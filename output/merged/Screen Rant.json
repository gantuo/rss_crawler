{"title": "No, Star Wars Hasn't Just Retconned Return Of The Jedi's Jizz Music", "date": "2023-10-02 18:01:28", "text": "The Star Wars fandom is dividing again, this time over what seems to be a Disney retcon of Return of the Jedi - but all is not as it seems.\nStar Wars fans can relax, Return of the Jedi's beloved jizz music hasn't just been retconned. George Lucas' Star Wars galaxy has always been delightfully diverse. Both the first Star Wars movie and Return of the Jedi featured a stunning number of different alien species, notably in the Mos Eisley Cantina and Jabba's Palace. The latter even featured a swinging jazz soundtrack, although - of course - the in-universe name had to be switched up a little.\nThe Return of the Jedi junior novelization officially referred to \"jizz music,\" a term that - in the real world - dates back to the 19th century. It originally meant \"energy,\" but swiftly came to have a far more colorful meaning, one that has amused generations of Star Wars fans. Now, though, a short story in the anthology book From A Certain Point Of View: Return Of The Jedi has generated something of a surreal backlash, with many accusing Disney of a great jizz retcon.\nLucasfilm Publishing has been celebrating the anniversaries of the Star Wars original trilogy by releasing a range of superb anthologies, From A Certain Point of View, each of which contain short stories by various authors. These flesh out background and secondary characters in the movies, offering unique insights into their arcs and motivations. Sometimes the choices are amusing - nobody expected to explore the sarlacc's story in Return of the Jedi - but others are deeply impactful. Slipped in among these tales, however, one - \"Fancy Man\" by Phil Szostak - doesn't refer to jizz music. It refers to jatz music instead.\nRelated: Star Wars Original Trilogy Cast & Character Guide\nUnsurprisingly, the Star Wars fandom seems to be furious. Few seem prepared to let go of their beloved jizz music, and many are appalled at the idea of jatz standards. Ironically, though, this isn't a Disney retcon at all; their complaints are 30 years out of date.\nJatz music was first mentioned 30 years ago, in a WEG sourcebook. From that point on, the terms jizz and jatz have been used interchangeably in Star Wars, both in canon and Legends - and even on official Lucasfilm websites. Sourcebooks and even novels have mentioned both jizz and jatz music, with writers switching between the terms with barely a second thought (although perhaps with a snigger). From A Certain Point Of View: Return of the Jedi continues this trend, canonizing the fact the music has many different names:\n\"Jatz was, of course, one of the most popular forms of performed and recorded music in the entire galaxy, including Outer Rim worlds such as Orto. It came to be known by many names, some less palatable than others, over time and across cultures.\"\nFar from retconning jizz out of existence, the short story actually seems to be confirming the joke works in-universe as well. (This does, of course, make it rather amusing that \"jizz\" was first mentioned in a junior novelization.) All this means Star Wars fans can relax; no, Disney isn't taking their beloved jizz away from them.\nTom Bacon is Head of Screen Rant's Star Wars coverage.

{"title": "The House With A Clock In Its Walls Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-02 18:01:28", "text": "The House With A Clock In Its Walls starts out as a funny horror comedy, but its ending features a surprisingly poignant message about trauma.\nWhile The House With A Clock In Its Walls might be a fun supernatural horror comedy, the movie’s ending offers a surprisingly moving message about grief, loss, and growing up. Eli Roth’s filmography is uneven, to say the least. Roth made his debut with 2002’s grisly Cabin Fever, a backwoods chiller that mixed body horror with offbeat humor and a relentlessly bleak tone reminiscent of the genre’s nastiest ‘70s hits. Roth followed this with Hostel and Hostel II, both infamously gory horror movies, and the gruesome 2014 cannibal movie The Green Inferno. However, the end of The House With A Clock In Its Walls is surprisingly more uplifting and positive than the director's previous films.\nThe 2018 movie is an adaptation of the novel House With A Clock In Its Walls. Lewis' Magic 8-Ball breaks the clock, Lewis has to accept a difficult truth, and the reason behind the creation of the clock is revealed. Admittedly, 2018’s The House With A Clock In Its Walls is an adaption of a horror comedy novel, but the book that the movie is based on features as many fantasy elements as it does scenes of horror. In terms of tone, The House With A Clock In Its Walls is closer to 2015’s live-action anarchic, cartoony Goosebumps adaptation than darker children’s horror movies like Coraline or Nightbooks. Still, Roth earned solid reviews for The House With A Clock In Its Walls, perhaps thanks to the movie’s surprisingly mature handling of death and trauma in the end.\nRelated: 10 Best Horror Movies Of All Time, Ranked\nThe House With A Clock In Its Walls opens with its hero Lewis losing his parents in a car crash. Sent to live with the eccentric Jonathan and his neighbor Florence, Lewis soon learns that the pair are a warlock and a witch respectively. When the vengeful ghost of Jonathan’s dead friend Isaac tries to end the world with the eponymous demonic clock, Lewis is forced to leave behind his last physical connection to his parents so that he can save everyone. In the process, Lewis lets go of his attachment to their memory and moves on from his loss.\nLewis’ last link to his parents was a Magic 8-Ball that they gifted him. The toy tells Lewis to “Say Goodbye” as the clock enters its final sequence, and he reads this as a message to let go of his grief over losing his parents by throwing away the toy. This breaks the internal workings of the clock, stopping its doomsday countdown. For all of the many genre Easter eggs in The House With A Clock In Its Walls, this moment proves that the movie’s true horror is the tragedy of loss. Lewis wants desperately to maintain a connection to his dead parents and the villains take advantage of this.\nIsaac’s undead wife Selena took the form of Lewis’s late mother to convince him to summon Isaac and, once Isaac was back in a human body, he was able to use the demon Azazel’s dark magic to protect his doomsday clock. This dark magic summoned a giant snake that Florence was forced to fight down in the boiler room, while another one of Isaac and Selena’s traps turned Jonathan into a baby. This needed to happen in metaphorical terms, since Lewis had to be alone when he faced his grief, conquered his fear of loss, and found the strength to throw away his Magic 8-Ball.\nThe villainous Selena and Isaac created the clock to turn back time and destroy humanity after Isaac was driven to nihilism by WWII. While both Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween and The House With A Clock In Its Walls starred Black as eccentric horror comedy heroes with supernatural skills, Jonathan had a far darker past than Black’s Goosebumps franchise character. Both Jonathan and Isaac were scarred by what they saw during the war, with their trauma taking them on very different paths. Isaac’s trauma led him to become a villain as he consulted the demon Azazel about creating a clock that could turn back time and undo human history.\nMeanwhile, Jonathan becomes the strange, eccentric warlock that he is when Lewis meets him. As he did so, the demon Azazel convinced Isaac that destroying humanity would undo the horrors of WWII. Unlike Lewis and Jonathan, Isaac couldn’t let go of his trauma for long enough to see through this lie. Thus, Isaac created the clock alongside Selena, convinced that this would somehow make up for the horrors of the war. While Lewis could accept that something terrible happened to him in his past, Isaac was driven to evil by a desire to rewrite reality and Selena joined him down this dark, doomed path.\nAfter Lewis saved the day, it might seem a little strange that he pettily used magic to hit his classmate Tarby with a basketball and humiliate him. However, this PG-rated horror movie has a good justification for this goofy scene. The duplicitous Tarby had briefly befriended Lewis earlier in the movie, only to turn on him as soon as Tarby won the title of class president. Magic allowed Lewis to stand up for himself, get revenge on his fair-weather friend, and gain a new love interest in the process as he impressed one of his classmates with his magic-assisted layup.\nIn The House With A Clock In Its Walls’ ending, Lewis and Isaac become mirror images of each other. Both the clock itself and the Magic 8-Ball are artifacts that tie the two characters to their past and, while the clock’s destruction kills Isaac for good, the toy’s destruction frees Lewis from his grief and allows him to enter adolescence unburdened by tragedy. While Disney’s Goosebumps reboot offers a PG horror story where kids and adults must face their fears together, The House With A Clock In Its Walls is scary precisely because Lewis can’t rely on his elders for advice.\nIn the final scenes of The House With A Clock In Its Walls, Lewis realizes that his parents aren’t coming back and that, even among magicians, anyone who promises him otherwise is taking advantage of him. His loss is tragic, but he can also let go of his past and move on. This is something that Isaac’s trauma never allows him to do. Thus, Isaac dies for good while the hero of The House With A Clock In Its Walls can venture into adolescence confidently.\n"}

The first movie in Roar Uthaug’s Troll franchise released in December 2022 on Netflix, quickly becoming the platforms move viewed non-English film of all time (via Variety). While the ending of Troll left the door open for a sequel there was little word on Troll 2 for almost a year - until Netflix finally confirmed the sequel was going ahead.\nTroll 2 will follow on from the first movie, which follows a group of paleontologists who come face-to-face with an ancient troll in Norway’s Dovre mountains. At the end of Troll it was revealed that the beast finally felled by Nora (Ine Marie Willmann) and Kris (Mads Sjøgård Pettersen) was just the first of many. With Tomb Raider and The Wave director Roar Uthaug once more at the helm, there’s plenty to digest when it comes to the possibilities of what awaits in Troll 2.\nAfter almost 10 months with little news Netflix finally gave an update on Troll 2 in September 2023. The streamer confirmed that Roar Uthaug’s Norwegian monster movie Troll was officially getting a sequel, and that filming would begin in 2024. While there was little else revealed beyond this, the fact that director Roar Uthaug is returning alongside the creative team behind Troll has already generated a great deal of excitement for the upcoming sequel.\nTroll 2 is officially happening, with the Netflix greenlight of the sequel to Roar Uthaug’s Norwegian monster movie announced in September 2023 (via Variety). It was confirmed on announcement that director Roar Uthaug would be returning for the sequel alongside writer Espen Aukan. Producers Espen Horn and Kristian Strang Sinkerud will also be returning to work with Uthaug on the sequel to Troll.\nThere is no confirmed release date yet for Troll 2. The Netflix sequel is due to start filming in 2024, so it’s unlikely it will arrive before 2025.\nThere are no confirmed cast members yet for Troll 2, and the only names attached to the project are director Roar Uthaug alongside his creative team of writer Espen Aukan and producers Espen Horn and Kristian Strang. It’s possible that Ine Marie Willmann and Mads Sjøgård Pettersen will reprise their respective roles of Nora and Kris, but nothing’s been announced yet. If the story focuses on entirely new characters it’s possible that none of names from the original return for the cast of the Troll sequel.\nThere hasn’t been much confirmed about the Troll 2 story. However, a few plot details have been teased along with the confirmation announcement. It’s known that the sequel to Troll will focus on another Norwegian folklore figure, though it’s not been revealed if this will also be a troll or something else entirely. \nThe ending of Troll set up a lot of possibilities for the Troll 2 plot. It’s clear there are more monsters inside the Dovre mountains, so the titular troll in the first movie is likely only the first to awaken. That being said, Troll 2 could focus on a different part of Norway entirely, as the entire country has a rich history of local folklore.\nShould any of the characters from the first movie return for Troll 2 this could also impact the plot. Kris and Nora discovered that trolls can be harmed by UV light, and managed to fashion a working trap. The dynamic could be quite different in Troll 2 if the story focuses on them again now that they’ve successfully taken down one of the mythical beasts. Whatever happens it seems likely that Troll 2 will be another unique monster movie for Netflix.\n"}
{"title": "10 Most Over-The-Top Brutal Fatalities In MK1", "date": "2023-10-02 18:01:28", "text": "Mortal Kombat 1 has some of the best Fatalities of any game in the franchise; however, some of its Fatalities are far more brutal than others.\nAlthough Mortal Kombat 1 innovated greatly from its predecessors, it did not change one fundamental part of the game — the Fatalities. Since bursting into arcades in the 1990s, Mortal Kombat has been known for blood and guts — no part of the game quite so graphically encapsulates this as the loved and loathed Fatalities. Ever controversial, Fatalities are such a significant part of the series that they are often taken as a measure of quality for each Mortal Kombat installment. Although some games, such as Mortal Kombat 4, have abysmal Fatalities, others like Mortal Kombat 11 have exceptional ones. Mortal Kombat 1, although not perfect, undeniably has great Fatalities.\nRelated: \"Oh, I Remember This\" - Mortal Kombat 1 Review\nWith a reputation as bloody as Mortal Kombat, each new installment has a great deal of gore to dish out. Mortal Kombat 1, the latest iteration of the tried and true fighting game, does not disappoint in this department. Although the game is more than mindless violence and death, these are undoubtedly the franchise's cornerstones. With an expansive roster of MK1 combatants, most with two Fatalities of their own, there is an abundance of choice available to the player in Mortal Kombat 1; although each Fatality is unquestionably brutal, some are so graphic that the others appear tame by comparison.\nRelated:Mortal Kombat 1: How to Unlock Every Fatality (& Button Inputs)\nAbsent from the previous game, long-time fans of the franchise welcomed the announcement that Reptile would be rejoining the roster in Mortal Kombat 1. A pillar of the franchise since his debut as a hidden opponent in the original Mortal Kombat, Reptile is a reptilian humanoid of the Saurian species. Known for his acidic finishers, Reptile has had some of the strongest Fatalities in previous installments — and Mortal Kombat 1 is no different.\nAlthough both of his Fatalities are brutal, his first, Indigestion, would be a particularly unpleasant experience. Indigestion sees Reptile swallow his opponent whole before vomiting their acid-ridden remains onto the field of battle before finally crushing them.\nA surprise return to the roster, the long-absent Reiko has not featured in a mainline Mortal Kombat game since 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. Despite this, Reiko has returned with some of the most fearsome Fatalities of any combatant in Mortal Kombat 1. Particularly brutal is his For the General Fatality, in which he viciously contorts his enemy's body, using their own bones against them, before ultimately ripping out their spine and raising it aloft as a trophy.\nThe purple color-swapped ninja and Prince of Edenia, Rain, most recently featured in Mortal Kombat 11's second round of DLC. The ever-popular ninja's combat revolves around the manipulation of water, and his most brutal fatality in Mortal Kombat 1 is no exception. Rain's Fatality 2 involves the water-bending rain summoning a rope of water which, in a manner reminiscent of an anaconda, constricts around his bested foe before devastatingly crushing their body and decapitating them.\nKung Lao's Mortal Kombat 1 Fatality, Lao’d and Clear, reimagines many of Kung Lao's classic Fatalities. Although it recycles a lot from previous games, this Fatality is, nevertheless, incredibly graphic. Utilizing his trademark razor-rimmed hat, Kung Lao destroys the appendages of his opponent, before decapitating them, and finally splitting them in two. It is truly a brutal Fatality, certainly not for the faint of heart.\nIn Mortal Kombat 1's timeline, Sindel is the leader of Outworld — it is clear from her Fatality, Hair Comes Trouble, that she rules the realm through fear. Like her Fatalities in previous installments, Sindel's main weapon is her incredibly long and powerful hair — a weapon put to good use in Hair Comes Trouble. In which, she tears off her opponent's limbs, lifts them by their shoulder wounds, and asks \"Who's your queen?\" before ripping out their spine and skull through their throat. It is not only brutal but undoubtedly Sindel's best Fatality in franchise history.\nEye-Palling Victory was first hinted at during the early reveals of Mortal Kombat 1 — much to the excitement of many. This fatality is brutal and brilliant, perhaps one of Scorpion's best in the franchise's history. It revolves around his famed chained spears, which he throws through his enemy's abdomen before having them return via the back of their head and through their eyes. Although this is brutal enough, Scorpion then yells, \"Come here!\" as he pulls the chains, causing his opponent's head to be severed and pulled through his adversary's back. Truly one of the most brutal Fatalities in the game.\nIn the new Mortal Kombat timeline, Johnny Cage returns to his narcissistic Hollywood actor gimmick, abandoning the past decade of his presentation as a retired actor and embattled military man. His Fatality Hollywood Walk of Pain is, therefore, a thematically appropriate choice; however, unlike the choreographed violence in movies, this Fatality is graphic and brutal. The Fatality begins with Cage embracing his defeated opponent, which is quickly followed by him smashing them face-first into a Hollywood Walk of Fame-style ground plate before ripping them back and taking a selfie with the faceless corpse.\nAlthough General Shao is no longer Khan, in the new timeline, is no less deadly, and his Fatality, Spin Cycle, is evidence of this. Spin Cycle sees General Shao launch his opponent into the air with his axe and grab them midair before finally rotating them around at such an extreme velocity that the air friction causes his adversary's skin to peel away. This, beyond brutal, is a wonderful step away from Shao's typical axe, hammer, or spear Fatalities, which, although cool, are a little predictable.\nThe Tarkatan warrior, Baraka, is undeniably a great combatant; however, he has often been overlooked, especially in recent Mortal Kombat installments. Despite this, his second Fatality in Mortal Kombat 1 is one of the most vicious in the game, if not in the over 30-year history of the franchise. It sees Baraka disembowel his opponent, knee them into the air, before creating a fire and using his foe's entrails as a rope to facilitate their cooking. The Fatality ends with a group of Tarkatans ripping off the roasted limbs of the still-somehow-living combatant.\nIn the franchise's latest iteration, the Chosen One, Liu Kang has been promoted to the status of a god. Although some gods are merciful, the God of Fire variant of Liu Kang is rather unforgiving. His brutality is best displayed in his second Fatality, in which he grabs his opponent by the neck, transports them through a portal to the far reaches of space, summons a black hole, and has their body painfully slowly sucked inside — in a manner disturbingly reminiscent of the Ark Covenant scene from Indian Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. Liu Kang's second Fatality is undoubtedly the most brutal in Mortal Kombat 1.\nSource: CJR Gaming/YouTube\nBased in the United Kingdom, Luke Horwitz is a graduate student in English Literature and Arts at the University of Oxford, having earned a BA in Music from the University of York."}
{"title": "What Was the First Anime?", "date": "2023-10-02 18:01:28", "text": "While it may seem like a straightforward question, the identity of the first anime is a matter of debate, although there is one clear candidate.\nAnime has a long and storied history, naturally leading many fans to wonder what the first anime was. In recent years Anime has become a pop culture juggernaut garnering worldwide fans and critical success. However, its origins are much more humble and controversial with many of the original cartoons being lost to time or under dispute. This makes the question of what the first anime even was quite fascinating to explore. Before discussing what the first anime was, the actual definition of the word \"anime\" needs to be addressed.\nAnime is the Japanese word for animation, so in Japan, this question would just boil down to what would be considered the first cartoon. However, in the West, anime has come to categorize the cartoons made in Japan. Of course, this definition itself isn't perfect as many people feel it doesn't include certain shows they view as anime. The anime-esque Avatar: The Last Airbender is a perfect example as the show is heavily inspired by Japanese cartoons in both look and story, but was made by an American team with Korean animators.\nRelated: An Incalculable Loss - Thousands of Classic Anime Are Close to Being Lost Forever\nThese sorts of edge cases didn't exist in the early 1900s however, which is when animation was in its infancy. At this time, foreign cartoons were only just being introduced in Japan, which inspired a variety of Japanese artists to try their hands at it as well. Many of the cartoons produced were short clips that didn't tell a story. Given the material on which these were created many of these clips are lost to time, and the few examples that do survive are hotly debated by scholars. The first true widely regarded Japanese cartoon with an actual story is known as The Dull Sword, which was created by Jun’ichi Kouchi and follows a goofy swordsman as he tests out his weapon.\nThe Dull Sword is very different from what modern anime fans may expect. It lacks many of the stylistic features that distinguish anime in the present day, and it is entirely silent. It also isn't very entertaining or satisfying on a narrative level. That isn’t to say it isn’t worth watching for fans of the medium who want to see what Japanese animation looked like over a century ago. It still stands as a fascinating glimpse into Japanese culture at that time and is somewhat humorous at points. However, unlike some old shows that still stand the test of time like Astro Boy or The Legend of the Galactic Heroes, The Dull Sword does not hold up on its own as a good watch.\nOf course, as with all discussions of this nature, there are other examples of early Japanese animation that some may call the first anime instead of The Dull Sword. The three-second-long Activity Photo is one such example despite its unorthodox animation technique. The debate over what is truly the first anime will likely never be settled, but The Dull Sword is about as best a candidate for that title as one can find.\nBen Sockol has been writing articles for the comics section of Screen Rant since early 2022.

{"title": "Us Soundtrack Guide: Every Song & When It Plays", "date": "2023-10-02 18:01:29", "text": "Us movie soundtrack is filled with music such as Luniz's I Got Five On It and Beach Boys' Good Vibrations. Here's every song in Jordan Peele's film.\nEvery song on the Us soundtrack perfectly complements writer and director Jordan Peele's vision. In part, that's because Us sees Peele reuniting with Get Out composer Michael Abels, though the soundtrack also features an array of pitch-perfect songs from well-known artists. In addition to Abels' terrifying score, the songs on the Us soundtrack range from contemporary Janelle Monáe-written tunes to Luniz's '90s hip-hop classic \"I Got 5 on It,\" which is notably intertwined with Abels' masterful score.\nWhile Jordan Peele's Us is full of haunting quotes, it's also rife with haunting tracks. For example, Abels' slowed-down version of the '90s Luniz hit helps craft the psychological horror film's eerie atmosphere. Meanwhile, other songs on the Us soundtrack help underscore the film's themes — or add in some much-needed humor. That said, Us is packed with great songs that fill the moments in between pieces from Abels' score. Here's every song in Us, in order of when each plays during the film:\n“I Like That” by Janelle Monáe - Starting at the 11 minute and 23 seconds mark, viewers can hear Monáe's Dirty Computer hit as the film fades from shots of rabbits in cages to the Wilsons driving through a woods-lined road to their NorCal cabin.\n\"I Got 5 On It\" by Luniz - At 21 minutes and 23 seconds, the film's most notable song plays while the Wilsons drive to — and arrive at — Us' significant Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk location. While Gabe (Winston Duke) and Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) sing along, Addie helps Jason (Evan Alex) get into the groove.\n“Good Vibrations” by The Beach Boys - The next recognizable needle drop comes at one hour, five minutes, and thirty-two seconds into the film as Josh (Tim Heidecker) and Kitty Tyler (Elisabeth Moss), the Wilsons' (sort of) friends, argue when Kitty thinks she hears an intruder. Instead of taking her seriously, Josh tells their smart home to play this Beach Boys tune.\nRELATED: What Jordan Peele's Next Movie Is (After Nope)\n\"F*ck tha Police\" by N.W.A. - After her family is brutally murdered by their Tethered counterparts in Us, a bloody Kitty crawls on the floor and tries to get some help from their smart home device, Ophelia. When Kitty tells the virtual assistant to \"call the police,\" Ophelia misunderstands and plays N.W.A.'s \"F*ck tha Police\" as Kitty's double delivers a killing blow. This all unfolds at the 1 hour, 7 minutes, and 43 seconds mark.\n\"I Got 5 On It\" (Tethered Mix from Us) by Luniz - At the 1 hour, 15 minutes, and 42 seconds mark, a reprise of Luniz's \"I Got 5 On It\" plays after the Wilsons successfully kill off the Tyler family's murderous doubles. This version, which remixes the track with themes from Abels' score, was initially used in promotional material. However, when it became a viral sensation, the remix was edited into the film.\n“The Nutcracker Suite: XI. Pas de Deux” by Tchaikovsky - Some of this classical piece plays during a flashback to Addy's ballet days at the 1 hour, 39 minutes, and 55 seconds mark.\n\"Les Fleur\" by Minnie Riperton - In the twist ending of Us, \"Les Fleur\" plays at the 1 hour, 50 minutes, and 42 seconds mark as the camera pans away from the Wilsons' escape ambulance to show miles of Tethered holding hands across America.\nReleased in 2019 by Back Lot Music, the official Us soundtrack features Michael Abels' original score as well as three songs that are heard in Jordan Peele's film. The trio of non-score tracks are \"I Like That\" by Janelle Monáe, \"Les Fleurs\" by Minnie Riperton, and, of course, \"I Got 5 on It\" by Luniz.

{"title": "5 Star Trek Furry Things That Are More Dangerous Than You Think", "date": "2023-10-02 18:11:27", "text": "Star Trek's tribbles are notoriously dangerous, but other furry things like Lower Decks' moopsy pose a greater threat to Starfleet officers.\nOver the decades, furry creatures on Star Trek  have turned out to be more dangerous than one might suspect based on their appearance alone. Some dangerous animals were the beloved pets of famed Starfleet officers such as Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) or Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn). Other dangerous species could not be domesticated, but could instead be found in sanctuaries devoted to their continued care and preservation, whether established for educational purposes or run for profit by Ferengi entrepreneurs.\nWhen these creatures were similar to Earth animals, humans in particular had a way of underestimating certain furry animals native to other planets, usually Class M designated worlds, believing their inherent natures to be close to what they found familiar, only to be surprised when the creatures' actions didn't match their expectations. The contrast between initial impressions and actual actions served as proof that even fauna deserved the same respect and understanding as more intelligent species, a theme that began with Star Trek: The Original Series and continued through Star Trek: Lower Decks.\nTribbles' soft fur and calming coos made them appear completely innocent at first blush, but their high reproductive rate made them ecological nightmares. One tribble became thousands in days, since they were \"born pregnant,\" as noted by Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) during the famed tribble infestation of the USS Enterprise in Star Trek: The Original Series, at which time McCoy determined that their rapid reproduction was only possible after they'd fed. It seemed only Klingons knew of the natural danger tribbles caused, and animosity between the species was mutual, perhaps predicated on the tribbles' side by a genetic memory of the devastation wrought by Klingon extermination.\nTribbles weren't always such devastating creatures, due to the role genetic modification played in their development. In Star Trek: Short Treks \"The Trouble With Edward\", Lt. Edward Larkin (H. Jon Benjamin) believed their biological composition of fur and meat made them an ideal food source, but for their slow rate of reproduction. His 2250s experiments to increase their reproductive rate were overwhelmingly successful, but resulted in his own death and these augment tribbles becoming the dominant version of the species. Further experimentation created the toothy \"attack tribble,\" fortunately contained to Daystrom Station as of 2401 in Star Trek: Picard season 3.\nMugato, also known as Mugatu, Mugutu, or even Gumato, were native to the planet Neural, where they coexisted with the planet's humanoid population, who knew that mugato were more dangerous than they looked. Mugato were ape-like creatures covered in white fur, with distinctive horns atop their heads and spikes trailing down their spines. They looked similar to Earth's gorillas, but the mugato diet was far more carnivorous, as indicated by their sharp teeth, clawed prehensile hands and feet, and venomous bite. Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) learned firsthand just how bad the bite could be when he visited Neural, and had to rely on primitive medicine for treatment.\nBy the 2380s of Star Trek: Lower Decks, mugato were deemed an endangered species. They were discovered in the wilds of Frylon IV, where they were the targets of both Denobulan scientists and Ferengi poachers. The mugato displayed their ferocity quite easily to the researchers, who sadly perished. The Ferengi traders, however, found ways of subduing them, so they could sell their valuable horns, and only ceased their poaching only after Ensigns Brad Boimler (Jack Quaid) and Samanthan Rutherford (Eugene Cordero) convinced them a mugato-themed tourist destination would be more profitable.\nSome of Star Trek's most famous Vulcans such as Subcommander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock), Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy), and Lt. Tuvok (Tim Russ) all kept sehlats as pets, which implied that these furry creatures were gentle by nature, but sehlats were more dangerous than they seemed. These large, powerful animals were similar in size to Earth's wild cats, with bear-like features and prominent six-inch teeth that marked them as the descendants of predators. Sehlats' aggressive tempers could be calmed through consistent regular feeding, not unlike Vulcans' adherence to strict control of their own emotions through ritual and meditation.\nIndeed, the practice of keeping sehlats as pets was an apt metaphor for Vulcan children learning to maintain control over something as inherently wild as their own inner natures. The bond between them was a mutually beneficial attachment, with the sehlat being fed, and the child attaining the trust and protection of an otherwise wild animal. Sehlats could be long-lived, and remain within families, like when Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard) passed his sehlat, I-Chaya, to his son Spock. While not sapient, I-Chaya was Spock's valued friend who nonetheless taught him an important life lesson, seen in Star Trek: The Animated Series season 1, episode 2 \"Yesteryear\".\nThe widespread appearance of Klingon targs in everything from cuisine to children's stories made them seem more harmless than they actually were. They resembled wild boars of Earth, appearing about the same shape and size but for the thick, wiry fur and sharp spines along their backs. As domesticated animals, targs were kept as both pets and livestock, sometimes with little distinction between the two cultural roles. Even domesticated targs were relatively formidable, possessing the same warlike spirit as their Klingon keepers, and capable of wanton destruction despite -- or perhaps because of -- their ultimate destination often being a Klingon's dinner.\nAccording to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine's General Martok (J.G. Hertzler), his own pet targ was as much of a warrior as he was, and yearned to return to the glorious freedom of the wilderness, and it was these wild targs that were even more dangerous than their domesticated brethren. As herd animals, they could easily overwhelm an opponent just by acting on instinct, and their natural weapons of spikes, hooves, and tusks gave them ample opportunities to attack. They were certainly far more dangerous than the watered-down reputation that preceded them thanks to creations like Toby the Targ holonovels and simple plush toys made in their image.\nMoopsy was introduced on Star Trek: Lower Decks as the cutest and most dangerous alien yet. It was a small round creature with a pure white pelt, short legs, and dark, round eyes. Its high-pitched call gave it its name, further adding to its deceptive cuteness. Relatively little was known about Moopsy, including whether it was the only member of its species or whether more Moopsies existed beyond the walls of Narj's Magical Menagerarium. One, of course, was all that was needed to verify Moopsy's true and seemingly paradoxical nature: that of a voracious predator, capable of liquifying the bones of its prey before drinking them. Moopsy was nonetheless beloved by many.\nA free Moopsy posed a genuine threat to those in its path inStar Trek: Lower Decks' menagerie. Moopsies did not form bonds like many other creatures that could be kept as pets. They fed on the liquid bones of any creatures at all, including those that seemed stronger and more powerful than themselves. While slow-moving due to its stature and small appendages, Moopsies could launch themselves at victims with terrifying leaps and drain them of their bones in a matter of moments. Their presence wasn't always a forsworn death sentence, however; Moopsy was guided by its own ravenous appetite, and it could be distracted by stray bones or teeth to lead it back into containment.\nMoopsy was a particularly cute creature new to Star Trek with its appearance in Star Trek: Lower Decks, with the contrast between its innocuous outward appearance and its true dangerous nature contributing to the story's comedy. Other furry creatures provided their own lessons in understanding that life was more complex than it appeared. Star Trek has always encouraged people to look beyond initial impressions, after all, and one only needed to encounter a dangerous specimen once to discover that lesson certainly applied to fauna just as much as it did to the intelligent species of the galaxy.\nJen Watson is a writer and artist based in the Chicago suburbs with a lifelong passion for good stories and a BFA from the Ringling College of Art and Design.

The Nun II was released on September 8, giving it just under a month in theaters. A follow up to 2018’s religious horror film The Nun, The Nun II continues the story of Sister Irene and her battle with the demon, Valak. The Nun II’s cast includes Taissa Farmiga, Storm Reid, and Bonnie Aarons, and is directed by The Curse of La Llorona director Michael Chaves.\nAfter less than one month in theaters, The Nun II has landed its digital release date. First reported by When To Stream, The Nun II will be available for purchase on Amazon and YouTube starting on October 3. Marking just 25 days after The Nun II’s theatrical debut, this release window comes in as one of the shortest windows for Warner Bros. this year. \nThe Nun II’s digital release coming so early on in its run is surprising based on how the film has done in theaters. To date, The Nun II has made over $76 million at the domestic box office and grossed $231 worldwide when considering the international ticket sales. These box office totals are pretty impressive considering The Nun II’s estimated $38.5 million budget. The Nun II even held strong at the top of the domestic box office for three straight weekends, beating out higher-budget films such as A Haunting in Venice. \nThough one of the shortest windows, The Nun II’s quick VOD release is also not unheard of for its studio, Warner Bros. Though less commercially successful than The Nun II, Warner Bros. films The Flash and Blue Beetle became available to rent digitally after only 32 days in theaters. The Meg 2: The Trench saw a gap of even less than 25 days, with digital rental available just 21 days after its theatrical release. \nWith The Nun II’s box office numbers looking comparatively better, Warner Bros. choice to truncate The Nun II’s theatrical exclusivity may seem surprising. Either way, The Nun II’s box office numbers do bode well for its prospects on streaming. As Halloween approaches and more horror films inundate theaters, The Nun II will have a chance to catch those looking for their fall spooks at home. The Nun II’s digital availability will also be good for those looking to binge-watch all the films within The Conjuring universe this fall. \nSource: When To Stream\n"}
{"title": "John Wick's Next Spinoff Won't Make The Same Mistake With Keanu Reeves", "date": "2023-10-02 18:20:27", "text": "John Wick seemingly dies in John Wick: Chapter 4, but Keanu Reeves' return in the next John Wick spinoff movie avoids making a similar mistake.\nThe John Wick franchise's upcoming spin-off Ballerina is a strong indicator that John Wick himself is not dead. After four movies of battling endless waves of assassins and High Table enforcers, John seemingly met his end in John Wick: Chapter 4 after his High Table duel with his old friend Caine (Donnie Yen). However, with John already confirmed to appear in Ballerina, he still has at least one more big-screen appearance ahead of him.\nBallerina will take place before John's apparent demise, with the film set between John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum and John Wick: Chapter 4. Meanwhile, the tremendous success of John Wick: Chapter 4 has led to John Wick: Chapter 5 reportedly entering early development. While this might seem primarily motivated by the financial success and critical acclaim of the main John Wick franchise, it is really Ballerina that demonstrates how central the Baba Yaga is to the franchise.\nRELATED: 8 Big Clues John Wick Is Still Alive After Chapter 4's Shock Ending\nThe John Wick franchise is a cinematic universe that has finally begun expanding into spinoffs not focused primarily on John Wick. Peacock's The Continental spinoff series takes place in the early 1970s, which precludes John from appearing, but Ballerina bringing him into its story shows how much the franchise relies on him. What makes that even more true is the fact that Ballerina is the first big-screen chapter of the John Wick universe not centered on him.\nTo be sure, having John in a supporting role in Ballerina is a wise strategy. Ana de Armas' Rooney will be the first protagonist in the John Wick universe headlining her own movie, so having the support of the legendary Baba Yaga is a smart business move. Still, the question of whether the John Wick franchise can thrive without him around has not been truly put to the test yet. Ballerina's strategy of gradually phasing new protagonists into the franchise's spotlight with John still on hand might help it commercially, but still establishes the expectation that John Wick can jump back into action at any time.\nDespite John being laid to rest next to his wife Helen in John Wick: Chapter 4's ending, one fan theory has suggested that John faked his death with the help of Caine and Winston (Ian McShane) to finally escape the High Table. With Ballerina taking place before John Wick: Chapter 4, it could establish Rooney as a potential player in that theoretical cover-up. Indeed, by having John seemingly go out of his way from his own war with the Elder and the High Table to help Rooney on her mission, it has a built-in story mechanism for Rooney to owe John a favor via an assassin marker.\nIn turn, John might cash in that favor from Rooney by asking her to help him fake his death. Ballerina might reveal such a transaction between John and Rooney outright, or it could simply hint to it to save the actual reveal for John Wick: Chapter 5. Still, while the John Wick universe might be stretching its legs with The Continental, Ballerina, and a spin-off for Donnie Yen's Caine teased at the end of John Wick: Chapter 4, his return in Ballerina shows that it is still very much the John Wick franchise - and that the world has likely not seen the last of the Baba Yaga.\nBrad Curran is a Features Writer and Interviewer for Screen Rant.

Glenn is now embracing grandparenthood.\nIn My Big Fat Fabulous Life, season 11, episode 4, Glenn Thore took the plunge and crossed skydiving off his bucket list with his daughter Whitney Thore. However, the surprises continued when Glenn was in for an emotional treat when he received a thoughtful gift from his great-granddaughter, Madeline (Maddie), embracing a new role as great-grandfather. Maddie is the daughter of William, the son of Glenn's long-lost daughter, Angela Burdett (Angie Vincent), and the sibling of Jaime Daughdrill and Cody. Inquiring minds might wonder if this new bundle could be the glue that bonds the Thore family tree and how Glenn will embrace grandparenthood.\nDuring a confessional moment on My Big Fat Fabulous Life season 11, Glenn shades Whitney's age and remarks that Hunter has no romantic prospects on the horizon. Glenn also humorously mentioned that he and his late wife, Barbara \"Babs\" Thore, once made a pact to forgo the experience of becoming grandparents. Hunter lightened the atmosphere by suggesting everyone benefits from this arrangement, with Glenn gaining the joy of grandkids. Although Whitney and Hunter might be off the hook for grandkids, Glenn's granddaughter Jaime is also in the picture, recently engaged to her fiancé, Heath Horton, ushering in a new generation for the Thore family.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nIn a considerate gesture that tugged at heartstrings, Angie sent Glenn a specially crafted pillow bearing a heartfelt message: \"Grand Daddy, I hugged this little pillow, I squeezed it tight, I filled it with my wishes, hope, love, and light.\" The message continued, advising Glenn to grasp the pillow tightly whenever he felt down, assuring him that Maddie's love would radiate from it throughout the day and night. This present from Whitney's secret half-sister appears to be a poignant peace offering, extending an olive branch in the form of affection and comfort to heal past wounds and mend their fractured relationship.\nWhitney underwent IVF and froze her eggs merely two years ago. However, she appears to have shifted her perspective, suggesting that motherhood might not be in her future. In the latest episode of My Big Fat Fabulous Life, Glenn divulged he and Babs had long abandoned their aspirations of having grandchildren. Instead, Whitney seems to have discovered contentment in her role as an aunt. She finds consolation amidst Glenn's extended family, marking a noteworthy difference from her previous fertility pursuits. After disclosing to E! News that her goal \"would have always been to have a child with a partner,\" Whitney seems genuinely happy in her self-proclaimed auntie era.\nJaime, Whitney's niece and Glenn's granddaughter, has yet to appear on My Big Fat Fabulous Life, but she's making headlines. This past August, Jaime took to Facebook to express her excitement about becoming the wife of her long-time boyfriend, Heath. This new chapter in Jaime's life likely brings a sense of fulfillment and pleasure to Grandpa Glenn, now embracing this role to an adult Jaime and a great-grandfather to little Maddie. It's a testament to the enduring bonds within the Thore family as they navigate life's twists and turns, and Glenn undoubtedly welcomes his next chapter and new generation with open arms and a proud heart.\nMy Big Fat Fabulous Life airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.\nSources: E!

Kimberly, a 30-year-old from Muscle Shoals, Alabama, is a clairvoyant who dreamed of her future husband thanks to her spirit guides. Months later, Kimberly received a message from an Indian man who wanted her to be his girlfriend. It was TJ who had manifested Kimberly into his life by meditating on her profile picture. Kimberly and TJ's strange relationship on The Other Way season 5 was a successful one until she moved to India. She had previously lived in Jaipur for a year on a student visa.\nBut now Kimberly is going to get married to TJ and settle down in India for good. However, Kimberly's latest Instagram post reveals she's not in India anymore.\nKimberly posted a video captioned, \"Is it bad how much I want to make a 7 year old jealous of my hat?\" Kimberly wore a propeller hat in the clip and was heading out to pick up her niece from school. Kimberly filmed herself driving with her dog accompanying her in the car. She asked her niece if she liked her hat and, in the end, even gave it to the little child to wear. Fans in Kimberly's comments asked her things like, \"Soo you’re back in America???\"\n\"Back in America, huh?\" wrote another fan before joking that they knew Kimberly and TJ's relationship wasn't going to last long. Meanwhile, one fan posted, \"Pretty sure she can come back to the US without it meaning the relationship is over.\" Kimberly replied to this follower to thank them. Kimberly's response could mean she's in America only for a temporary stay. It would also most likely be one of Kimberly's visa requirements. Kimberly and TJ do get married as revealed in a mid-season trailer for The Other Way season 5, as shared by 90 Day Fiancé on Instagram. Kimberly and TJ are shown getting married in a lavish Hindu ceremony.\nKimberly tells the cameras that it feels like a fairy tale coming true to her. She's happy that she's going to be with the man whom she wants to spend the rest of her life with. Kimberly and TJ are happy during the wedding ceremony as cheerful music plays in the background and even TJ's brother Yash Goswami, who was against the marriage, is dancing in the wedding procession with glee. But there is always a twist in the tale when it comes to Kimberly and TJ. The trailer ends with the couple in an argument.\nA homesick Kimberly annoys TJ so much that he's seen asking her to go back to the U.S., and she screams and yells at him. The scene has been compared to a horror movie. If Kimberly is implying she's still together with TJ, him making the relationship work despite the yelling deserves an applause. She has been difficult the entire season when she lashed out at TJ for not building an apartment the way she wanted it to look. But then again, Kimberly and TJ do love each other and could have decided to accept each other just the way they are in order to have a successful marriage.\n90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.\nSources: Kimberly Rochelle/Instagram, 90 Day Fiancé/Instagram\n"}

As one of the best reality TV shows, it's no surprise curiosity about former Below Deck cast members continues. The Venezuelan native has a heart of gold that shined through during each episode. With the Bravo series behind him, Marcos has embarked on a new adventure.\nMarcos has been working as a professional chef for the last ten years. Even though he's primarily cooked in restaurants, working on a yacht came naturally to the chef. The culinary guru started his career in culinary school in Venezuela but, after graduating, decided to travel. He revealed in one of his BDSY season 3 confessionals that he could learn from chefs from all over the world by doing this. Marcos is settled in Los Angeles and has made his mark there.\nSince filming the reunion for BDSY season 3, Marcos has opened his restaurant, Lou'Mar, by ML Eats, which was initially a food truck. The food fuses cuisine from his home country of Venezuela, Korea, and the U.S. The restaurant serves brunch and dinner with many delicious sounding and looking dishes. On top of being a business owner, Marcos also signed a deal with the University of California to cook for them.\nMarcos teamed up with Below Deck Mediterranean season 7's Chef Dave White for a pop-up event in L.A. The plan was for Dave to add in a few dishes and work in his restaurant during the week, and the event brought in a large crowd. Besides his business ventures, Marcos revealed he will not return to BDSY for another season. Since opening his restaurant, Marcos has become too busy to be a chef on a sailing yacht.\nBelow Deck Sailing Yacht season 3 was one for the books, as the entire cast got along well. Marcos has kept in touch with his co-stars and recently hung out with Chief Engineer Colin MacRae. Even though Bravo viewers will no longer see Marcos on their screens, they can pop into Marcos's restaurant, Lou'Mar, to try his delicious food or continue checking up on him via his social media accounts. Whatever the future holds, Marcos will undoubtedly be a success.\nSource: Marcos Spaziani/Instagram\n"}

First airing in 2005, NBC's The Office would go on to become one of the most popular sitcoms of a generation over the course of its nine seasons. The show, which is based on a British series of the same name created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, came to an end in 2013, with audiences forced to say farewell to the show's beloved cast of characters.\nNow, Dwight Schrute actor Wilson has shared a new image from a recent mini The Office cast reunion with Carell and Kinsey at a charity dinner party. Check out the new image below:\nIn his caption, Wilson reveals that the dinner party was organized to raise money for the Lide Foundation, with the actor teasing that, while it \"wasn't exactly a reenactment of the dinner party episode... I did bring my babysitter and a teeny tiny flatscreen,\" a reference to one of the show's most notorious episodes.\nRelated: The Office: One Tiny Detail Makes Michael & Jan's Dinner Party Even Worse\nWilson's image follows some exciting recent news regarding The Office, with Matt Belloni of Puck reporting that a reboot is in the works from Greg Daniels, the showrunner of the hit NBC sitcom. This reboot is said to be in the very early stages of development, meaning there are almost no details regarding what it will be about, where it will be set, or who will star in it. At the moment, it's not clear if the show will be happening at all.\nCrucial to note here is that Daniels is working on the reboot as part of a development deal, which is a far cry from a show actually getting the green light. If Daniels can come up with a good idea and NBC likes it, then the reboot might actually move forward. While little information is known at this point, the use of the term \"reboot\" over \"revival\" suggests that the original cast of The Office, despite being a core reason behind the show's success, will not be returning.\nWith the WGA strike having only just ended, it's likely that it will be some time before anything comes of Daniels' development deal. What is already clear, however, is that any prospective reboot faces the immense challenge of recapturing the same magic as the original NBC show. It remains to be seen whether The Office reboot will actually happen, but replacing stars like Carell, Wilson, and Kinsey will definitely be no easy task.\nSource: Rainn Wilson/ Instagram\n"}

Thriller Movie's Filming Locations Explained", "date": "2023-10-02 18:30:28", "text": "The 2023 Netflix film Reptile stars Benicio del Toro as a detective trying to solve the murder of a real estate agent – where was the movie filmed?\nReptile centers around the baffling murder of a young real estate agent and the complicated life of the detective on the case, and the cast and crew utilized a few cities on the East Coast to capture the movie's story. The Netflix murder mystery film, which premiered on September 29 on the streaming service, takes plenty of twists and turns, leaving viewers constantly guessing what the truth is and who brutally killed Summer Elswick. As the movie's synopsis suggests, nothing is as it seems in the crime thriller.\nThe large cast of Reptile includes Benicio del Toro as Tom Nichols, Justin Timberlake as Will Grady, Alicia Silverstone as Judy Nichols, Eric Bogosian as Captain Robert Allen, Ato Essandoh as Dan Cleary, Domenick Lombardozzi as Detective Wally, Michael Pitt as Eli Phillips, Karl Glusman as Sam Gifford, Matilda Lutz as Summer Elswick, Mike Pniewski as Chief Marty Graeber, Thad Luckinbill as Peter, Sky Ferreira as Renee, Owen Teague as Rudy Rackozy, Frances Fisher as Camille Grady, and Catherine Dyer as Deena Allen. Almost everyone is a suspect — the boyfriend, the best friend, the ex-husband, etc. However, nothing can prepare the audience for what happened in the ending of Reptile.\nAccording to Ready Steady Cut, the primary filming location for Grant Singer's Reptile was the metropolitan area of Atlanta, Georgia. Principal photography on the Netflix thriller film occurred from August 2021 to November of the same year, and the cast and crew spent most of their time in the Peach State, even though the movie takes place in Scarborough, Maine, which is a real town. However, Atlanta has become a hub for plenty of film and television show productions, so it is understandable why the Netflix movie chose the Georgia city as its central filming location rather than committing to shooting the entirety of the project in the New England town.\nAtlas of Wonders reported many of the Atlanta metropolitan area locations used in the film, including the Peachtree Battle Alliance neighborhood, the Cabernet Steakhouse, the Inn at Stone Mountain Park, the Westview Abbey Mausoleum, Accuformance Motors, and the Bigelow's nightclub. It seems as though the producers were determined to strictly use on-location spots for the movie, as opposed to shooting the majority of Reptile in a film production studio. All the reports regarding the Netflix crime thriller's filming locations suggest that production studios were not a part of principal photography.\nThe Peachtree Battle Alliance neighborhood was used for the house scenes. The Cabernet Steakhouse can be spotted in a couple of sequences when the characters go to a restaurant. The Inn at Stone Mountain Park was utilized for Justin Timberlake's Will Grady's conference scene at the film's beginning. The Westview Abbey Mausoleum was the backdrop for Summer Elswick's funeral. The auto repair shop Accuformance Motors can also be spotted in one scene. Lastly, the location of Bigelow's nightclub was used for the sequence where Benicio del Toro's Detective Tom Nichols and Ato Essandoh's Dan Cleary interview Sky Ferreira's Renee, aka the victim's best friend.\nRelated: Justin Timberlake's New Netflix Movie Features A Surprising Actor Reunion\nThe cast and crew of Reptile also heavily utilized Marietta, Georgia, another city just outside of Atlanta, for shooting significant scenes in the film. The primary location set in Marietta was the Manley Firm Law Offices, which doubled as the Grady Real Estate company offices where the victim, Summer Elswick, worked in the Netflix murder mystery film. However, the production team also took advantage of numerous spots in Marietta for their movie. But the most important one was undoubtedly the law office building since it was significant to the case in Reptile.\nAlthough most of the principal photography for Reptile took place in and around Atlanta, George, The Cinemaholic reported that the cast and crew also traveled to some parts of New England to capture a handful of shots for the movie. It would make sense if the production team shot various exterior scenes in the region in the Northeastern United States since that is where the 2023 Netflix crime thriller takes place. Unfortunately, specific New England locations used for the movie are unknown. However, it is possible that the crew went to Scarborough, Maine, the exact location of Reptile, to film specific sequences to make it more believable that the movie's events transpire in the town.\nSources: Ready Steady Cut, Atlas of Wonders, The Cinemaholic\nSarah Little is a Network TV Shift Writer for Screen Rant.

There have been several live-action Joker actors over the years, including Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto, and Joaquin Phoenix's versions of the Batman villain. While Leto played the character in the DCEU, he will most likely not be returning as the Joker in James Gunn's upcoming DC Universe.\nDC's upcoming movies in the DCU will almost surely feature a new Joker, possibly starting with the still-to-be-dated Batman reboot movie, The Brave and the Bold. While each live-action version of the Joker has brought out a different side of the character, from mobster to gang leader to anarchist and beyond, there is one inspiration for how the Batman villain should be portrayed in the new DC Universe that has come up as quite commonly requested. However, that perfect version of the Joker already exists in live-action.\nDespite only having a cameo role in The Batman and a deleted scene released online to showcase his version of the Joker, Barry Keoghan's Clown Prince of Crime fits exactly the inspiration for the Batman villain that was seemingly teased by Gunn for the DCU. Gunn sparked Joker rumors when he posted images of Conrad Veidt in Paul Leni’s The Man Who Laughs on Twitter, talking about how the original Batman comic book creators agreed that Veidt's role in the movie — a character that had a smile carved on his face — served as the inspiration for the Joker.\nWhile Keoghan's Joker has appeared very little so far, the actor's take on the iconic Batman villain is very clearly inspired by Veidt's role in The Man Who Laughs. Speaking with Variety, The Batman director Matt Reeves confirmed as much by comparing the two, saying, \"He has a congenital disease where he can’t stop smiling and it’s horrific,\" and \"his response was to say, ‘Okay, so a joke was played on me,’ and this was his nihilistic take on the world.” Keoghan's look as the Joker is appropriately grotesque, taking cues from The Man Who Laughs and positioning a challenge for the new DC Universe.\nWhile the DCU's Joker might not debut alongside whoever gets cast as Batman for the new universe in The Brave and the Bold, the Joker will inevitably have to come to the DCU one day. Batman can't be without his biggest villain for long, and so the Joker must come to the DC Universe. Whenever that happens, the DCU will have a very difficult task, as its version of the Joker will have to be different from the ones that came before.\nRelated: How To Watch DCEU Movies In Order (By Release Date & Chronologically)\nWhen there are multiple popular takes on the Joker in live-action, that becomes hard. Still, if the DC Universe's Joker manages to take inspiration from The Man Who Laughs and still feel unique among the other live-action versions of the villain — as the best versions of the Joker have managed to do — then the DCU's version of the villain could succeed. Based on how well Keoghan's Joker — who is directly inspired by The Man Who Laughs — was received, Gunn's seeming tease for the direction of the DCU's Joker is the right path for the character's next live-action iteration.\nSource: James Gunn/Twitter\n"}

So she didn't have that kind of runway, unless we treated her as exactly the same as Finn. So it was just kind of finding a situation we could put them in that would let her make very different choices and have a very different milieu to be in, in the first place.\nPart of the series ending kind of was freeing because we didn't have to tie it in as directly. It wasn't like we were cutting to a Fionna and Cake episode in the final season and then cutting back to the main series. It could kind of live as its own offshoot. And that's kind of how we treated it, like this is a branch that can go in a very different direction if we wanted to. And we don't have to show the whole course of her life, we're just kind of showing, you know, a couple of days in her life.\nThe multiverse was already established in the previous show, but Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake leaned into it a whole lot more. Were there conversations about all the other multiverse media that's been coming out recently, and how were you able to make your series standout among these other shows and movies?\nAdam Muto: I think it sort of helped that [the multiverse] already existed as being in the air and almost too many multiverse things right now. So it was kind of like looking at what we could do differently, and what we could kind of strip away and not try to show every single depiction of the characters because it feels like it's kind of moved in that direction, where it's like, ‘how can I show every single version of the character and include that in the story?’. And on a TV budget, you can't really do that for one thing. So we kind of listed all the things we possibly could do, and then narrowed down the list to the ones that felt like they would have the most meat or visually be different, or you know, just a couple of different factors. And then since it was kind of episodic, we wanted to treat it like we didn't have to track all those multiverse strip threads through the entire thing. Like each episode is basically in its own AU. And you know, we'd all seen Sliders at some point. So we just kind of like said, ‘what did we like about sliders? Maybe we can use that.'\nAre there any universes that you hope to include that didn't make it in the final cut that you're able to share?\nAdam Muto: I'll have to look at the list. Some of them were just like, ‘oh, this is a look,’ or ‘that looks cool.’ And they just were visually interesting, but it was hard to say we need a whole episode there. I think initially when we talked about like the FlapJack cameo we were like, ‘maybe we just go to Flapjack for an entire episode and have a crossover.’ And then eventually that got stripped away, because we only had 10 episodes. I'm trying to think if [there are] any others, but that was the one that stands out.\nSo going back to when Adventure Time first made that jump from more episodic storytelling into the lore-heavy serialized stuff. Was there any pushback from Cartoon Network, because around that time, there weren't a lot of animated shows aimed at younger demographics doing these broader stories.\nAdam Muto: What's strange is that they were resistant at first, but then it became sort of a marketing thing, like you could package a bunch of episodes together and promote it as an event. And it was a lot harder to get promos for individual episodes. So it wasn't like we were the only show. They were kind of going to a lot of shows and saying, ‘Hey, we want an eight pack or a 10 pack of episodes that we can kind of lump together’ and even in the later seasons of some of the shows that are still running. Like the last season of Summer Camp Island that was like one big arc. And some of that comes from the creators, and some of that came from the network itself, just having a harder time promoting individual episodes.\nSo elements that ended up playing a big role in the overall story like the Enchiridion - which was around in the pilot - were these things that you always hope to include or was your team just going through and finding things that could work in the overarching story?\nAdam Muto: It's kind of both, where you have things in mind, like what are your significant objects and events in the past that you can refer to that feel like - not that every single audience member would know it - but that felt significant enough in the backstory of each character that you could bring it back and it would have some significance.\nWe tried to leave it in a place where you could start and if this was your first series that you watched, it might be confusing, but you could kind of pick it up. And like, it would just seem like part of the backstory that maybe doesn't even exist. If you didn't know there was an original series, you could still watch it and just think that you're referring to something in the distant past. I think because we’d shown the Enchiridion in relation to Simon, it felt natural to kind of revisit that.\nThe Adventure Time fan base is obviously massive. Did you ever dream that it would get this big?\nAdam Muto: No, we just were trying not to get canceled the first season. I think a lot of that feels so outside of your control. We never sat around and wondered about like, ‘what's Comic-Con gonna be like,’ ‘which characters are people going to ship?’. I don't think we ever had conversations like that. It was more ‘how are we going to finish this in time for the next deadline?’. I think you get kind of tunnel vision. And especially if you're working in a studio, you can look at stuff online, but your day to day is just production. So you know, it's cool to see fan reaction. And when it's in person, it feels like realer in a way because you can see it online and you know, it's detached. It's just text on a screen, or fan art. But then when you see people in person, you're like, ‘Oh, I thought you were tricking us.’ I didn't know if people were actually watching. So it's nice. It's definitely nice, but it's not why we were making it.\nSo with the later seasons, and with Fionna and Cake, and Distant Lands after this fan base was already established, do you feel like the influence of the fan base and the things they wanted to see influenced the show's production at all?\nAdam Muto: I think it influenced especially what characters kind of showed up. Because if they had an established fan base, and the show is sort of fan facing, there are certain characters that lend themselves to a new series more than others. Like it'd be really hard to do a Mr. Pig series or a Shelby series or one about the Snail because the world was so expansive, you could focus on anything. But I'm pretty sure Max wouldn't have said ‘yes’ to a lot of those ideas. So I think the fact that the Fionna and Cake episodes usually got pretty high ratings when it was on linear, kind of made it an easier sell when we were like pitching what the series could be.\nAre there any hints you can give us as to what's coming next for the Adventure Time franchise?\nAdam Muto: I wish. I mean, I think streaming has made it a lot harder to predict the life of what's going to happen for a different iteration of the show, because I'm pretty confident there will be, but I have no idea when. I think in the meantime, we're just developing stuff and kind of seeing what the next year is going to be like.\nBased on characters from the beloved “Adventure Time” franchise, this brand-new 10-episode series set in the land of Ooo follows the alternate universe versions of Finn & Jake on a multiverse-hopping journey towards self-discovery. When Fionna and her sidekick Cake find themselves in the crosshairs of a powerful new foe, they have no choice but to seek the help of former Ice King Simon Petrikov. With appearances from Marshall Lee, Marceline the Vampire Queen, Princess Bubblegum, and Finn the Human, “Adventure Time: Fionna & Cake” transports fans of the classic series to worlds both familiar and alien. Voices include Madeleine Martin, Roz Ryan, Tom Kenny, Andrew Rannells, Donald Glover, Kayleigh Mckee, Sean Rohani, and others. Executive Producers: Adam Muto, Fred Seibert, Sam Register.

Throughout Big Brother's decades long run, Julie has been the only host of the series and has an intense personal relationship with the series. As a fan of the game herself and a part of the series from its very beginning, Julie often weighs in on what's happening in the BB house, sharing her thoughts on the players and the game as a whole. For Julie, watching new houseguests tackle Big Brother is second nature.\nAccording to an exclusive interview with People, Julie feels that the house's next target should be BB houseguest Jag Bains. \"Jag is good at winning things,\" Julie explained, adding that while he's good at \"winning games...he hasn't been able to steer the direction of the house.\" There's more to Big Brother than competition wins, though, which is why Julie feels BB 25's Cory Wurtenberger is actually running the BB house. Cory \"has the gift of being a persuasive speaker,\" according to Julie, and also \"has a fair amount of people under his belt\" aside from his showmance America Lopez.\nAlthough Big Brother is meant to capture its houseguests 24/7, sharing their most personal thoughts, there's still a code of conduct in place to ensure that houseguests are held to an appropriate standard of behavior. Earlier in the season, BB 25's Luke Valentine used a racial slur and was swiftly ejected from the game, causing a stir among BB viewers. \"It's just zero tolerance for that. That is unacceptable,\" Julie explained. \"That word really stings me. I can't imagine anyone using it even casually. I don't condone it at all.\" She shared that if she had things her way, Big Brother's code of conduct would apply in every situation.\nAs the longest season in BB history, Big Brother 25 has continued long past it's typical season benchmark. Most BB season span between 80 and 90 days, with some in the mid-90s, but BB 25 will be a 100-day-long competition. The houseguests, who have been in the house for roughly 60 days, are feeling the pressure after more than half the competition has gone by. With the series most recent twist resurrecting Cameron Hardin's game after he was unanimously evicted, the series will pick up the pace for the rest of the houseguests as they head towards the finish line.\nWhile there are still nearly 40 days left of the Big Brother 25 season, the houseguests have already played close to a full game. Though there are still weeks to go, the end is on the horizon for the BB 25 cast, including Jag, Cory, and Cameron. With the power shifting week to week, it's impossible to know who will wind up the winner of the longest modern season to date. Big Brother viewers will have to continue watching and expecting the unexpected in order to see what happens next.\nBig Brother airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EDT, Thursdays at 8 p.m. EDT, and Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT on CBS.\nSource: People\n"}
{"title": "Disenchantment Season 5’s 7 Best Easter Eggs & References", "date": "2023-10-02 18:50:29", "text": "Disenchantment season 5 continues the Netflix show’s tradition of including Easter eggs, with several connecting to Matt Groening’s other shows.\nDisenchantment, the popular animated show from the creator of The Simpsons and Futurama, has just finished airing season 5, which has plenty of hidden Easter eggs and references scattered throughout. The third animation from the mind of Matt Groening, Disenchantment is set in the fictional kingdom of Dreamland, which combines the Middle Ages with futuristic, space-age elements. Disenchantment season 5 serves as the final season of the series, bringing Queen Bean's (Abbi Jacobson) quest to save her home to a close at last.\nDisenchantment follows Bean and her companion, the feisty elf Elfo (Nat Faxon), in their attempts to save Dreamland from Bean's mother, Queen Dagmar (Sharon Horgan). The animated show is known for its hidden Easter eggs and references to popular culture, and season 5 of Disenchantment has continued this tradition, featuring a number of fun nods to itself, movies, and other shows in the Groening universe.\nOne notable reference made in Disenchantment season 5 is a callback to a 29-year-old joke from The Simpsons. In the 1994 Simpsons episode \"Lady Bouvier's Lover,\" Bart tries to sell Comic Book Guy an animation cell of a singular arm and informs the young boy that it was drawn by a man called Hig Heisler. Although Hig Heisler is not a real-life animator, his name appears in the credits of Disenchantment season 5, episode 3, \"Electric Ladyland.\" Specifically, Heisler is given credit for animating the Disenchantment characters' arms.\nThis isn't the first crossover between the two Groening shows. In Treehouse of Horror XXIX, Disenchanment's Luci (Eric Andre) makes an appearance. Luci is seen sitting atop the castle of Dreamland by Lisa during a fever dream. Luci also reappears in the Simpsons season 30 episode \"101 Mitigations,\" where eagle-eyed viewers can see figurines of him, Bean, and Elfo among a pile of trash in Comic Book Guy's room.\nFuturama's Hypnotoad is best known for his oscillating eyes and low hum, using his powers to hypnotize those who watch. These abilities eventually earn the creature its own in-universe show — Everybody Loves Hypnotoad — which becomes a worldwide hit. Hypnotoad returns in the Disenchantment season 5 episode \"I Hear Your Noggin, But You Can't Come In,\" where he can be seen in the background of the freak show. He's sitting upon a gold podium and covered with a glass dome. Locked away in a cell, Hypnotoad can be seen peering through the bars with a sign reading \"Prince Toad\" above it.\nThis makes sense, as Futurama season 11 confirms that the show shares a timeline with Disenchantment. Little is known of Hypnotoad's backstory, so it's unclear how old the creature is. He appears to be the only one of his kind on Earth. If Hypnotoad is as ancient as has previously been implied. it's more than possible that Hypnotoad is, in fact, the toad seen in Disenchantment.\nLuna Park is first introduced in Futurama episode 2 as a theme park inside a giant orb situated upon Earth's moon. Luna Park is inspired by the average 20th-century theme park, and it's revisited multiple times across the seasons of Futurama. It also appears in Disenchantment season 5. The episode \"Who Shot Elfo?\" finds Elfo and a group of escaped freaks attempting to make their way back to Dreamland aboard a submarine. As they set their destination, several other stops can be seen — including one for Luna Park.\nRelated: 10 Ways Disenchantment’s Characters Can Still Return In Futurama & The Simpsons\nIt's not known when Luna Park was first built, but this Easter Egg adds another link between Futurama and Disenchantment. Seeing as the group are traveling by submarine, and Luna Park is based on the moon, it doesn't make much sense. However, it is possible that Luna Park may have started on Earth and eventually made its way to the moon, which could have happened during the destruction of New York in 2308, as confirmed in Futurama.\nIn the Disenchantment season 5 premiere, Queen Dagmar sets off on a mission to locate Bad Bean's body. She begins interrogating the characters about its whereabouts. While Queen Dagmar questions Elfo, he sits at a table lined with different torture devices, including wrenches, pincers, and barbed wire. At the end of the table, eagle-eyed viewers can spot a metal device that resembles Zoidberg's claw on the far left.\nThis could simply be inspired by the Futurama character, but it also could be a reference to the Futurama episode \"Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?\" Dueling using the Decapodian ceremonial process of Claw-Pach, Fry uses a large crab cracker to defend himself against Zoidberg, which looks very similar to the weapon seen on the table in front of Elfo. The Claw-Plach was actually inspired by an episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, meaning this Easter egg could be a reference of a reference.\nDuring an appearance at San Diego Comic-Con in 2018, Matt Groening told audiences that a massive clue had been hidden at the beginning of the opening credits of Disenchantment (via GameSpot). It isn't until Disenchantment season 5's ending that the meaning behind his words becomes clear. The mystery is solved when Bean gives Dreamland back to the Elves. Disenchantment's credits feature a shot of the cast, which is a reference to King Rulo's crown. This hints at the Elves' eventual rule over Dreamland way before it happens.\nDisenchantment's Steamland is home to the Gunderson Steamwork, which is inspired by the 1927 film Metropolis. However, this is not the only reference to the silent science-fiction film. Another is made in season 5 of Disenchantment. Bean is seen embracing a figure resembling a Maschinenmensch (a Robot-Person), the non-human antagonist of Metropolis. It's clear the movie influenced Groening and his animated series, as Disenchantment keeps returning to it.\nIn Disenchantment season 5, episode 9, \"Darkness Falls,\" magic is unlocked and Dagmar is delighted as it slowly spreads across the kingdom of Dreamland. As this happens, a voice can be heard muttering about \"10 years.\" This is a reference to Futurama's cancelation in 2013, the second time Groening's show was canceled before returning for its third run in September 2023. This Easter Egg from Disenchantment season 5 further emphasizes the connections between Groening's series, especially Disenchantment and Futurama.\nSource: GameSpot\nRebecca is an experienced freelance writer from the UK, with two degrees focussing on narrative design and characterisation, as well as being a doctoral candidate on the discussion of the wider public's understanding of minority groups and the issues they live with, through mainstream television, film, and video games. \n\nIn her spare time, you'll find her with her cats, a cup of coffee, and gaming."}

A contemporary reimagining of the 1984 cult classic of the same name, the upcoming film follows the downtrodden janitor, Winston Gooze, as he suffers a horrible toxic accident that transforms him into a monstrous hero. The film features a stellar ensemble cast led by Peter Dinklage as Winston Gooze alongside Jacob Tremblay, Taylour Paige, Kevin Bacon, Sarah Niles, Julia Davis, Julian Kostov, and Elijah Wood.\nNow, Legendary has released a red band teaser trailer for the Toxic Avenger remake. Watch it below via IGN Movie Trailers:\nThe teaser begins with a series of news reports and interviews with eyewitnesses who have seen the Toxic Avenger. After a group of armed extremists known as the Nasty Lads take hostages at the Miss Meat lunchatorium, the titular hero armed with a glowing mop and super-human strength breaks down the door and takes matters into his own hands by ripping the jaw off one of the hostage takers.\nThe Toxic Avenger reboot trailer shows the first footage of its titular vigilante, though just like the initial image that was released this past August, it's only a silhouette that purposefully obscures much of his appearance. Another batch of images released late last month revealed a clear look at Winston Gooze wearing a tutu pre-toxic transformation. Elijah Wood was also unrecognizable as Fritz Garbinger, a character whose appearance is heavily inspired by Danny DeVito's Penguin from Tim Burton's Batman Returns. Kevin Bacon plays Bob Garbinger who, just like his brother, takes inspiration from a DC supervillain – Lex Luthor.\nRelated: The Toxic Avenger Remake Is Already Shaping Up To Be Darker Than The 1984 Original\nThe teaser trailer also promises that much like the original cult classic, the reboot will feature plenty of blood and gore. This was already expected considering the remake received an R-rating from the MPAA for \"strong violence and gore.\" It's also produced by Troma Entertainment, who was behind the original Toxic Avenger and is known for its exploitation-style movies that push the boundaries of graphic violence, gruesome deaths, and over-the-top gore for comedic and shock value purposes. Based on the red band teaser trailer, it appears The Toxic Avenger reboot will follow firmly in the footsteps of orginal.\nSource: Legendary (via IGN Movie Trailers)\n"}

The 37-year-old Panama native last appeared in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6 and faced many challenges in her relationship with Gino Palazzolo. But she stayed with him and traveled to the United States to seal the deal. Unfortunately, the couple still has many unresolved problems that endanger their relationship. They are still not on the same page about signing a prenup and making a will.\n90 Day Fiancé season 10 promises even more drama between Jasmine and Gino. E! News spoke to the couple to get their reactions to a recent trailer that them having a major argument after the Panamanian woman discovered lip gloss in her future husband’s car. While sharing her views, Jasmine accepted her faults. She said, “I was not expecting that. It took me by surprise, and I reacted in the most emotional, crazy way.” Jasmine then admitted that she was glad the meltdown happened in front of the cameras. She added, “Now people are going to see that Gino is not the angel everyone thinks he is. He's truly not.”\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nGino and Jasmine also discussed their wedding plans in the interview, stating they aren’t sure what's going to happen. Gino said, “We’re still undecided if we’re actually going to get married.” The 90 Day Fiancé couple explained that they have different expectations from the marriage. Gino wants a local celebration so all his family members can attend the wholesome gathering. In comparison, Jasmine wants a seaside wedding away from the wilderness. She explained, “Since my family is not going to be able to be present in the wedding, I wanted to make it just him and I. No family at all.”\nIt’s saddening that after years of being together, Jasmine and Gino still treat their relationship like a business contract. Jasmine is in the wrong for not wanting to interact with Gino’s family or invite them to the wedding. She is extremely selfish for wanting her future husband to give up on having his family at the venue just because she can't have hers. Similarly, Gino is at fault for not discussing the wedding plans before inviting Jasmine to the United States. He could have clarified his expectations when he first addressed the topic with her.\nIt’ll be interesting to see what is in the future for Jasmine and Gino. The Panamanian single mom has implied that the lip gloss incident will expose Gino and ruin her social media image. However, she didn’t provide more details on the subject. Gino also didn’t seem to defend himself in the interview, which could hint that he is confident he isn’t at fault. 90 Day Fiancé season 10 will show Jasmine and Gino giving their relationship a last chance.\n90 Day Fiancé season 10 premieres Sunday, October 8, 2023, at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.\nSources: E!

This post contains SPOILERS for Ahsoka episode 7\nGrand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen) has finally made his live-action debut in Ahsoka, and he's already proven himself to be incredibly powerful as Star Wars' latest big bad. Unlike other villains such as Darth Vader or Emperor Palpatine, Thrawn is not a Sith Lord nor can he wield the Force. However, there are some key reasons why he's just as scary and dangerous in the Star Wars galaxy nonetheless.\nAs seen in Ahsoka episode 7, Grand Admiral Thrawn is preparing to finally escape his decade-long exile on the extragalactic world known as Peridea. Having been located by his agents with a means of returning to the known galaxy, Thrawn is nearly ready to take command of the Imperial Remnant as \"Heir to the Empire\", starting a brand-new war with the Rebellion-turned-New Republic in the aftermath of the original trilogy. To that end, his first battle with the Jedi trio Ahsoka Tano, Sabine Wren, and Ezra Bridger proves Thrawn's true power as an effective Star Wars villain.\nAt his core, the true danger of Grand Admiral Thrawn is his genius-level intellect as a brilliant tactician. Not unlike Anakin Skywalker whom Thrawn had history with, Thrawn is renowned for his unconventional strategies and offensives, often raising the eyebrows of his fellow officers and superiors. However, Thrawn's results spoke for themselves which is why he rose through the ranks of the Imperial Navy so quickly, eventually being given command of the Seventh Fleet as a Grand Admiral.\nWithin Thrawn's sinister genius, one of his true strengths is his extensive study of his opponents. Seeking to learn their backgrounds, history, culture, and art, Thrawn was able to gain unique insights into his enemies' strengths and flaws, allowing him to press on weaknesses his fellow officers would have never seen. For example, Thrawn was continually one step ahead of Hera Syndulla during Star Wars Rebels, having gained advantages after learning all about her history and even pieces of art held by her family on Ryloth. Thrawn's whole approach is to truly know his enemy. He thus launches plans that take unique advantage of their literal blind spots.\nIn the same vein, the first thing Thrawn does is seek knowledge after hearing that Tano may be coming to Peridea in Ahsoka episode 6. Wanting to prepare, Ahsoka episode 7 sees Thrawn looking over all the Empire's data on Ahsoka, including the fact that Anakin Skywalker was her master. As such, Thrawn now knows that Ahsoka is just as unpredictable and dangerous as Anakin was, motivating the Grand Admiral to adapt and shift tactics. Rather than continuing to pursue Ahsoka as Morgan Elsbeth would have, Thrawn calls off their fighters in order to better position both himself and Ahsoka right where he wants her to be.\nRelated: 14 Star Wars Easter Eggs In Ahsoka Episode 7\nAs seen multiple times in Star Wars Rebels as well as in Timothy Zahn's canonical Thrawn novels, the Grand Admiral often takes advantage of his enemies' fear. Anyone who faces Thrawn typically ends up second-guessing themselves, struggling to figure out whether they're being played. The fear of Thrawn therefore paralyzes them, leaving them indecisive in their own strategies and creating even more opportunities for Thrawn himself. More often than not, Thrawn's preparation and ability to be flexible with multiple contingencies allow him to control the flow of battle in his favor.\nFurthermore, Thrawn is also able to trick his enemies with false victories, using their confidence against them. During the Liberation of Lothal, the Rebellion was allowed to believe that they had fought hard to break through Thrawn's planetary blockade, though the ships that did make it through were met by a second wave of TIE Fighters kept in reserve and hidden within the planet's atmosphere. As such, Thrawn's unconventional tactics and ability to adapt in real time make him a truly frightening opponent to face in battle.\n To that end, Grand Admiral Thrawn has no problem giving ground in the short term in favor of the long game to become the ultimate victor. While others may want to press an advantage at the moment Thrawn has proven himself to be far more patient, though he's also willing to expend necessary forces if it means his foes overplay their hand. In Rebels, probe droids were destroyed during Thrawn's search for a secret Rebellion base. However, he was still able to use the data to shorten the list of planets the rebel cells could be on, turning what others might have seen as a loss into a gain.\nThrawn also knows when to pull his forces back to gain a stronger advantage as seen in Ahsoka episode 7. With Baylan Skoll missing in action, Thrawn called in a retreat and allowed Ahsoka to reunite with Sabine and Ezra. This is because it ultimately bought him more time to eventually leave Peridea. While Morgan Elsbeth saw this first confrontation as a defeat, Thrawn saw the true value of the retreat. He doesn't need to destroy the Jedi and risk his escape when all he needs to do is let them waste time as he prepares to leave, thus stranding the heroes on the extragalactic world.\nRelated: How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order\nIn the past, the biggest examples of Thrawn losing have come from the Jedi and their more unpredictable use of the Force. Kanan Jarrus motivating the Force entity known as the Bendu to enter the conflict prevented Thrawn from wiping out the Rebellion in Star Wars Rebels season 3. Likewise, Ezra's bond with the pod of star whales resulted in the Grand Admiral's exile and the Liberation of Lothal in Rebels' series finale, explaining Thrawn's absence during the original trilogy.\nNow, Ahsoka has debuted Thrawn in league with the Force witches known as the Nightsisters. It's the perfect example of Thrawn having adapted, turning a key weakness from his past defeats into a strength for future victories. While he might not wield the Force himself, he's already made up for it with this new alliance, further proving Grand Admiral Thrawn's status as one of Star Wars' most dangerous villains.\n"}
{"title": "Feud Season 2: Renewal, Release Date Window & Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-02 19:00:31", "text": "Ryan Murphy's FX docudrama returns with Feud season 2, titled Feud: Capote vs. The Swans. Here's everything we know.\nFeud season 2, officially titled Feud: Capote vs. The Swans, is arriving on FX, and the next season of the anthology docudrama already looks set to be filled with just as much edge-of-the-seat drama, intrigue, and high-society betrayal. Feud’s first season showcased the rivalry between Joan Crawford and Bette Davis in the 1960s. The next season of the anthology show is moving forward a decade, detailing the feud between writer Truman Capote and his mostly female high-society friends (the titular Swans) and the scandal that followed after his explosive 1975 Esquire article “La Côte Basque 1965”.\nWith a cast that includes Naomi Watts and Tom Hollander, anticipation for Feud season 2 is high, especially since it will be arriving over five years after the first season. The hit Ryan Murphy historical docudrama could arrive on FX by the end of 2023, and since it’s based on historical events there’s already much to discuss when it comes to Feud: Capote vs. The Swans.\nThe most recent news for Feud season 2 came in September 2023 when FX released first-look images from Feud: Capote vs. The Swans. The handful of images didn’t reveal a huge amount of plot-specifics, but they did give viewers their first look at cast members like Tom Hollander’s Truman Capote and Naomi Watts’s Babe Paley.\nDespite several years passing since 2017’s season 1, Feud was reconfirmed as renewed for season 2 in 2022. Feud season 2 was initially confirmed in 2017 shortly after the first season. However, development then went on hiatus for many years while Murphy exited the show to work on other projects. While the plug was never officially pulled on Feud, between 2017's confirmation and the 2022 story announcement/reconfirmation many believed the show wouldn't return.\nThere’s currently no known release date for Feud season 2, although with first-look images circulating it likely won’t be much longer until one is announced. It’s widely expected that the FX anthology show has been pegged for a winter 2023 release window, which means it could debut by the end of the year. However, given the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes throughout the year, it’s possible FX could delay the 8 episodes of Feud season 2 for an early 2024 release.\nMuch of the cast of Feud season 2 has already been announced, along with who they’ll be playing in the Capote vs. The Swans. Truman Capote will be played by Tom Hollander (The Kings Man), with Naomi Watts (Mulholland Drive) joining him as Babe Paley.\nHollander and Watts aren’t alone in the Feud season 2 cast, however, and the rest of the ensemble lineup of the next season of the FX anthology show includes:\nThe full title for Feud season 2 is Feud: Capote vs. The Swans, which reveals what the story of the next season will be. Truman Capote was a fame novelist and screenwriter who lived from 1924 to 1984, reaching fame with the novella Breakfast at Tiffany’s and 1966 true crime classic In Cold Blood. Feud season 2 will focus on a specific incident from Capote’s life, the now-infamous “La Côte Basque 1965”\nStarting life as a single chapter of the novel Answered Prayers, the article in the November 1975 edition of Esquire marked the end of Capote’s life as a budding socialite. It was clear that many of the characters were based on high-society women Capote knew - the titular Swans of Feud season 2 — with some not even being masked by pseudonyms. Since Capote marketed a lot of his work as non-fiction there was, understandably, uproar, especially since the text included no shortage of scandalous details and gossip, many of it blurring real events with fictionalized conversations.\nCapote was isolated and exiled from the high-class company he’d grown used to keeping thanks to the single chapter. Once a staple of the New York ballrooms, La Côte Basque 1965 saw Capote shunned by his friends and associates — something that pushed him ever further into alcohol and substance abuse. This is the story Feud season 2 will tell, showcasing how the titular Swans went out of their way to ensure that Capote’s article didn’t go unpunished.\n"}
{"title": "Wheel Of Time Season 2 Makes A Villain Reveal From The Books Even Better", "date": "2023-10-02 19:00:31", "text": "The Wheel of Time season 2 takes a meaningless villain reveal from the books and turns it into a huge twist with massive story implications.\nWarning: Spoilers for The Wheel of Time season 2, episode 7\nIn addition to copying a villain twist from the books, The Wheel of Time season 2 made it even better than what happened in the source material. The Wheel of Time season 2, episode 7, titled “Daes Dae’marr,” offered a surprise when one of the show’s newer characters, Barthanes Damodred, stood revealed as a Darkfriend. As it turns out, Barthanes was never the innocent nobleman he was presented to be when he first appeared.\nOf course, Moiraine’s nephew is far from the first Wheel of Time character to turn out to be a servant of the Dark One. The innkeeper Rand and Mat encountered in season 1, Padan Fain, and more recently, Liandrin, were all exposed as Darkfriends. For one reason or another, they were lured by the Shadow into doing the bidding of the Dark One and his generals, the Forsaken. Apparently, Barthanes was among the many tempted by the promises that come with helping the Dark One. At an unspecified point in time, Barthanes became a Darkfriend in the interest of gaining political power for his family, Wheel of Time’s House Damodred.\nIn spite of his admiration for Moiraine and seemingly good-spirited attitude, Barthanes being exposed as a villain didn’t come as a complete shock – or at least, not to book readers. Like the TV character, the version of Barthanes Damodred in The Great Hunt was revealed to be a Darkfriend when Rand visited him after receiving an invitation to a party held at his home in Cairhien. Rand knew very little about the mysterious nobleman before meeting him, but by the end of their conversation, it was abundantly clear that Barthanes was allied with the Dark One. His true loyalties were confirmed to Rand when Barthanes passed on a message from Padan Fain.\nWhat transpired between Rand and Barthanes bears few similarities to the story given to the villain in Amazon’s live-action adaptation. Both versions are members of House Damodred, of course, meaning that the book character is most likely related by blood to Moiraine in some form. However, any relationship that he shared with her was not relevant to the book in any way, as Moiraine and Rand were in separate parts of The Wheel of Time’s world at the time. The Anvaere character wasn’t a factor either. In short, Barthanes’ entire backstory was an invention of the show, but also one that made a lot of sense for the series.\nIn contrast to his brief arc in The Great Hunt, Barthanes is a character whose story actually carries emotional weight in the TV series. In the novel, it hardly mattered that Barthanes was a Darkfriend, especially since he was someone that Rand had just met. The show, on the other hand, managed to dramatize it in a meaningful way, thanks in large part to how it fit both Barthanes and his mother into Moiraine’s season 2 story. The development was much more significant for the show because Barthanes was introduced in episode 5, allowing the series some time to make the character genuinely likable.\nHis affection for Moiraine, which felt sincere, added something to the villain that simply wasn’t in the books. This helped create the feeling that perhaps the TV show’s take on Barthanes wasn’t a Darkfriend. After all, it’s worth pointing out that it was he who helped break through to Moiraine, who had been cold and detached since returning to her family home. Moiraine even apologized after treating him poorly and expressed her confidence in Barthanes’ ability to be a good king for the people of Cairhien. Earlier, she had made comments about how kind he is. All this made his story in Wheel of Time season 2 episode 7 even sadder. After all, it’s only a matter of time before Moiraine learns the heartbreaking truth.\nThough Moiraine has yet to personally discover her nephew’s plan to kill her, it’s already had a profound impact on the narrative. Specifically, it was a massive gut-punch to Anvaere. Remembered as Moiraine’s sister in Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time books, Anvaere never appeared in any of the novels and was only confirmed to exist in the canon through a few forgettable references in the prequel, A New Spring. Whereas the books’ Anvaere was never more than a name from Moiraine’s backstory, the TV show’s interpretation of her has already emerged as one of the best additions to season 2.\nInteractions with Moiraine have helped flesh out Anvaere’s character, revealing that she’s so much more than a noble eager to move up the social and political ladder. Anvaere was depicted as someone who had good reasons for being angry at Moiraine. Moiraine stayed away for a just cause – finding the Dragon Reborn – but admittedly, Anvaere knew nothing of it and was understandably bitter about Moiraine’s return. That said, her love for her sister outweighed this feeling, and even led to her providing Moiraine with some much-needed advice. Anvaere then making the difficult decision to have her own son arrested - and forego her chance to restore House Damodred’s good name – gave her a truly great character moment.\nContributing further to the tragic nature of Barthanes’ storyline is what this means for his ending in the series. The idea that the show followed the course set by the books by making him a Darkfriend makes it increasingly likely he’ll meet a fate not unlike what happened to his book counterpart. Shortly after Rand met Barthanes, he learned from Thom that the nobleman was murdered in his bedroom by a gholam, a creature of the Shadow. Since Barthanes has failed to complete the order given to him by Liandrin, the stage is set for he too to die at the hands of one of the Dark One’s minions.\nBarthanes appears to be living on borrowed time. His status and relationship with Moiraine were what made him useful, but now that his allegiances have been exposed, there’s a good chance he’ll be discarded by his masters. The 13 Forsaken in The Wheel of Time have a low tolerance for failure, so Barthanes meeting an unceremonious end very soon feels like a real possibility. But while his death was easily forgotten by Rand and the others in The Great Hunt, it could have emotional consequences for both Moiraine and Anvaere in The Wheel of Time’s future.\nThe Wheel of Time releases new episodes on Fridays on Amazon Prime Video.\n"}

The Infinity Saga revolved entirely around the Mad Titan. From the moment audiences caught a peek at him at the end of The Avengers, each Marvel film built up to the Avengers' inevitable confrontation with him in Avengers: Infinity War. After they lost and half of all life in the universe was destroyed, the remaining Avengers found a way to bring everyone back and defeat Thanos. However, after his demise, it was unclear where the universe would go from there without its central villain.\nThe MCU Phase 5 is well underway, and the franchise still can't escape Thanos. While Kang appears to be the central antagonist for the Multiverse Saga, many movies still deal with life in a post-Thanos world. If the MCU wants to move forward without being stuck in the past, then it needs to establish a fresh story that doesn't rely on fragments of what came before. Thanos is a great character, but his time is done.\nThe Marvels is the next film in the MCU and is both a sequel to Captain Marvel and a showcase for Monica Rambeau and Kamala Khan, two new heroes introduced in WandaVision and Ms. Marvel. As the release date gets close, new footage is emerging, and a Chinese trailer featured shots involving a familiar villain. The teaser begins with Nick Fury reminding viewers that Captain Marvel is mighty and one of the few Avengers members who could go toe-to-toe with Thanos. Then, it shows the fight between Carol Danvers and Thanos from Endgame, in which she had him on the ropes until he used the Power Stone against her.\nIt's not a scene many have forgotten within the last four years, but it's a great reminder of how powerful Captain Marvel is. However, the flashback to their fight is a reminder that the MCU is still banking on the audience's connection to Thanos. He is arguably the best villain in the franchise, and many are still waiting for the universe to reach the peaks that it hit when everything revolved around the purple titan. The Marvels isn't the only film that is leaning on the past, as many other MCU projects have dealt with the lasting effects of Thanos.\nThe MCU Phase 4 established the beginning of the Multiverse Saga, but it was also a Thanos epilogue in many ways. Projects like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Eternals had conflicts that directly connected to Thanos' actions and how the world changed once everyone came back post-blip. Even in Phase 5, the MCU still hasn't fully moved on from him. Secret Invasion leaned heavily on Nick Fury's five-year absence from Earth due to the blip and his recent mission, and it included a serum called the \"Harvest,\" which had DNA from the Avengers collected from the battleground of the Battle of Earth.\nRelated: Every Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie Ranked Worst To Best\nThanos was a phenomenal villain, but these stories should no longer be so obsessed with the fallout from his defeat. Kang is here, and if he is to become an iconic character like Thanos before him, he needs more focus.

Co-created by the genre vet and I Am Number Four author James Frey, the animated horror show centers on a group of teens in New Orleans who become imbued with special powers from mystical spirits known as Loa in order to combat the rise of the malevolent demon, Belial.\nSydney Mikayla leads the ensemble Fright Krewe cast alongside Chester Rushing, Tim Johnson Jr., Grace Lu, Terrence Little Gardenhigh, and Jacques Colimon. Boasting a colorful yet gothic animation style and storytelling that is equal parts heartwarming and terrifying, the show is a perfect gateway into the horror genre for younger viewers and a thrilling ride for those already in love with it.\nRelated: New On Hulu: All 185 Movies & TV Shows Arriving In October\nIn anticipation of the show's premiere, Screen Rant spoke exclusively with Eli Roth to discuss Fright Krewe, the long journey to make the family-friendly horror title, the importance of authentically depicting voodoo religion, and his hopes for its future.\nScreen Rant: Eli, I'm very excited to talk with you. I've been an admirer of your work for a long time, and I feel like this is such a great expansion of your work in the horror genre, especially after The House with a Clock in Its Walls, where you're going for this Goosebumps-like aesthetic. When did this concept first come about for you and James Frey, and how long did it take for you guys to develop it together?\nEli Roth: It was actually before House with a Clock in Its Walls, weirdly, this started in 2015. James is a friend of mine, a dear friend, a writer I love, and we sat down, and we were talking about how there was nothing scary for our kids, and how the show that that still is the greatest [for that] is Scooby-Doo. There's nothing animated scary that we remembered after school, or on Saturday mornings, watching episodes of Scooby-Doo, and watching them go through haunted houses, and how much fun that was, that the teenagers solve the mysteries without parents, that they were all these groovy kids driving around in a van.\nWe thought, \"What if we did a show where it was kid solving supernatural mysteries set in New Orleans, and what if we could do our own Scooby-Doo, or our own Goosebumps, and maybe it's an animated series, and a series of books or whatever it is.\" We wanted to create this world where it's something that is for kids, but that is fun, and teaches you that you can Trojan horse life lessons and things about friendship, and bravery, and all these great things that you can do in a scary story. It just it took years to get done, but we could not have had a better team, and a better crew, and the amazing studio at DreamWorks Animation, and now Hulu and Peacock releasing it, and our showrunners Kristine Songco and Joanna Lewis, and our director Shane Acker. We just have an incredible cast, it really couldn't have turned out better, it was so much better than we ever originally imagined it, but we just loved the idea of doing something set in New Orleans, and using that as a basis for a great scary series, except in our series, the monsters had to be real.\nLooking at Scooby-Doo, you could obviously go the fake monster out, but having this be very real creates more stakes for a lot of the characters, and it's a lot of fun to watch. Now, you talk about the multi-year process and getting this off the ground, what were some of the biggest challenges for you, whether it be creatively or logistically, putting the show together?\nEli Roth: Well, when you come up with a show like this, even the pitch process is very lengthy. First, you have to get the studio on board, and I remember we pitched DreamWorks Animation, and they're so good, they're very patient, so it can sometimes take a year to get the script right, or to get the artwork right. James and I wrote the first draft of the script, we wrote it together, and then they said, \"Let's bring in different artists to draw Missy, and Soleil, and Patrick, and let's have different samples of art. Okay, let's try this, let's bring in a director,\" and now we're bringing Joanne and Kristine before you go out and pitch it. Then, sometimes you pitch to a company, and they would pass on it, or they wait three weeks, or four weeks, before they say no, and then six months later, you go, \"Okay, let's go back to them.\" \"But they already said no,\" it's like all those people got fired, there was a regime change, or places like Hulu and Peacock, the people that are the buyers, their mandates change.\nSometimes they're looking for animation, you know, kids animation is traveling worldwide, everyone in the world watches, it's evergreen, they want that. Then they go, \"Okay, they already have three shows, and they don't want that anymore.\" So it's a combination of lining up the project, getting the script right, getting the artwork right, but also the buyers needing a product like this. Because, obviously, animation is expensive, and it's more cost-effective to just do a season than to just do a pilot, so you have to be very, very patient. We started this in 2015, and here we are in October of 2023, it's finally coming out, but it's really nice when it all comes together and it's worth the wait.\nI couldn't be happier with the show, I think we have something that's so unique and fantastic, and I wanted a show that horror fans could watch with their kids, that if you want your kids to get into scary stuff, you can't start them with Hostel. You need that gateway horror, and something that's fun, that's scary, that's safe, that teaches you lessons about bravery and friendship, and to give kids their own new mythology, a whole bunch of cool new monsters. It's really exciting.\nI love how unique this feels. It feels 3D, but also feels very hand-drawn at the same time. What was it like finding that right look, and what were some of the big things that you really wanted to ensure stayed there, regardless of which artists came in?\nEli Roth: Well, the first decision was 2D, but with a 3D feel, that's what we settled on. Because we looked at renderings in 3D, and it didn't have the same feeling. There's something beautiful and retro about hand-drawn animation that we love, it's just my aesthetic. I started with animation, I made a bunch of short films called Chowdaheads, and stop-motion called The Rotten Fruit, they're floating out there on YouTube. So, even before Cabin Fever, I come from an animation background, and I love hand-drawn animation.\nBut we wanted it to have a real cinematic feel, and I love Shane Acker, he's an incredible director, and I love his film 9, and I love his work. We looked at what kids are going to be watching this on projectors, and on 100-screen televisions in 4K, and we said, \"What can we do that doesn't feel like The Flintstones or King of the Hill?\", which are obviously shows that I love, but something that when you're dealing with horror and monsters can be so cinematic, and so scary, and so rich, with complex camera moves. That was just the commitment that we made right from the beginning. In animation, it's money, and it's budget, and it's time, and working on those animatics, and finding those moves, and finding the look at the monsters. And that was really Joanna and Kristine Songco, who had done the Jurassic Park show for DreamWorks Animation, they're really not just overseeing the writing, but working with the animation studios, and working with the animation directors, and making sure that whatever that aesthetic that we set up with Shane from the beginning was really carried throughout every single episode.\nAnd then, of course, getting the voice talent [is important as well]. I want everything to look like a work of art when you're watching the show, I want it to be beautiful and cinematic and feel like you're watching a movie. That was the ambition of the show, and I think that the animators just hit it out of the park. Horror is so visual, especially when you're dealing with voodoo. James and I thought about how we had seen voodoo represented when we were growing up, and whether it was a voodoo doll, or a voodoo spell that you put on someone, it's such an incredible, rich, deep religion that we had never really seen portrayed like this. If you think about the crossover of religion and horror, it's still happening with The Exorcist and The Nun II, that's the biggest thing in the box office right now. But we really wanted to make sure that we did it in a very respectful way that could teach kids about it, and educate about the Loa, the spirits that help guide the kids, and the values they instill in that this one is for power, and that this one will be for knowledge, and this one is languages, and there's Papa Legba, and there's the Maman Brigitte, and Marie Laveau, and really rooting it in real history.\nWe had voodoo priests and priestesses and practitioners that were on from the very beginning, they were technical advisors, and looking at the artwork. One of our writers was from New Orleans, and her grandmother was a voodoo priestess, so really making sure that even though we're going off into the world of fantasy and horror, that it was all grounded in reality. What animation allows you to do is to render the spirit world in such a beautiful and incredible way so that when I think of what was my understanding of voodoo by the time I was 12, or 13 years old, if the kids watched the show, they'll have a completely different understanding of what the religion in a much, much more grounded way. You want kids to watch the show and eventually when they go to New Orleans, and recognize the different places, and understand the history of the city, from having seen Fright Krewe. People that are from New Orleans are so happy with the show, because they say, \"These guys, they really took the time to get it right and do it in a respectful way.\"\nThe season ends on quite an explosive note. I'm curious if you and James have future plans laid out for this show, or if you're just currently waiting for word from DreamWorks of whether to move ahead?\nEli Roth: Well, we would love to continue it. I'd love to continue it as a TV series, and a book series, and that's entirely in the hands of the viewers. You know how it works, there's a lot out there, there's a lot of content, and if we want this to become the next Scooby-Doo, or the next Goosebumps, it's really up to the public at this point. We feel like we've put our hearts and souls into this, everyone cares so much about it, all the voice talent, the writers, the animators, the incredible artists. Everybody loves this show so much, and hopefully that translates, and if the show catches fires with the public, then everybody would love to do more, but it's up to the public at this point.\nIt all started during detention in a graveyard when Soleil Le Clair, a girl who LIVES for horror, accidentally broke a spell on the Tree of Life and unleashed an ancient evil into this world. The spirit of Marie Laveau, voodoo queen of New Orleans, put her and four other kids in charge of saving the city from Belial, an ancient demon who feeds on fear. Luckily they're not alone — each kid gets a special gift from voodoo spirits called Loa. Super strength is given to Missy, Maybe gets the ability to disappear into the realm of the dead, Pat can understand any language or creature, Stanley gets knowledge about anything he touches, and Soleil can manipulate all four Earthly elements.\nThe ward they live in, the 13th and a Third, is known for fright tourism and Soleil's always loved all the scary legends about her creepy little ward. So she's beyond excited to find out the town's biggest secret — the vampires, rougarous, ghosts, monsters and demons are in fact very real. The creatures have been secretly living among humans for decades...but tensions between the rougarous and vampires have been high lately, and when Missy has to turn into a rougarou to survive a life-threatening injury, the kids can't help but get mixed up in all of it. Our Krewe will have to hone their powers, figure out what Belial's up to, keep the peace between vampires and the rougarous, AND figure out how to be a team because there's no way they'd all hang out otherwise. But going up against local legends like the Feu Follet, swamp monsters, and demon hounds from the underworld is kind of a weird bonding experience, and our Krewe will realize there's more to each other than they thought.\nFright Krewe is now available for streaming on Hulu and Peacock.\n"}

Based on George R. R. Martin's book series A Song of Ice and Fire, Game of Thrones is an epic fantasy show that follows a series of characters that include Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), and Jon Snow (Kit Harington) who are all involved in an epic war over who should become the ruler of Westeros. Unfortunately, the characters also have to prepare for an invasion from a group called the White Walkers, led by the Night King, who want to destroy the entire realm.\nThroughout the HBO series, Game of Thrones has had a number of strong side characters who played a vital part in the overall narrative, one being the character played by Hannah Waddingham. Waddingham is a prominent theater actress who has graced the stages of both London's West End and Broadway, but most know her for her Emmy-winning role as Rebecca Welton in Apple TV's Ted Lasso. However, even before Ted Lasso, Waddingham's Game of Thrones character became a huge pop culture phenomenon, especially for her iconic scene involving Cersei Lannister.\nFirst introduced in Game of Thrones season 5, Hannah Waddingham plays Septa Unella, a member of the Faith of the Seven clergy and one of the High Sparrow's (Jonathan Pryce) most loyal followers. However, Unella is more collectively known within popular culture as the \"Shame Nun\", which alludes to her famous scene in which she strips Cersei completely naked and then forces her to walk around King's Landing while ringing a bell and chanting \"shame\" for her crimes of committing adultery with Lancel, Cersei's cousin.\nHowever, Cersei ultimately gets her revenge because after destroying the Sept of Baelor and reclaiming her position as the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, she immediately imprisons Unella and torments her for all the pain she caused against Cersei. Cersei reminds Unella of the promise she gave to her about how her face would be the last thing the nun would see before Unella dies, and afterward, Cersei brings Ser Gregor \"The Mountain\" Clegane (Hafþór Júlíus \"Thor\" Björnsson) into her cell. Cersei leaves the room and smiles as she hears Unella's screams while the viewer is only left to imagine how The Mountain is torturing her.\nDespite Unella's grisly fate, Waddingham enjoyed playing the character, specifically because of Unella's drab appearance. Waddingham states, \"I'm not interested in looking dolly all the time, it needs to be whatever suits the character. I mean liked the fact that in Game of Thrones, I looked like I'd just been dug up, exhumed from somewhere\" (via CinemaBlend). Her role as Unella also highlights how talented of an actress Waddingham is as the dour, zealous nun is a completely different character from the more confident and fashionable Rebecca Walton she played in Ted Lasso. Waddingham even got to keep the shame bell after her time on Game of Thrones was over.\nTimothy Lee is a writer and avid movie/TV/anime fan who has been working at Screen Rant since 2023. Ever since he wrote his first film review for his college newspaper, he has been obsessed with the art of film criticism. Whether as a hired writer for small news organizations or on independent platforms like YouTube, Timothy is always happy to write about and express his love for all things pop culture.

Re-Po has a massive, formidable body, with a huge mouth full of jagged – though perhaps not jagged enough – teeth, and not one, but several tongues. What makes this monster truly nightmarish is the face within its face. Sprouting from the hellish being's forehead, connected by a sinewy, organic tether, is a ghoulish white, humanoid face. It's a striking image, one that is perfect for the comic book medium; it would be difficult to imagine Re-Po translating to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, when it feels more suited to a Clive Barker horror story.\nThe current arc will also continue the adventures of Rek-Rap, Marvel's demon Spider-Man, who has quickly become a fan-favorite. As the preview pages for Amazing Spider-Man #36 shared by Looper show, Rek-Rap is absolutely freaked out by Re-Po, seemingly even more so than Peter Parker, who seems more puzzled than anything during their initial encounter. However, the solicitations for Amazing Spider-Man #38 make clear that Re-Po will be a serious threat to Spider-Man and his demonic counterpart, asking, \"Can Spider-Man and Rek-Rep both survive the repulsive RE-PO?!\" The cover for issue #38 features the malevolent new nemesis, whom readers will become much more familiar with over the next several issues.\nPerhaps Re-Po belongs in the pages of Amazing Spider-Man, but it would be an unexpected surprise to see it ever enter the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The villain is one of the most horrifying Spider-Man has ever faced, with a terrifying design that more than conveys that magnitude of the threat Re-Po will pose to Spidey and Rek-Rep. Spider-Man's demon ally has quickly endeared himself to readers, meaning it is unlikely he will fall to Re-Po – but with Peter Parker edging closer to darkness lately at the same time, such a loss might be the unexpected tipping point which sends Spider-Man spiraling further into the dark.\nAmazing Spider-Man #36 will be available October 25, 2023 from Marvel Comics.\nSources: Looper; League of Comic Geeks\n"}

These debates are likely to go on for as long as new anime air every season. Anime can tell a broad range of stories, and the nature of animation allows anime to tackle just about every genre of fiction, from slice-of-life to sci-fi. However, combat-focused anime (usually in the shonen category) tends to be some of the most popular and commercially successful anime around.\nWith so much combat in anime, it’s no surprise that debates about which character is stronger than another are a staple of the fandom. Of course, with more anime airing than ever before and heroes of ongoing tales constantly receiving power-ups, these debates can change from day to day. It may be impossible to say for sure who would win in a one-on-one fight, but the most powerful characters in anime can be ranked when they are at their strongest and most capable.\nOver the course of Tokyo Ghoul, Ken Kaneki goes from a timid bookworm to a figure of worship known as the One-Eyed King.

After transforming into a half-Ghoul and training his body, he’s able to destroy entire cities easily and command legions of monstrous beasts that can transform others into Ghouls. This makes him a borderline undefeatable fighter who only grows stronger with each injury he sustains.\nRelated: Tokyo Ghoul's Most Divisive Moment Returns in Creator's New Series\nAs the main hero of Bleach, Ichigo wields a diverse set of powers that come from just about every group seen in the series. His Soul Reaper abilities allow him to wield a spiritual weapon known as a Zanpakuto, while his Hollow abilities give him mastery over the dark energies of the monstrous Hollows. Ichigo even demonstrates some Quincy techniques, such as the Blut Vene which can protect him from attacks, and at one point was also capable of wielding Fullbring, a special type of spirit power that only a small percentage of humans (like Chad) can acquire. While Ichigo surely has far more abilities at his disposal than were ever seen on screen, his return in the Thousand-Year Blood War anime has given him another chance to show off.\nA character based on a legend like Dracula has to be able to deliver in the power department, and Alucard in Hellsing Ultimate does just that. Functionally immortal at the beginning of the series due to the number of souls inside of him, and then literally immortal by the end of it, Alucard cannot be ended. He has super strength, speed, and incredible durability, putting him far above the level of a mere human. He can manipulate and control blood as well, and has a plethora of other odd powers, like the ability to pass through walls. His dual pistols are also essentially cannons, and he is able to summon the souls of those he’s eaten to form an army of servants. As if those abilities aren’t enough, Alucard also has an army of demon dogs at the ready that can tear nearly any enemy it shreds in an extremely painful instant.\nThough dissociative identity disorder means Elfen Lied's \"Lucy\" has many voices that make up her character, Lucy tends to be the strongest of the bunch. It's Lucy who most often utilizes the character's numerous abilities. Lucy is both a deft fighter and a near-perfect marksman, but it's her telekinetic abilities that most often stand out. She makes use of psychic \"vectors,\" which act like invisible arms she can use to extend her reach and power. At her strongest, Lucy's vectors can be used to sink landmasses the size of small countries. She could, conceivably, destroy the whole world, securing her a rank among the strongest anime characters.\nJotaro Kujo is the main protagonist of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders. As a person, he’s as smart as he is tough and able to discern and counter the abilities of anyone who would challenge him. His stand ability, Star Platinum, is one of the most physically powerful Stands in the series, despite its short range. After going up against Dio, Jotaro also learned how to stop time for several seconds, allowing him to wail on enemies as they stand helpless. Those without Stands can't even see them, so Jotaro could easily defeat any character without a Stand, without so much as cluing them into what just happened.\nMuzan Kibutsuji is the progenitor of the Demons of Demon Slayer, who gained his own powers when experimented upon by a scientist with a rare blue spider lily over 1,000 years ago. Muzan is capable of turning others into demons and his blood will outright kill those who are incompatible with it. He can shape and mold his body to form weapons and is an absolutely vicious killer. Muzan's only weakness is sunlight; as a demon, he's unable to go out in the day, and he's spent most of his long life desperately searching for a cure for this one flaw. When in the dark, however, Muzan's ability to regenerate is nearly unlimited, and as a result, he's killed many, many demon slayers over the years.\nThe former chairman of the Hunter Association, Isaac Netero is one of the strongest martial artists in anime history. After subjecting himself to training that was supposed to end him, Netero gained incomprehensible speed and strength, able to throw punches faster than the speed of sound. His ultimate ability is the 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva, the manifestation of his Nen powers at a level that no other character in the series even comes close to matching. Even if he should somehow lose, though, he has a small nuclear bomb implanted in his chest that will obliterate whoever manages to end him and poison anyone who manages to survive the blast.\nAttack on Titan's protagonist Eren Yeager is a very powerful character who has the ability to transform into a 15-meter tall Titan with incredible regenerative abilities. However, the reason he ranks so highly among the strongest anime characters is because of his ability to command legions of Titans with the power of the Founding Titan. Using this ability, he can bring entire nations to ruin with a simple command that summons thousands of 50-meter tall Titans to action. Entire armies could not stand against this ability, and that makes Eren deserving of a spot as one of the most powerful characters in anime.\nMob Psycho 100's Shigeo Kageyama, more commonly known as Mob, is an ultra-powerful esper who can destroy anyone or anything with a simple thought. His powers are so intense that he has to shackle his emotions to keep them from running wild, meaning that he doesn't often put them to use. However, if he feels something too strongly or falls unconscious, his psychic powers come rushing to the surface. In his ???% state, Mob wields powers on par with large-scale natural disasters. Not only does the nature of his abilities make them impossible to guard against, but the strength behind them is also so great that even the strongest psychics in his world buckle beneath them. Mob is among the strongest anime psychics, though he isn't quite the strongest.\nThe big villain of My Hero Academia, All for One is a villain from the dawn of Quirks, who has used his personal power to gather Quirks that enhance his power and allow him to live indefinitely. Over the time since the dawn of Quirks, All for One has collected hundreds of different powers, ranging from physical attacks to radio wave emission to regeneration. All for One is also able to redistribute the Quirks he steals, allowing him to gain favor by providing underlings with new power. All for One's shrewd social manipulation is actually one of his most dangerous traits, and the reason why it's taken 9 generations of One for All users to even come close to bringing him down.\nGojo is continually touted as Jujutsu Kaisen's strongest sorcerer for good reason. While already incredibly smart and strong, what truly puts him over the edge are his cursed techniques Limitless and Infinity. With Limitless, Gojo can essentially control space, giving him incredible offensive and defensive capabilities. With Limitless, Gojo also has the technique Infinity which makes it so that any attack launched against him can only ever get infinitely close to him but never touch him in an astoundingly literal take on Zeno's Paradox. Gojo might not be impossible to defeat in Jujutsu Kaisen, but his raw power makes him one the series' strongest by a wide mile.\nGurren Lagann's Simon is a simple earthling who incorporates spiral power into the attacks of his giant mecha to devastating results. Commanding a mech so large it spans galaxies, Simon can create a drill with the ability to rip reality apart and destroy literally anything that stands in his way. With a nearly god-like command over life and the afterlife, as well as reality itself, this metaphysics-bending warrior is nearly unstoppable and can obliterate the universe itself if he chose to. Only beings with the ability to destroy entire universes could even hope to stand a chance against him.\nGiorno is the protagonist of Jojo's fifth part, Golden Wind, wielding a Stand ability that goes by the same name. Golden Wind allows him to invigorate both living things and inanimate objects with life energy, which can cause them to temporarily come to life or increase their power immensely. However, Giorno's true power isn't seen until the end of the series, wherein he's struck by the Stand Arrow and his Stand evolves, becoming Golden Wind Requiem. Golden Wind Requiem becomes a rare Stand capable of operating independently of its master and can cancel out actions taken against it, removing them from causality. Once struck by Golden Wind Requiem, a person is trapped in a state of reliving their death over and over again for all eternity--a chilling and terrifying power that no one would want to go up against.\nThe Legendary Super Saiyan himself, Broly canonically debuted in the Dragon Ball Super film of the same name and proved that he still lived up to his reputation from the '90s. Broly was so powerful that even Golden Frieza, Super Saiyan Blue Goku, and Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta were only barely enough to keep him busy. Goku and Vegeta had to fuse into Gogeta and use their Super Saiyan Blue abilities to defeat him, but even that wasn't enough to kill him. Broly was later seen training with Beerus on his homeworld in Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, suggesting that this Saiyan's power is only going to become greater with time.\nKoro-sensei is an \"alien\" who wields dozens of incredibly powerful tentacles, which make up the bulk of his body. Koro-sensei is unbelievably fast, able to zip across the world on his lunch break and dodge streams of bullets coming out of machine guns without breaking a sweat. Koro-sensei can only be killed by special \"anti-sensei\" material, which is harmless to ordinary humans even when made into weapons. Koro-sensei is also a master assassin, skilled in various forms of combat--an ability that comes in handy even without a humanoid body. And, while his stamina isn't limitless, it's incredibly high. If he weren't specifically training people to kill him, he'd be nigh unstoppable.\nGetting reincarnated as a slime was the best thing that ever happened to Rimuru Tempest, turning him from a lonely salaryman into a force to be reckoned with in his new fantasy world. Rimuru forged an alliance with a powerful dragon, who shared with him a large portion of his power. This allowed Rimuru to build a following by naming monsters, which granted them new powers, and in turn, allowed Rimuru to grab new powers as well. Rimuru receives guidance from the Great Sage, an AI-like being that offers advice and evaluates scenarios. Rimuru also possesses the incredible ability to take power from anything he devours, a fate that many a villain has fallen to. Rimuru doesn't just have physical power, though; he wields an impressive amount of political power as the leader of the monster kingdom.\nFew anime characters came to regret their incredible powers as much as Devilman Crybaby's Ryo. Though Akira's best friend spends much of the anime series behind the scenes plotting, it is eventually revealed that Ryo is actually Satan. As Satan Ryo commands a massive army of demons that wipe out all of humanity as well as the more powerful devilmen. No slouch in combat himself though, Ryo as Satan actually takes out the series' titular devilman, Akira in a tragic brawl that leaves the heroic devil cut in half. Ryo's misanthropy and raw power ended up costing him the only person he ever loved, making Devilman Crybaby's Satan one of the most tragic and powerful anime characters.\nFans often think of Naruto as the most powerful character in his anime, but even he can't defeat the series' ultimate villain on his own. Known as the Rabbit Goddess, Kaguya is one of the most powerful villains in the Naruto franchise, and may well be the most powerful woman in anime. Not originally from Earth, Kaguya travels to the planet in order to take the fruit of the God Tree. Her plan was to unite people by making them fear her, which is not hard when you can read minds, manipulate memories, travel through space, and control the elements. Once she partakes of the God Tree's fruit, she's also able to heal her own injuries, making her nearly indestructible. Kaguya's powers rank her as one of the strongest anime villains of all time.\nMonkey D. Luffy took a bite of Gum Gum and developed the power to stretch his body, at the cost of being able to swim. That might seem like a big downside for a pirate, but Luffy has made it seem like no big deal over the years. Luffy trained for ten years to master this power, and all that training paid off big time. Luffy's special transformations go from \"Gear 1\" to \"Gear 5,\" and each features a radically different way of using his rubbery nature to enhance his battle ability. Luffy is also a master of Haki, a means of utilizing spiritual power for both combat and non-combat purposes. Though these abilities might not seem so strong on the surface, Gear 5 gives Luffy the powers of a god as he warps reality into a cartoonish parody of itself. These abilities make Luffy one of the strongest shonen anime heroes of all time.\nTetsuo Shima, the de facto antagonist of Akira, awakens his immeasurable psychic powers after a collision with another psychic. His powers quickly grow in strength, and before long he runs the risk of obliterating the entire universe. Thankfully, before that can happen, he warps himself to a place outside of reality and the force of his psychic explosion gives birth to a whole new universe. Few other anime characters possess the ability to both create and destroy reality, and that’s what ranks Tetsuo among the strongest characters in the medium.\n"}
{"title": "Scarlet & Violet's Indigo Disk DLC May Have Pokémon's Easiest Villain", "date": "2023-10-02 19:02:27", "text": "The upcoming DLC for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, The Indigo Disk, seems set to have the least threatening villain character in the series’ history.\nIt seems that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will have the franchise’s easiest villain for people to beat when the upcoming Indigo Disk DLC releases. Given both the ending of The Teal Mask and its gameplay, it is easy to predict how several aspects of The Indigo Disk will play out. One of these likely outcomes features a villain who appears to be doomed to be overcome with ease.\nIn recent Generations, the Pokémon games have seen some notable changes to the traditional formula surrounding their villains. Perhaps most notably, the Teams of the most recent games, Team Yell and Team Star, have nothing to do with their game’s respective villains. Instead of being evil organizations backing up one of Pokémon’s most terrifying villains, these groups are effectively an over-enthusiastic fan club and a student support network founded by bullying victims. Likewise, the main villains themselves are growing more independent and self-sufficient. The Pokémon Scarlet and Violet games are especially lacking in truly evil characters, but the new DLC aims to change this.\nRelated: Which Pokémon Evil Team Leader Is The Hardest\nThe ending of The Teal Mask does a lot to set Kieran up as an antagonistic force for The Indigo Disk. Shutting himself up in his room, he is seen becoming obsessed with his desire to grow stronger whilst ominous music plays. It’s uncertain what exactly Kieran will try to do after training himself, but assuming he now holds a grudge, he will likely become more aggressive towards the protagonist. However, unfortunately for Kieran, The Teal Mask has also demonstrated just how underwhelming he’ll probably be because the average player’s team is already too strong for him, and this isn't likely to change.\nRelated: Short & Sweet DLC - Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Teal Mask Review\nThe Teal Mask’s level scaling doesn’t really account for endgame teams, and there is no indication that The Indigo Disk will be much better in that regard. The Teal Mask content offers players Pokémon of differing levels to battle depending on whether The Way Home, the final part of Scarlet and Violet’s main story, has been completed. However, the Pokémon in The Teal Mask are easily beaten either way, a situation which extends to the teams of NPCs. Kieran himself, in his final battle against the protagonist, uses a team with levels mostly in the early 70s, the exception being his level 76 Gliscor.\nThe problem is that by the time people reach this point — as most will have already completed the base games before the DLC’s release — in all likelihood, their teams will be in the level 80s, if not even higher. It is worth noting that the toughest Tera Raid Battles encourage people to battle with the most powerful Pokémon they can at level 100. While Kieran will undoubtedly be stronger than he is at the end of The Teal Mask in The Indigo Disk, this disparity seems set to continue; as such, it is doubtful that his team will truly be able to compete with the protagonist.\nGiven his final levels in The Teal Mask, Kieran’s next team will probably be in the level 80s. As such, with the possible exception of story beats giving him a victory outside of regular battle, it seems that Kieran will be unable to pose much of a threat no matter what he tries to accomplish. This is unless he actually has a team at level 90 or above, but this seems unlikely. Such a team would undoubtedly make Kieran the most powerful NPC trainer in the Pokémon franchise, marking a dramatic change in how the franchise’s NPCs are usually designed.\nRelated: Scarlet & Violet: Nemona Is Pokémon’s Most Relatable Rival\nCurrently, Red’s Pikachu in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver is tied with Cynthia’s Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl Garchomp (on a second rematch) for the title of strongest NPC trainer’s Pokémon, at an incredible Level 88. For Kieran to outdo this record with not just his ace but his entire team would be a significant development in this regard. Although this would guarantee more of a challenge, it is important to remember just how easy it is to level up in Scarlet and Violet. EXP Candies are plentiful due to Pokémon Tera Raids, and The Teal Mask even provides an Exp. Charm to boost gains even further.\nOf course, it is important to note that the Pokémon games do offer battles against Pokémon up to level 100. In addition to the extremely difficult six and seven-star Tera Raid Battles, it has long been possible to face trainers with level 100 Pokémon in Battle Facilities. However, Battle Facilities typically represent a more generic challenge that scales in difficulty in response to a win streak. They do not form part of a Pokémon game’s plot like future battles with Kieran will (excluding optional post-game rematches), and so are less beholden to the standard design conventions, which ensure a gradual rise in difficulty throughout a game.\nAny battle with a significant NPC like Kieran must balance difficulty with accessibility so that people are not unfairly overwhelmed in battle. This effectively limits how strong Kieran can become to limit the amount of monotonous grinding required to progress through the DLC. On the other hand, introducing the BB League does mean that several other new trainers will also be faced during The Indigo Disk at a high difficulty level. These are trainers whom Kieran seems set to become stronger than in pursuit of his own goals, so there is still the potential for him to approach impressive heights for any trainer.\nThe Teal Mask sets up future content in various ways, from subtle hints to clear foreshadowing, and a rematch with Kieran is a clear example of this. Given that Kieran is already approaching Level 80 with his Gliscor, it is entirely possible that he will ultimately field a team on par with Red and Cynthia in The Indigo Disk. Nevertheless, given the time provided by the delay between Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s initial release and that of the DLC, as well as the already plentiful opportunities to grow stronger, it is clear that most will have already outstripped him once again by the time this fateful rematch actually takes place.\nSource: Nintendo of America/YouTube\n"}
{"title": "Why The Incredibles Broke Pixar’s Most Iconic Easter Egg Tradition", "date": "2023-10-02 19:11:27", "text": "The Incredibles is unlike every other Pixar movie beyond its use of superheroes as it's the only film to not include a Pizza Planet truck Easter egg.\nPixar's animated movies are known for including some fun Easter eggs, but The Incredibles broke the studio's most iconic tradition. The iconic animated studio has a habit of including Easter eggs referring to its own movies or other parts of Pixar's or Hollywood's history. These range from the popular references to A113 and connections to other Pixar movies, with the Pizza Planet truck - which originated in the studio's first movie Toy Story - among the most popular. This even led to the popular theory that there is a Pixar Shared Universe in which all the movies exist.\nAfter Toy Story debuted the Pizza Planet truck, Pixar turned the yellow delivery vehicle into one of the studio's most popular Easter eggs. It was briefly seen in their next film, A Bug's Life, and returned in Toy Story 2. The Pizza Planet truck Easter eggs have varied throughout the years, but it is still an aspect that Pixar fanatics keep an eye out for with each movie. The newest Pixar movies like Luca, Turning Red, and Elemental included the Pizza Planet truck Easter egg. The overall popularity of this reference to Pixar's past makes it even more surprising that the iconic truck is not in The Incredibles at all.\nRelated: All 27 Pixar Movies Ranked From Worst To Best\nThe lack of a Pizza Planet truck Easter egg in The Incredibles is surprising considering every other Pixar movie has managed to include it in some capacity. However, director Brad Bird has commented somewhat on the lack of a reference. Over a decade after the movie's release, The Huffington Post asked Brad Bird whether The Incredibles secretly had a Pizza Planet truck Easter egg. He admitted he had no idea because \"I was busy making the movie. I didn’t think about the Pizza Planet.\" Bird did admit that it is possible that someone else from the animated team at Pixar included the reference, but he doesn't know about it.\nThere were plenty of opportunities for the Pizza Planet truck to appear too. Since The Incredibles takes place in the 1960s, a retro version of the delivery vehicle could have been featured. The city settings included a number of other cars, so a Pizza Planet truck easily would have fit. Fans have speculated that several yellow cars could be associated with Pizza Planet, but the spaceship topper isn't visible. There is also a theory that since The Incredibles takes place in the 1960s that Pizza Planet does not yet exist, so no delivery truck could be included.\nSomewhat miraculously, The Incredibles remains the only Pixar movie without the Pizza Planet truck appearing in some form. The 2004 animated movie broke the trend for Pixar, but all future movies from the studio made sure to include it. The new 19-year streak of Pizza Planet truck Easter eggs began with Cars in 2006 and continues all the way through Elemental's release in 2023. That makes 21 consecutive Pixar movies to include the iconic truck, and 26 out of 27 movies overall. This includes it appearing among Incredibles 2's Easter eggs, so the family arcade does exist in this universe, even if The Incredibles doesn't reference it.\nSource: The Huffington Post\n"}

While each Power Rangers season since the end of the Zordon Era has been mostly standalone, there is still a strong level of interconnectivity in the franchise. Even Dino Charge and Dino Super Charge, both of which take place in a different timeline from most Power Rangers TV shows, have been part of crossovers in the last few years. This includes Cosmic Fury, which featured three generations of Dino Rangers.\nThe Power Rangers Cosmic Fury cast included David Yost as Mighty Morphin’s Blue Ranger Billy, who fought alongside the former Dino Fury Rangers for most of the season. Heckyl’s return in Cosmic Fury made it into a crossover involving the Mighty Morphin, Dino Charge, and Dino Fury lores. In addition to being a fun crossover, Heckyl’s role in Cosmic Fury delivered on a seven-year-old Power Rangers tease – the debut of Dino Charge’s Dark Ranger.\nPower Rangers Dino Charge’s Dark Ranger never actually appeared on the show, even though Heckyl was clearly meant to become a Power Ranger. Heckyl is one of many Power Rangers villains who were later redeemed, which is something the character even acknowledges and jokes about in Cosmic Fury. Heckyl’s “classic redemption arc” in Dino Super Charge was not surprising considering that the character was not originally evil. Heckyl was the guardian of the Dark Energem from Sentai-6, but after the planet was invaded, he accidentally touched the artifact. Dino Charge’s Heckyl was given the power of the Dark Energem, but an evil alter ego was created in the process.\nRelated: Which Super Sentai Show Power Rangers Cosmic Fury’s Zords & Costumes Are Based On\nHeckyl’s Super Sentai counterpart becomes a Ranger in Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger: Gaburincho of Musicmovie, a film set in the same continuity as the Kyoryuger show. However, due to character rights issues, Power Rangers could not use the Deathryuger design in the TV show. This is why Dino Charge’s Dark Ranger, a character viewers dreamed of seeing in Power Rangers, was not in the show. However, whatever prevented Power Rangers from using the Deathryuger design was handled, and the Dark Ranger finally debuted in Power Rangers Cosmic Fury. Dino Charge’s Dark Ranger also appeared in the BOOM! Power Rangers comics, which are set in a different continuity entirely.\nHeckyl momentarily became the Blue Solar Ranger in the Power Rangers Beyond The Grid comic books, during which the Death Ranger design first appeared in a piece of Power Rangers media. The Power Rangers comics revealed that Heckyl returned to his homeworld to protect the Dark Energer but continued to struggle with its evil influence. While the Dark Ranger’s origin story in the comics was quite interesting and brought Heckyl’s Dino Charge story full circle, it cannot be assumed that those same events happened in the Power Rangers TV show chronology.\nPower Rangers Cosmic Fury’s Heckyl role was surprising, especially because Power Rangers Dino Charge takes place in an alternate universe from the main timeline. Cosmic Fury acknowledged that Heckyl was from another universe but did not get into detail as to how or why the Dark Ranger had come to this dimension. Regardless, Cosmic Fury’s Dark Ranger was an essential part of the Power Rangers’ plan to save Earth from an alien invasion led by Lord Zedd and his allies. Heckyl was Terrick’s spy inside Lord Zedd’s ship and became Squillia’s crush before revealing his true identity. Almost seven years after Dino Charge’s finale, Heckyl morphed into the Dark Ranger.\nRelated: Power Rangers Cosmic Fury’s Ending Explained: Is It The Last Power Ranger Season?\nThe Dark Ranger was supplying Terrick and the Resistance with information on Lord Zedd, but he was eventually captured. After the Power Rangers freed Heckyl and the others, the Dark Ranger briefly joined the Cosmic Fury team in one of the coolest Power Rangers battles in years. Heckyl’s Dark Ranger Morpher was unique compared to the ones from the Dino Charge Rangers, and his transformation sequence began with the “Unleash the power” battle cry. After fighting side by side with the Cosmic Fury Rangers and Mighty Morphin Blue Ranger Billy Cranston in episode 7, Heckyl continued to help the Resistance offscreen.\nRyan Carter plays Heckyl in Power Rangers Cosmic Fury. Heckyl first appears in episode 6 as the spy inside Lord Zedd’s base before morphing into the Dark Ranger in Power Rangers Cosmic Fury episode 7. Ryan Carter originally played Heckyl in Power Rangers Dino Charge, having appeared in the final episode of the season. Carter would reprise his role as Heckyl in Power Rangers Dino Super Charge, which explored the character’s origins and his secret, evil form. Snide, Heckyl’s evil counterpart in Dino Charge, was voiced by a different actor, Campbell Cooley.\n"}

This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 7.\nIvanna Sahkno's Shin Hati has quickly become a favorite among viewers of Ahsoka, especially as the dark Jedi apprentice of Ray Stevenson's Baylan Skoll. The duo has been shrouded in mystery since their orange lightsabers first appeared in the earliest previews of the Star Wars Disney+ TV show, and with each new episode, more about them has unraveled - especially for Shin. As someone craving the power only a high rank from Grand Admiral Thrawn could promise, Shin's desires have strayed from her master's, and now she's set on her own path. Shin's story has piqued the interest of many viewers, and for some, it's inspired some incredible creations.\nOne of these creations is a cosplay by Lucy of striking similarity to Shin, as captured by Tom Roberts. Lucy dons an incredibly faithful recreation of Shin's full outfit, including her silver pieces of armor.\nLucy invokes the energy of Sahkno as Shin in this photo, especially with the far-away glance of the potential of her future. From her hair to her boots, Lucy brings Shin's dark Jedi look of conflict to life with this cosplay.\nWith only the finale of Ahsoka season 1 remaining, Shin has one chance left to find redemption before the story's conclusion. Ahsoka has now offered that path to her, but whether Shin takes it or not is still left to be seen. It certainly seems as if she may take this route based on the abandonment of her master and her chemistry with Natasha Liu Bordizzo's Sabine, but with limited storytelling space remaining and plenty of loose threads left to tie up, it could be that Shin's redemption has to wait until season 2.\nRelated: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nShin is a character that should remain in the future of Star Wars stories. She's become one of the series' most interesting characters, and now that she seems to desire being at Thrawn's side, she could function as an important Force-sensitive adversary in the greater conflict Thrawn's return promises the galaxy. Should Shin take the path of redemption, then she could also become a key part of Luke's new Jedi Order, or at least join the effort to stop Thrawn. Either way, Shin has brought a lot of interest to Ahsoka, and hopefully her story will get to continue on in both galaxies.\nAhsoka releases new episodes Tuesdays at 6 pm PT / 9 pm ET on Disney+.\nSource: Tom Roberts\n"}
{"title": "10 Harsh Realities About The DCEU’s Ending", "date": "2023-10-02 19:30:29", "text": "The DCEU is finally coming to an end with the release of 2023's Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, but the franchise's final days haven't been positive.\nThe DC Extended Universe might be coming to an end, but the franchise's final days have caused huge division and created several problems for the upcoming reboot, the DC Universe. Warner Bros. kicked off the DCEU with the 2013 release of Man of Steel and quickly thrust their superhero franchise into overdrive, adapting the stories of some of DC Comics' most popular characters into live-action. Since its beginnings, however, the DCEU has always been polarizing, with the work of individual directors tending to be praised rather than the franchise's overarching storyline, visual effects, scripts, and even performances from several of the franchise's core cast.\nThis division, and the 2022 merger between Warner Bros. and Discovery Inc., led to a lengthy period of turmoil, with DC Films being replaced with DC Studios, with filmmaker James Gunn and producer Peter Safran hired as co-CEOs. Both Gunn and Safran have delivered strong superhero movies, so immediately set into motion a plan to reboot the DCEU, allowing the mistakes of the past to be glossed over with new stories. While the DC Universe is kicking off in 2024 with Creature Commandos and Waller, and with 2025's Superman: Legacy, the DCEU still needs to deliver its final project, though the faltering franchise has left a lot to be desired.\nThe DCEU will officially conclude on December 20, 2023, with the release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. While 2018's Aquaman became a smash hit, grossing over $1 billion at the box office, predictions aren't as high for the sequel despite the majority of the primary cast returning. There has been confusion surrounding why Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is the final DCEU film before the reboot, with many considering The Flash a better closing narrative before the DC Universe.\nXolo Maridueña will reprise his role of Jaime Reyes from 2023's Blue Beetle in the DC Universe, but despite being positively received, his DCEU debut still became a box office bomb due to its release date. Blue Beetle was released after several disappointing DC projects, and it may have been hard for audiences to get excited about a story in a soon-to-close shared universe. Had Blue Beetle been released a couple of years earlier or waited to debut as an official part of the new DC Universe, it almost assuredly would have fared better.\nBlue Beetle's disappointing turnout was a symptom of a greater issue with the DCEU's recent releases. The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the performance of Wonder Woman 1984 and Gunn's own The Suicide Squad, but its successors didn't fare any better and have acted as the final nail in the DCEU's coffin. 2022's Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash in 2023 were all met with mixed-to-negative responses and only grossed $797.4 million collectively - a number several solo superhero movies have surpassed their own.\nIn the lead-up to The Flash's release, the film was billed to be resetting the DCEU, using DC Comics' Flashpoint storyline as inspiration, seemingly gifting the DC Universe the perfect jumping-off point. However, this failed to come to fruition. The Flash's DC franchise reset involving George Clooney's Bruce Wayne made no sense, it's timeline and storyline were confusing, and the film's poor visual effects and script quality didn't do it any favors. DC Studios had the perfect opportunity to set the stage for a major reshuffle in their live-action franchise with The Flash, but completely fumbled it, leading to more confusion.\nThe DCEU has left many unanswered questions in almost every project, and with the franchise now coming to an end, these loose ends will never be resolved. Part of the magic of a shared franchise is that each project can set up something for the future, but the DCEU's constantly-changing plans and confusing timelines mean that too many storylines were set up. Viewers will never know what happened to Robin, what Bruce Wayne's Knightmare visions would have culminated in, what happened when Superman met Black Adam, or whether Shazam joined the Justice Society.\nRebooting the DCEU seems like the easy way to avoid past mistakes leaking into the new DC Universe, as history could repeat itself once David Corenswet brings a different version of Clark Kent to life in the DCU's Superman: Legacy. However, after a lengthy period of DC releasing disappointing projects, the future won't only entail focusing on a reboot but also trying to rebuild audience trust in the franchise. Many have become apathetic towards the DCEU, as proven by the turnout to Blue Beetle, The Flash, and Shazam! Fury of the Gods, so Gunn and Safran must try and build a strong foundation to reignite desire in the new franchise.\nPerhaps one of the key elements that led to the downfall of the DCEU was that Warner Bros. was in constant competition with Marvel Studios' more successful Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starting with 2008's Iron Man, the MCU now comprises over forty projects across film, TV, and animation. In only a decade, DC released 14 feature films (including Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom) and one TV series, paling in comparison. Jumping too fast into crossover stories meant that individual characters never saw the development they needed, and this was proven by 2023's Blue Beetle, which was more positively received thanks to its overt separation from the wider world of the DCEU.\nAs well as leaving many loose ends and producing several disappointing installments, the DCEU also missed several perfect opportunities to make itself stronger. For instance, Henry Cavill's Superman was wasted, despite many calling for a direct sequel to 2013's Man of Steel, and Ben Affleck's Batman never got the development he deserved, missing out on a much-needed solo project. Perhaps the franchise would have been more popular had Zack Snyder been able to complete his planned Justice League storyline, but even this can't be known for sure. Too many stories and developmental moments slipped through the net, leading to the poor projects that have been released more recently.\nDespite rebooting the DCEU into the new DC Universe, Gunn and Safran have confirmed several DCEU characters who will return in the DCU. While it will surely be great to see John Cena's Peacemaker, Viola Davis' Amanda Waller, Xolo Maridueña's Blue Beetle, and others returning, the fact that some actors will continue to play their roles while others are being recast has led to confusion among DC's audiences. Gunn has stressed that the DC Universe's first projects will mark a new canon, suggesting the entire DCEU will be forgotten, so actors will be playing new versions of the same characters, but this may be difficult for DC fans to comprehend.\nIt has also become evident that the DCEU has wasted some of DC Comics' most popular properties. Henry Cavill's Superman was insignificant in the DCEU, and Ben Affleck's Batman was underdeveloped and never got his solo movie. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman was one of the DCEU's most popular projects, but her cameos in Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash were disappointing. While the DC Extended Universe may have treated its most prized characters in a disappointing fashion, the new DC Universe will hopefully do them justice.\n"}

The FOX animated series Krapopolis has its two-episode premiere on September 24, 2023, kicking off the exciting new series. The show was already renewed for seasons 2 and 3 well before season 1 was even finished, meaning that Krapopolis has a bright future ahead of it.\nPete Michels is the supervising director on Krapopolis, with him having previously worked on immensely popular shows like The Simpsons and Family Guy. Andy Ristaino is the lead character designer on Krapopolis, with him having previously worked on fantastic animated series like Adventure Time and the DuckTales reboot. Both Krapopolis crew members attended SCAD AnimationFest 2023, promoting the series by premiering episode 3 early as well as hosting a Q&A panel.\nRelated:Why Dan Harmon's Krapopolis Was Renewed For 3 Seasons Before Its Debut\nScreen Rant sat down with supervising director Pete Michels and lead character designer Andy Ristaino at SCAD AnimationFest 2023 in order to talk about Krapopolis. Michels and Ristaino were able to shed some light on the creation of Krapopolis, the influence of other Dan Harmson shows, and the future of the series.\nScreen Rant: One of the biggest names attached to Krapopolis is Dan Harmon. How did his work on shows like Rick and Morty and the expectation of that kind of content influenced the creation of Krapopolis?\nAndy Ristaino: I feel like that might be more for me. I worked in character design right from the beginning, and one of their main directors was ‘make sure it doesn't look like Rick and Morty.’ That is kind of how it influenced it. So yeah, we went in a different direction, and a little more realistic and a little less cartoony, basically.\nSo part of the art style obviously is the time period. Were there any challenges that came with adapting this specific time period and mythos to the world of an adult animated show?\nAndy Ristaino: Sure. I mean, I feel like it's all like a lot of costume research and time period research and trying to remember what fruits are available.\nPete Michels: We didn't have pumpkins or coffee. Well, we kind of had coffee I guess, but yeah. Also, I think some of the technology was a challenge too. So Dan's all about making sure that the gadgets and things that they create works, like with Rick and Morty, because I worked on Rick and Morty with Dan, and he wanted to make sure anything that Rick would invent could at least look like it could actually work. And the same with everything we do. But we're limited to Bronze Age technologies. So they have, bronze and they have tin and they have leather and wood and rocks, and you know, sheep stomachs.\nAndy Ristaino: So how do you build a flamethrower out of that?\nSo was the historical research a huge part of trying to make things work, or was it just trying to make things believable and cheating things if you felt like it was better for the story?\nAndy Ristaino: I feel like in the beginning there was a lot more historical research than there is now.\nPete Michels: Yeah, well, in design, we didn't do a lot of like, even background is I think a lot of the murals you see on the walls in the palace or the temple. A lot of those are based on Messinian and Minoan actual archeology that we've researched. A lot of our prop designers do. When we give them a challenge, they'll do a lot of the research and look up what something might have looked like or what the technology available was.\nAndy Ristaino: But also the show takes place in that time period before Greek civilization was really established. So we've got a little wiggle room to make stuff up.\nPete Michels: And one of the rules of the show is that they have not yet invented written language. So we can't do any sign gags. It makes it a little challenge. Like, well, we have to somehow identify this building as like a medical office or something. Well how do you do that without saying ‘doctor's office.’\nAnother big aspect of the show is the star-studded cast. So how much of a factor did the stars play in the characters that they were voicing when it comes to the designs and the writing and personality and stuff like that?\nAndy Ristaino: I feel like definitely the characters changed. If they were like, ‘we're trying to cast this person,’ but it fell through, the design would change to match the voice actor. And we do a lot of things where we try to match, like, the ethnicity and stuff to the voice actor. And I feel like that's the main thing.\nPete Michels: And there's also a lot of personality that an actor will bring to the character, and that needs to be reflected in the design too. So if an actor is cast, and it doesn't quite sound like that voice came out of that person than we’ll redesign it.\nAndy Ristaino: Deliria needed to be kind of elegant and look kind of intimidating.\nPete Michels: And the word elegant is key there too. Because even the posing and the boards, you try to get her a little bit more regal there and a little bit more confident. She's really super self-confident.\nWhat skill sets and aspects of previous shows that you've worked on do you think really helped you in developing Krapopolis, and what unique challenges did you face when working on the show?\nPete Michels: I think the most important skill set for working in anything in animation is the drawing. You have to be able to draw. I’ve worked with Dan Harmon before on Rick and Morty, so I kind of knew his sensibilities, what he liked and didn't like. My background is mostly primetime adult animation. So The Simpsons, Family Guy, and Rick and Morty. So I think it's that [there are] certain sensibilities that are in adult animation. Characters don't do cartoony poses, for instance, they don't close their eyes for a long time, or they don't bounce and stretch too much. So making it more like humans in a sitcom, that was kind of a big, big thing to bring to it.\nAndy Ristaino: And I think Pete your were a good bridge to that world for us when we're starting to develop the show, because I feel like when you came on the show things really solidified. I feel like there's this realism and primetime sensibility that really sort of solidified when you started working on the show.\nPete Michels: Yeah, and even background-wise you know, just where to put the horizon line where to put the camera to make it like you're watching a live television show that's actually been shot with cameras and live actors.\nKrapopolis seasons two and three have already been green lit, which is awesome. So where are you both hoping to take the show in the future? And are there any details you can give us about what you have in store for the next two seasons?\nPete Michels: They do meet a lot of new characters in the upcoming seasons and a lot of new locations also.\nAndy Ristaino: Go to a lot of cool places. We visit more gods and stuff.\nPete Michels: A lot more gods. I think you’ve designed like 120 gods or something.\nAndy Ristaino: Yeah, I’ve designed a lot of gods and a lot of creatures and mythological creatures and things that were never mentioned.\nPete Michels: Yeah, and I think those are the fun things too because we do not just the gods and goddesses and the humans, but there's also monsters. [There are] a lot of interesting monsters that animation lends itself to that were just really fun to do and fun to draw.\nSet in mythical ancient Greece, Krapopolis tells the story of a dysfunctional family of humans, gods and monsters trying to run one of the world’s first cities, while also trying their best to not kill each other in the process. The series features the voices of Emmy Award-winner Hannah Waddingham (Ted Lasso, Game of Thrones), Richard Ayoade (The IT Crowd), Matt Berry (What We Do in The Shadows), Pam Murphy (Mapleworth Murders) and Duncan Trussell (The Midnight Gospel).\nNew episodes of Krapopolis release Sundays on FOX.\nRobert Pitman is a Movies/TV features writer for ScreenRant and loves all things nerdy.

The revelations of the character's Inhuman heritage, alongside her death and resurrection as a mutant, has made Kamala Khan a perfect conduit for stories about identity.\nMs. Marvel: The New Mutant #2 – written by Iman Vellani and Sabir Pirzada, with art by Carlos Gomez and Adam Gorham – places great emphasis on how deeply being a mutant has become tied to Kamala's identity.\nTaking a moment of solace with Marvel's newest married couple, Iron Man and Emma Frost, Kamala reflects on herself as, \"walking proof that we can all coexist.\"\nRelated: MCU's Iman Vellani Reveals New Ms. Marvel Comic Came to Her in a Dream\nDespite the immense controversy it sparked, Marvel continues to commit to the decision to incorporate the mutant gene into Kamala Khan's DNA, alongside her Inhuman roots, while making the newest X-Men member. Among all these changes, Kamala tries to adjust to the public perception of Ms. Marvel souring upon her reveal as a mutant, at a time when mutant-human relations are at an all-time low. In Ms. Marvel: The New Mutant #2, after saving her from an Orchis attack, Tony Stark brings Kamala Khan to meet with his new bride, Emma Frost. During the exchange that follows, Kamala effectively states why she is so critical to the contemporary Marvel Universe.\nEmma Frost cautions the young hero, suggesting that waving her newfound mutant flag proudly is dangerous. This fires Kamala up, leading her to wonders if she didn't go public enough, convinced that she's living proof that people from differing backgrounds should be able to live freely in the same space. \"I'm a Pakistani-American-Inhu-Mutant,\" she shouts proudly. \"I'm literally walking proof that we can all coexist!\" Although Frost quickly shuts down Kamala's idealism, her rant goes a long way in highlighting how becoming a mutant has added to her character. Kamala's story, at its core, has always been about her learning to become comfortable in her own skin.\nEarly in Ms. Marvel's original debut origin run, from G. Willow Wilson, Kamala would take the form of a white woman – specifically Carol Danvers, the previous Ms. Marvel – because, as she put it in Ms. Marvel #3, she didn't think anyone would want to see \"a sixteen-year-old brown girl with a 9 PM curfew\" as a superhero. Subsequently, her stories have always had the core theme of identity, with Kamala growing comfortable with herself over time. Who Kamala is today is someone who would rather change the minds of others than accept discrimination. Being a mutant is just another addition to the identity of an already multi-faceted character.\nWhen the decision to make Kamala a mutant was first announced, there was a concern that the character was being pulled into too many directions; traditionally, however the character has always represented a lot. The mutant metaphor is just another means for writers to give readers a more realistic depiction of a person of color navigating through America. The mutant identity is another way to amplify the more realistic narrative of Muslim identity, as well as the complexities behind Kamala's larger identity. Just as the Ms. Marvel name has belonged to multiple people in the past, Kamala Khan herself consists of multiple identities, all of which encompass who she is and how she approaches life.\nJoe Anthony Myrick (or JAM) is a comics writer who specializes in, of course, covering the big figureheads of the industry (Marvel and DC), as well as lesser-known indy parties and some personal favorites like BOOM!

{"title": "Wes Anderson's Poison: How Venomous The Krait Snake Really Is", "date": "2023-10-02 19:33:24", "text": "A deadly krait snake is at the heart of Wes Anderson's film Poison, but how big a threat would it actually pose to Benedict Cumberbatch's Harry?\nIn Wes Anderson's short movie Poison, Benedict Cumberbatch finds himself in hot water due to a venomous krait snake coiled on his stomach ― but it's unclear if the venomous reptile really spells a death sentence. Poison is the final Dahl adaptation in Wes Anderson's short Netflix film series, and the others in the series featured Dahl's characteristic dramatic claims, both fanciful and nasty; for instance, licorice being made out of rats' blood in The Rat Catcher. While Anderson's Poison features a real type of snake, its danger might not match reality.\nCumberbatch's Poison character Harry Pope, a British man in colonial India, begins the movie trapped in bed, telling his friend Woods (Dev Patel) he has been lying entirely still for \"hours and hours\" so as not to wake the krait asleep on him. Woods is immediately alarmed, jumping backward, and rescuer Dr. Ganderbai (Ben Kingsley) also sees the situation as very grave, even confessing the snake bite serum he has might not save Harry's life. It's clear in the extreme tension between the men, and particularly in Harry's sweaty state of panic, that in the movie kraits are notorious for being extremely dangerous.\nPoison's Harry, Woods, and Ganderbai are right to be worried. Krait bites kill an estimated 70-80% of untreated victims in Bangladesh, the now-independent nation where Anderson's movie is hinted to be set thanks to the trademark jute crops on screen. Kraits live in rural Asia and can bite when startled or threatened. In Bangladesh, the common krait is \"responsible for more than half of all snakebite deaths,\" reports the journal Toxicon: X in the National Library of Medicine. It continues that victims experience pain and paralysis, with death occurring between four and eight hours after the bite:\nSnake biting is a major public health concern in Bangladesh... The common krait (B. caeruleus) is one of the 'big four' snake's species and it has been responsible for one of the most human deaths and injuries from snakebites in Bangladesh and India. Typically, victims report acute stomach pains that worsen over time, followed by gradual paralysis.\nThe Wes Anderson movie's description of kraits is fairly accurate, then. Dr. Ganderbai warns his serum might not save Harry, and antivenom has limited effect in reality, too ― though this is more because it is often administered much too late, owing to victims in rural areas being without easy hospital access. The journal warns that once paralysis has set in, the situation is \"catastrophic\" no matter the treatment. It makes sense that Dahl would know to take kraits' danger seriously, as he trained as a World War II fighter pilot in Iraq, which borders Iran, one of the nations where the snakes live.\nWhile krait snakes really are very dangerous, Poison's ending focuses on another kind of venom altogether. The reptile, whether it was ever really there or wholly imagined, is not the real source of the Netflix film's titular poison. That's actually Harry himself, with the film's toxicity embedded in his racism, attitude of superiority, and interactions with Dr. Ganderbai. Harry keeps his racism coiled like the creature he thinks is on his stomach, acting irritable and dismissive but under control, until a moment of tension so unbearable that it springs out of him — with a snake-like rattling even heard on screen.\nHarry's racist tirade against Ganderbai is not only a betrayal, but also shows viewers that the anxious tension that infuses the men's interactions throughout the short movie isn't merely around the snake, but about power. Harry feels \"superior\" to Ganderbai but is suddenly not in control, trapped in bed and feeling threatened and cornered. The unseen snake is a phantom that haunts the men's interactions, like the racial dynamics of colonial India. Woods apologizes to Ganderbai at the end of the Wes Anderson film on Harry's behalf — but both he and Ganderbai know many more snakes are lying in wait to spring at them.\nSource: Toxicon: X\nJen is a British journalist who moved to Canada, mostly for the poutine.

{"title": "Inception Star Reflects On Wild First Day On Set With Practical Effects Rig", "date": "2023-10-02 19:39:04", "text": "Cillian Murphy reflects on his wild first day on the set of Inception, which included a scene with Leonardo DiCaprio and a big practical effects rig.\nInception star Cillian Murphy reflects on his exciting first day on the set of the Christopher Nolan film, which included a massive practical effects rig. Released in 2010, Nolan's mind-bending thriller stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb, a thief who uses dream-sharing technology to undertake a mission that will finally reunite him with his children. Murphy stars in the movie as Robert Fischer, Cobb's target, with the project serving as the third time Murphy and Nolan have collaborated.\nIn a recent interview with BBC Radio 1, Murphy takes a look back at the big movies of his career, reflecting on one memorable Inception filming experience.\nAs the actor recalls, he filmed one of his most involved and important scenes on the first day, which included a tilting set. Check out Murphy's full comment below:\n\n“I remember that day was my first day on set. It was this big scene with Leo, biggest movie star in the world, someone I have huge admiration for. I walked on and that whole bar had been built on a huge gimbal in order to get the effect of the glass tilting. The whole thing, this huge set, just went like that [tilts hands]. And there were all these stuntmen. I knew I was making a serious movie there.”\n\n“I remember that day was my first day on set.

And there were all these stuntmen. I knew I was making a serious movie there.”\nRelatively early on his career, Nolan became known as a filmmaker who highly valued practical effects and a more old-school style of filmmaking. The director's love of practical action is on clear display in his Dark Knight trilogy, and has only become more legendary with each passing film. Oppenheimer, his latest release, even recreates a nuclear explosion with no CGI, with practical elements layered with VFX to create the blast.\nNolan takes this same approach with Inception, with much of the film's action standing the test of time because of the more old-school way in which it was captured. While certain sequences in the film do rely on VFX, many are impressively real, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's hallway fight, for example, being filmed inside a constructed hallway that could rotate 360 degrees.\nThe practical action in the movie compliments a genuinely novel idea, with the notion of a dream heist being something that is truly original. That's not to mention the fact that Inception's ending scene is deliciously ambiguous, generating conversations and theories that persist to this day. While Inception has ebbed and flowed in terms of its position in Nolan's larger filmography, the film remains a testament to the director's vision and talent, and Murphy's latest recollection further speaks to the impact the filmmaker's approach has on the actors involved.\nSource: BBC Radio 1/ YouTube\n"}
{"title": "Hughie & The Boys Are The Show's Real Villains After Gen V's Most Tragic Story", "date": "2023-10-02 19:40:28", "text": "Gen V’s most tragic story highlights the impact of Hughie Campbell and The Boys’ actions, suggesting they could be the show’s real villains.\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for Gen V.\nGen V focuses on young Supes aspiring to be heroes, and its most tragic story highlights how Hughie Campbell and his companions could be the real villains of The Boys. So far, Gen V is doing a great job of expanding The Boys universe. However, it may also prove that the main show's heroes aren't as heroic as they seem. While it's pretty obvious that the actions of Billy Butcher and even Hughie fall into morally gray territory, they're still portrayed as the good guys trying to take down Vought International and Homelander.\nIn their efforts to rid the world of Supe corruption, the main group that goes by \"The Boys\" manages to kill the likes of Translucent and even unravel The Seven. Taking on Homelander is a task too difficult, even with the help of Compound V, but they do succeed in exposing his true colors to the public. Their methods aren't always ethical, even if The Boys are usually trying to do the right thing. And Gen V doesn't necessarily suggest otherwise. However, it shows the fallout of the group exposing how Compound V works, and it's pretty catastrophic for Gen V's young Supes.\nIn The Boys season 2, Hughie and Starlight manage to leak Compound V to the press, letting the whole world know how it works. Their revelation is made much darker through the lens of Gen V. In The Boys, exposing Vought's secret about how Supes are made is seen as a huge victory. The team gives away Vought's biggest secret: that their Supes' abilities come from this chemical. The company works with parents to give the serum to children. The Boys' Gen V spinoff shows how kids react to their parents allowing them to be injected — and it has a detrimental effect on some of them.\nRELATED: Gen V's Surprise The Boys Cameo Secretly Confirms A Major Hughie Theory\nGen V's Godolkin University grants aspiring Supes the chance to perfect their powers, but despite its tagline, it's not a safe place to do so. The Godolkin Dean reveals there were barely any suicides after the Hughie and Starlight's revelation, disregarding the few that occurred as nothing serious. While this may not be a big deal to the Dean, the leak was clearly so traumatic to some students that they took their own lives. Golden Boy's brother, Sam, also struggles with this now-public secret, which may have contributed to him ending up in the Woods. Revealing the truth about Compound V may have hurt Vought, but it also hurt kids.\nHughie and Starlight make the decision to expose the secret of Compound V in The Boys, but it arguably isn't their place to do so. It's important for people to know the truth, as it shows that Vought is exploiting children to have them become heroes. However, it also reveals that parents consented to this. Making this public knowledge was always going to have consequences. When all the Supe kids learn that their parents lied to them, they deal with emotional trauma. The degree of this is explored in Gen V, which starts to paint Hughie and The Boys as villains.\nRELATED: The Boys Season 3 Finally Resolved 1 Annoying Hughie Storyline\nFor some people, knowing the truth may be a good thing, but for others, it completely destroys their lives. Sam is the most obvious example of this. Given how much Starlight resents her own mother after finding out the truth, she perhaps should have taken more caution before going public. Starlight's reaction to Hughie taking Compound V also makes them grow further apart and damages their relationship, showing the impact the drug has even among The Boys.\nThe Boys never shies away from showing the consequences of the characters' actions. One of the most notorious examples is Supersonic's death. Starlight warns him about Homelander's true nature and even tries to get the other Supe involved in taking down The Seven's lead. To teach Starlight a lesson, Homelander delivers Supersonic a brutal death. This incident makes it clear that The Boys won't let even its most heroic characters off the hook. Therefore, The Boys season 4 must show the impact of the characters' actions surrounding Compound V, much like Gen V is already doing.\nWhether it is through a crossover with Gen V's characters or by publicly revealing the impact of Hughie and Starlight's announcement, The Boys' protagonists must see the impact of what they've done. The realization that they've hurt young Supes would likely upset Starlight and Hughie, perhaps making them rethink their battle with Vought — or maybe making them double down on stopping those responsible. There will be plenty of twists in The Boys season 4, and the addition of Gen V makes things even more unpredictable. How much the show leans into the main group being the villains is unknown, but The Boys must face the consequences of their actions.\nBackground\n\nBorn in Glasgow Scotland, Kyle is a passionate journalist who has a keen interest in TV and film.

Paul Rudd debuted in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Scott Lang in 2015's Ant-Man, with the movie revealing that Scott was a thief before he became one of the MCU's most beloved heroes. By the time Ant-Man's post-credits scene teased Captain America: Civil War, Scott had already fully become a hero; however, Ant-Man showed that Scott's criminal ties were very much alive at the start of the film, with Rudd's character trying to rob Hank Pym's house.\nInsider showed safe technician Charlie Santore Ant-Man's heist scene, letting the expert give his review of 2015's Ant-Man.\nSantore was not very impressed with Scott Lang's heist sequence in the MCU movie, with the real-life safecracker pointing out several flaws in Ant-Man's depiction of how Scott got into Hank Pym's vault. According to the specialist, the movie's errors include Scott taking a fingerprint off a door with the use of tape and the character freezing the vault door to crack it apart. As Ant-Man used a real safecracking tool — the StrongArm MiniRig — Santore rated the scene a 3/10. Check out the full quote below:\n\"He's taken the fingerprint off the door with tape. It could have been the cleaning lady's print that he pulled off of there. This actually broke my head a little bit. If you pull the print off with tape, and you turn it over and put a ring on it, and put Loctite in it aren't you actually making it a cast of the invert of the fingerprint?\nCarbondale's a made-up name, but the vault door itself, I looked through hundreds and hundreds of photos of vault doors, and I'm pretty certain that the art directors based this off a very early Diebold vault door. This is actually a real tool. This is a StrongArm MiniRig that's used for putting pressure when one's drilling. So that aspect of it is definitely accurate. We'll go do a quick job that winds up being something where you don't have your full tool kit with you. So there's lots of times when we've been running around trying to bend wires and make tools and sort of have to come up with something that we didn't have with us.\nSupposedly he's freezing it, and it's going to expand and crack this door apart. What they showed us was the bolt work inside of the safe and the door pan. There's a big door pan. If he poured a gallon of water in there, it would spill out the bottom of the door pan, basically. If by chance he froze it and the ice expanded, I mean, obviously water can expand. Glaciers expand over time. The thing about a vault door is, in this case, there's a thin back panel that's like sheet metal essentially on the back of the door. So the idea that that's going to expand is pure fantasy. It would blow the back of the panel off before it blew the door off.\nI opened up a couple of safes that were at a Blockbuster Video a while and there was Astroglide, condoms, and some dirty photos. So I don't know if a manager was having a fling with somebody, but that was pretty unexpected. On the more valuable side of things, we once opened a safe in an affluent part of Beverly Hills that people had recently moved into a home. The former owner was gone. There were Bulgari necklaces, Cartier necklaces, Krugerrands, GIA certificates. I mean, I can only imagine that it must have been a mid-to-high-six-figure lick. But I think that people get traumatized when there's that much left because they're not expecting to have a moral conflict, sort of.

However, the character was a very good thief in the MCU. Scott found success in many of his heists, including one at the Avengers Compound in Ant-Man. While the character was a convicted thief before Pym selected him to don his Ant-Man suit and become the new bearer of the Ant-Man mantle, that doesn't mean that Scott only failed in his criminal life.\nScott has been shown to be a smart character, making him a master thief, as Rudd's hero has a great mixture of athletic abilities, as well as knowledge of chemistry and hacking, which help him pull off heists. However, Scott got caught when trying to rob Hank Pym's home, though that ultimately led to him becoming a reformed hero. While Scott has failed as a thief a few times in the MCU, that does not mean that can't be successful if there are high stakes involved.\nThat is why Kang the Conqueror made Scott steal his Multiversal Engine Core back in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, knowing that the hero would deliver if his daughter's life was at risk. Scott was successful, showing that he can be a good thief when needed. Thankfully, his life has taken a turn away from his criminal past, with Scott now being a beloved Avenger — even being chosen to write a book about the events of Avengers: Endgame — and founding X-Con Security Consultants, which sees Scott move away from his past as a thief to now spearhead a security company, showing his growth since the first Ant-Man.\nSource: Insider\n"}
{"title": "Every Pumpkinhead Movie, Ranked", "date": "2023-10-02 19:50:28", "text": "While each of the Pumpkinhead films has its charms, the monster movie franchise's horror outings do differ in terms of quality and watchability.\nWhile the Pumpkinhead film franchise features a terrifying horror villain, not all the sequels are as interesting as their title character, making some of the movies stand out as better than others. Special effects legend Stan Winston made his directorial debut in 1988 with the supernatural horror movie Pumpkinhead. The original movie and the three sequels comprise this underrated horror movie franchise follow the story of the titular demon, a monstrous figure summoned by a grieving father. Pumpkinhead’s antihero wants revenge on teens who killed his son in a hit-and-run but regrets summoning the beast when he sees the bloody chaos that Pumpkinhead can wreak.\nA possible Pumpkinhead remake has been rumored for years, but it still hasn’t happened. As a result, there are currently only four installments in the Pumpkinhead franchise that wavered in quality. The first movie was released in 1988 and proved a minor box office flop, grossing only $4.5 million on a budget of $3 million. Despite its lack of success in theaters plus some weak reviews, Pumpkinhead gained a sequel six years later in the form of Pumpkinhead 2: Blood Wings. Like its titular monster, the franchise then lay dormant. In 2006, the belated sequel Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes continued its story, while 2007’s Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud ended the series.\nRelated: 10 Movie Monsters From The 80s Ranked By Toughness\nIt is hard to fault the 2007 TV movie Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud for ambition. Rather than phoning it in and offering another simplistic revenge story that copies the beats of the original movie, this fourquel instead opted to incorporate the real-life Hatfield and McCoy feud into the Pumpkinhead series. However, like the later installments of the Alien franchise whose eponymous monsters Stan Winston also helped design, Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud fell apart as its sprawling story got too big for its own good. The battle between the families is engaging and Pumpkinhead looks great, but the connective tissue just isn’t there.\nAs a result, Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud is effectively two passable movies that only occasionally intersect and become something good. One is a grisly Western tragedy about star-crossed lovers from feuding families while the other is a gruesome supernatural horror movie that wants to showcase its famous monster. There are some memorable kills in Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud, which proves that even the weakest outings of the franchise have something to offer. Lance Henriksen’s Ed Harley also shows up for a cameo, although his role is far smaller than it was in 2006’s Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes. Thanks to a downbeat ending, this is the least essential of the series.\nLike the Child’s Play movies, another slasher franchise that survived from the late ‘80s into the ‘90s, the Pumpkinhead movies didn’t prioritize their villain’s backstory until the sequels started. In Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings, Pumpkinhead gains a deformed son in the sweet Tommy, who is swiftly killed off by some of the most monstrous bullies in movie history. While it is undeniably satisfying to see these villains get torn to shreds when Tommy is revived in the form of Pumpkinhead, the unrelenting bleakness of Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings makes this sequel a tough watch.\nThe sequel’s antagonists are so inhumane that it is tough to care about their fates, making this a lesser entry in the series. Fortunately, some creative kills ensure this isn’t a complete waste of time. While other direct-to-video horror sequels feature innumerable sequels that fail to justify their existence, the trim runtime of Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings and its nasty gore make the movie worth a watch. However, the rest of the series has stronger character work.\nBy rights, Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes should have been a disaster. For one thing, it is a made-for-television sequel released around the same time as cheap, in-name-only cash-ins like Lake Placid 2. For another, its director, Jake West, was previously best known for low-budget British horror comedies. Despite these limitations, Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes is a gory joy. Not only does the original movie’s Lance Henriksen return as Ed Harley, but he is also joined by horror royalty Ed Bradley. The Hellraiser franchise villain plays a bizarre anti-villain in the form of Doc Fraser, an amoral mortician who is caught harvesting the organs of the dead.\nUnfortunately for Fraser, he made the mistake of carrying out his crimes in the same small town where the original Pumpkinhead hero Ed Harley once lived. Soon enough, Harley is revived as Pumpkinhead and the original movie’s hero becomes the killer in this sequel. Since Fraser has to go on a bloody murder spree of his own to cover his tracks, this sequel is an unusually morally ambiguous spin on the franchise’s simple plotting. Fraser is no one’s hero, and Harley’s take on Pumpkinhead is comparatively morally justified in his actions, making the story of Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes a gory fun time that also plays with the franchise’s formula.\nThe original Pumpkinhead is by no means perfect, but it is still the strongest horror movie in the series so far. Lance Henriksen gives a stellar central performance as a grieving father who will go to any lengths to avenge his son’s death, and the tragedy of his loss means that Pumpkinhead’s slow-burn revenge story feels earned. In many ways, the opening half of Pumpkinhead plays out like a more vengeful spin on Stephen King’s Pet Sematary, as a parent’s grief drives them to unimaginable extremes. However, once the kills start, the franchise’s real selling point becomes obvious.\nWhile every sequel gives Pumpkinhead plenty of screen time, the monster is never more effective than he is in his big-screen debut. Pumpkinhead builds up to its big reveal slowly and, when Stan Winston’s creature is finally unveiled, the movie has the confidence to show off the beast in numerous lengthy set-pieces. Where many horror movies shy away from this approach, the original Pumpkinhead proves that a great monster can withstand plenty of time terrorizing viewers onscreen without diluting its scare factor. As a result, Pumpkinhead remains the best film in the franchise to date thanks to its unique combination of tragic horror drama and pure monster movie chills.\n"}
{"title": "Broadway Legends Talk Writing For Steve Martin On Only Murders In The Building", "date": "2023-10-02 20:00:27", "text": "Benj Pasek, Justin Paul, Marc Shaiman, and Scott Wittman dive deep into “Which of the Pickwick Triplets Did It?” from Only Murders season 3.\nOnly Murders in the Building season 3 has brought fun musical flair to the true crime comedy, with a number of standout pieces like “Look for the Light” that would sound at home in any real-world Broadway show. The song with the biggest story impact, however, is “Which of the Pickwick Triplets Did It?”, the tongue-twisting patter song Charles-Hayden Savage (Steve Martin) is set to perform in the in-show musical Death Rattle. The piece keeps sending Savage to “the White Room”, which begins to strain his relationship with Oliver Putnam (Martin Short).\nWith a musical at the heart of Only Murders in the Building season 3, the songs had to hold up to Broadway standards. That’s why Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the award-winning writers behind Dear Evan Hansen and The Greatest Showman, were hired to write or co-write nearly every song the season, including “Which of the Pickwick Triplets Did It?” For that song, however, they enlisted two more Broadway legends in Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, who wrote Hairspray. Pasek, Paul, Shaiman, and Wittman even wrote songs for the beloved NBC series Smash.\nRelated: Does Meryl Streep Really Sing In Only Murders In The Building? Her Song With Ashley Park Explained\nBenj Pasek, Justin Paul, Marc Shaiman, and Scott Wittman dove deep into the making of “Which of the Pickwick Triplets Did It?” in a fun conversation with Screen Rant. Note: This interview was conducted during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, and the show covered here would not exist without the labor of the writers and actors in both unions. This interview has also been lightly edited for clarity and length.\nScreen Rant: I realized you all have worked on the same project in Smash, which I used to watch week to week and was crazy about, but had you ever [actually] collaborated other than just being involved in the same general thing?\nScott Wittman: No, we didn’t even meet them on Smash. We were all in separate worlds.\nBenj Pasek: But I do know that they were the nice people who allowed us to get the job on Smash, and that was our first TV job ever. I don't know if I've ever said this to you guys, but I hear that you guys were listening and that you approved our song, or whatever. So, they're the reasons why we got our first television show.\nJustin Paul: We had to jump through their hoops to be able to be approved.\nScott Wittman: We did recommend them. I remember saying, “You should get these young whippersnappers.”\nBenj Pasek: Justin and I have loved Marc and Scott forever. We’ve just been fans, and Smash was a huge, huge opportunity for us. It was the first time, honestly, we ever had a song on television, so it was huge for us. But we have just been fans for a really long time and have always wanted to play in the same sandbox, and never thought that we would ever get the opportunity to do so. And then this became an amazing opportunity to do so.\nDoes that mean that, Justin and Benj, that you got them involved in Only Murders?\nJustin Paul: The way that it came about was all this crazy lovely serendipity, which was [that] we went to college with a lovely woman named Sas Goldberg and she and Benj were together--it happened to be at the same place--on vacation. They were just having a conversation and she was like, “When I get back, I'm going back into the writers’ room. I'm joining, this season, the writers’ room for Only Murders in the Building.” He was like, “Oh my gosh, we're huge fans of that show.” And, saying it in Benj’s typical way of just trying to create a path where there isn't one, he was like, “If there's ever a song, if you need a ditty or something…”\nBenj Pasek: I was hawking our wares.\nJustin Paul: And there was no music in the show, necessarily. There was no plot of any of this, but it was like, \"If you ever need something, we will do it. We love this show. We live on the Upper West Side.\" He was just hawking our credentials of why we should be part of Only Murders in the Building.\nBenj Pasek: Then she called back literally a week later and she's like, \"So, not only do they might want a song, but the entire plot around the season hinges upon a fictional musical. I brought up that you guys might be interested in working on it, and they were like, 'Great!’” So, it was very serendipitous in that way. We knew that there were going to be a couple of song moments, and we honestly just used the moment [for] getting to work with some of our favorite folks. [We asked Marc and Scott] knowing the beautiful reciprocity of the gift that they gave us on Smash, but also, we have always wanted to work with Marc and Scott on something. We're such huge fans; this seemed like such a fun opportunity to get to collaborate.\nJustin Paul: We sort of knew this was a great chance to work with some of our favorite writers and our favorite musical theater idols because we can go to them and say, \"Hey, do you want to work with us writing a song for Steve Martin?\" or, \"Do you want to come along and write a song with us for Meryl Streep?\" So, there was that built in. This is a fun show, [and there’s] a great spirit of collaboration on the show itself. It's all about Broadway. They're getting the best people on Broadway; half of them are already on the show, but it's going to be a whole thing about Broadway. There was going to be an episode about a sitzprobe and about curtain coming down.\nIt's so crazy to us that there’s a TV show on now with these guys and Selena Gomez that's centering all around Broadway this season, and so we were like, \"Why don't we continue that spirit? Let's bring along some of our favorite friends.\" These gentlemen kindly said yes to us, even though they were highly skeptical of what the heck that was going to look like. Maybe skeptical of us, I don't know, but they kindly said, \"Yes, let's get in a room and see what the heck happens.\"\nMarc Shaiman: As you can tell from Justin's last speech, the idea of getting a word in edgewise just seemed like... “How will we write together?” But the truth is, we got together and the four of us started writing lyrics in the most fantastic way--the same way Scott and I do it, and obviously the same way that Justin and Benj do it. We were just the four of us throwing out stuff. Usually, I'm very good at remembering. \"I wrote that. I wrote that,\" on things, which is obnoxious. I do remember those things, but in this case, I can look at the lyric and go, \"I think, but I'm not sure.\" We were all just going at it equally, and it was just fantastic.\nScott Wittman: Because we had never written with anyone else--except for Bette Midler a few times where we wrote songs with her--I really felt like getting in a room was like taking all our clothes off together. So, we did that, and it worked out well.\nLogistically, how did you start the song? Was it just lyrics and rhythm stuff? I imagine you don't necessarily need a piano to get started on this kind of thing.\nScott Wittman: Well, everything starts with a story, so we worked from the script and an outline of what the character was, and what the plot of the mystery was. So, we started with Pickwicks and that has a lot of alliteration; that was the beginning of it, I think.\nBenj Pasek: We worked really collaboratively with John Hoffman (Only Murders in the Building co-creator) who was really trying to hone in on, “What is the idea, specifically, of this patter song?” Even the fact that it was going to be a patter song and that the plot hinged around having a really tough song to be able to sing was then a fun challenge for us of, “How do we then reverse-engineer something that would feel like a challenge to be able to perform?” And then, as Scott is saying, “How do we make that incredibly alliterative,” or “How do we allow it to be complex and tongue twisty and all of that?” And that began to inform our process.\nThen, honestly, the four of us were just in a room starting with lyric first. The first line that we wrote was, \"Which of the Pickwick triplets did it?\" And then it's like, \"Okay. What rhymes with ‘did it’?\" It’s like having a flashlight and you can only see a little bit in front of you, and things get revealed, and everyone just is piping up and contributing different ideas, and slowly but surely we got a little bit further down the path together.\nSo much was made of Steve Martin's character not being able to do this throughout the season. How was it when he actually got the song? Is it as much of a challenge as it's made out to be?\nScott Wittman: A challenge to sing? Yes. I think he really loved the song and I think he was very happy when he was done with it; a combination of the two. But he worked extremely hard. I mean, it was hard. It was a lot of pre-records and singing live, and he had to wrap his tongue around all those vowels. So yes.\nI was going to ask if the vocals were recorded live [for the one that was in the show], or if that was pre-record. Or was it a mix? \nJustin Paul: It's a little bit of a mix. Well, what ended up in the TV broadcast is a little bit of a mix. Typically, you're going to go in with a pre-record; that is the plan. What’s actually amazing is that number… I can't remember what caused the delay, but some days got pushed and stuff, and so they ended up having like two or three hours to shoot that number in what was supposed to be a whole day shoot, or something like that. Of course, of all the numbers that get squeezed like that, it's like, “Really? This one?” So it’s that much more impressive when you watch Steve execute it, knowing that he was literally under the gun.\nScott Wittman: It was adorable, too, because Marty had wrapped, and Meryl had wrapped, and they all stayed to watch Steve do it. It was really sweet. It’s a lovely group up there. They really enjoy each other.\nEven watching the show, it seems like that's kind of the energy, which is great.\nScott Wittman: And in my whole life in show business, this is one of the only things we wrote that there were no notes from anyone.\nMarc Shaiman: That's true. I don't know if you've seen the video; the guys have posted some of it. We made a video of just us reciting the lyrics, with Justin and I just playing a little bit, and they just kind of went, \"Yeah, that's it.\"\nJustin Paul: Well, we worked hard on it guys. I think that was hopefully due to the good work that we all did together and also really careful plotting from John in the writer's room. They knew how they wanted to use the song. We had so much direction. I think another thing about the writing process that was so fun for us was [that] I feel like a lot of what we did was reverse engineering, so just sitting around thinking \"What are the most delicious pairings of murder and infanthood? And what are fun rhymes of an investigation and babies? How can we pair these things up?” It was really, in the best way, the one-upmanship of, like, \"What about this?” “Oh no, we can add one more rhyme in there.” Then, once we had all those assembled, \"Okay, this is our arsenal here. How do we put these to use in creating a song?”\nAnd there were some things where we were like, \"This is so good, but we can't squeeze it in.\" But a lot of it was really loving. A patter song… this is sort of a puzzle anyway, so it was really [about] identifying some of our favorite pieces and then putting them together. It was like, \"How zany can we be? How far can we go?\" In video that Marc is talking about, if you listen closely, you'll hear us say, \"Will the baby get fried for matricide?\" We did get one note, and the note was, \"I don't think we want to put on the broadcast the image of an infant and an electric chair, so we're going to say, ‘Will the baby get tried’,\" Which was equally fitting and makes sense to a courtroom and a case and a murder. They didn't want to evoke electrifying a young toddler.\nProps for getting the word “triptych” in a song, too.\nMarc Shaiman: I know. We were all thrilled. We literally were dancing with joy that we figured that one out.\nWas there anything you used as a reference in terms of great patter songs that you wanted to keep in mind as you were writing?\nBenj Pasek: I'm sure lingering all of our heads is “Modern Major General” in some way. I don't know that you can ever escape it, just because it looms large in the pantheon of great patter songs.\nScott Wittman: I'd say Gilbert and Sullivan.\nBenj Pasek: Gilbert and Sullivan or some Lerner and Loewe stuff. I don't know; I think we didn't reference anything directly. I think we all love classic Broadway show tunes as well, so just having a really similar pool of references to draw, even if we didn’t name them… We sort of all identified the same kind of style that we thought it should be in.\nMarc Shaiman: And Scott and I were often told, \"That song is too wordy.\" We do like writing wordy songs. Sometimes, on some shows, we've even been told, \"It's so wordy that the audience will tune out.\" In this case, it was nice to be encouraged to embrace it.\nBenj Pasek: And the moment that was engineered was really about paying attention to the lyric. What was so great about how John and the writers set up the song was that the audience is really invested in, “Can he say these lyrics?” So, it's not something where you're distracted by other stage pictures that are going on, or other things that are happening that are going to detract. It allowed us to put as much dexterity and complicated internal rhyme as possible because the audience's only job, really, is to follow whether or not Charles-Hayden Savage can actually nail the patter song. It really allowed us to maximize that element of it.\nScott Wittman: It created an earworm long before they actually heard it, so that's sort of fun too. I think that the audience enjoyed that.\nMarc Shaiman: And then there’s Steve's performance. I was there that day and had to leave because they kept pushing it back. I couldn't believe I had sat there all day [only to have to leave], but that's typical on a movie or TV. So, I only saw him for the first time in that full version that they put out online. He's just so adorable. It was just a thrill.\nJustin Paul: I wasn't able to be there either. I remember texting with some of the music team, and they were like, \"I don't know what we're going to do, because we're only going to have maybe two hours to get this whole thing.\" Of all the songs in the season, it was intentionally the most challenging of all of the songs [and] of all the moments, and so we were like, \"How are we going to shortchange this?\" But it wasn't shortchanged.\nAt least [for] the folks on the music team, no one had ever seen him perform it. No one had seen him do what he was going to do, so everything that he broke out, all these crazy hand motions and his entire iteration of that song and that performance… I don't think anyone had ever seen before. That's just what he did on the day when cameras were rolling. It is… I say this about the performance, not the song: his performance is iconic. It really is.\nScott Wittman: I was there. He attacked it straight on. It was all in one take too, most of it.\nI love the way that it's presented in the show. It’s played in full and then there are these shots of everyone else trying to solve the murder as [the song is] happening. Did you know that it was going to be presented in that way, and from start to finish? Because I feel like that is rare even in shows that feature musicals; usually there are cut points and things like that.\nScott Wittman: It’s hard to cut away from that song though, because you'd lose the engine. It would stall on the track.\nMarc Shaiman: It was just pleasing to see, \"Oh my god, it's all in there.\" Because yeah, we are used to [projects where] eventually something gets cut or lost. It was also great that they did it as it is on the episode with all the other things going on. Nowadays it's so great that they can also present just him, so that there are these two versions to take in. It's very satisfying.\nScott Wittman: On Smash, we used to learn that if we kept changing keys, they couldn't cut.\nIt doesn't necessarily sound like it, but Steve Martin is such an accomplished musician as well. Did he have any input or suggestions with this at all?\nMarc Shaiman: No. He never said anything like, \"Could that be a C# minor instead of this?\" or anything like that. I think he felt it was enough to just learn the song and be able to perform it. And then we had the evil Ian co-producing the vocal. I never saw anything like Ian--never. I thought I’m something when I'm working with a singer, [like], “Try it again. Try it this way,” knowing that you can comp a vocal and take the best of this and that, but I never saw anything like this. But Steve Martin was incredibly patient and would just try anything any of us suggested. He was like, \"No, no, no. Give me a line reading. Sing it to me the way you think.\" And he would just try it, like, eight different ways. It was phenomenal. He's Steve Martin.\nWho orchestrated this? Because the orchestration is beautiful.\nJustin Paul: The orchestrator was an incredibly talented fellow named August Eriksmoen, who we've worked with before. What's great about August is that his style diversity is really off the chart. Even in our own work, he's done some more contemporary stuff and he's done a lot of classic Broadway kind of stuff, so his abilities really run the gamut. The first time that I saw this chart, I was like, \"Okay, this is going to be [great.]\"\nHe was like, \"Can I go there?\" and we're like, \"Yes, you have to go there.\" We’re so grateful that the show, the network, the studio, [and] everybody really committed to, “We want to make this feel like a big Broadway musical.” You watch on screen and [there’s] that set that they built at United Palace, [we had] an orchestra that was a really nice-sized orchestra record, and got the proper time to do it. It was onscreen an ode to Broadway, and a love letter to Broadway, but offscreen it was as well, from getting Broadway songwriters, to orchestrator, to the orchestra, to doing it the right way. It felt really beautiful that there was such a love and respect for how things get done on Broadway.\nSeason three of “Only Murders in the Building” finds Charles, Oliver & Mabel (played by Steve Martin, Martin Short & Selena Gomez) investigating a murder behind the scenes of a Broadway show. Ben Glenroy (Paul Rudd) is a Hollywood action star whose Broadway debut is cut short by his untimely death. Aided by co-star Loretta Durkin (Meryl Streep), our trio embarks on their toughest case yet, all while director Oliver desperately attempts to put his show back together.

Debuting in the Top 10 most-watched movies on Netflix in many countries, including the U.S., Love Is in the Air follows chief pilot Dana (Delta Goodrem) as she deals with William (Joshua Sasse), ITCM Financial’s advisor from the UK. William ventures to Fullerton in a bid to shut Dana’s family company down. However, seeing the work Dana, Jeff (Roy Billing), and Nikki (Steph Tisdell) do on the ground serving remote communities changes William’s heart.\nJoining the list of Netflix’s best romantic comedy movies, Love Is in the Air makes perfect use of its filming locations, which manage to highlight just how remote the featured islands are. This is precisely why Dana prioritizes air deliveries to remote communities over tours for paying visitors. Love Is in the Air mentions multiple locations, including the quaint town of Fullterton, where Dana and her family live, and various spots like Packers Bay, or Lizard Island. While the filming locations are relatively close to each other and all in the state of Queensland, Australia, the places Love Is in the Air mentions are mostly fictional.\nThe company at the center of Love Is in the Air's story is Fullerton Airways, which according to the Australian rom-com, is based at Fullerton Airport. However, no airport with this name exists in the Whitsunday archipelago, where Love Is in the Air was filmed. Apart from multiple trips around the Whitsundays, Fullerton Airport is the main stage where most of the action happens in Love Is in the Air, making it an important location. It works as an airstrip and also as an accommodation, as it's where William ends up during his stay in Fullerton. He enjoys a front row seat to the comings and goings of the airport.\nRelated: 20 Best Australian TV Shows On US Netflix\nLove Is in the Air’s scenes at the airport were filmed at Whitsunday Airport (Shute Harbour) in Queensland, Australia (via Atlas of Wonders). The private airport boasts a modern hangar, a couple of helicopters, and, just like in Love Is in the Air, a residential area for small aircraft owners. Love Is in the Air makes a point of highlighting how everything is close in Fullerton, and Heath’s bar is where Nikki, Jeff, and Dana all hang out. It's also where William picks up the keys to his apartment. The bar exists in real life under the name The Hangar Cafe and Bar, and it’s mere meters from the runway.\nJeff makes a point of asking Dana to pick up William and show him the panoramic route as he tries to sort out the company’s books. The town of Fullerton's real name can be seen right after Dana welcomes William in her car. Airlie Beach, west of the Whitsunday Airport, doubles as Fullerton in Love Is in the Air. Nestled in Pioneer Bay, Airlie Beach offers the perfect arrival spot for visitors of the Whitsunday Islands, which boast naturalistic wilderness both on the ground and the sea, given their vicinity to the Great Barrier Reef.\nOn their many visits to remote communities, Dana and William see beautiful white sand beaches from above, and while they rarely specify the places they’re flying over, their flight right before the cyclone shows one of the beaches deemed among the most beautiful in the world. The northern side of Whitehaven Beach on Whitsunday Island can be seen on Dana and William’s flight back to Fullerton Airport. The beach, situated on the largest island of the archipelago, stretches over seven kilometers and can be reached by boat or overseen via helicopters and small aircraft flights (via Queensland’s official website).\nRelated: 25 Best Underrated Netflix Comedies\nLove Is in the Air’s end credits offer another shot of Whitsunday Island as Dana flies over it after the group overcomes the challenges Duncan Mitchell throws at them.

With the small-town community being at the center of Love Is in the Air, the Whitsunday Islands offer the perfect backdrop for the Australian romantic comedy, showing off the archipelago’s astounding natural beauty and simultaneously explaining why would William be enticed to stay.\nSource: Atlas of Wonders, Queensland.com\n"}

They don't need anyone's approval to live their life.\nFemale anime anti-heroes are a surprisingly underrepresented archetype, due to the medium's tendency to turn female characters into helpless damsels in distress, often needing to be saved by their strong male counterparts. Even when that is not the case, they are often either given supporting roles, or act as the love interest of the main character, rather than having their own identity.\nAnime anti-heroes, in general, are not entirely uncommon, but most of them are men, who are typically allowed to have stronger and more dominant personalities, without needing to be considerate of those around them. Regardless, there are also female leading characters who are shown to go around the world as they see fit, without conforming to any rules, and making a name for themselves as some of the best anti-heroines.\nBlack Lagoon's titular Lagoon Company is a group of people typically working for criminal organizations, providing services such as smuggling and piracy. Revy's personality seems perfectly suitable for her line of work, as she is known for being rude, aggressive, and sadistic, often using foul language and killing without any hesitation. However, this destructive behavior is actually fueled by her deep psychological trauma, as she was verbally, physically, and even sexually abused by people who were supposed to protect her. This caused her to desperately seek power, and being impoverished resulted in her obsession with money. However, Revy also seems to have a soft side, occasionally saving her comrades.\nAs the female protagonist of The Future Diary, Yuno Gasai's identity and actions revolve around her love interest, Yukiteru Amano. Despite genuinely caring for Yukiteru and doing everything in her power to ensure his success in the survival game they're playing, her methods tend to be on the questionable side. Many of her problems stem from her childhood; after being adopted into a seemingly happy family, her father ended up being mostly absent, and her mother turned out to be abusive towards her, even locking her in a cage. This caused Yuno to become troubled and develop a twisted personality, often resorting to cruel and violent methods.\nRelated: Future Diary: The Main Characters, Ranked From Worst To Best By Character Arc\nAkame Ga Kill's eponymous anti-heroine, Akame, is a ruthless assassin who kills her enemies without showing any mercy or remorse. However, she is not entirely villainous, as she is shown to care deeply about her comrades, always trying to protect her friends and being affected when she is unable to do so. Her seemingly cold and emotionless nature is a result of her childhood, during which she, along with her sister, was sold to the Empire and forced into a cruel exam. The survivors were then trained by elite assassins to become effective killers, learning killing and espionage techniques, and undergoing difficult training.\nAs the protagonist of the Slayers franchise, Lina Inverse's actions are typically not too different from those of other heroic mages, as she too tends to spend most of her time fighting the forces of evil. What differentiates her from her peers, however, would be her methods; she has a short temper and a tendency to cause great collateral damage when fighting, using black magic derived from beings of chaos, with no regard or consideration for her surroundings. Moreover, coming from a family of merchants, she is always trying to get a good bargain, even forcing people to give her items for free occasionally.\nGunslinger Girl revolves around the Social Welfare Agency, where young girls are given cybernetic implants and used as anti-terrorist agents, working alongside \"Handlers\" who brainwash them into being completely loyal, often at the cost of their memories. Triela became one of the Agency's first cyborgs after living a tragic life as a victim of the mob, routinely drugged and abused, and nearly dying at some point. She is shown to be one of the more compassionate and level-headed characters, often teaching and helping the other girls who are struggling. Though she is seen as an anti-hero because of how brutal she can be, Triela is but a product of her circumstances.\nKoko Hekmatyar is an arms dealer, typically seen traveling with her squad of bodyguards around the world to conduct business. Her personality is difficult to assess, as she rarely shows her true feelings. Her behavior is occasionally immature, but she can also be composed, especially when dealing with business partners. One thing that can be said for sure is that she is determined, as she is leading a secret project known as Jormungand, with the goal of ending war and arms trade. This plan may involve casualties amounting to 700,000 people, but she sees that as a necessary sacrifice, which deserves to be made for the sake of achieving world peace.\nBorn into a family of demon hunters, Shiki Ryougi grew up with two personalities, the stoic and cynical female persona, and the male persona who knows nothing but to kill. After being involved in an accident that leaves her in a 2-year coma however, she realizes that she lost her male persona SHIKI, instead gaining the \"Mystic Eyes of Death Perception\", a supernatural ability that lets her perceive the death of any object or being. The Garden of Sinners follows Shiki's life and the mysteries she is wrapped up in, making no effort to hide just how cruel and merciless she can be when she wants to.\nElfen Lied's protagonist Kaede is a Diclonius, a species with horns and psychokinetic abilities, defined by one of anime's most tragic backstories. Raised in an orphanage, she grew up with the mistaken idea that her parents abandoned her and wanted her dead, causing her deep psychological issues. At the orphanage, she was not only neglected by the staff but also bullied by the other kids. As she matured, her vectors, or invisible telekinetic arms, also developed, and she unconsciously used them to murder people when she felt betrayed and enraged multiple times. Once she learns about love though, she makes the conscious decision to change and atone for her past.\nClare is a Claymore, or human-Yoma hybrid, fighting the demonic creatures called Yoma that torment the lands. Although she can be considered an anti-hero because of her generally cold and blunt attitude, seemingly prioritizing the elimination of Yoma above all else, including the protection of other humans, she proves herself to be rather kind beyond the surface, genuinely caring about her friends and comrades. Unfortunately, she has trouble expressing her feelings due to her traumatic past. After losing her parents to Yoma and being captured and abused by one, she was finally saved by another Claymore, namely Teresa, only to eventually lose her too, left with nothing but a desire for revenge.\nMichiko Malandro, Michiko & Hatchin's co-protagonist, is a strong woman with a troubled past. Growing up in an orphanage, she routinely stole from shops to provide for the other younger kids, feeling responsible for them. After leaving the orphanage, she eventually got arrested, later escaping prison to look for the daughter of her ex-lover, Hiroshi. Saving Hana, whom she would then name Hatchin, from an abusive foster family, the two set out on a journey together. Michiko may have strange ways of showing it, often appearing as abrasive or a troublemaker, not afraid of pointing guns at people, but she truly cares for the ones she loves, trusting them completely.\nThese anti-heroines prove that strong anime female protagonists can be popular too, despite not being particularly common. In fact, their rarity only makes them that more special. Rather than being dismissive or blindly following the expectations associated with the role of a leading character, they prove that there is more than one way to lead a story and set the tone of the action. That's what makes these female anime anti-heroes some of the coolest and most memorable anime characters ever.\nRemus Badescu is a writer for ScreenRant's anime section.

Episode 1 of the new college-focused spinoff saw Golden Boy kill Godolkin University's Professor Brink (Clancy Brown) before exploding in midair. His sudden actions were because of a discovery he made involving the Woods, a secret Supe testing facility beneath Godolkin.\nNow, Vought International has released a video where Vought CEO Ashley Barrett (Colby Minifie) spins Golden Boy's death in Gen V for the media.\nIn the video, Ashley claims Golden Boy's death was due to drug use, which resulted in him having \"a full psychotic break.\" However, later episodes of the series reveal his rampage was fueled by what he discovered about the Woods.\nThe characters in Gen V have had to deal with Golden Boy’s death since it happened at the end of episode 1. This has resulted in Andre (Chance Perdomo) heavily investigating the Woods, discovering its existence and sending Emma (Lizze Broadway) there to investigate. The end of episode 3 saw Emma discover Golden Boy’s brother, Sam (Asa Germann), is alive, just as Andre discovers his father, Polarity (Sean Patrick Thomas), knows about the experiments.\nGolden Boy’s death was the catalyst for students at Godolkin starting their own investigation into the Woods facility. This will likely result in the core students trying to make the experiments known to the public while also trying to understand why they’re being conducted beneath the school. Since Gen V has five episodes left, the answers may not be clear right away.\nHowever, it seems Emma could be discovered in episode 4, which may lead to more direct conflict between students and the school going forward. If that's the case, then the developments that transpire for the rest of the season will likely be extremely unpredictable. By embracing the same dark elements of The Boys that make it so memorable, Gen V will no doubt help to enhance the universe with its own deadly storyline.\nGen V releases new episodes Fridays on Prime Video.\nSource: Vought International/Twitter\n"}

The 1978 movie follows the havoc that is wreaked when murderer Michael Myers escapes from a sanitarium and begins stalking the streets of Haddonfield, Illinois, on Halloween night. After becoming one of the most profitable independent movies of all time, Halloween launched a franchise that now includes 13 movies. In addition to directing the original, Carpenter also co-wrote the screenplay and composed the now iconic Halloween score.\nOn Instagram, Halloween Kills performer Douglas Tait shared a video of a moment when John Carpenter made a surprise appearance at the H45: 45 Years of Terror convention in Pasadena on October 1.\nIn Tait's video, Carpenter poses for a photo with Nick Castle, who played \"The Shape\" (the moniker given to the masked Michael Myers) in the original Halloween as well as Blumhouse's recent legacy sequel trilogy. Carpenter also paid a visit to P.J. Soles (Lynda) and Nancy Loomis (Annie), as well as other performers from the 1978 classic before participating in a panel about his iconic movie.\nThis was not a full cast reunion, as some of the surviving cast members including Charles Cyphers (Sheriff Brackett) and Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode) were not present. However, Carpenter's appearance at the event does feel like something of a full-circle moment for his career. Horror has long been central to Carpenter's work, with titles including The Thing, Prince of Darkness, and Village of the Damned dotting his filmography over the years. However, he hasn't directed a horror movie since 2010's The Ward, which is also his final directorial feature at the time of writing.\nCarpenter is now prepping for the release of his Peacock miniseries John Carpenter's Suburban Screams, which features his return to directing (done remotely, in this case). However, this long-awaited comeback has been building for quite some time. While Carpenter hasn't directed a movie or television project since The Ward, he has never been too far from the horror genre in the meantime.\nMost notably, Carpenter returned to the Halloween movies as a producer and co-composer for 2018's Halloween and its sequels, Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends. However, he has also released multiple albums of his horror-tinged musical compositions, even going on tour to perform them alongside entries from his iconic scores. He also directed music videos for several song releases, co-composed the score for 2022's Firestarter, and made a cameo in the Foo Fighters horror movie Studio 666, presaging his eventual return to the horror genre.\nSource: Douglas Tait/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "How Old Star Trek’s New Vulcan Is Compared To Spock & T’Pol", "date": "2023-10-02 20:16:30", "text": "Star Trek: Lower Decks' T'Lyn revealed her age, but how does she compare to Enterprise's T'Pol and Strange New Worlds' Lt. Spock?\nStar Trek: Lower Decks' new Vulcan, Lieutenant T'Lyn (Gabrielle Ruiz), is of comparable age to Star Trek: Enterprise's Subcommander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) and she is older than Star Trek: Strange New Worlds' Lieutenant Spock (Ethan Peck). T'Lyn was introduced in Lower Decks season 2 as a Lower Decker serving on the Vulcan ship Sh'vhal. When T'Lyn saved her ship during a conflict between Klingons, Pakleds, and the USS Cerritos, she was transferred to Starfleet and stationed on the Cerritos as a provisional Ensign. However, T'Lyn was quickly promoted to Lieutenant, junior grade.\nVulcans are relatively long-lived and can roughly double the lifespan of humans, although some elderly Vulcans can develop Bendii Syndrome, a neurological disease that affects their telepathy. In Star Trek: Lower Decks' late 24th century era, numerous Vulcans serve in Starfleet, but this was a much rarer thing in previous generations of Star Trek. T'Pol was the first Vulcan to join Starfleet in Star Trek: Enterprise season 3, and when Spock became a Starfleet Officer a century later, Vulcans in Starfleet were still relatively uncommon compared to the 24th century. Spock did attend Starfleet Academy, which neither T'Pol nor T'Lyn did, which accounts for why the two female Vulcans were introduced to be much older than the iconic Mr. Spock.\nRelated: Star Trek: Lower Decks Cast Guide - Who Voices Each Character In All 4 Seasons\nIn Star Trek: Lower Decks season 4, episode 5, \"Empathological Fallacies,\" Lt. T'Lyn told Lt. Beckett Mariner (Tawny Newsome) that she is 62 years old, to which Mariner responded, \"62? You look great, by the way.\" T'Lyn's age lines up with T'Pol's, who was 63 years old when Star Trek: Enterprise began, which was set in 2251. Comparatively, Lt. Spock was only 29 in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 1. Spock was born in 2230 on Vulcan, and he is about 36 in Star Trek: The Original Series when Spock is portrayed by Leonard Nimoy.\nSpock chose to attend Starfleet Academy instead of the Vulcan Science Academy, which created a rift between him and his father, Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard/James Frain). Both T'Lyn and T'Pol ended up in Starfleet by circumstance; T'Pol was originally a Vulcan observer on the inaugural mission of the NX-01 Enterprise commanded by Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) and she chose to remain aboard the Earth vessel before eventually aligning her loyalty from the Vulcan High Command to Starfleet. T'Lyn was transferred to Starfleet as a punishment for being \"too emotional\" and \"out of control,\" and she desperately tried to return to the Sh'vhal before deciding to remain on the Cerritos.\nAlthough she is Star Trek's newest (an increasingly popular) Vulcan character, T'Lyn was definitely inspired by her Vulcan predecessors. As a Vulcan in Starfleet, T'Lyn evokes Lt. Saavik (Kirstie Alley/Robin Curtis) from the Star Trek movies, and her headband and hairstyle are reminiscent of the treacherous Lt. Valeris (Kim Cattrall) from Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. Like T'Pol, T'Lyn unwillingly found herself serving on a Starfleet ship, and her dissatisfaction and issues with her Vulcan superiors led her to question whether she is \"Vulcan enough.\" And, similar to T'Pol, T'Lyn has to get used to how humans smell as they offend the superior olfactory senses of Vulcan females.\nT'Lyn and T'Pol are nearly identical ages when they come aboard their Starfleet ships, just like Spock and Tuvok (Tim Russ) are of comparable ages in their early Starfleet careers. Like Spock, Tuvok was 29 when he served on the USS Excelsior commanded by Captain Hikaru Sulu (George Takei) in 2293. Lt. Tuvok was 93 years old when he came aboard the USS Voyager commanded by Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) at the start of Star Trek: Voyager, and Captain Tuvok is 137 when he appears in Star Trek: Picard season 3, circa 2401. Star Trek: Lower Decks' Lt. T'Lyn is hopefully still alive in Star Trek: Picard season 3, and she would be around 80 years old.\nJohn Orquiola is Screen Rant's Star Trek Beat Editor, Senior Features staff writer, and interviewer."}
{"title": "There’s One Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Side Quest You Should Do ASAP", "date": "2023-10-02 20:16:30", "text": "One Phantom Liberty side quest unlocks a whole new way to earn legendary rewards. Here’s how to find and complete it in the Cyberpunk 2077 DLC.\nCyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC brings many new side quests to the open world of Night City, but one in particular shouldn't be skipped. Naturally, the main focus of the Phantom Liberty DLC is on its tense, twisted spy thriller of a story. Even so, some of its side quests do a wonderful job of expanding its world, getting the player acquainted with the notable people, places, and things of Dogtown to ease them along their journey.\nBut not all side quests are exactly the same. While some of them tie into the setting or expand on the story, others are simple, skippable fetch quests that don't offer much beyond material compensation. Still others, though, are more than worthwhile because of the new mechanics, shops, or items they unlock. These rewards can stick with the player throughout the DLC and beyond, changing even the base game of Cyberpunk 2077 in meaningful ways. Those side quests are worth looking out for, but can sometimes be hard to find.\nRelated: One Cyberpunk 2077 Choice Will Ruin Your Phantom Liberty Playthrough\nCompleting the Phantom Liberty side job \"Push it to the Limit\" unlocks a whole new feature in the DLC: the ability to undertake Vehicle Contracts. These are often simple, quick driving missions in which V has to steal a designated car, then drive it to a buyer while swerving around enemies. Vehicle Contracts allow the DLC to showcase the brand-new vehicular combat mechanic, which was added to the game in Cyberpunk 2077's free 2.0 update. Since each one is centered around a different car, these quests also give players an opportunity to test drive some of Phantom Liberty's coolest new vehicles.\nCyberpunk 2077's Vehicle Contracts are also notable for their rewards, which may include crafting components, rare weapons, weapon attachments, and a variety of different Shard types. Shards can be exchanged for different rewards, which are mostly self-explanatory. Money Shards can be turned into eurodollars, and Skill Shards grant a slight XP bump to the relevant ability. Vehicle Contracts may also reward V with Autofixer Discount Shards, which can be traded in for price cuts at Night City's many car dealers. These can stack up to a 100% discount, allowing V to get new cars absolutely free if they save up enough.\nIn order to accept the Cyberpunk 2077 quest \"Push it to the Limit,\" players must first complete Phantom Liberty's story through the main quest \"Spider and the Fly.\" Once V has finished the first three introductory missions and returned to the full open world, they may see a small, blue-green steering wheel icon on the map in Pacifica. If they pull up near it, they'll see a bright yellow car, and receive a call from El Capitan goading them into stealing it. V should hop into the driver's seat and head toward the destination.\nBut before long, a caravan of gang members pull up behind V. They'll do everything they can to stop the car from getting to El Capitan's garage. V can either take out their pursuers or shake them off; with the new vehicular combat mechanic, they can fire weapons out the window to keep the pressure on. If they make enough noise during the first leg of the chase, the police may show up to further complicate things. V doesn't need to arrive unharmed, but they do need to arrive intact, so sometimes it's better to avoid a fight than to drive right into one.\nOnce V parks in the designated garage, El Capitan emerges and congratulates them on a job well done. In short, he wants to repeat the same scheme over and over again, paying V to steal desirable cars and deliver them to exacting buyers across the city. With that, Vehicle Contracts become available all over the map. V can start undertaking them at any time, simply by opening the door of a target car and heading toward the destination. When they do, they'll know they're headed in the right direction if the quest title \"Just Another Story\" pops up in the top right corner of the screen.\nFor the most part, future Vehicle Contract quests don't change much from V's initial brush with El Capitan. Of course, the vehicles themselves are often different, as are the places where they're parked and the locations of the buyers V has to deliver them to. They can be found on the map with the same blue-green steering wheel icon that marks the original \"Push it to the Limit\" quest.\nWhat does make future Vehicle Contracts more interesting, though, are the optional objectives the later ones include. They're not strictly required, but they do directly affect the amount and quality of the rewards V receives, so it's worth keeping an eye on them and at least trying to adhere. There are four possible optional objectives: a time limit, a hostile tail, a hacking challenge, or an \"undamaged\" condition. Satisfying a Vehicle Contract's optional condition means V will be treated to an extra crate full of Tier Five items - Legendary weapons, armor, and attachments - upon completion of the job.\nTime limits work exactly as expected, with a clock constantly ticking down until the extra rewards expire. Sometimes, V will instead be pursued by the car's rightful owner, rival thieves, police, or all of the above, as they were in the introductory Vehicle Contract \"Push it to the Limit.\" At other times, they'll have to complete a hacking mini-game before they can even get into the car. The most difficult optional objectives, though, require V to deliver the car completely unharmed. The slightest dent or scratch, and they can wave goodbye to the extra rewards.\nWhile the other side quests in Phantom Liberty are pretty limited in terms of scope, \"Push it to the Limit\" unlocks a whole new category of side activities. Vehicle Contracts might not be the easiest or most popular feature, but they provide a wonderful tour through some of the DLC's new features, and the rewards are more than worth the effort. Even though it's technically optional, the Cyberpunk 2077 side quest \"Push it to the Limit\" should be every player's first priority.\n"}

Director Larry Charles (Borat) and writers Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp have brought the earnest bravado of Broadway (or more accurately a half-hour performance born from Upright Citizens Bridage training) to the big screen with a star-studded cast and show-stopping numbers. Jackson and Sharp, who also originated the original show, star as two identical twins who accidentally reconnect at work and set out to reunite their family.\nTheir parents are played by Megan Mullally (Will & Grace) and Nathan Lane (The Birdcage), who give some of the most outlandish performances of their career — which is really saying something. Dicks: The Musical also stars Megan Thee Stallion as a \"lady boss\" who will take no disrespect from her underlings and Saturday Night Live's Bowen Yang as the movie's fabulous and fashion-forward incarnation of God. If that sounds like the recipe for a good time, just wait to see how wild it gets as the show goes on.\nRelated: The 20 Best Musicals Of All Time\nScreen Rant spoke with stars Megan Mullally & Nathan Lane about getting into their Parent Trap-esque characters for Dicks: The Musical, finding their voices for set, and cozying up to the animatronic creatures known as the Sewer Boys.

Do you?\nNathan Lane: Not always.\nMegan Mullally: I'm unclear. [Laughs] No, we love them. They're the best.\nNathan Lane: I liked that joke, too. I liked it when they couldn't remember.\nDid you guys mix up the character name sometimes, saying the right name instead?\nMegan Mullally: Yeah. I did, for sure.\nMegan, I love the voice that you found for Evelyn. How did you find her, and then connect that to your singing?\nMegan Mullally: Oh, thank you. Well, it came to me in a dream. [Laughs] I don't know. I always just have a very weird, ephemeral way of coming up with characters, I guess. Not logical; more just my gut.\nNick was running lines with me before we ever started, and I was doing it, and Nick liked it. And then when we first started rehearsing, there were a few people maybe who didn't like it; producer types, in that realm, and maybe it was suggested to me that I not do it. And I said, \"Well, I am going to do it,\" and I did it. So, that's how it happened.\nNathan, Harris and the Sewer Boys is his own little family melodrama there. How close did you have to get to those puppets?\nNathan Lane: That's the sequel. Harris and the Sewer Boys: Dicks Continued.\nWell, very close. I had to spit ham into their mouth. Yes, close. I got close physically and emotionally. That's what happens when you rescue Sewer Boys. It's such a bizarre thing. The Sewer Boys had a history because, in the original sketch, they were just referenced. You never saw them, and it was suggested that perhaps he was having sex with them.\nOh?!\nNathan Lane: That very reaction was what I believe A24 and Peter Chernin Entertainment thought, too. In fact, a group of men went, \"Oh?!\" And they said, \"That's where I believe if there is a line on this film, this is where we're going to draw it, and Harris cannot be having sex with anyone with Boys in their name.\" The notion of human actors playing them, guys from Cirque de Soleil swinging in the cage, that was done away with, and it had to be puppets.\nI hope that no puppeteers were harmed in the making of throwing ham at the Sewer Boys.\nNathan Lane: I don't think so. I think I had a pretty good aim. But these aren't sophisticated puppets. I mean. Maybe I vaguely remember some sort of animatronic bit, where maybe their mouths might move a little. I don't know. But, essentially, it was just two or three people with sticks going like this. It was a lot of this; just people doing that. And so they would go like this.

It was not what you would call nuanced movement.\nMegan Mullally: Well, Larry said it's the most anti-AI film in the history of movies.\nNathan Lane: It has a very handmade quality, I would say.\nTwo self-obsessed businessmen (writers Aaron Jackson & Josh Sharp) discover they’re long-lost identical twins and come together to plot the reunion of their eccentric divorced parents, in this riotously funny and depraved musical from comedy icon Larry Charles (Seinfeld, Borat) also starring Megan Thee Stallion, Nathan Lane, Megan Mullally, and Bowen Yang as God.\nCheck out our other interviews here:\nDicks: The Musical arrives in select theaters on October 6 before its nationwide release on October 20.\nSource: Screen Rant Plus\n"}
{"title": "Are Any Of The Ghosts Real In A Haunting In Venice?", "date": "2023-10-02 20:30:28", "text": "Ghosts are at the heart of Kenneth Branagh’s A Haunting in Venice, but are the supernatural forces actually present or can they be explained away?\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for A Haunting in Venice.\nWhile most of A Haunting in Venice’s mysteries are neatly tied up, the story remains elusive when it comes to the reality of its titular haunting. The film, Kenneth Branagh’s third outing as the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, finds itself blending genres and breaking with numerous series conventions. In A Haunting in Venice, a retired, disillusioned Poirot is invited to witness a séance at the home of an opera singer who wishes to commune with her late daughter. However, the macabre evening takes an even darker turn when the psychic medium is found dead, with a retired Poirot forced to take on the case.\nA Haunting in Venice is the first of Branagh’s three Hercule Poirot movies to change its name from the original book’s title, and it diverges from the source material in other ways. Agatha Christie’s novel Hallowe’en Party takes place at an English estate rather than a Venetian Palazzo. While the central mystery is largely the same, the book does not feature a séance, nor do ghosts play a major part in the story. The decision to focus more heavily on the supernatural elements imbues A Haunting in Venice with an affecting atmosphere. However, it’s unclear whether the film’s many ghosts are another misdirection or a confirmation of the supernatural.\nWhile A Haunting in Venice’s cast of characters spends the entire movie being menaced by apparently supernatural forces, the vast majority of these occurrences can be rationally explained. The troubling visions of ghosts and sounds of children’s laughter that Poirot hears throughout the film are in line with the legend that the Palazzo is haunted by the spirits of children, and the deceased Alicia Drake appears to Poirot multiple times throughout the film, both as a child and in her drowned form. However, these visions can largely be explained as the result of drinking tea laced with Rowena Drake’s (Kelly Reilly) hallucinogenic honey.\nOther supernatural occurrences can be explained with a plot spearheaded by Tina Fey’s Haunting in Venice character, Ariadne Oliver, in order to generate material for a best-selling book about Hercule Poirot being stumped by the medium Joyce Reynolds (Michelle Yeoh). Ariadne and Poirot’s ex-detective bodyguard, Vitale (Riccardo Scamarcio), feed Joyce information about the Alicia Drake case and about Poirot’s life in order to give her the appearance of psychic clairvoyance. Joyce’s accusation that someone murdered Alicia Drake is contrived as a means of injecting drama into Ariadne’s planned book. Unfortunately, their lie proves prescient, resulting in Joyce’s murder at the hands of Alicia Drake’s killer.\nWhile the plot rationally explains away most of its hauntings, some vaguely supernatural occurrences are purposefully left unexplained. The young Leopold Ferrier (Jude Hill) seems to actually be imbued with the ability to speak with the Palazzo’s ghosts. Leopold claims that the spectral children told him Joyce Reynolds is a fake, a claim that proves true. Leopold also seems capable of hearing the children’s laughter like Poirot does, implying that it’s not an auditory hallucination at all. While Rowena Drake’s death is apparently the result of her slipping over the balcony, a split-second manifestation of the drowned Alicia Drake appears to pull her over.\nWhat’s more, the teacup in Alicia’s room may be a signal of her spectral presence. The falling teacup causes Poirot to find a photo that sets A Haunting in Venice's ending in motion by triggering the realization of Alicia’s true killer. However, the teacup isn't jostled or moved in any way. Having been in the same position for months, it happens to fall at the precise moment that leads to Alicia’s murderer being brought to justice. All of these individual details are small, but they paint a larger picture of a supernatural force that is difficult to dismiss.\nThe ambiguity of the ghosts in A Haunting in Venice is central to the film’s themes of faith and cynicism. At the outset of the story, Poirot’s past dealings have brought him to a point of utter disillusionment wherein the existence of ghosts, God, or any kind of cosmic justice seems impossible. However, this airtight certainty is keeping the detective from living his life. The events of A Haunting in Venice — both the real and the apparently supernatural — force him to acknowledge that he could be wrong about the nihilism of the universe. Ultimately, the only way to honor the ghosts of the past is to accept their existence.\n"}

Unimaginably vast, the city covers the entire eastern seaboard of the United States, stretching from the northernmost part of America (including parts of Canada) to the southernmost tip of the Florida peninsula. The megalopolis is also densely populated, serving as home to hundreds of millions of people.\nThe sprawling supercity made its first appearance in the Judge Dredd universe in the late 1970s via comic stories by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra published in 2000 AD. Since its introduction, Mega-City One would see its massive population take hit after serious hit. Various wars and pestilence over the decades would significantly reduce the number of people living in the city.\nRelated: Judge Dredd Art Shows What Even Movie Fans Missed About Mega-City One\nJudge Dredd’s city started as an extended urban area stretching from Washington, D.C. to the Big Apple in the late 2020s. It was intended as a metropolitan area that connects the nation’s capital to New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and other East Coast states, providing housing and work for those living in and around the region. Its population would balloon in the next few years, laying the foundation of what would become the first American mega-city. It would quickly expand in size to accommodate the unstoppable growth of its population, enveloping Massachusetts (and beyond) in the north, Florida in the south, and parts of Ohio in the west.\nIn 2070, the global Atomic War transforms the majority of the United States into radioactive wasteland. Mega-City One survives the nuclear war because of its experimental laser shield technology. But it soon finds itself attracting millions of refugees from less fortunate American cities. The situation forces the city to resort to building towering apartment blocks that can house more than 50,000 people. Block construction over the next 30 years causes Mega-City One’s population to reach 800 million by the start of the 22nd century. By the mid-2100s, however, that number would be reduced to half its size.\nDue to the high crime rate within Mega-City One, death is almost like a daily occurrence for its citizens. Going into the 22nd century, however, the already hardened population would be further traumatized. In 2104, several block wars would erupt across the megalopolis, resulting in major casualties. But that is actually just a diversion manufactured by the Soviet Judges of East-Meg One in Russia to launch a nuclear attack on the southern sectors of Dredd’s home turf, taking 150 million lives. The ensuing radioactive fallout, nuclear winter, and starvation of this event (dubbed the Apocalypse War) would further inflict a massive death count.\nJudge Dredd would later put an end to the war by giving East-Meg One and its no-good Soviet Judges a taste of their own medicine. But the Apocalypse War causes Mega-City One’s population to drop from 800 million to 400 million. Barely just rebuilding after a nuke attack, the city would again face another adversity in the early 2110s thanks to evil witches who turn Mega-City One into a Necropolis ruled by undead judges favoring slaughter over street justice. With Dredd retired (and later becoming amnesiac), the corrupt Justice System would lead to 60 million deaths by 2112.\nIn 2126, terrorists get their hands on a dozen nuclear weapons and set them off around Mega-City One, instantly killing 4 million. Still reeling after yet another nuclear bombing, the city would be beset just a year later by the Half-Life epidemic, a psychic disease that turns people into murderers, taking another million lives. But these events pale in comparison to 2134’s Day of Chaos, wherein a biological WMD wipes out nearly 90 percent of Mega-City One’s population. From 400 million inhabitants three decades before, that number drops to about 40 million by the mid-2130s.\nStill, those major events don’t keep the megalopolis down for long. By the start of the 2140s, Mega-City One would see its population recover relatively quickly to breach the 100 million mark, taking into account the constant influx of immigrants after the events of the Day of Chaos. By the year 2145, the population estimate is around 130 million. But if Mega-City One's history in Judge Dredd teaches anything, that number will likely take another major hit soon.\nGuile Canencia is a freelance writer from Cebu, Philippines.

{"title": "Friday The 13th: Every Filming Location In The Horror Movie Franchise", "date": "2023-10-02 20:41:26", "text": "Friday the 13th has used a variety of locations to depict Camp Crystal Lake over the years. Here's where each movie in the franchise was shot. \nWARNING: Spoilers ahead for Friday the 13th.\nThe Friday the 13th series is one of the most iconic franchises of the horror genre due mainly to its iconic setting of Camp Crystal Lake, which was shot in various locations. Jason Voorhees owes much of his villainous notoriety to his wooded hunting grounds that have served as the site for dozens of his gruesome killings in his notorious hockey mask. Camp Crystal Lake is an essential component of the Friday the 13th series since it was where the vengeful horror legend was born. It has become nearly as iconic as its evil resident slasher Jason, considering how the fictional summer campground established a thematic standard for modern slasher films and the horror genre in the past few decades.\nCrystal Lake's heavy forest setting provides dense coverage for Jason to hide under the cover of darkness as he picks off his unsuspecting victims one by one. The simple log cabins at Camp Crystal Lake provide limited hiding spaces for those unfortunate enough to get caught in Jason's violent grasp, most of whom are smoking, drinking, or engaging in other forms of youthful debauchery. The lake itself is the place where Jason drowned due to his counselors' negligence and marked the original story of Jason's dark upbringing. Given the significance of Camp Crystal Lake to the overall story of Jason Voorhees, here are all the Friday the 13th shooting locations listed by the franchise's chronology.\nRELATED: Every Friday The 13th Movie Ranked By Kill Count\nThe real-world setting of the first Friday the 13th film is by far the most famous. The grounds used for Camp Crystal Lake is a Boy Scout retreat called Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco located in Hardwick, New Jersey. The camp is still operating to this day, but unfortunately, that means that fans can't visit the site without getting in trouble for trespassing. However, No-Be-Bo-Sco occasionally holds elaborate Crystal Lake Tours on select Friday the 13th days complete with props and memorabilia.\nNearby Blairstown, where Crystal Lake's own town was shot, also pays tribute to the film with an exhibit at the Blairstown Museum that expanded to a full-on Friday the 13th museum. Locals express that the date of Friday the 13th has become a sort of holiday for the community and the town holds a \"Jason Fest\" to celebrate the film's legacy. The Roy's Hall concert venue in Blairstown typically screens Friday the 13th on these days as well as appearing in a shot of the film itself. Interior shots were also shot next door to Blairstown in Hope.\nThe sequel moved its filming locations from New Jersey to Connecticut, shooting in the rural and heavily wooded county of Litchfield. The village of New Preston provided the backdrop for downtown scenes including the casino where the counselors visited the bar. The cabins along Camp Kenmont's North Spectacle Pond, located just outside the town of Kent, were where Jason stalked his prey at Camp Crystal Lake. In addition, the city of Waterbury, located in the much more urbanized eastern part of Connecticut, was where audiences visited the house of the sole survivor of the first film, Alice Hardy.\nUnfortunately, the sets for this entry have not been nearly as well-preserved as those for the first film. Alice's house in Waterbury has been demolished, although interior scenes were shot in what is now a rehabilitation center in Torrington. The casino in New Preston was a popular nightlife spot for years before completely burning down. Camp Kenmont is still active but the property was sold to another owner. The residences on North Spectacle Pond called Bromica Lodge were also destroyed.\nPart III marks the first time that a Friday the 13th film was not shot on the East Coast since the crew needed a more controlled environment to regulate the movie's 3D effects. Instead, production took place in Veluzat Motion Picture Ranch in Santa Clarita, California with its own constructed barn, cabin, and lake. The ranch is still used to this day as a production site, but the cabin that was used in the film burned down in 2012. In addition, the scene with the biker gang was shot at what is now the Green Valley Cafe in the Santa Clarita area.\nRELATED: 10 Jason Voorhees Cosplays That Should Be Inspiration For A Friday The 13th Reboot\nThe opening to The Final Chapter was also at Veluzat Ranch but the rest of the film takes place in different locations. The expendable teens went skinny-dipping in the waters of Zaca Lake while they hiked along the trails that surround the area. Strangely, the Zaca Lake Lodge marks the third time so far that a Friday the 13th shooting location burned down, this time more recently in 2016. The place is a popular filming site with its ties to Hollywood productions going all the way back to the silent era. The lake was also where the Universal Monster classic Creature from the Black Lagoon was shot. In addition, the residence of Tommy Jarvis and his family is a privately owned house in Topanga, CA.\nProduction for the Friday the 13th series remained in California in various locations around the Los Angeles area. As opposed to the other entries in the franchise, a chunk of the action was shot in the middle of an urban area, albeit in the idyllic Franklin Canyon Park, tucked inside the Beverly Hills portion of the Santa Monica Mountains. The Pineway Halfway House where Tommy Jarvis is institutionalized is a privately-owned property called Rancho Rosito located in Camarillo, California. Corey Feldman's cameo was shot in his own backyard as he was too who was busy shooting The Goonies to appear on set.\nFor the sixth film, production was primarily moved down south to Georgia. The town scenes, including the sheriff's office where Tommy Jarvis fails to convince the law that Jason is back from the dead, were shot in Covington. Located outside of Atlanta, the small city shares common ground with Rob Zombie's Halloween II which was also shot there. The camp scenes took place in Camp Daniel Morgan around Hard Labor Creek State Park's Lake Rutledge a couple of miles east of Covington. Luckily, the camp still exists and holds occasional tours and screenings, perhaps because Jason Lives is so well-beloved by Friday the 13th fans.\nA point of contention exists over which cemetery Jason emerged from at the beginning of the film. Fansites often state that it was Covington Cemetary, but screencap comparisons and recovered call sheet documents reveal that it was actually Old Madison Cemetary in Madison, GA. It's comforting to know that what is considered arguably the most entertaining entry in the series has had its shooting locations comparatively well-preserved.\nRELATED: 10 Ways Jason Lives Saved The Friday The 13th Franchise\nProduction for The New Blood stayed in the south but moved over to neighboring Alabama, specifically within Baldwin County and around the city of Mobile. Byrnes Lake was chosen for the primary outdoor location, although the cabins were all constructed for the film only to be torn down once production ended. There was even a gator wrangler hired to be on set in case the beasts attacked the cast and crew but fortunately, the gators weren't active during the time of the shooting. A number of interiors were also built in Los Angeles for filming and the crew went back to Topanga Canyon, California for the interiors of the house.\nJason's trip to New York City infamously doesn't even take place within The Big Apple for the majority of the movie. Despite the fact that Jason Takes Manhattan was the most expensive Friday the 13th film to date, its $5 million budget still wouldn't cover the would-be cost of shooting entirely in New York. Production took place mostly in Vancouver and surrounding areas within British Columbia as well as with some interior shots in Los Angeles. The only scene that was legitimately shot in New York was in Times Square, which attracted a sizable crowd of Friday the 13th fans to watch Jason actor Kane Hodder perform in the hockey mask.\nThe crew returned to southern California to shoot the ninth installment in Thousand Oaks. The town contained the Canyon Ranch Studio for outdoor production, as well as nearby urban locales such as Joey B.'s Diner. The Voorhees residence where Jason goes to hell was filmed at a private house in the suburban West Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, specifically on Eagle Mountain Street.\nRELATED: 10 Best Summer Camp Movies\nThe horror sci-fi crossover Jason X takes place entirely on a spaceship. The film crew used a soundstage to construct the sets in Toronto, Canada. There are no Camp Crystal Lake locales to be found here beyond a virtual simulation that's created for part of the movie. However, Jason X includes a fun cameo appearance where director David Cronenberg gets stabbed and showcases one of the franchise's most creative kills with Jason killing someone in a vat of liquid nitrogen.\nAfter years of teasing audiences and studio meddling, the big crossover between two icons of the slasher sub-genre, Freddy vs. Jason, was born. It was shot in and around Vancouver, using an impressive amount of on-location settings compared to the past few previous films. Jason's shack was located along the shore of the picturesque Buntzen Lake, although the set was demolished after filming. However, there were also some interiors and street shots that were filmed on a Universal Studios lot in Hollywood.\nRELATED: How Does Freddy vs. Jason Still Hold This Horror Record After 20 Years?\nThe 2009 remake of Friday the 13th took the action to Central Texas around the Austin area. Neighboring Bastrop provided outdoor recreation areas for camp scenes on Friday the 13th, while Austin, Round Rock, and Wimberley contained on-location structures like houses and stores. The city of Austin itself conveniently holds film studios for a more controlled environment as well. Additionally, the crew also traveled to Camp Fern in the East Texas town of Marshall to shoot more on-location outdoor scenes.\n"}

Goyer, showrunner of the Apple TV Plus show Foundation, teases how the Mule will impact season 3 of the hit science-fiction story.\nFoundation showrunner David S. Goyer teases how new villain the Mule will shake up a prospective season 3 of the hit Apple TV Plus series. First released on the streamer in 2021, Goyer's series is loosely based on source material from acclaimed author Isaac Asimov. The explosive Foundation season 2 finale recently aired on Apple TV Plus last month, setting up an even more thrilling story to come with Mikael Persbrandt's the Mule poised to be a central figure.\nNow, as audiences await news regarding the not-yet-confirmed Foundation season 3, Goyer teases in an interview with TVLine how the Mule will factor into the story going forward. The showrunner hypes up the villain's immense power, promising that things are only going to get more intense in the episodes to come. Check out Goyer's full comment below:\n\n“Yes, he is super scary. He’s magnitudes of order more powerful than Tellem. When Asimov created [the Mule], it was a character that flipped the whole table over. When the Mule enters the story properly in [a potential] Season 3, that’s completely what he does… As crazy as the end of Season 2 is, Season 3 is even crazier. You haven’t seen anything yet.”\n\n“Yes, he is super scary. He’s magnitudes of order more powerful than Tellem. When Asimov created [the Mule], it was a character that flipped the whole table over.

You haven’t seen anything yet.”\nRelated: Foundation's The Mule Explained & How He Threatens Hari Seldon's Plan\nThe Foundation season 2 finale was released on Apple TV Plus on September 15, with the season as a whole earning even stronger reviews from critics than season 1 did. Despite these strong reviews, however, the sci-fi show hasn't actually be renewed for season 3 yet. Season 2 was confirmed back in October 2021, before the first batch of episodes had even finished airing, and the lack of a renewal in the same time frame for season 3 could be interpreted as somewhat concerning.\nThat being said, the impact of the WGA strike in this case cannot be understated. Beginning earlier this year in May, the writers strike is almost certainly why Apple has not yet announced season 3. With the strike now over, it's entirely possible that an announcement is imminent. Goyer himself is evidently very confident in the show's future, recently revealing that he has charted a course for Foundation up to season 8.\nWhat's more, Foundation remains a surprisingly affordable series, at least for what it is. The budget for season 2 has yet to be made public, but season 1 cost only $45 million, a very small sum considering what competitors are spending on the likes of The Rings of Power and Stranger Things. With a season 2 budget that is probably a little larger but still relatively modest, and with impressive performance on various popularity metrics, it's looking likely that Goyer will indeed get to explore the Mule's impact on the story in Foundation season 3.\nSource: TVLine\n"}
{"title": "Everything Rick & Morty's Creators & Crew Have Said About Justin Roiland's Recast", "date": "2023-10-02 20:50:30", "text": "Adult Swim is continuing Rick and Morty, recasting Justin Roiland’s characters for season 7. Here’s what the creators and crew say on the subject.\nIn attempts to ease their viewers' concerns, the creators and crew of Rick and Morty have spoken candidly about the process of recasting Justin Roiland for season 7. Co-creator Roiland, who voiced the titular interdimensional adventurers, was fired from Adult Swim's hit series following a series of abuse allegations. Adult Swim decided, however, to continue the series, opting to recast Roiland's characters.\nJustin Roiland created Rick and Morty with Dan Harmon, who also functions as the show's primary writer. After six highly successful seasons, the show will return with Rick and Morty season 7. However, the Rick and Morty cast will feature two new actors in Roiland's roles. Nevertheless, writers and producers have stated they are confident in maintaining the level of quality, some even claiming season 7 is an improvement.\nRick and Morty producer, Steve Levy, has confirmed that the new actors portraying Rick and Morty will sound like Justin Roiland. Asked whether the show would change the voices following Roiland's recasting, possibly addressed by the show's multiverse plot lines and meta-narratives, Levy stated that the voices would remain the same. Levy commented that \"the characters are the same characters,\" and the transition into a new cast would be seamless (via IGN).\nIn a recent interview, Rick and Morty co-creator, Dan Harmon, discussed his professional relationship with Roiland throughout the show's history. Despite creating the hit series together, a divide between the two quickly developed after Harmon employed several fellow writers from Community for Rick and Morty season 2. Roiland slowly withdrew from the writers' room, as Harmon observed: \"I’d come to find out later that it was like, ‘Oh, Harmon brought in his Harmon writers,’ and, man, that is not how I saw it.\" The pair's relationship would never recover and, reportedly, they have not spoken to each other since 2019.\nDan Harmon also discussed his reaction to the Justin Roiland allegations. Harmon initially declined to comment on the abuse allegations but has since decided he cannot remain silent and expressed his sympathies and remorse. Harmon also has stated his regret over not commenting earlier, saying:\n\"It’s other people’s safety and comfort that got damaged while I obsessed over a cartoon’s quality. Trust has now been violated between countless people and a show designed to please them. I’m frustrated, ashamed and heartbroken that a lot of hard work, joy and passion can be leveraged to exploit and harm strangers.\"\nAdult Swim President Michael Ouweleen also clarified that the cast for Rick and Morty season 7 would not be imitators and explained audiences won't notice Justin Roiland's recast. Despite stating that the new Rick and Morty voices will sound like Roiland, Ouweleen reiterates that the Rick and Morty protagonists would remain the same, in every respect, despite very minor differences in performance. Ouweleen likened the circumstance to successive Bugs Bunny actors: \"It's not Mel Blanc! And yet we recognize the character. I even think that for Rick and Morty we will do even better... It will be fine. It'll be great.\"\nWriter and producer Steve Levy has suggested Rick and Morty season 7 is better without Roiland involved. While commenting on the writing team behind Rick and Morty season 7, Levy expressed great enthusiasm, praising the team for maintaining the same level of quality as the previous beloved seasons. Both Levy and Ouweleen have asserted that the season will certainly not suffer creatively without Roiland, with Levy stating:\n\"The work that we’re doing across the board has only gotten better. When the new season comes out, we’ll focus on how amazing it all turned out. We hope the fans will realize that this is the same old show, maybe even better!”\nSteve Levy has also stated the reason they decided Rick and Morty would continue without Roiland. Levy acknowledges the hardworking writing team who have contributed greatly to Rick and Morty's success over the years as the primary factor in continuing the series. Levy says:\n\"It would have been very easy to just say, ‘I’m done and I don’t want to do anything with this show anymore.’ But our crew said, ‘No, we’re not going to let one person drag down all of our hard work.’ This show is created by this team — this family of incredibly hardworking people, and we are going to push through and show the world that we aren’t going to miss a beat.\"\nOuweleen has wholly supported the plan to recast Rick and Morty for season 7. While commenting on the importance of vocal performance in animation, Ouweleen reiterated his support for the Rick and Morty writing team and the recasting efforts. Ouweleen said:\n\"Listen: voices are obviously super important in an animated series. And, of course, none of us wanted to go through what we went through. But I've been in animation for a long time, and I know that what makes a series is its different parts coming together. If the voices are obviously a big part, there is also the writing of the characters, their design... I have reason to believe that the transition will go well.\"\nDiscussing the future of Rick and Morty, Dan Harmon has revealed talks with Warner Bros. Studios to make a feature-length Rick and Morty movie. Referring to it as a \"super episode,\" Harmon drew a comparison with the South Park movie, Bigger, Longer, Uncut. Harmon also suggested that Rick and Morty could continue for decades, drawing a comparison with long-running animation, The Simpsons.\nRELATED: 10 Rick & Morty Story Ideas That Would Be Perfect For Dan Harmon's Movie\nThe first glimpse at the actors cast to replace Roiland has been revealed in Rick and Morty's season 7 trailer. The trailer provides several snippets of dialogue from each of the titular characters, which seemingly have adhered to Levy and Ouweleen's assertions. While there are some very minor changes in performance, the characters are essentially the same. While clearly not imitations, they are very clearly still Rick and Morty.\nAdult Swim has elected not to reveal the names of the actors cast as Rick and Morty until the season premiere on October 15, 2023. This comes after the performers featured heavily throughout the season's trailer. Despite perpetuating the casting mystery a little longer, it is unlikely to be an earth-shattering revelation, as Harmon has said the actors are \"unknown.\" Nevertheless, Rick and Morty season 7 is eagerly awaited, with many keen to know if the series will be the same without Roiland.\nRichard Craig is a musician and writer based in Brighton, UK. Recently completing an MA degree in Music and Sound Art, Richard has written extensively about movie genre studies and film soundtracks, paying particular attention to the horror genre and appearances of folk music. Richard's Bachelor's degree dissertation was chosen for publication in the first major academic collection on the folk horror genre, The Routledge Companion to Folk Horror. Released in October 2023, Richard's chapter explores the relationship between the Estonian horror movie November, and Estonian rune songs. Richard is also an accomplished film score composer, and most notably performed a live soundtrack to the 1922 silent film essay Haxan: Witchcraft Through the Ages. "}
{"title": "Can 200+ Improvements Fix Payday 3's Disaster Of A Launch?", "date": "2023-10-02 21:00:28", "text": "Payday 3's launch has been one of the worst of 2023, but developer Starbreeze Studios has revealed its plans to fix the cooperative shooter.\nPayday 3 was finally released on all current-gen consoles and PC - and was included as part of the main Xbox, PC, and Ultimate Game Pass tiers - on September 21, 2023. The title was highly anticipated by fans of the heist shooter series who had waited just over a decade since the release of its predecessor, Payday 2, but unfortunately, it has suffered from one of the worst launches of the year so far. Developer Starbreeze Studios seems intent on turning things around, though, promising over 200 improvements are on the way.\nPayday 3 picks up many years after the Payday Gang's crime spree in Washington DC in 2013's Payday 2. The group appeared to have retired after this, but were forced back into action to deal with a threat in New York, and much like the previous titles before it, Payday 3 would see players engaging in a variety of heists both in single-player with AI teammates or in online co-op with a team of up to three other players.\nRelated: \"Smart, Fun, And Chaotic In Every Way\" - Payday 3 Review\nDespite having a single-player option, the Payday games are primarily designed for online cooperative play. Therefore, the fact that the game's matchmaking was completely broken at launch was a major issue. Another issue was that the game - as is a growing trend in the industry these days - required players to be constantly online regardless of whether they were playing solo or with others.\nPayday 3 also suffered from frequent server crashes, which has left a huge number of players unable to play the game completely. As a result, those who bought the game on Steam reviewed the game en masse to vent their frustrations with it currently sitting at an overall Mostly Negative score, and positioned within the top 50 worst-rated games on the platform, with one Steam user dubbing it \"Payday 3: Main Menu Simulator\"​​​​.\nRelated: \"I Think I Would Be A Horrible Bank Robber\" - Payday 3's Lead Producer Interview\nOn September 25, Almir Listo, global brand director for Payday 3's developers, Starbreeze Studios, addressed the need for the game to always be online when responding to a comment on a Twitch stream on the official PAYDAY The Game channel. Regarding an offline mode, Listo said, “We cannot give, right now, a clear yes or no answer on this topic because it’s four days since launch. We did not foresee the incredible difficulties you had logging into the game. And we will address that, and answer that properly, as soon as we can.”\nStarbreeze Entertainment has since announced a plan for fixing the title on its official website. The plan consists of over 200 quality-of-life improvements coming this month, with an unspecified number of further improvements, bug fixes, new content, and functionality coming at later dates throughout the Fall before the Syntax Error DLC launches in Winter.\nThe update also addressed the game's matchmaking issues, stating that fixes had been made on September 26 and September 29 and that Payday 3 is \"stable\" and has had \"good performance\" after the completed maintenance. Starbreeze Entertainment's CEO Tobias Sjögren went on to thank the community for its patience with a launch that was \"not the start [Starbreeze] wanted\" and explained that the studio's business model is \"a marathon and not a sprint\", which indicates even further, regular updates and enhancements to the game to support Payday 3's live-service roadmap.\nWhen it actually works, Payday 3 can be a solid title that more than holds up to the standards of its predecessors, so hopefully these fixes will be enough to save it. For example, titles such as Cyberpunk 2077 have had disastrous launches but have been redeemed by a number of updates since. However, in a time when there are so many other titles on offer, with October alone being full of new major releases, publishers are running more of a risk of killing their games at launch by forcing studios to release them in broken or unfinished states, especially if they're dependent on fans coming back regularly for live-service content like Payday 3.\nSources: Steam, PAYDAYTheGame/Twitch, Starbreeze Entertainment\n"}
{"title": "Star Wars Visions Season 3: Story, Updates, Release Date Prediction, Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-02 21:00:28", "text": "While Lucasfilm hasn't announced Star Wars Visions season 3, here's everything we know about the project and when it will most likely be released.\nThe first two seasons of Star Wars: Visions on Disney+ provided a unique spin on the Star Wars universe, leading viewers to anticipate the announcement of season 3. With only nine episodes per season, each with a short runtime, there is plenty of room for Star Wars: Visions to continue telling new stories. The variety on display from each animation studio offers a refreshing perspective on the franchise in an era where many Star Wars TV shows feel the same.\nAlthough Star Wars: Visions is considered non-canon, the show may influence the main Star Wars timeline, just as the old Expanded Universe continues to influence the current canon. Many Star Wars: Visions episodes were set in a different timeline, especially in season 1, but many episodes from season 2 seemed as though they could fit in the canon timeline. With so much creativity and potential to impact the larger franchise, there are plenty of reasons to be excited about a potential Star Wars: Visions season 3.\nRelated: How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order\nWhile the release of Star Wars: Visions season 3 is highly probable, Lucasfilm has not officially confirmed it. This is understandable since Star Wars: Visions season 2 came out in May 2023, and there are plenty of other shows to keep fans busy and upcoming Star Wars movies to get audiences excited. It will likely be some time before Lucasfilm needs to announce any details about Star Wars: Visions season 3.\nThe popularity of Star Wars: Visions season 1 and 2 is the most significant reason for season 3 to happen. As a massive multimedia franchise, Star Wars can sometimes feel repetitive and hard to keep up with, but Star Wars: Visions focuses on unique standalone stories. Each studio has complete freedom to use a different animation style and experiment with how to tell a Star Wars story.\nBased on past release dates, Star Wars: Visions season will probably be released on May 4, 2023. Season 1 dropped in September 2021, but season 2 came out on Star Wars Day in 2023, a much more effective release date. Star Wars: Visions season 3 may be a long way out, but Star Wars fans have plenty of content to look forward to in the meantime, and it will surely be worth the wait.\n"}
{"title": "Marvel Heroes Show Off Their Winter Apparel in New Ski Chalet Cover Series", "date": "2023-10-02 21:00:28", "text": "Marvel Comics heroes like Storm, Captain America and White Widow hit the slopes in new winter apparel for a series of ski chalet variant covers.\nFall may have just arrived, but a new line of ski chalet variant covers from Marvel preview several heroic favorites in the wintry months to come. Iconic heroes like Storm and Captain America are joined by rising stars such as White Widow and Spider-Boy for this series of snowy portraits. Fashion-inspired variant covers are not new to Marvel Comics, which has made waves with its haute couture-infused Hellfire Gala covers for the past three years. Of course, no one necessarily needs a special occasion to be fashionable, and this surprise showcase of winter apparel is a welcome treat.\nMarvel recently announced the series alongside a preview of five out of the total seven ski chalet variants.\nLucas Werneck's variant for Thunderbolts #1 and Russel Dauterman's cover for X-Men #29 debut on December 6. The following week, Greg Land's contribution for Captain America #4 arrives. The next three covers all hit the shelves on December 20, featuring J. Scott Campbell on Amazing Spider-Man #40, Pablo Villalobos for Doctor Strange #10, and Humberto Ramos' variant for Spider-Boy #2. David Nakayama concludes the festivities on December 27 with a cover for Spider-Woman #2.\nNakayama and Campbell's covers have not been revealed yet, but Marvel's announcement still provides the five other variants. The result is a veritable feast for the eyes. Werneck brings a signature level of beauty and grace to his action shot of the White Widow Yelena Belova. Land, often critiqued for the use of tracing in his comic work, delivers a pleasant surprise with his fresh rendition of Steve Rogers in a retro ski suit. However, Dauterman's Storm is perhaps the most notable of the series thus far, as the snow-robed Wind-Rider is transcendent. Ororo Munroe has proven quite the muse for Dauterman, as he designed Storm's current costume and has brought the consistent rendering of her natural hair texture into the mainstream at Marvel.\nWhile Marvel has certainly been working more fashion-inspired concepts into its variants in recent years, this trend is nothing new. Just as many of Marvel's writers in the '70s were authors who could only find consistent work in comics, numerous artists in the same era were fashion illustrators taking on side gigs in comic work. This trained eye for design is why so many iconic character looks and costumes have endured from that era until today. Arguably though, the zenith of the fashion industry's influence on Marvel Comics was the annual Marvel Swimsuit Special that ran from 1991 to 1995. What's old is new, and Marvel is certainly feeling fashion fever once again.\nOnly two covers have yet to reveal their take on heroic hilltop apparel. However, winter extends beyond December, and if this initial set of ski chalet variants is met with success, it's more than likely next year will bring even more Marvel icons to the slopes. Either way, there's plenty to enjoy with this series of variant covers as some of Marvel's favorite heroes have a snowy holiday.\nThe ski chalet variant cover series will be available from Marvel Comics starting December 6.\nSource: Marvel Comics\nJonathan Jones is a freelance comics content writer at Screen Rant, reviewing new issues and generally nerding out online.

{"title": "For All Mankind: Astronaut Confirms Horrifying Death In Apple TV+ Sci-Fi Show Is Realistic", "date": "2023-10-02 21:05:11", "text": "Astronaut Chris Hadfield breaks down the accuracy of shooting a gun on the moon in a scene from the acclaimed Apple TV+ series For All Mankind.\nAstronaut Chris Hadfield has confirmed the accuracy of a death in the series For All Mankind. The series follows an alternate reality in which the Soviet Union landed on the moon before the United States and the space race never ended. Each season has taken a time jump that delves further into what a continued competition between the world's superpowers would look like if they kept striving for the stars.\nAhead of the release of For All Mankind season 4, Hadfield breaks down a scene for Vanity Fair where he is shown a scene in which an American astronaut shoots a Soviet astronaut on the moon.\nHe discussed how gunfire on the moon is much more accurate as opposed to on Earth, citing the lack of air and oxygen, thus making the bullet shoot straighter and farther. Along with confirming the accuracy of the gunfire in the scene, he went on to explain how the impact of a bullet on a space suit was also true to life:\nIt's a hundred percent oxygen inside a spacesuit, so everything burns. We have had a fire inside a spacewalking suit. It was in test at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and even the aluminum was burning inside the suit. Fortunately, there was not a person in the suit. You don't want any sparks to be even possible inside a hundred percent oxygen environment.\nWhile earlier in his review of For All Mankind Hadfield bashed it as \"excruciating to watch\", he was impressed with the shooting scene. Hadfield had previously researched how guns would fire on the moon for his fiction thriller, The Apollo Murders. His praise comes not only from the point of view of an astronaut, but also as a storyteller. And compared to the accuracy of movies like Moonfall, For All Mankind has a lot going for it.\nDespite calling some of For All Mankind \"cartoonish\" after only a few episodes, the narrative of the show does at times supersede realistic science. This isn't the only film in which Hadfield pointed out inconsistencies. Notably, he commended on Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 for the scene that shows Star-Lord floating through space unprotected. Hadfield chalked this up to a viewer's experience, stating that it would have been done to more entice audiences. Another interesting scenario that Hadfield felt would be accurate if it ever occurred was the concept of someone born in space as shown in The Expanse.\nWhile For All Mankind may not hold up in all aspects, the show has taken an interesting premise and still clearly puts forth an effort in the topics it handles. Hadfield's critiques do make the show more interesting, especially when he points out the parts that line up with scientific accuracy.\nSource: Vanity Fair\n"}
{"title": "Why Daryl Dixon & Codron Can't Be Friends According To Walking Dead Star", "date": "2023-10-02 21:19:29", "text": "The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon star Romain Levi explains why Daryl and his character, Codron, can't be friends after what Daryl did to his brother.\nWarning: SPOILERS ahead for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 4! \nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon star Romain Levi has opened up about why his character, Codron, can never be friends with Daryl. In episode 1 of the spinoff series, Daryl kills Codron's brother, resulting in the Pouvoir Guerrier pursuing Daryl for revenge. The pair have fought twice so far, with Daryl gaining the upper hand or escaping Codron's grasp each time.\nSpeaking with Collider, Levi explained that, because Daryl killed Codron's brother, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon likely won't feature the pair becoming allies. He described how difficult it would be for Codron to forgive Daryl because his brother was such a major part of who he was. Check out what Levi had to say below:\nWhat happened between Daryl and his brother, it’s not easy for Codron to forgive or be respectful. In a way, to forgive someone is to accept what happened, and Codron doesn’t accept the situation. His brother was a part of himself, really, and Codron will never be the same after that. His brother was the only human being that he was very close to. And what would his brother think, if Codron were friends with Daryl? I’m not sure he’d be so happy about that. So, I won’t say yes he can or no he can’t because it’s not so easy in this situation.\nCodron's path of revenge against Daryl has only grown stronger as the Walking Dead series has progressed. This includes Codron going directly to the leader of the Pouvoir, Genet, to get a group of soldiers to help him in his quest to kill Daryl. His vengeance is fed into by Genet, who wants Daryl dead for destroying important research aboard one of the Pouvoir's ships before the start of the series.\nCodron's new faction in The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon wants Daryl dead just as much as he does. This means that, even if his allegiances were to change, he is still under orders to kill Daryl. He may also be tasked with killing Laurent, since Genet wants the boy dead for the optimism he brings the Union of Hope. If he were to succeed, this would further drive a wedge between him and Daryl.\nHowever, Genet's plan to kill Laurent could also be what makes Codron decide to stop hunting Daryl. The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon trailer teases Codron will hold Laurent at gunpoint, but it's unclear if he will kill the boy. Perhaps Codron will realize the monster he would become by killing a child, deciding to stop seeking revenge against Daryl not for himself, but for Laurent. However, with Daryl and Laurent escaping Paris in episode 4, anything could happen as season 1 reaches its apex.\nSource: Collider\n"}
{"title": "How Many People Actually Died In Pompeii", "date": "2023-10-02 21:21:26", "text": "Because Pompeii focuses on individual characters more than the community, the movie may leave viewers wondering about the real event’s death count.\nAfter watching Pompeii, viewers may be left wondering how many people died in the real-life tragedy the film is based on. The action romance movie tells the story of a Celtic gladiator named Milo who falls in love with a woman named Cassia and escapes slavery. Pompeii's story unravels in the days leading up to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. By the end of the movie, all the main characters have perished.\nThough scientists praised the movie for its relatively realistic depiction of the volcanic eruption and the city, Pompeii's true story had a vastly different aftermath. Mount Vesuvius impacted a wider area than what's shown on-screen, and the death toll looked quite different. Numerous people died due to the eruption, which included multiple waves. However, some escaped the impact and went on to live elsewhere.\nRELATED: 5 Best (& 5 Worst) Movies About Volcanoes\nPompeii doesn't specifically reveal how many people died in the tragedy, taking a narrative approach instead. In real life, approximately 2,000 people died in Pompeii due to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Unfortunately, the death toll included many more individuals than those located in Pompeii. The number is much higher when counting the deaths of people in Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae, Torre Annunziata, and other villages in the region (via Britannica). In total, History estimates that the number could be as high as 16,000 casualties.\nThe movie Pompeii opens with a quote from a letter in late 107 A.D. — not 79 A.D., the year of the eruption — written by Pliny the Younger, a Roman lawyer and author, to a historian named Tacitus. Combining his words and the images of the \"Two Maidens\" of Pompeii, the opening helps frame the events of the movie. The quote reads:\n\"In the darkness, you could hear the crying of women, the wailing of infants, and the shouting of men. Some prayed for help. Others wished for death. But, still, more imagined that there were no Gods left, and that the universe was plunged into eternal darkness.\"\nConsidering Pliny the Younger witnessed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius firsthand and survived to write about the event in letters, viewers can surmise that people survived the events of Pompeii. However, the movie doesn't actually depict any survivors. Instead, Milo and Cassia end up dying due to the fireballs and pyroclastic flow, even though they attempt to leave the city.\nRELATED: 10 Best Disaster Movies Ever, Ranked\nDespite the Pompeii movie's portrayal of events, volcanologist Claudio Scarpati and his colleagues found that 73% to 92% of citizens successfully escaped the town during the initial signs of Mount Vesuvius' eruption. It's unknown exactly how many of that percentage survived in the long run because people outside the walls of Pompeii, especially those in the nearby city of Herculaneum, died due to the second wave of pyroclastic flow (via NBC News). It's heavily debated by scholars how many people escaped the tragic aftermath of the eruption. Ultimately, despite what the movie Pompeii implies, it's approximated that several thousands of individuals lived.\nSources: Britannica, History, NBC News\nDani Kessel Odom (they/them) works as a Core Features Shift Writer for Screen Rant.

The Slytherin student was Harry's Hogwarts rival for most of the Harry Potter series, but after joining Lord Voldemort, Draco discovered that he didn't enjoy Darkness as much as he had thought. Still, the character never truly got a redemption, instead choosing to be passive in the Second Wizarding War. The Harry Potter movies attempted to remedy this by adding a heroic scene for Draco Malfoy, but it was ultimately removed from Deathly Hallows Part 2's final cut.\nAt the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, what everyone presumed was Harry Potter's body was carried by Hagrid to the Hogwarts courtyard. Voldemort hoped that the Boy Who Lived's death would squash the resistance at the Castle, but he was wrong. Of course, Harry was actually still alive. In a deleted scene from this sequence, Draco Malfoy sees Harry get to his feet and rushes across the courtyard to toss him his wand. This scene never made it into the film, a fact that Draco fans have lamented for years.\nRELATED: Harry Potter Cast - Where Are They Now?\nDraco Malfoy was far from a true villain in Harry Potter, but he certainly had some rough moments. Deeply prejudiced against Muggle-borns, he established himself as a not-so-pleasant person the moment that Harry Potter met him. However, things changed for the character in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Voldemort had made him a Death Eater to punish his father, Lucius Malfoy, and gave him the seemingly impossible task of murdering Albus Dumbledore. The pressure of this began to tear Draco apart.\nThough he wasn't nearly as nasty after this in Harry Potter, and Harry even mentioned in the books that he felt a good deal of pity for his old rival, Draco never had a moment in which he took any sort of stand against Voldemort. Instead, he passively shrunk into the corner and waited for the horror to end. The deleted scene in Deathly Hallows Part 2 would have definitively answered whose side Draco was on and would have proven that he had it in him to be a hero. Of course, such a thing never happened in the books either, and it was for an excellent reason.\nWhen he entered the Forbidden Forest in Deathly Hallows, Harry already had Draco's wand. In fact, this was a key detail of this impactful moment. Though Draco hadn't known it, he had been the master of the Elder Wand since the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, when he disarmed Albus Dumbledore before Snape killed him. Though it wasn't the Elder Wand itself, Draco's wand became a sort of symbol of the wand's ownership. Therefore, when Harry wrenched it from Draco's hand at Malfoy Manor, the Elder Wand shifted its loyalty to Harry.\nThis moment at Malfoy Manor was included in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, so it's unclear how the deleted scene in Deathly Hallows Part 2 would have explained why Draco suddenly had the wand again at the Battle of Hogwarts. Even with some justification, though, this would have presented a significant problem. Wand loyalty doesn't transfer when a witch or wizard willingly gives their wand to another individual—there are countless times in Harry Potter that a borrowed wand was noted to not work properly for the borrower. Therefore, if Draco had given Harry his wand, Harry wouldn't have become master of the Elder Wand and would have lost his battle against Voldemort.\nAs previously mentioned, the deleted scene in Deathly Hallows may have come with some justification for how Draco got his wand back. Of course, he couldn't have forcefully acquired it from Harry because then the Elder Wand's loyalty would have shifted back to Draco. However, if Harry had somehow dropped the wand at the Battle of Hogwarts, and Draco picked it up, returning it to Harry in a big moment of bravery and redemption might not have messed with the Elder Wand's loyalty. Still, this would have been pretty muddy ground for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 to wade through.\nWand loyalty may have been the key to Harry Potter's ending, but many questions remain unanswered about how it works. For example, even dropping a wand could be grounds for lost loyalty. Still, if Harry had dropped Draco's wand, would that have affected the Elder Wand - or would he have had to drop the Death Stick itself? It's all a little too complicated, which is likely why Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 deleted this scene to begin with. Ultimately, Draco was better off with an ambiguous redemption, no matter how great it would have been to see him join Harry's side.\n"}
{"title": "Nightwing & Superboy as Pokémon Trainers Proves DC NEEDS to Organize a Crossover", "date": "2023-10-02 21:30:28", "text": "In recent years, DC Comics has shown incredible creative foresight in its crossover content, but a Pokémon crossover would be a great opportunity.\nDespite DC Comics' willingness to take on crossovers and teams-ups with non-traditional partners or explore putting its heroes in situations outside the primary canonic DC universe, new fanart exposes its need to collaborate with Pokémon, one of the most popular and widely known franchises on Earth.\nNow the worlds of DC Comics and Pokémon have been brought together in works of fanart by the artist malenjoyer. In a pair of posts on Instagram, malenjoyer imagines Dick Grayson's Nightwing and Conner Kent's Superboy as Pokémon trainers with their Pokémon ready for battle.\nWhile malenjoyer's art is fascinating in and of itself, an equally interesting element to the illustrations is the suggestions it makes for DC - Pokémon crossover. Judging by the feedback both illustrations have gotten so far, it's a crossover event that would be quite popular with the fans.\nThe need for a DC Comics/Pokémon crossover is made all the stronger when considering the publisher's impressive recent history of non-traditional collaborations. \"Non-traditional\" in this context refers to crossovers that are not just between superheroes, but can include a range of content. Brian Buccellato and Christian Duce's upcoming Justice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong miniseries is a perfect illustration of the creative crossovers DC has been willing to explore. Indeed, this series is not your grandfather's crossover. As the title suggests, the story involves the DC's Justice League taking on Legendary Pictures' Monsterverse royalty. It's not the kind of crossover one would expect from a comic book publisher, but it is one that makes sense from a thematic and entertainment perspective.\nDC Comics has also found success in expanding the horizons of its superhero line-up by putting them in alternate reality situations that do not normally include heroes. Daniel Warren Johnson and Juan Gedeon's The Jurassic League limited series is emblematic of how DC has been successfully experimenting with this material in recent years. The story reimagines the Justice League as composed of a group of super-powered dinosaurs who resemble Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Similarly, their enemies - like the Joker - are also super-powered dinosaurs with human characteristics.\nThere are other series that demonstrate that further express DC's creative willingness to take on next-gen crossovers, collaborations, and alternate universe stories. For example, there's James Tynion IV and Matthew Rosenberg's DC vs. Vampires, which see DC heroes confront a plague of vampires. There's also Kenny Porter and Baldemar Rivas' DC Mech, which has heroes suiting up in giant mechanical robots to fight their battles. Incidentally, DC Mech draws from the same rich world of anime and manga that Pokémon is from.\nAll this content reinforces the idea that DC needs to establish a crossover with Pokémon. As malenjoyer shows in his art, tabbing a Pokémon to a specific DC hero has the potential to create a landmark crossover. First, there's Pokemon's current global popularity. Matching it with an equally popular DC hero or villain is a recipe for success. Who wouldn't want to see a Batman versus Joker Pokémon battle? Second, there's the ease of two-world integration. In Pokémon, anyone can be a Pokémon trainer or owner. So, it wouldn't be strange for a hero to also be one too. Third, it's a collaboration that offers an extremely broad range of story options. There are no limits to the stories that can be generated from a collaboration. All things taken into consideration, a DC Comics - Pokémon crossover seems like a match made in collaboration heaven. This leaves fans to wonder why one has not occurred yet and demand that one NEEDS to occur soon.\nSource: malenjoyer via Instagram (1, 2)\nMarcel Green is a writer for Screen Rant's Comics and Anime Sections."}
{"title": "Sister Wives: Christine Left LuLaRoe (8 Ways The Company's &quot;Culty&quot;)", "date": "2023-10-02 21:48:19", "text": "Sister Wives star Christine Brown's been linked with LuLaRoe, but she's actually cut ties with the firm. Was the clothing business too \"culty\"? \nSister Wives star Christine Brown isn't affiliated with LuLaRoe anymore, and since the searing documentary LuLaRich aired, she may be trying to distance herself from the company. In season 18, Christine's reinventing herself. She left Kody Brown, and seems quite happy to be free of him. However, she does resent him at times, especially when he mistreats her close friend Janelle Brown. Christine's so over polygamy with reality show star Kody. However, embracing life without the patriarch isn't the only change that she's making. In love and business, she's evolving.\nSister Wives season 18's featured some memorable drama so far, but Janelle's issues with Kody probably deliver the most riveting onscreen entertainment. Janelle and Kody are having serious problems, and although she thinks he's \"hot,\" she wants to go to couples' counseling with him. Janelle doesn't see another way out of their problems, and she's really losing hope. Christine's focusing on the future, but she's willing to be friends with Kody. He thinks she's playing some kind of game, but more often than not, Christine's 100 percent sincere. A straight shooter, Christine values directness in others. She's all about emotional honesty. She may consider LuLaRoe a little too shady.\nRelated: Did Christine From Sister Wives Get Engaged Too Fast? (Will David Woolley Let Her Down Like Kody Did?)\nIn LuLaRich, people who tried to sell the company's leggings and other products were often disappointed by the quality of the merchandise that they received. Some got stinky leggings because the fabric was moldy and rotting. It's not uncommon for people to sink a lot of their savings into building LuLaRoe ventures. There's a cult mentality that gets recruits excited about being a part of the organization. This may drive overspending. Said recruits sell the products from home, and when quality is poor, they're much more likely to lose money.\nChristine's an honorable person who may not want to risk linking her name with the company anymore. She's got a new man, David Woolley, and doesn't seem to be strapped for cash. Her place in Utah, which was shown in season 18, looks very nice. Janelle's the one who's having money issues. Christine's engaged, and that means that she's probably sharing expenses with David. That may be another reason why she chose to stop promoting LuLaRoe.\nLuLaRich showed the dark side of a seemingly sunny company. This firm appears to primarily target women, promising them income, clout and perks. However, those who want to sell LuLaRoe need to spend money in order to get started. That's the first red flag. When people need to buy the products that they sell, it's often the hallmark of an MLM scheme.\nMulti-level marketing (MLM) is about drawing people in at the bottom of the pyramid. The money that people at the bottom spend helps to line the pockets of the people on top. Without bringing in more people at the bottom, the system falls apart. So, basically, with a pyramid scheme, money's made by recruiting new salespeople who buy products. That's often much more important to CEOs than sales to end users i.e. the people who buy (and wear) the bold and colorful leggings.\nIn other words, the money that the salespeople spend is what makes the company's owners so rich. Anyone who wants to thrive in an MLM needs to aggressively recruit. There can be a brainwashing mindset in pyramid scheme companies. Quite often, LuLaRoe salespeople, such as Meri Brown, are encouraged to pester friends, family and others in order to bring them aboard. Lives have been ruined by MLM companies. People buy into the dream and end up in debt, with their hopes dashed.\nIn LuLaRich, many wrenching stories were captured on film. While some people had positive experiences, those who ended up with nothing were stressed and heartbroken. They fell hook, line and sinker for the marketing patter that LuLaRoe owners Mark and DeAnne Stidham deliver, and deeply regret being so naive. Some have homes filled with unsold merchandise, including defective products that no one is likely to buy.\nSince the company gets such bad press now, it's not that surprising that Christine stopped promoting it. It's actually a pretty smart decision. It's a choice that's easy to respect.\nPart of the whole cult mentality's selling a dream. Cult leaders know how to dazzle their \"marks.\" They promise whatever the person doesn't have. In a typical cult, a vulnerable person who feels lonely will be made to feel like an integral part of a group. However, there's always a price to be paid down the line. For example, the cult member might be asked to do unpaid labor (as in Scientology's Sea Org) or cut off any friends and family members who criticize the cult. A cult member might also be asked to give money to the organization.\nWhile LuLaRoe isn't a bona fide cult, it has a lot in common with a true cult. People who want to be rich are drawn in by glitzy success stories from members. As well, the company puts on events where the dream is intensively sold to the team. For example, the Puerto Vallarta get-together shown above sends the message that life as a LuLaRoe representative means fun in the sun, freedom from financial worries, and good times with coworkers.\nIf a person buys enough products and sells them, they might be included at this type of VIP event. Then, they can live the dream. Of course, few make the cut. Those who never scale those heights may find that they've blown thousands (or even tens of thousands) of dollars on products and never really turned a profit. For every LuLaRoe success story like Meri's, there are many \"fails\" that don't get publicized. That's why the Washington State Attorney General sued LuLaRoe. The company had to pay 4.75 million USD in damages, as per Yahoo.\nAbove, a happy model extols the virtues of \"twirl-worthy moments,\" as per LuLaRoe at Instagram. The woman wearing the ruffled LuLaRoe frock seems confident and serene. She's there to make other women want what she has. While LuLaRoe representatives may really get that \"twirl-worthy\" feeling at first, it's just too good to last. The joy linked with joining the company is often fleeting.\nIn the life cycle of a cult, members start out strong, fully believing in the reality that's shoved down their throats. However, as time passes, many cult members get cynical. They notice abuses that make them question the lives they've chosen. Disillusionment's quite common, and people who escape from cults often feel traumatized. Some never move past their pain.\nWith LuLaRoe, there's also been disillusionment. For example, when representatives tried to return defective leggings and the like, they were given a hard time, and many were stuck with the flawed merchandise. They weren't taken care of. A cult chews up and spits out members, and it seems like LuLaRoe's done the very same.\nShould Meri be ashamed of pushing LuLaRoe designs on her Instagram followers? Maybe. While she seems to be having a positive experience with the company, she must be smart enough to know that famous and influential LuLaRose reps get VIP treatment. To create a comparison, Tom Cruise is going to enjoy life as a Scientologist more than the average Joe will. Tom will be treated with kid gloves, but other members may be treated like slaves.\nWhen Meri promotes such as a culty company, that's actually been legally penalized for its business practices, she may be sucking in women (and men too) who won't get special treatment. They may pour their savings down the drain in order to try and live Meri's reality. Christine left the company, and Meri's still a part of it. Meri loves the conferences and everything else that LuLaRoe provides. However, she may be willfully ignoring some painful truths about the firm.\nMeri and Christine promoted LuLaRoe, and, as previously mentioned, Meri's still doing it. In their promotional posts, they made the company look like the answer to their prayers. When people see LuLaRoe reps succeeding so wildly, and fail the get the same results, they may feel very bad about themselves. Of course, a reality TV show star has a much higher chance of making money in an MLM company. Fame is currency that can be leveraged to get the most from new business opportunities.\nMeri isn't a typical LuLaRoe member. Thanks to appearing in 18 Sister Wives seasons, she's very famous. Her online platform is massive, and that means that she has a pool of potential LuLaRoe recruits at her fingertips. The average person who's starting out with the company won't have any of that. In a sense, this company sells the stories of its stars, and sets recruits up to fail. Without success in an MLM, a person is basically nobody. Everything revolves around money and the status that selling brings. When someone fails, they may feel excommunicated.\nPromising the moon and then failing to honor return policies is bad business and shady. It's the type of gaslighting that leads to court cases and other negative outcomes. Good companies will accept returns of defective products. Sketchy firms will make it almost impossible for people to get their money back. Phones will go unanswered. Messages left on social media will be ignored and/or deleted. Bad companies do this stuff all the time.\nIn a cult, a leader will also gaslight underlings, making them believe that they're the problem. A leader retains power by inspiring, or by instilling fear and doubt. It's typically one or the other. A good leader will care about underlings, while a bad one won't value them, except as a means to an end.\nChristine knows all about bad leadership. She experienced it with Kody. The uber-patriarch didn't do much to steer the Brown family forward. He favored Robyn and neglected the other wives. When they complained, he twisted things around to make them feel like villains. It could be argued that a plural marriage can be a sort of micro-cult. A leader calls the shots and wives obey. If they don't, they may be punished. At the least, they'll learn what gaslighting really means.\nDevotees like Meri probably don't get fleeced because they add so much value, but a typical LuLaRoe initiate will be strongly encouraged to spend, spend, spend...perhaps, until it hurts. Cults are known for fleecing followers. Some cult leaders live like royalty while their underlings have very little. There's always a huge chasm between the highly successful VIPS and those at the bottom.\nA worthy organization is not going to have this dynamic. There will be more fairness, and those who need help will get it, rather than being ignored. There's no such thing as a good cult, and there may be no such thing as a good MLM either. When Meri promotes the LuLaRoe \"good life,\" she's probably not helping her followers. They might end up wasting a lot of money trying to grab brass rings. Since Christine's finished with the company, she can focus on promoting more positive things. However, Christine's link with Plexus dietary supplements is also controversial.\nInfluencers often push shady products, such as diet teas and \"pink drinks.\" They do it for money. As long as their followers perform research, to find out the truth about what their favorite stars are promoting, they should make smart choices. If they don't, they may end up feeling ripped off.\nIn Sister Wives season 18, Christine's spreading her wings and leaving the past behind. She left LuLaRoe behind too. By sealing herself off from the bad vibes that Kody and the clothing company bring, she's doing what's best for herself. Now, she can focus on things that make her happy.\nSources: Yahoo, LuLaRoeInstagram\n"}
{"title": "Halloween: Where Is Haddonfield? Filming & Movie Location", "date": "2023-10-02 21:50:27", "text": "Halloween's Haddonfield, Illinois isn't a real place but rather a creative mix of several locations that create the haunting setting for the film.\nOne of the scariest aspects of John Carpenter’s Halloween is the suggestion that the film's horrific events could happen in any typical American suburban town. In the 1978 horror classic, that town is the fictional Haddonfield, Illinois located in Livingston County. While some may make the assumption that Haddonfield is a real town, the film's crew members creatively blended several locations together to create the vision that Carpenter had in mind for his ideal horror setting.\nHaddonfield, Illinois is the perfect backdrop for Michael Myers and his silent reign of terror, being a picturesque and presumably safe autumnal town. Large Victorian homes line the streets along with impressive lawns and plenty of trees, making it an ideal Midwestern town before Michael shows up. Halloween was so effective because it introduced intense threats and elements of fear in an idyllic location. Finding such a perfect town to shoot in might have been difficult if it weren't for the fact that Haddonfield, as Halloween fans know it, isn't a real place.\nRELATED: Halloween’s Franchise Future Is Promising, But It Will Only Work With Michael Myers\nHaddonfield, Illinois may not be real, but it is based on a real town named Haddonfield. The actual Haddonfield is in southern New Jersey, not too far from Philadelphia. Debra Hill, who co-wrote and produced Halloween with John Carpenter, was from Haddonfield which inspired the town's name in the movie. Because of this detail, there has been a common misconception that Halloween was shot in Haddonfield, New Jersey. Interestingly, the towns do look quite similar considering both have plenty of trees and large single-family homes, including some in a similar Victorian style.\nThe actual filming locations for Halloween were entirely shot in Los Angeles, California, and South Pasadena. Shooting for Halloween was done over the course of 20 days mostly in South Pasadena, California with some additional filming in Alhambra, Sierra Madre, and Hollywood in May 1978. Considering that Halloween is supposed to take place in the fall, set designers had difficulties filming in California in the spring. The crew used artificial leaves to cover the ground and were forced to work around consistent sun exposure by finding rare wooded areas. Viewers who pay close attention will notice palm trees in the background of shots at certain points of the movie.\nRELATED: Halloween Can Finally Return To John Carpenter’s Original Franchise Plan After 40 Years & 5 Reboots\nThe real house of Michael Myers used in Halloween is located at 1000 Mission Street, South Pasadena, California, USA. The house is still standing today and is privately owned by a massage therapist, meaning that it does not operate as a tourist attraction for Halloween fans. The house resides next to a railroad and is only accessible by one main road. It does not have any other filming credits to its name. There is a fictional replica of Michael Myers' house that is located in North Carolina where fans can visit and take pictures without entering the property. While Haddonfield may not be a real place, Halloween successfully created the perfect small town for a new horror franchise to be born that continues to this day.\n"}
{"title": "Karl Saint Lucy & Marius de Vries On The Songs & Music Of Dicks: The Musical", "date": "2023-10-02 21:56:34", "text": "Dicks: The Musical songwriters and composers Karl Saint Lucy and Marius de Vries talk turning an unhinged UCB one-act into A24’s first musical.\nDicks: The Musical is somehow even more wild than its name implies, making A24’s first musical feel like a big swing for the production company. It’s a gamble that audiences will likely be glad A24 took; what began roughly a decade ago as a musical performed in a cramped Upright Citizens Brigade theater in Manhattan has morphed into a film that aims for the heart as much as humor. The movie was written by Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp--also its stars and the creators of the UCB musical--and directed by Larry Charles (Borat). \nJackson and Sharp were also the songwriters behind Dicks: The Musical, though they had help. Songwriter and composer Karl Saint Lucy has worked with the pair since their UCB days and returns for the film along with Marius de Vries, an Oscar-winning composer whose previous work includes CODA, Kick-Ass, and Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet. Together, the film’s songwriters have crafted catchy and hilarious pieces for the film’s cast, which includes Nathan Lane, Megan Mullally, and Megan Thee Stallion.\nRelated: The 20 Best Musicals Of All Time\nKarl Saint Lucy and Marius de Vries spoke with Screen Rant about their work on Dicks: The Musical, working with Nathan Lane and Megan Mullally, and more. Note: This interview was conducted during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, and the film covered here would not exist without the labor of the writers and actors in both unions. This interview has also been lightly edited for clarity and length.\nScreen Rant: Karl, I believe you did the stage version of this back at UCB in New York. I'm sure it had to be expanded, but how much changed once more people started getting involved and you had to start thinking about putting it on screen?\nKarl Saint Lucy: Oh, I mean, just about everything. There’s very little from that show that exists in the same form than it did. One of the things that I thought was going to be a challenge when they made it into full-length show is that it was a 30-minute UCB show--all of those shows are, like, 30 minutes long--so a lot of those jokes and the comedy had to do with the fact that they're changing wigs and everything is happening so quickly. So, initially I didn't think it was going to work, because I was like, \"Oh my God, the center of the comedy of the show is the fact that it's so time limited.\" But they worked on it with Larry for a really long time, and I think they did a great job.\nMarius, how did you find your way here?\nMarius de Vries: I was introduced to Josh and Aaron something like seven years ago by our lead producer Kori at Chernin, and at that point the movie was up and in development at 20th Century Fox, back when it was 20th Century Fox, which gave me some pause. I wondered, as things came to fruition, whether someone at Fox might notice that it's not something that they perhaps would want representing the Fox brand. I just had a suspicion that that might be the case. And then, of course Disney came along, and my suspicions were redoubled and indeed right, because we lost that connection. But thank God we did, because we found a new parent in A24 who were nothing but supportive and just allowed us to cause the maximum amount of mayhem without interfering. So hats off to them for their courage and patience in that regard.\nThere was a period where the whole thing was asleep, and we didn't have a director. Then, they found Larry, recontacted me, I picked up the thread, and then we just rolled our sleeves up and started making it. It was a long and twisty journey, but I knew from that first meeting I had in Silver Lake with the twins seven years ago [that] there was something really special here, and I was delighted to have the opportunity to see it through.\nHow did the collaboration work between the two of you and the two of them? Did they do all the lyrics and did you two do the orchestrations?\nKarl Saint Lucy: The lyrics are by the boys. I wrote the melodies and harmonies of the songs. I did most of the orchestration of the songs. Marius, of course, was the music producer for all the songs, and was a hugely influential part of the songwriting process as we did that, and helped to punch up the orchestrations and everything once we were in post-production. Then the score, really, is a marriage of our work. A lot of it is thematic, so it pulls materials from the songs, and Marius did a lot of that work, and I did some of it as well.\nSo, when you hear the underscoring, it might be 32 bars of Marius and then 16 bars of Karl, and then something that we worked on together. I think the music for this really is a great marriage of what both Marius and I brought to this. And, of course, when you're writing a song, you're sometimes making some tweaks to the lyrics and stuff, so there were a few moments where either Marius or I proposed to the boys that maybe there should be a lyric changed. But by and large, they were the lyricists, I was the songwriter, and Marius and I were both the composer.\nMarius de Vries: What's kind of interesting about the process that I discovered as we got into developing new material for the show is that Josh and Aaron [would] kind of put a phone on the table and sing an acapella version of the song. In many respects, it's actually pretty close to how it turned out, so I think you'd agree, Karl, that it's not a traditional “sitting around the piano” song composition process. It's more of a relay.\nKarl Saint Lucy: Exactly. And they always know how the songs are going to stand [and] they know how they're going to move, so having that information coming into the songwriting process was hugely important.\nHow much were the vocals done on set versus in the studio? Because I would've guessed in the studio and then there was an outtake, I think, of Megan Mullally on the set belting something out.\nMarius de Vries: I'd hesitate to put a percentage on it because I haven't dug through it and worked that out, but a lot of it was recorded live. Most of the twin stuff was live on set. A lot of Megan was live on set, and a fair amount of Nathan was. Megan [Thee Stallion] was lip-synced. I'm a big fan, without getting fetishistic about it, of recording on set, because you get a kind of verisimilitude that is very difficult to achieve with pre-records. I was pleased that, even in an extremely condensed 20-day shoot, we were given the opportunity to slow things down and do what you need to do to get good live takes, and that we were able to use a fair amount of them.\nWere there musicals that you two used as reference, either in songwriting or orchestrating? One of my favorite things about this is how sweet the music sounds paired with these insane lyrics.\nMarius de Vries: I wasn't aware of any specific references. In fact, we were just talking about how we believe that one of the strengths of this is that, in spite of [the fact that] we're going for comedy as much as we can in the songs, there's almost nothing that's to do with parody and referentiality. The songs live on their own. Also, there's a great sincerity to the performance and the composition of the songs that helps support the fact that they're also undermining themselves all the time, referring to themselves, and poking fun at themselves. There’s such a strong emotional core to the songwriting that I think that's what makes the show so involving.\nKarl Saint Lucy: To Marius's point, we were not referential to anything, but if you wanted to talk about shows that I think do some of the things that we do, or have some of the same sensibility, I'm thinking of the Full Monty with the score by David Yazbek. This is a show that's very funny but has some really earnest and emotional moments. I don't know that my work sounds like David Yazbek, but certainly I was drawing from those songs. And Seth McFarlane's work, I think was really in my ear a lot for this as well.\nMarius de Vries: I think if I had a North Star, it would've been the Rocky Horror Show. Not in terms of its content at all, but just in terms of its impact and its sensibility.\nKarl Saint Lucy: And Reefer Madness, the musical, too. It’s funny, I watched Reefer Madness for the first time in a few years the other day, and they also have a scene where oysters and spaghetti are being served at the same time, which I thought was so funny.\nI want to ask about some specific songs because, first off, Megan Thee Stallion's song is so great. I think that's going to be one that people talk about, for sure. Do you know if she was involved with the writing of it at all? Did she have ideas or was she just down to do whatever? \nMarius de Vries: We had to turn that number around insanely fast because Megan was cast at quite a late stage, and the material that we had prepared for that moment was in no way suitable for Megan Thee Stallion to perform. We had to give her something. We knew that she'd bring her own thing to it, but this was barely days before we started shooting, and we only had one day of rehearsal with her and two days on set. We had to take something which was basically kind of a old-fashioned showtune and give it some sort of DNA that she'd be able to connect to.\nWe stopped working on everything else, scrambled together a very quick demo, and with profuse apologies, sent it to her and said, \"This really isn't what you're used to, but see what you can do with this,” and she was a champion. She turned it around in a day, sent us back a more or less finished vocal, came in and rehearsed it. The choreographers had to put it up in about 12 hours. 36 hours later we were shooting it. I'm not sure that we all believed that it was actually going to happen as we were doing that, but the gods were smiling on us. Bowen was smiling on us.\nThe next thing I was going to ask was about “Desperate for your Love”, and just generally just getting Nathan Lane and Megan Mullally to do the things that they do in this. How were they? Did they take any convincing?\nMarius de Vries: Nathan would turn out to work every morning and say, \"This is the greatest mistake of my professional career.\" And it was only last night that he finally admitted that it wasn't.\nKarl Saint Lucy: I told him on set that this movie was going to be his apotheosis.\nMarius de Vries: They were both incredibly game, and I think they knew walking into it that the only way to get through this and make it work was to embrace the extremity. So they knew they had to do that, but it can't have been comfortable for them at times.\nKarl Saint Lucy: It was really interesting to watch the different ways that they approach this. Nathan, very Stanislavski, needs to understand where the character is coming from psychologically. There was this whole thing about [how] he wanted his character to be a famous archeologist, so we gave him a pith helmet, et cetera. And then Megan Mullally… she just plays. It's so fun to watch the fact that they have such a different way of doing this work, but somehow it works together. I think that that's part of the secret sauce that makes them such a special part of this.\nReally quickly about the archeologist [thing] that you mentioned, was that just something he wanted to have in his mind to kind of shape the character? Not in the script, not part of the thing, just for him to have?\nKarl Saint Lucy: Well, he wanted it in the script.\nThat’s great.\nMarius de Vries: The hat. He wanted the hat in the script, specifically. He was given the hat, and he pulled it off. I mean, Megan surprised us; she turned out with that extraordinary accent without really having forewarned us at all. Of course, one of the first things we did was to test singing. There was a lot of very frantic discussion about, \"Oh, this is an unusual turn of events to the character,\" but she'd clearly done an immense amount of wise preparation in building that character. She bought it fairly fully formed, and it worked brilliantly.\nFrom the moment she opened her mouth, I was like, \"How is this going to work in a song?\" And it was incredible. You both are in this movie, I believe, [as well]. How did that come about? Did you ask for it?\nMarius de Vries: One of the things I've started doing at this later stage in my career is insisting on having a cameo in pretty much everything I do, because it keeps things a little bit fresh. So, this is by no means my first small role in a big musical, but I don't know how to explain it other than I kept pestering Larry, saying, \"You've got to put me in somewhere.\" Then a scene came up and they were short of a maître d’, and I got a call at five-thirty saying, \"Can you be on set at seven-thirty?\" and so there I was. But I think Karl has a much more significant and important visual role in the film than I do, so perhaps the question is better addressed to him.\nKarl Saint Lucy: It was a lot of fun. I got to be the martini shot that day, so we spent the whole day throwing spaghetti around the set, and then watching the prop cleaners put the spaghetti back on the plate and throw it around again. The whole place just smelled awful, you know, with the lights and everything. It was, like, the last 20 minutes of shooting for that day. Larry was just shouting direction at me, and it was so much fun. Then, afterwards, he came up to me and he was like, \"Was that okay? Are you all right?\" and I was like, \"Oh my God, please shout at me as much as you want.\" It was incredibly fun. I know they wanted to originally put me in a tux, and I'm so glad that they let me wear a kaftan instead.\nWas there anything that didn't make it into the movie that was too much?\nKarl Saint Lucy: In Megan's song, there used to be a moment where she was playing a fish harmonica and air drums, and we worked very hard to work the fish harmonica into the song, and that did not make it, sadly.\nMarius de Vries: Yeah, Megan had a drum solo. I kind of miss that. One day the world will see it. That’s when the movie went from being an 88-minute movie to an 87-minute movie.\nI feel there is a theremin at one point in the score. Did I make that up?\nKarl Saint Lucy: It’s an ondes Martenot, which is similar to a theremin, but it's a keyboard instrument that was very, like Messiaen used it a lot in his Turangalîla-Symphonie. We got the VST (virtual instrument). Originally, the p**sy was supposed to be horrific, so we had this huge cue that was a reference to Jerry Goldsmith's Alien where the ondes Martenot had a really prominent role, but we ended up having to cut that when the p**sy ended up being very cute.\nSo that instrument came in as a thematic instrument for that?\nKarl Saint Lucy: For the p**sy, yeah.\nMarius de Vries: That was the p**sy instrument. And then the ondes Martenot, apart from Messiaen, the most recent expert or virtuoso on the ondes Martenot is Johnny Greenwood who used-\nDo you two each have favorite songs that you were able to work on for this?\nMarius de Vries: I think, for me, the real standout is “Lonely”.\nKarl Saint Lucy: Yeah, me too.\nMarius de Vries: It's kind of the most extreme example of the way that the sincerity and the songwriting is juxtaposed with the ludicrousness of the situation, and I think it pushes that device about as far as it can go.\nKarl Saint Lucy: And I was kind of lifted out of being alone in my apartment through the pandemic to do this, and I think a lot of people on set were sort of feeling lonely. On the day that we got to see that shot, I mean, Megan Mullally's performance was--we were all just weeping. For me, that felt like a real coup. Not only were we getting everyone on set to laugh and sing the songs, but we were also getting them to cry because of, like you said, the sincerity of her performance in that. And Nathan's.\nMarius de Vries: When we did our first set of piano demos just after the pandemic--just at the beginning of pre-production--and sent them to Larry, first of all, amazingly, he liked them all, so we were off to a strong start. I put the “Lonely” song, and he said, \"I immediately wept. Then, I went outside for a walk, and I came back and played it again, and I wept again.\" So we knew that we had a tear jerker on our hands.\nSomething that I loved so much about this is [that] I felt like there were takes where the actors were just laughing at the end of the take, [that were] left in the movie. To me, it just speaks to this thing where this movie's insane, and it's so raunchy, but it's so sweet and has so much heart at the same time. To me, I think that's why it works so well. Is that something that you all talked about, had discussions about, and made an effort to preserve as you were putting this together?\nMarius de Vries: I think there's something about the fact that it was lifted conceptually from that initial 30-minute rowdy comedic stage show and [us] wanting to keep a sense of liveness about it and a sense of theatricality to it across all departments. That breaking phenomenon that you're talking about, I think, is to do with that. And you're right, I think it pulls you into the joint endeavor of just having a wonderful time and enjoying the humor together that is part of the inclusiveness of it. I don't know, Karl, you can probably speak to that better than I can.\nKarl Saint Lucy: I also just want to say that Nathan Lane is also really largely responsible for that, because as we were in development, he kept reminding us, \"Yes, let's go for the jokes, but let's also go for the heart. There has to be a heart to this.\" I think that that already existed in the show, but it was incredibly helpful to have Nathan reminding us of that periodically throughout the process.\nTwo self-obsessed businessmen (writers Aaron Jackson & Josh Sharp) discover they’re long-lost identical twins and come together to plot the reunion of their eccentric divorced parents, in this riotously funny and depraved musical from comedy icon Larry Charles (Seinfeld, Borat) also starring Megan Thee Stallion, Nathan Lane, Megan Mullally, and Bowen Yang as God.\nCheck out our other interviews here:\nDicks: The Musical arrives in select theaters on October 6 before its nationwide release on October 20.\nSource: Screen Rant Plus\n"}
{"title": "10 Reasons Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof Is His Biggest Failure", "date": "2023-10-02 22:00:28", "text": "Quentin Tarantino's weakest movie is Death Proof, his only horror movie to date, and there are different reasons why it didn't succeed.\nDeath Proof marked a first in Quentin Tarantino’s career as it’s his only horror movie to date, and it’s also his biggest failure. Quentin Tarantino has become one of the best filmmakers of his generation but also one of the most controversial due to the violence in every one of his movies. Still, Tarantino’s works have been praised for their narrative and visual style, his mastery in writing dialogue, and more, and though some of his movies are considered among the best films ever made, some haven’t had the same success.\nIn 2007, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez teamed up to bring Grindhouse, a double feature that combined Rodriguez’s horror comedy Planet Terror and Tarantino’s Death Proof, a slasher thriller. Death Proof followed Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), who used his death-proof car to kill young women, as the car was only safe for him. Death Proof is widely considered Tarantino's worst movie, and even Tarantino himself admits it’s his weakest movie – and here are 10 reasons Death Proof was a failure.\nAs part of the Grindhouse project, Death Proof has the visual style of grindhouse and exploitation movies from the 1970s, but unlike its sibling film, Planet Terror, Death Proof didn’t stick to this aesthetic. The first part of Death Proof is in full grindhouse style, with bright colors and the style of an old movie. The beginning of the second part of the story is in black and white, and it suddenly changes to color and good quality, leaving the grindhouse look behind. While this can be explained as part of the Grindhouse project's aesthetic, it gave Death Proof an inconsistent look that, ultimately, impacted the overall quality of the movie and its reception.\nOne of the most praised elements in Quentin Tarantino’s movies is the dialogue. Tarantino’s ability to write dialogue has been praised, which is often heavy on pop culture references, and it’s key in understanding the dynamics, motivations, and personalities of the characters. Death Proof, however, and unlike Tarantino’s previous works, has more dialogue between female characters, as the main characters are all women. Tarantino used the same style he had used for all his male characters in Death Proof’s female ones, which felt off and brought out a weakness in Tarantino’s writing. \nThe first part of Death Proof follows Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito), Shanna (Jordan Ladd), and Jungle Julia (Sydney Tamiia Poitier) who meet Stuntman Mike at a bar, where he claims a lap dance from Arlene that Jungle Julia promised on her radio show. Later, an old friend of Julia, Pam (Rose McGowan), takes Stuntman Mike’s offer for a ride home, but he kills her by speeding and slamming on the brakes. Stuntman Mike then catches up with Julia and company, crashing into their car, and killing them in truly gruesome ways.\nThe second half of Death Proof sees Stuntman Mike targeting a new group of women, but to his surprise, they know how to fight back. However, this second half is slower and lacks the suspense of the first part of Death Proof, to the point where many viewers have shared that they lost interest in the characters and stories throughout the second half of the movie.\nDeath Proof spends enough time with Jungle Julia and her friends in the first part of the movie to make the audience care about them, but the same can’t be said about the second group. While they end up being the heroes of the movie, Death Proof doesn’t do much to make the audience care about them and what will happen to them next, and the character of Stuntman Mike isn’t properly developed, leading to the audience not even caring about the villain. The heroes aren’t exactly likable, either, leaving the audience with no one to really root for.\nQuentin Tarantino is no stranger to starting his movies with a bang, but what happened with Death Proof is that it never recovered from its shocking first act. The rest of Death Proof sees Stuntman Mike going after Abernathy (Rosario Dawson), Kim (Tracie Thomas), and Zoë (Zoë Bell), but the chase and the women’s revenge take too long to happen and reach their peak. Death Proof starts to take off again towards the end, but never truly does so as the movie comes to an end when the women finally get their revenge.\nDeath Proof is considered a slasher movie even if it doesn’t go all the way, but even if it just took the structure of a slasher movie, it still didn’t deliver on that promise. Death Proof leans more towards an action thriller, and though Stuntman Mike’s murders are very graphic and horrible, especially those of Jungle Julia and her friends, Death Proof doesn’t really feel like a slasher movie. Still, Death Proof is considered Quentin Tarantino’s only horror movie to date, even if it falls short.\nDeath Proof’s slow pace made the climax and ending pretty underwhelming. As mentioned above, the movie takes too long to set up the Abernathy and friends' conflict with Stuntman Mike, and by the time they can finally get their revenge, the movie ends. The big moment of Abernathy, Kim, and Zoë beating an injured Stuntman Mike ended up being more comedic than exciting, and the movie ends as Stuntman Mike falls and the women celebrate their win. Of course, this deeply affected Death Proof’s reception with critics and viewers, making it a forgettable movie.\nBy itself, Death Proof still wouldn’t have succeeded, but its failure was made worse by its sibling film, Planet Terror. Unlike Death Proof, Planet Terror fully embraced the horror genre with its zombie apocalypse story and its very graphic scenes. Planet Terror had a consistent visual style, its characters were developed enough for the audience to root for them, and it was packed with action from beginning to end. Planet Terror also had a proper ending, and even had a small tease at the end (though that will never pay off).\nAlthough the idea of a double-feature B-movie style project like Grindhouse sounds interesting, it risked only appealing to a specific audience, even if it counted on the talents of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. Rodriguez delivered on the horror/grindhouse style of the project with Planet Terror, while Tarantino made his interpretation of a slasher movie that, ultimately, would only be exciting for him. Surely, Tarantino ended up admitting that Death Proof isn’t his best work, but in big part, the movie’s failure was because it wouldn’t really appeal to a wide audience, like his other projects.\nPerhaps the biggest problem with Death Proof is that it doesn’t feel like a Quentin Tarantino movie because his style doesn’t fit the movie. As mentioned above, Tarantino’s style of dialogue didn’t fit the female characters, and his trademark long speeches felt off with the overall style of Death Proof. Surely, Tarantino’s style of violence was perfect for it, but that’s about it. Death Proof could have benefited from having Quentin Tarantino as producer, a better script, and a different director, but that wasn’t the case.\n"}
{"title": "Prey Director Dan Trachtenberg On Introducing A New Generation To Predator Lore", "date": "2023-10-02 22:00:28", "text": "Prey director Dan Trachtenberg discusses shooting on location, tapping into Predator lore, and showing Naru's incredible strength in the movie.\nPrey is the fifth installment in the Predator franchise, set hundreds of years before the original movie. Set in the Northern Great Plains in 1719, the movie follows Naru, an accomplished Comanche healer and tracker who yearns to become a warrior. Although overshadowed by her brother Taabe, a skilled hunter, Naru sees her chance for the big hunt, a rite of passage in her tribe. Naru will face a much more sinister and dangerous threat than anything she or the others have seen before.\nPrey is directed by Dan Trachtenberg and written by Patrick Aison. The movie is produced by John Davis, Jhane Myers, and Marty P. Ewing. Prey stars Amber Midthunder, Dakota Beavers, Dane DiLiegro, Michelle Thrush, Stormee Kipp, Julian Black Antelope, and Bennett Taylor.\nRelated: Predator: 8 Ways Arnold Schwarzenegger Can Appear In Prey 2 Despite A 268-Year Gap\nScreen Rant spoke with director Dan Trachtenberg about his installation in the Predator franchise, Prey. He discussed shooting on location and revealed how sports movies were an inspiration. Trachtenberg also broke down the importance of showing the Predator lore to a new audience and tapping into an earlier era of this world.\nScreen Rant: Dan, look, I love Prey! I'm so happy. I got to revisit it over this weekend. October 3, it's coming in 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and DVD. I'm sure everyone can't wait. Can you talk about the world-building and why you decided to start at the beginning of the Predator story?\nDan Trachtenberg: I don't even know if it's the beginning of the Predator story. Great point. It is the beginning of this Predator, the Predator in this movies needs the first time he's ever been to Earth, or it's ever been to Earth. Frankly, I did not come at it from thinking of \"Oh, I'd like to make a Predator movie. What Predator movie could I make? Oh, what if I went to a different...\" It actually was thinking of Naru's story and trying to thinking of a movie that could be as nonverbal as possible, just as action oriented as possible, but also wanting to feel as emotional as that possibly could.\nSo I thought of an underdog story. Taking the engine from a sports film and putting that into this other kind of genre. And then what is your protagonist that we never see? Native American and Comanche in particular. And all of those thoughts, while still wanting for it to have a science fiction component. Period and sci-fi coming together has not always been successful. I was really trying to figure out, well, is there a way that it could be? And that's when Predator came to mind because it wouldn't just be arbitrary and look at the science fiction thing. Actually the predators thematic, that it goes on hunts looking for the strongest thing, and we'd already be focusing on a character whose peers are saying, \"You're not, you're not it.\" And she's wanting to be it and also was questioning herself in my head.\nAnd the Predator doesn't even look at her doesn't even consider her, that was like, okay, cool. That is a movie that doesn't feel like I'm just throwing a hat on that, that really feels like a great mixture. And then it was like, okay, well wait, if this is set in the 1700s and that means that'd be before Predator. Actually, I should say before it was even 1700s it was just, what is pre... As early as possible I wanted to tell a story about this people in this culture that we don't often see usually it's in the 1800s. It's in the western. I just want to be focused on them.\nAnd then I realized there was that gun in Predator 2. I was in the shower when I was thinking, and as soon as I got in the shower I ran to my phone to Google, what was the date on the gun? It's 1715, and it was like, \"Holy crap, there!\" We perfected it beautifully aligned with Predator lore, and what I was already interested in doing with the film.\nThat is incredible. That is incredible that you had that thought in the shower, and had that foresight in mind. I love this character of Naru. Can you talk about how you wanted to differentiate her strength from the other members of the tribe? And also how you wanted to differentiate her from other Predator heroes we've seen in the past?\nDan Trachtenberg: What I love, even though I'm not physically represented at all on screen except for maybe I have a beard now so then there's a bunch of bearded people, this was a very personal story for me. It's my feelings. My heart is beating in the movie. Why I wanted to put it out there, why I'm always interested in this kind of stories. I think that a lot of people feel the way that Naru feels. A lot of people feel like they are capable of more than is outwardly seen yet also question and hope that they have that within them, and hope they have the guts to prove it to themselves and to others.\nIt's why we we do sports. It's why we pursue careers with any sense of ambition. I think anywhere you are in the world that's a very specific feeling that is felt by, I would imagine, almost all of us. So that is why I focused on her. That kind of story is very different than the kind of protagonist that we certainly saw on the original Predator. Arnold represents the wish fulfillment. It's like, oh, I'm watching that and saying, \"Wouldn't it be great if I had all those muscles? If I was that way? Could I kick it?\"\nJust exhilarating to see a character kick butt on screen that is Uber capable. And Naru is the other thing and that is, what if I was there? What if I, but just a little bit better, but could I pull it off? Could I be posed with a seemingly impossible task, still rise to the occasion, figure it out, and handle it? So yeah, that's kind of how that came together.\nWhen I originally watched Prey, when it first came out on Hulu, my girlfriend had never seen the Predator movies before. So this is kind of a new way to introduce such a famous character to her. Were there any elements you wanted to set up with Prey for people who hadn't seen Predator before?\nDan Trachtenberg: Actually the first cut of the movie we did not do our job in making it for people who had not seen Predator. Really took for granted what the rules are of a Predator and so we had to kind of learn the hard way after screening for some friends and family that we had missed that. We very much wanted this to be for anyone. For it to be great movie first and then a kick ass Predator movie second. So what we found was we really need to make sure the movie retaught the audience that it was an alien coming to earth looking for the Alpha following the hierarchy of Predator and Prey on this planet and a Trophy Hunter.\nBefore we articulated that in the movie there was a reaction to the sequence where it kills the bear or someone thought it was a vampire. Because they thought it was drinking the blood of the bear before we had sequences that were it studying the ant, the snake and getting the skull of the wolf and attaching to it. So before those kinds of things were in the movie. It was like \"Oh, I don't know what this is. The shimmering red thing and then it drinks blood.\" So anyway, it took a few unfortunate reminders that this must be a movie for everyone, of course, and we need to make sure all that lore that is established in the other films we have in this one as well.\nWell, it worked because after that I think we binged the next two Predator movies. So it absolutely worked. Now Prey explores intense survival themes. How did you approach capturing the psychological aspects of the character in such a gripping manner?\nDan Trachtenberg: Making sure the movie was very linked to Naru's POV. To making it a very experiential film. So we really only see in large part what Naru sees. Hear and feel it as best we can. So playing with sound, focusing on the noises that she would focus in on, and letting the suspense build around her and towards her. As opposed to it being like the other Predator films [which] are a little bit more of a classic slasher film approach. Where you're meeting a team of people and watching them killed by one. This is a much more specific, single protagonist oriented movie. Which just makes it all feel that much more emotional, and the suspense matters so much more because you care about her and her specific relationships.\nSpeaking of that, this film has such a unique blend of suspense and horror. How did you balance maintaining the tension throughout the story without overwhelming the audience?\nDan Trachtenberg: What I loved about the original Predator was for me growing up, it was the first time I'd seen a real genre combination. That was combining sci-fi, horror, and action. What I love about Prey is that it was a combination of science fiction, horror, and adventure. Adventure films are not a genre that we have too much of these days. Growing up, we had a lot of them, we had a lot of quicksand, slide, swinging from things, and swashbuckle.\nSo I wanted to infuse this movie with a bit of that language as well. Have moments of score that remind us of big epics, that, that I grew up with. So I think that and certainly her relationship with her dog and her relationship with her brother, all the emotional story makes the tension matter more. And then also, when it follows through with the with the action, it's much more of a cathartic release. Because everything's been building up and building up and building up.\nCan you talk about the usage of practical effects and visual effects, and combining them both? Knowing when to us which one when the story called for it?\nDan Trachtenberg: Digital effects when it is literally impossible to do anything practically. Almost the whole movie was shot on location. So there was there was a lot on screen that is in camera. CG stuff was used to just augment what was there from landscape to snowfall to ash in the sky,. There's a bit that I love that we've mentioned in the commentary in the movie that I'd forgotten about through the whole process of releasing the film, that was a big deal while we were making the movie, where Amber, when she climbs out of the water. After escaping from the Predator, she was wearing a wetsuit that was covering her arms. And it was very obvious and unfortunate that we had no other take because it was something that we were just racing to get there. In this pretty gnarly location at the bottom of a ravines and stuff.\nSo we were kind of screwed until we found an awesome digital artist who just in 2D found a way to comp skin onto her arms. So her arms are digital effect in that scene. I don't think many people realize that or would notice that. And then there's bits where to make the predator more believable. it's all suit except when it's hands. We're very tight on his hands and it's sniffing ash know that CG hands because his hands weren't articulating, in the most refined way and sometimes we augmented some of the mandibles and the face here and there. Sometimes that's really just it.\nSo it's always playing a little bit of a zigzag game. You never know when it's going to be practical when it's gonna be real. So when you're seeing a thing, hopefully you're kind of lulled into it and tricked. And I would argue the moments that are blatantly CG are that way because there's no element of practicality to it. What we're at what we're doing is so physically impossible. So it sort of proves that the methodology is sound. That most people don't notice are those that were really combining both things.\nLook, I love home entertainment releases because of audio commentaries. And you have a great one with you. Amber Midthunder, Jeff Cutter, Angela M. Catanzaro. I love audio commentaries, because it's almost like going to film school in a way. It's hearing it from your guys's perspective. If there's an audio commentary that you'd like young filmmakers to check out, what would be your choice?\nBy the way, it was my film school. Audio commentaries.\nWas it really? \nDan Trachtenberg: Oh, yeah. I mean, I also went to film school but I think I learned as much if not more from listening to audio commentaries growing up than I did from movies. There's several that come to mind that were personal to me that I enjoy listening to that I would said, Well, that's probably not the most formative. I think David Fincher did some awesome commentaries. Steven Soderbergh.\nI remember Traffic having a whole walkthrough of their post process that's sort of beyond commentary. It was showing you the AVID if memory serves on the disk that was really insightful. It's a great question there's probably so many more but yeah I would look to the Fincher and the Soderbergh. I remember Nightmare Before Christmas also having a commenter, I think I got that before DVDs, that was super interesting. I remember having a VHS of commentary version that I got to like a comic convention or something, probably was bootlegged.\nSet in the Comanche Nation 300 years ago, this is the story of Naru, a fierce and highly skilled warrior, raised in the shadow of legendary hunters who roam the Great Plains. When danger threatens her camp, she sets out to protect her people. The prey she stalks: a highly evolved alien predator with a technically advanced arsenal.\nPrey is available on 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and DVD on October 3.\nSource: Screen Rant Plus\n"}
{"title": "Krapopolis Seasons 2 & 3 Have 1 Really Exciting Thing To Look Forward To", "date": "2023-10-02 22:11:26", "text": "Krapopolis has already been renewed for seasons 2 and 3, but the minds behind Dan Harmon's new series have already hinted at what's to come.\nKrapopolis seasons 2 and 3 are already underway, and the upcoming batches of episodes have one really exciting thing to look forward to. Krapopolis has only just started, with the series hitting the ground running. FOX has already renewed Krapopolis for two more seasons ahead of season 1, meaning that the show already has some pretty ambitious plans. While a lot of these details are still under wraps, one Krapopolis detail has fans eagerly awaiting the upcoming seasons.\nKrapopolis is the newest show from Community creator and Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon, with the new series bringing back many of the creative's signature trademarks and stylistic flairs. Krapopolis takes place in pre-civilization Ancient Greece, with the show following King Tyrannis as he attempts to start up the first Greek city. However, Tyrannis is constantly thwarted by his colorful family which includes his mother, the goddess Deliria, and his father, a Manitaur named Shlub.\nRelated: Krapopolis Season 2: Renewal, Release Date Prediction & Everything We Know\nWhile only a handful of gods have appeared in Krapopolis so far, the series clearly has some ambitious plans, as around 120 gods have been designed for the first three seasons of the series. In Screen Rant's exclusive interview with Krapopolis supervising director Pete Michels and lead character designer Andy Ristaino, the duo touched on what's to come for the show's upcoming seasons. Here's what Michels and Ristaino had to say when asked about the show's future:\nPete Michels: [Krapopolis' main characters] do meet a lot of new characters in the upcoming seasons and a lot of new locations also.\nAndy Ristaino: Go to a lot of cool places. We visit more gods and stuff.\nPete Michels: A lot more gods. I think you’ve designed like 120 gods or something.\nAndy Ristaino: Yeah, I’ve designed a lot of gods and a lot of creatures and mythological creatures and things that were never mentioned.\nPete Michels: Yeah, and I think those are the fun things too because we do not just the gods and goddesses and the humans, but there's also monsters. [There are] a lot of interesting monsters that animation lends itself to that were just really fun to do and fun to draw.\nThis is major news, as only a select few gods from the Greek pantheon have appeared in Krapopolis so far. Obviously, more gods were expected to appear, but 120 is an immense number for only three seasons of the show. It's entirely possible that many of these gods and monsters may not make the final cut, but it is a sign of how expansive the world of Krapopolis is intended to be by season 3.\nWith around 120 gods having been designed, it seems like almost any ancient Greek god is fair game to appear in future seasons of Krapopolis. Some of the biggest names, like Hermes, Athena, Poseidon, and plenty of others have appeared. However, characters like Zeus and Hades as well as deep-cut gods that viewers may not know about could also appear. Michels and Ristaino didn't give us any specifics on which gods could pop up, but there are plenty of possibilities.\nRelated: Krapopolis: Concept, Trailer & Everything We Know About Dan Harmon's New Show\nAlthough it is still unknown what gods Krapopolis has in store for seasons 2 and 3, some future monsters have been confirmed. In the Krapopolis Q&A panel at SCAD AnimationFest 2023, Michels and Ristaino confirmed that Pegasus and a Hydra would appear in upcoming episodes of the series. While other monsters and creatures are sure to appear, this is big news for fans of the series, giving viewers something to look forward to in the future of Krapopolis.\nRobert Pitman is a Movies/TV features writer for ScreenRant and loves all things nerdy.

{"title": "Community Movie Gets Discouraging Update From Creator Dan Harmon Amid Production Setbacks", "date": "2023-10-02 22:16:39", "text": "Community creator Dan Harmon is worried the movie might not happen following the SAG-AFTRA strike after it was announced by Peacock last year.\nCommunity creator Dan Harmon is worried the movie might not happen after all. After years of fan campaigning under the hashtag #SixSeasonsandaMovie, it was finally announced in September 2022 that a Community movie was in development for Peacock featuring the return of original stars Joel McHale, Danny Pudi, Alison Brie, Gillian Jacobs, Jim Rash, and Ken Jeong. However, the WGA and still ongoing SAG-AFTRA strikes have caused a plethora of production setbacks and put those plans into serious doubt.\nNow, the latest Community movie update reveals that Harmon is concerned it might not happen at all. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the Community creator admitted that once the SAG-AFTRA strike ends, he's worried the cast might not be able to get back together. In his own words, Harmon says, \"By the time we can recoordinate, what are the odds that everyone’s schedule is going to once again align?\"\nBefore the SAG-AFTRA strike, Harmon says the plan was to shoot the Community movie in Atlanta, which was moved from Los Angeles in order to accommodate Glover's return, \"And Donald was stoked,\" Harmon says. The actor's name was missing from the original announcement in September 2022, though there have been multiple updates suggesting he will return. Glover has several other commitments, including Prime Video's Mr. and Mrs. Smith series and the Star Wars Lando movie, and changing the shooting location to Atlanta was to prevent the Community movie from shooting \"separately at different months in different locations,\" Harmon explains.\nWith no conclusive end to the SAG-AFTRA strike in sight, it's uncertain if the Community cast will be able to reunite for the movie. Once the SAG-AFTRA strike does end, there will be a scramble in Hollywood to secure top talent. This includes Glover, but also McHale who stars in Fox's Animal Control, which was renewed for a season 2, and hosts reality competition series like Crime Scene Kitchen and House of Villains. In light of the stoppage started by the SAG-AFTRA strike, Harmon's comment casts some serious doubt on the fate of the long-anticipated Community movie.\nSource: THR\n"}
{"title": "5 Reasons The Rings Of Power Is Amazon Prime Video's Best Fantasy Show (& 5 It's The Wheel Of Time)", "date": "2023-10-02 22:21:29", "text": "Amazon has two great shows full of magic and adventure, The Rings of Power and The Wheel of Time. But which one is the fantasy show to rule them all?\nAmazon Prime boasts two sprawling series The Rings of Power and The Wheel of Time, each with their own strengths that make them the streaming network's best fantasy show. The Rings of Power focuses on important events during Middle-earth's Second Age that lead up to The Lord of the Rings movies, including the forging of the titular rings, the creation of Sauron's stronghold in Mordor, and the fall of Numenor. The Wheel of Time follows Moiraine, an Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah, who embarks on a quest to discover the identity of the Dragon Reborn, a great warrior prophesied to either save the world or cause its destruction.\nBoth series feature magic, exciting battles, the same directors (Sanaa Hamri), and extensive world-building based on beloved works of fiction by celebrated authors. Certain things like creative license, budgetary constraints, and character development have greatly impacted how they have both been received by fans of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth setting and Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson's Randland from The Wheel of Time books. Both series have strengths and weaknesses that are giving them growing pains ahead of their respective second seasons, but there's no denying that fans of fantasy are fortunate to have so many options right now, on Amazon as well as other platforms.\nEven without the most recognizable faces in The Lord of the Rings franchise, The Rings of Power has several memorable characters. Not only does Galadriel make a huge impression as a much more battle-weary figure, but Elrond emerges as a loyal friend and budding politician whose thoughtful choices shape the fate of Middle-earth. While not every performance rings true, the vast majority of the actors give committed performances that pay homage to the material, with individual relationships, like the one between Elrond and Durin, that humanize larger-than-life figures and build a strong foundation for The Rings of Power season 2.\nLike The Rings of Power, The Wheel of Time has a lot of source material to work with, but manages to be more faithful to it. Modifications, such as truncated time periods or, in the case of Matt and Perin, changes to character backstories and personalities can be explained in-universe with a few words of dialogue or dramatic motivations. It doesn't help that Amazon never obtained the rights for all the necessary Tolkien works before they attempted to adapt The Rings of Power and therefore had to ignore a large portion of it.\nThe Lord of the Rings franchise is known for its painstaking attention to detail thanks to a trilogy boasting handmade chainmaille armor on hundreds of extras and heroes wielding rune-carved blades forged by real blacksmiths. The high budget on The Rings of Power is unmistakable, even if at times it looks a little too pristine. Aesthetically, it's not only beautiful to watch, but distinct from other fantasy series, which are either too gritty like Game of Thrones and The Witcher, or too generic like The Wheel of Time.\nBecause it doesn't have to compress hundreds of years of actions and characters into a single narrative like The Rings of Power with the Second Age, The Wheel of Time has a better story. Not only is the pace better, but it's cohesive and linear without being too confusing even as it leaves circumstances surrounding Rand more mysterious and leaves casual fans wondering who the Dragon Born will be. Moraine is a strong lead character, and her goals sync up with all the supporting cast in ways that make sense, rather than trying to find ways to connect characters like Galadriel to less compelling characters, like the Harfoots, in The Rings of Power.\nWhile die-hard Tolkien fans will find a series based on appendices jarring, The Rings of Power does have a certain amount of creative freedom. The series builds a foundation for prominent events in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and aside from having to compress its time period by having certain characters alive who would have otherwise been separated by years, it isn't as constrained. The Wheel of Time has to turn 14 books, and some of them fairly massive, into a television show, while The Rings of Power has to hit certain milestones and then fabricate what happened between them.\nOne of the main problems with The Rings of Power is its pacing, which often comes across as plodding and monotonous. The Wheel of Time keeps things moving at a brisk clip, which translates into much higher completion rates for viewers. As a fantasy series, The Wheel of Time understands how to make episodic structure work for its overall narrative, rather than The Rings of Power's tendency to make some episodes completely disparate from others.\nWhereas The Wheel of Time stumbles with its CGI and Trollocs that don't look quite finished, The Rings of Power boasts incredible visual effects on par with The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Rivendell and Numenor are dazzling, and every environment bursts with a vitality that makes Middle-earth seem real and lived in. Locations that were seen as dark ruins, like the Mines of Moria, are seen in all their glory, full of bustling industry and part of one of the most thrilling communities in the series that focuses on the dwarves.\nSauron is a formidable villain in The Lord of the Rings, but as he's presented in The Rings of Power, he's operating in the shadows as more of a charming puppet master. The Wheel of Time has villains that are not only more apparent, but also more entertaining to watch as they work out their schemes. The members of The Forsaken still have a lot of damage to do in Season 2, but watching powerful characters like Lanfear has given the series charismatic darkness to counteract the light.\nIt should come as no surprise that the battle sequences in The Rings of Power are as pulse-pounding as anything in The Lord of the Rings. Not only do they showcase grand special effects, but they also feature expert horsemanship, stuntwork, and practical strategic elements. On top of that, they're beautifully shot, making the violence and bloodshed at times almost like a fever dream, or in other cases, a nightmare of ash and flame.\nDialogue in fantasy series can often be ropey or overly verbose, with characters speaking in ways that don't flow naturally or make a lot of sense. The Wheel of Time includes dialogue that not only sounds how characters speak in the books but even lines verbatim from them that work in the appropriate situation. This helps keep it focused without lines that take viewers right out of the drama, which even the best fantasy series like The Rings of Power can't always prevent, but should make an effort to do so in order to remain immersive.\n"}
{"title": "Big Brother 25 Week 9 Power Of Veto Ceremony Results (Spoilers)", "date": "2023-10-02 22:26:20", "text": "The Big Brother 25 week 9 Power of Veto ceremony has occurred. Find out if the winner used the veto to save Felicia or Mecole from the chopping block.\nWARNING! THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR BIG BROTHER 25!\nThe Big Brother 25 Power of Veto ceremony has occurred, and winner and current Head of Household (HOH) Cameron Hardin didn't use it, leaving his original nominees, Felicia Cannon and Mecole Hayes on the chopping block. Cameron came roaring back into the Big Brother house after being evicted unanimously, winning the Do or Die competition, and resurrecting his game. He did this after besting Jared Fields in the Resurrection Rumble. He won HOH the same night he returned to the game, and then the Power of Veto two days later. This is Cameron's third HOH win of the season.\nThe Big Brother 25 live feeds have revealed that Cameron chose not to use the Power of Veto in order to save either Felicia or Mecole. Cameron had been considering backdooring Cory Wurtenberger, but said that he wouldn't do it if his Fugitive alliance members, Matt Klotz and Jag Bains weren't on board. While Matt was in favor of the idea, Jag had reservations, and didn't think they should evict Cory yet. Therefore, Cameron decided to follow through with his original plan to evict Felicia this week. Cameron told Bowie Jane that it would cause too much chaos in the house if he nominated Cory at the ceremony.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nDespite trying to convince Cameron that she's not a threat to him, and that she'd vote for him if she made it to the jury, Felicia was unsuccessful at making her pitch to him. Cameron told her that she might not be his biggest threat, but she is the biggest persuader in the house. He doesn't want her to go to the jury, and this is the last week before the Jury of 7 begins. Matt and Jag have an agreement with Cory and America Lopez, so it's no wonder that Jag wanted to keep Cory safe. Between Felicia and Mecole, the houseguests will almost certainly evict Felicia.\nCameron's second HOH was very shocking as he floored the houseguests by nominating Felicia and Izzy Gleicher instead of the expected Jag and Blue. However, this time, Cameron didn't have a reign of chaos, but instead had a much more straightforward approach. This is good gameplay for him, especially since he was unanimously evicted from the house last week. He's smart to play a bit more conservatively right now to ensure his safety when he's ineligible to play for the HOH next week as the outgoing one.\nIf Felicia exits the game, she'll join Kirsten Elwin, Reilly Smedley, Hisam Goueli, Red Utley, Izzy, and Jared as the houseguests who didn't make it to the jury. They're one of the strongest groups of pre-jury competitors in Big Brother history, and it's surprising that so many of them didn't make it to the jury. Felicia has had a great run on the show, and she's a fierce competitor. Perhaps she can turn things around before Thursday's live eviction and keep herself in the Big Brother 25 house longer.\nBig Brother 25 airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT, Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EDT, and Thursdays at 9 p.m. EDT on CBS.\n"}

Christian, a 30-year-old from Minnesota, described himself as the life of the party in episode 4 of season 6 of the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off. Christian said he liked to drink cocktails and loved to make people laugh. He’s been called “starry-eyed Christian” for moving too fast in relationships. During the pandemic, Christian even eloped with a woman, only for him to get the marriage annulled later that year.\nChristian fell for Cleo, who is originally from Italy and lives in London, while he was scrolling on Instagram. Cleo has autism and is a trans woman. Christian had apprehensions about meeting Cleo in person, mostly because his family judged her. Christian took a while to show intimacy towards Cleo. He also tried to flirt with other women in her presence and lied to the cameras when asked if he and Cleo had slept together. Cleo still managed to forgive Christian for his mistakes. They stayed together through the finale to the Tell All, becoming one of the few successful couples of 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6.\nChristian proposed to Cleo on the 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days Tell All Part 2. Before he professed his love to Cleo and asked her to be his wife, Christian also made their relationship official on Instagram. Shortly after Part 1 of the reunion aired on TV, Christian posted about Cleo on his IG. He shared a photo of the two of them clinking cocktail glasses. “Cat’s out of the bag! I can finally post about Cleo and I without spoiling it for y’all fans of the show!,” Christian wrote in his caption. The photo was not taken when Christian went to England to meet Cleo but was taken during her visit to America.\nChristian has a lot of secrets up his sleeve, including things he’s never revealed to the audience on the show. This includes the persona that he sometimes puts online. In one such post, Christian dressed up as a “U.S. Secret Service agent on the Kennedy detail” for his Instagram. Christian’s black and white photo fetched him several compliments from his followers.\nChristian’s flirty behavior didn’t get a stamp of approval from his cast members. For instance, Amanda Wilhelm called him out for trying to make excuses to justify his actions. She wanted him to admit what he did was wrong. “I just don’t see it,” said Christian. But Christian also hung out with Amanda and the rest of his cast members from America in New York after the Tell All for cocktails. “I'm so glad I met everybody and had a chance to connect with them personally,” Christian wrote about a group photo with his co-stars. He called them wonderful people who put themselves out there.\nChristian also showed off his dancing skills on Instagram to his friends and followers in a September 2023 post. Christian captioned the photo “Shana Tova!” which is a popular phrase that means \"Happy New Year\" and directly translates to \"Good New Year\" in Hebrew. Christian performed a traditional dance with a friend in the picture and seemed to be fully immersed in the act when the photo was clicked. Several fans wished Christian a happy new year in his comments section.\nChristian considers camping one of his pastimes. Christian’s Instagram does reveal a different side to him than what he chose to portray himself as while meeting Cleo. Perhaps things would have been different if Cleo was the one to come to America and Christian was the one showing her around. When Christian posted a video from one of his camping trips to Northern Minnesota, he showed a raging river and declared that he would rather stay there than in “civilization.” Not to be missed was Christian’s tough and rough look with a shaggy beard, a beanie, and large, yellow aviators.\nChristian’s introduction on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days showed him getting ready for a Halloween party at a friend’s place. Christian dressed up as “Chet Steiner,” a 70’s newsman. He donned a red wig and a blue suit with an orange shirt and interviewed the guests at the party as he chugged on beer and showed off his '70s dance moves. Christian surely loves to dress up and is skilled at mimicry, and in a post from August 6, 2023, he did just that. Christian imitated Rick Grimes from The Walking Dead as he mouthed, “There’s walkers… out there… Carol, watch out.”\nChristian leaves no stone unturned to prove that he brings the party with him wherever goes. With an interest in cocktails and an affinity for alcohol, Christian loves sharing his favorite kind of drink creations with the world as he flaunts his party lifestyle. In August 2023, Christian posted a stellar-looking cocktail on his Instagram page. The smoky drink was from Baldamar restaurant in Roseville, Minnesota. Christian wrote that the unique cocktail was called, “Smoky Old Fashioned: N.Y.F.O.F. (Not Your Father’s Old Fashioned).” Created using bourbon, the cocktail also used cherry liqueur with cherry wood smoke.\nThe wildest and eeriest post on Christian’s Instagram page is his Jack Torrance tribute. Back in November 2019 when he was several years away from becoming a sensation on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days, Christian channeled his inner The Shining antagonist to put on display his acting chops for his IG followers. Christian joked that when it gets cold, and the cabin fever sets in, he chases his nephew around like Jack Torrance from The Shining. A follower had even asked Christian why he was not in Hollywood yet. “Actually going in January” was Christian’s cryptic reply.\nSource: Christian Allgood/Instagram, Christian Allgood/Instagram,Christian Allgood/Instagram,Christian Allgood/Instagram,Christian Allgood/Instagram,Christian Allgood/Instagram,Christian Allgood/Instagram,Christian Allgood/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "The New Writers Deal Is Starting A Content Arms Race As Hollywood Studios Catch Up", "date": "2023-10-02 22:30:27", "text": "Now that the WGA strike is over, the Hollywood machine is starting to work again, meaning we can expect a lot of big movie and TV news soon.\nThe Writers Guild of America strike finally coming to an end means the new deal could start a content arms race as writers return to work. After months of striking, the WGA and Hollywood studios have finally reached a deal allowing members to resume writing movies and TV shows and engage in negotiations for new projects, meaning there could be a rush of new project announcements as studios are finally able to finalize deals needed to green-light stagnant projects.\nThe writers strike began after talks with studios on a new deal fell through due to major sticking points such as streaming data transparency, streaming residual structures, restrictions on studio use of AI in movie and TV writing, and more. Fortunately, most of those issues have been addressed in the new WGA basic agreement, meaning writers can begin writing again and Hollywood's temporary standstill comes to an end.\nRelated: Why Writers' New Streaming Residuals Are So Different From TV & Movies\nThe 2023 WGA strike started on May 2nd and ended on July 27th, during which time all writers ceased ongoing work and halted discussions for future work, putting many productions on halt. The beginning of the SAG strikes in the middle of July slowed production down even more. In addition to freezing active projects, this also meant contract talks for future projects could begin or be finalized during that period. Putting movie and TV production on ice for long enough eventually gave the writers the leverage they needed to get the deal they wanted from the studios, and with SAG discussions ongoing, hopefully, actors' demands will be similarly satisfied soon.\nDue to a halt in negotiations, some big franchise plans had to be put on hold, especially for big cinematic universes like DC Studios and the MCU, where numerous projects are constantly in development. Now that writers can resume negotiations, expect a rush of project announcements and rumors to begin again as Hollywood tries to make up for lost time. This can already be seen with reports such as news of an incoming X-Men movie from the MCU. While news about actors won't start until the SAG strikes come to an end, you can expect an arms race to lock up writing talent as the Hollywood machine spins back up again.\nWhile the end of the strikes will likely result in a brief surge of project announcements, that doesn't mean Hollywood will necessarily return to full speed immediately. 2023 has also seen a number of massive flops from big-budget content, meaning some studios may be rethinking their blockbuster plans or slowing down development on future projects as they reconsider their approach. So, while a number of in-development projects were halted for a few months are finally going to start generating headlines thanks to the conclusion of the strikes, that may not be indicative of the kind news cycle to expect in the coming months.\n"}
{"title": "10 Most Powerful X-Men Comics Characters Right Now", "date": "2023-10-02 22:30:27", "text": "The X-Men have some of the most powerful characters around, from reality warping to magical manipulation, making the Fall of X era unlike any other.\nOut of all of Marvel's many superhero franchises, perhaps the most diverse and powerful cast are that of the X-Men, whose characters both heroic and evil could single-handedly devastate the planet if they chose to. From subtle but shockingly brutal heroes like Kate Pryde to magically manipulative clones like Mother Righteous, the X-Men universe is filled with characters unlike any other.\nThe X-Men are currently experiencing the horrific Fall of X era, with the mutant heroes scattered throughout the cosmos after a bloody defeat at the hands of the mutantphobic organization Orchis. As the mutant's war against Orchis is waged on multiple fronts, a handful of X-Men characters have clearly been established as the most powerful of the current era. Unsurprisingly, many of these iconically powerful mutants are women, and most of the mutants on this list are considered Omega-level, meaning there has been no recorded upper limit to their abilities.\nThe X-Men's Kate Pryde has often used her phase-shifting powers for defensive maneuvering, but time and time again she has shown the truly devastating impact her ability can have. The Fall of X era has Kate, who has long been a voice of peace and reason on Krakoa's now-defunct Quiet Council, once again donning her ninja persona and becoming Shadowkat, to take down Orchis from the shadows. Pryde is now the only living person who can use the Krakoan Gates, a huge advantage against Orchis, and her grief at the fall of Krakoa has been reflected in her increased brutality, viciously murdering a group of Orchis soldiers without any hesitation.\nCharles Xavier's son David Haller, better known as Legion, was a long-time villain of the X-Men until he gained control over his multiple personalities and stabilized his powers in X-Men Legacy. Since the Krakoan Age Legion has been an outright hero, creating the life-saving astral plane on Krakoa called the Altar, and helping to protect the mutant nation repeatedly. Legion's vast reality-warping abilities would be invaluable against Orchis, but unfortunately, David disappeared from the universe during a battle with Mother Righteous. Hopefully, Legion - who is surely still alive somewhere in the Multiverse - makes an appearance once again during the Fall of X to help save Krakoa and beat Orchis once and for all.\n Bobby Drake, better known as Iceman, is an Omega-level mutant capable of vast negative temperature manipulation, with no upper limit to his control over freezing water. Designated as \"Omega Two\" by Nimrod, Iceman has shown just how powerful he is in the Fall of X era. After being seemingly murdered by Nimrod at the Hellfire Gala, Bobby's partner Romeo was able to reconstitute him out of his dispersed vapor in the air, proving that Iceman is practically immortal. Since then, Bobby has been using his endless ice powers to assault Orchis from all sides, fighting back against his evil oppressors.\nThe mutant-hunting Sentinel robot Nimrod has been an enemy of the X-Men for decades, leading to the annihilation of mutantkind across multiple Multiverses and timelines. The creation of Nimrod is inevitable in every universe, and Nimrod coming online is often the first sign of a coming mutant genocide. Orchis was finally able to bring Nimrod online, and since then the devastatingly intelligent and powerful advanced Sentinel has defeated the X-Men on multiple occasions. Most recently Nimrod slaughtered the newly announced X-Men at the Hellfire Gala and almost murdered Iceman. The X-Men have a lot to fear from Orchis, and Nimrod is one of their most terrifying and formidable allies.\nMother Righteous, recently revealed to be a clone of Mister Sinister's late wife Rebecca, is one of the more intriguing X-Men villains in recent years because of her penchant for magic. Righteous has thus far kept her villainy a secret from most of the X-Men, gaining their trust and favor through the Sins of Sinister timeline. Mother Righteous is able to manipulate and control people by getting them to thank her, giving her immense power over the many Krakoans who gave her thanks after SOS. The full history and power of Righteous' magic is unknown, but she is one of Krakoa's biggest threats of the modern age and is well on her way to achieving her goal of reaching \"Dominion\" status.\nIsca the Unbeaten is one of the most fascinating Arakki mutants to debut during the X-Men's Krakoan Age, due to her disloyal and unrepentant personality, and her devastatingly powerful mutant ability. Isca, who is the younger sister of Genesis, is unable to lose... ever. Her Omega-level ability seems to be reality-warping in nature, because while sometimes Isca will simply be given the skills she needs to win, other times the world around her literally shifts, allowing her to never lose. That being said, Isca's overconfidence will always be her downfall, as the brash mutant can still be manipulated by those around her for their own purposes.\nOroro Munroe has always been a Goddess, and Storm's time as leader of the Brotherhood of Arakko has reestablished her role as X-Men leader and Omega-level icon. Storm has accomplished an almost endless supply of spectacular feats since the dawn of the Krakoan Age, and the highly respected former Queen continues to astonish. During the Fall of X Storm is going head-to-head with Genesis as she wages war on Storm's Brotherhood and the rest of Arakko to gain control over the mutant planet. Ororo's weather manipulation, strategic prowess, and compassion are unmatched in modern Marvel Comics, and Storm will surely continue to be the hero mutantkind needs for years to come.\nGenesis - wife of Apocalypse, mother of the original Horsemen, and ruler of Amenth - has emerged as one of the X-Men's most powerful enemies during the Krakoan Age, first acting as a major antagonist of the X of Swords event. Genesis who is an Omega-level manipulator of plant life, is also the wielder of the Annihilation Staff after the Golden Helm of Annihilation was transformed by Saturnyne. Annihilation's power allows her to control the demonic hordes of Amenth and manipulate the wills and desires of those around her, making her a wildly dangerous foe. In the Fall of X era the ancient warrior is waging war against Storm and her Brotherhood for control of planet Arakko, proving Genesis is a brutal force to be reckoned with.\nAn Omega-level universal seer and member of Arakko's Great Ring, Lactuca the Knower has powers similar in some ways to the X-Men's Manifold. Like Manifold, Lactuca is a \"Universal Shaper\" - the highest level of reality manipulator - and is able to sing to the universe to communicate with it, considering the universe to be their \"mother.\" Lactuca has vast powers like universal communication, teleportation, flight, and most importantly spatial omnipotence, allowing them to know the position of all things in the universe and see everything at once. Lactuca is the one mutant that Genesis fears, as Genesis is unwilling to battle Lactuca after they teleport Storm and her allies away from the Great Ring.\nJean Grey has always been one of the X-Men's most powerful heroes, particularly after gaining a connection to the ancient primordial entity known as the Phoenix Force, which has made Jean into what many consider a cosmic deity. Known as \"Omega One\" to Nimrod and Orchis, Jean's endless empathic, telepathic, and telekinetic abilities make her an incredibly formidable fighter, and her connection to the Phoenix has made her essentially immortal. While Jean was killed by Moira X at the Hellfire Gala she has remained alive in astral form, most likely in the Phoenix's White Hot Room, and is soon set to return to Immortal X-Men, perhaps once again in full control of the Phoenix Force's primordial power.\nThe X-Men have always been home to vastly powerful heroes and villains, but the Fall of X era has really ramped up the displays of Omega-level powers and unrepentant violence, from both sides of the battle lines. From magical manipulation to reality warping, to being the avatar for a cosmic entity, the X-Men's many characters have perhaps never been more powerful, or more ready to use their incredible abilities to defeat their enemies.\n"}
{"title": "8 Star Trek Characters Who Died In A Series Premiere", "date": "2023-10-02 23:00:27", "text": "Star Trek series premieres introduce new characters, starships, and the premise of the show, but sometimes they also leave a body count behind.\nStar Trek series premieres introduce new characters, starships, and the premise of the show, but sometimes they also kill off characters and leave a body count behind. Star Trek: The Original Series was heady science fiction for its mid-1960s era, but it was also an action-adventure series to suit the audience and network demands. Shootouts, fist fights, and character deaths were regular occurrences during the original five-year mission of Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and the Starship Enterprise.\nStar Trek has spanned 11 live-action and animated series since 1966, with a 12th series, Star Trek: Starfleet Academy, already announced, on top of 13 live-action theatrical feature films and a made-for-streaming movie, Star Trek: Section 31, on the way. By and large, Star Trek shows feature an ensemble cast of characters who quickly grow beloved by fans, and most series are set aboard a starship except for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Star Trek series premieres tend to be grand affairs, many two-hour feature film length, that reinforce the franchise's themes of exploration, discovery, and co-existence. But sometimes, Star Trek series premieres are steeped in violence and war, and people die. Here are some notable casualties of Star Trek's series premieres.\nRelated: Star Trek: The Original Series Cast & Character Guide\nLt. Commander Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) was the helmsman of the USS Enterprise and an old friend of Captain James T. Kirk. When the Enterprise entered the Galactic Barrier, Mitchell was struck by strange energies that activated his latent ESP abilities. Mitchell was quickly changed, developing psionic powers like telekinesis, telepathy, and matter manipulation. To stop this malevolent danger to the ship, Kirk attempted to maroon Mitchell on Delta Vega. In response, Mitchell rebelled, killing crewmember Lt. Lee Kelso (Paul Carr). Kirk fought and finally killed Mitchell by burying him under tons of rock.\nDr. Elizabeth Dehner (Sally Kellerman) was a psychiatrist serving aboard the USS Enterprise and, like Lt. Commander Gary Mitchell in Star Trek: The Original Series \"Where No Man Has Gone Before,\" Dehner was also changed by the strange energies of the Galactic Barrier. Dehner developed similar psychic powers as Mitchell, which became clear after Captain Kirk tried to maroon Gary on Delta Vega. Dehner sacrificed her life so that Kirk could kill Mitchell. In his log, Captain Kirk noted that both Mitchell and Dr. Dehner had died in the line of duty.\nAlthough \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" was the second pilot of Star Trek: The Original Series, it aired later on NBC due to the time needed to complete its visual effects. \"The Man Trap\" was the first episode of Star Trek to actually air on NBC and many fans still consider it Star Trek's series premiere. In \"The Man Trap,\" a salt vampire took the form of a woman named Nancy Crater (Jeanne Bal) and killed people by draining the salt in their bodies. Among the salt vampire's victims were Enterprise crewmen Darnell (Michael Zaslow), Green (Bruce Watson), and Sturgeon (John Arndt), as well as Nancy's husband, Professor Robert Crater (Alfred Ryder). The salt vampire is finally killed by Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley).\nStar Trek: Deep Space Nine begins with a flashback to Star Trek: The Next Generation's Battle of Wolf 359, and the death of Jennifer Sisko (Felicia M. Bell), the wife of Lt. Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks). Jennifer and Ben were stationed on the USS Saratoga with their young son, Jake (Cirroc Lofton), but Ben could only save their son from the Borg attack. Sisko still mourned Jennifer 3 years later when he was made station Commander of Deep Space Nine, and her death defined both Ben and Jake in the early seasons of DS9, although both accepted her loss and moved on with their lives.\nRelated: Every Star Trek Premiere Episode Ranked Worst To Best\nThe series premiere of Star Trek: Enterprise (originally titled just Enterprise) introduced the 22nd century crew of the first Starship Enterprise, the NX-01 led by Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula). But Enterprise was kicked off by the deaths of aliens landing on Earth. Two Suliban agents pursued a Klingon courier named Klaang (Tiny Lister, Jr.), who crashed in Broken Bow, Oklahoma. Klaang killed his pursuers by blowing up a corn silo, but the Klingon is then seriously injured by a farmer. Returning Klaang to the Klingon homeworld then becomes the first mission of Captain Archer's NX-01 Enterprise.\nStar Trek: Discovery's two-part series premiere, \"The Vulcan Hello\" and \"Battle at the Binary Stars\" erupted into a tragic and bloody affair as the resurgent Klingons declared war of the United Federation of Planets. Fleet Admiral Brett Anderson (Terry Serpico) led the USS Europa to the Binary Star system to answer Commander Michael Burnham's (Sonequa Martin-Green) belief that the Klingons were mounting an attack. Burnham was proven right when a Klingon Cleave Ship rammed into the Europa, destroying the starship and everyone aboard, including Admiral Anderson.\nThe most tragic character death of Star Trek: Discovery's series premiere was Michael Burnham's commanding officer, Captain Philippa Georgiou (Michelle Yeoh) of the USS Shenzhou. Georgiou was Burnham's mentor whom Michael mutinied against in her desperate attempt to prove the Klingons were about to start a war. Georgiou and Burnham mounted their own offense on the Klingon Sarcophagus Ship where Phillpa was murdered by the Klingon leader, T'Kuvma (Chris Obi). Captain Georgiou's body was left behind on the Klingon ship as Burnham escaped, and the USS Shenzhou was destroyed by the Klingons. Although Captain Georgiou was mourned, her Mirror Universe counterpart, Emperor Philippa Georgiou, became a main character in Star Trek: Discovery's first 3 seasons.\nStar Trek: Picard's series premiere, \"Remembrance,\" ended with the violent murder of Dahj Asha (Isa Briones) by Romulan Zhat Vash operatives. Ostensibly a young woman who sought help from the retired Admiral Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), Star Trek: Picard soon revealed that Dahj was synthetic, one of a pair of human-like twin androids built from a positronic neuron recovered from the late Commander Data (Brent Spiner). After Dahj was disintegrated by the Romulans, Picard's mission became about saving Dahj's identical twin, Dr. Soji Asha, from the same fate, and Jean-Luc eventually discovered a race of synthetics spawned from Data's tech living on the planet Coppelius. Tragically, Dahj was the sacrifice that launched Jean-Luc Picard back to saving the galaxy at the dawn of Star Trek's 25th century.\nJohn Orquiola is Screen Rant's Star Trek Beat Editor, Senior Features staff writer, and interviewer."}
{"title": "What’s Going On With Amber Heard In Aquaman 2?", "date": "2023-10-02 23:00:27", "text": "Amber Heard is only minimally featured in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom's first trailer, so what's going on with Mera in the upcoming DC sequel?\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom's first trailer barely features Amber Heard as Mera, the chief love interest of the titular hero Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa). This has likely created some confusion as to why she's not more prominently featured and what her role might be in the upcoming DCEU sequel. However, there's likely a collection of factors behind Heard hardly being seen in the new movie's initial promotion.\nIn the first Aquaman movie from Warner Bros and DC Studios, Arthur Curry and Mera reunited after briefly interacting in 2017's Justice League. Working together to stop Arthur's half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) from conquering the surface world, Mera and Arthur went on a journey to recover the Trident of Atlan which Arthur used to unite the Seven Kingdoms as its new king. To that end, the new trailer for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom implies that Aquaman and Mera took their relationship further, even though Mera herself is barely in the trailer. Here is what's likely going on with Mera and actress Amber Heard in Aquaman 2.\nRelated: Aquaman & The Lost Kingdom: Cast, Story, & Everything We Know\nIn the first trailer for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Arthur Curry is shown in his new status quo as King of the Seven Kingdoms. He's also featured as a new father with a newborn son, the implication being that he and Mera got married and had Arthur Curry Jr. However, Black Manta has returned with new power, having recovered the cursed Black Trident with the ability to seemingly resurrect the dead who then follow his command. Seeking revenge against Aquaman for the death of his father, Black Manta vows to kill Aquaman's entire family in the new footage.\nAs a result, this new trailer features multiple shots of Aquaman's family including his mother, father, and son. Based on the trailer alone, things are looking particularly bad for Aquaman's father Tom with the Amnesty Bay lighthouse in flames as Manta rallies his forces with the Black Trident. Furthermore, things definitely don't look good based on Black Manta's original comics' history, having been responsible for the deaths of both Arthur's father and his son while still a baby. As such, it's quite possible that Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom could get very dark depending on how closely its story on-screen mirrors what's been seen on the page.\nAquaman's half-brother Orm is featured quite prominently as well with Aquaman releasing him from his prison to gain his help against Black Manta and his powerful new trident. As such, it's quite bizarre that Mera is only featured in a single shot that's easy to miss in the new trailer, seen striking a window while appearing to be trapped somewhere in Atlantis. While it's possible that Mera is being kept hidden to avoid a major plot point, some behind-the-scenes details help explain what's confirmed to be a more limited role for Amber Heard's Queen Mera compared to her past appearances in the DC Universe.\nRelated: Every Underwater Species In Aquaman 2\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom's director James Wan recently spoke about Amber Heard and her reduced role in the new movie. According to Wan himself, the DC sequel was always going to have a stronger focus on Aquaman and Orm joining forces as estranged brothers and former rivals rather than Aquaman and Mera teaming as they did in the first movie. Having envisioned the first Aquaman film as \"a romance action-adventure movie\" for Arthur and Mera, the sequel will reportedly be a \"bromance\" instead as Arthur and Orm attempt to reconcile their differences to save the Seven Kingdoms.\nApparently, little room has been left for Queen Mera to be involved in the new quest to stop Black Manta, though she is confirmed to have some sort of role (however minimal it may be). Based upon the single shot of the trailer, it does look as though her life will be endangered thanks to Black Manta and his revenge quest against Aquaman. As such, perhaps Mera will be the one to die rather than Tom Curry or Arthur Jr. as a means of subverting expectations for the upcoming DC movie.\nThe deviation away from Mera likely comes from a desire to focus more on the film's villain beyond Aquaman's uneasy alliance with Orm. It certainly looks as though Black Manta in particular will be getting a much bigger spotlight following what many believed wasn't nearly enough screen time or focus in the first Aquaman. Thanks to the new Black Trident, Black Manta has clearly become far more powerful than he was in the first movie, looking to be more than capable of killing his nemesis and everything he loves (which could certainly include Mera). That being said, actress Amber Heard has argued that her role used to be more substantial.\nRelated: Black Manta's New Costume: 7 Biggest Changes In Aquaman 2 Explained\nDuring her very public court battle with ex-husband Johnny Depp over allegations of abuse and defamation, Heard claimed her role as Mera in Aquaman 2 was significantly reduced by Warner Bros. in response. Despite the aforementioned comments from James Wan to the contrary and testimony from DC Films president Walter Hamada citing a lack of chemistry with Momoa, Heard believed her role was a \"very pared down version\" of what it originally was with multiple action scenes having been taken out, implying that it was the result of her ongoing court battle and the allegations being made by both her and Depp regarding each other's alleged misconduct during their relationship.\nBy all accounts, it does not seem as though the trial between Heard and Depp had very little to do with Mera's smaller role in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom compared to the size of her role in the first film. Not only should the comments from Wan and Hamada be taken into account, but it's also worth noting that filming for the sequel wrapped in January 2022, three months before the beginning of Heard and Depp's demotion trial. It certainly looks as though Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was always going to have a shifted focus away from Mera long before the lawsuits.\n"}
{"title": "If You Love Amazon's The Boys, There's a Comic You Need to Read... But It's Not The Boys", "date": "2023-10-02 23:00:27", "text": "Fans of Amazon's streaming series The Boys who may find the original comics too extreme should check out this alternative Garth Ennis comic.\nThe Boys is known for its over-the-top humor, but for fans of the Amazon streaming series, the original comics may be a bit too extreme. But there is a comic-book option for fans looking for an even better Garth Ennis alternative: his DC Comics series Hitman.\nLaunched in 2006 under the DC imprint WildStorm, The Boys was created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. Telling the story of a group of government operatives trained to keep vain and out-of-control superheroes in line, the series positioned itself to be the ultimate taboo-breaking dark superhero parody — so much so that DC Comics eventually canceled the series after only a handful of issues. Dynamite Entertainment then acquired the series, where it went on to run for 72 issues. While the TV show keeps comic’s irreverent tone, there are some elements of the original that haven’t aged as well and may prove too extreme for fans only familiar with the Amazon adaptation.\nFor those fans of The Boys looking to get into comics, a better alternative might be DC Comics’ Hitman, a 60-issue series created by Garth Ennis and John McCrea. The story stars Tommy Monaghan, a low-level hitman in Gotham City who gets super-powers after being attacked by an alien parasite. Now possessing X-ray vision and telepathy, Monaghan decides to specialize in taking contracts on super-humans and other supernatural threats, gaining the ire of heroes like Batman along the way. The series is laced with the same biting superhero satire that made The Boys a success, but it's still not quite as extreme as that boundary-pushing series.\nThis isn’t to say that Hitman is any less violent or profane. True to Garth Ennis form, the adventures of Tommy Monaghan range from the bleak to the hilarious (and one memorable encounter with a zombie plague in the Gotham Aquarium). While Tommy Monaghan routinely makes fun of superheroes and their inherent jingoistic attitudes, the character later confesses to having a deep respect for Superman, even going so far as cheering Superman up after he failed saving someone from a burning building. Aside from all that, Hitman is just plain funny, with several hilarious take-downs like the Daredevil-inspired “Blind Bastard” or the future version of the ridiculous hero Gunfire accidentally turning his backside into a hand grenade.\nWhile Monaghan’s adventures come to a pretty definitive end after the conclusion of his solo series, Garth Ennis and John McCrea would later return to many of his supporting cast in works like All-Star Section Eight and Six-Pack and Dogwelder: Hard Travellin’ Heroez. Of course, The Boys has grown beyond its juvenile origins to be the type of carefully-considered character study that Garth Ennis excels at. But for those fans looking for something less extreme, they couldn’t do any worse than DC Comics’ Hitman.\n"}
{"title": "Sister Wives: What Is Salsa Brava? (Kody & Christine Have Fought There)", "date": "2023-10-02 23:23:59", "text": "Sister Wives season 18 has seen moments from the personal lives of the Brown family, including some tension-filled scenes at Salsa Brava restaurant.\nSister Wives season 18 has pushed the Brown family to brand new emotional spaces, with some moments taking place outside their homes and in public spaces like Salsa Brava restaurant. While the majority of Sister Wives season 18 has always been filmed in the homes of the Brown family, who have been open and honest about their lives from the beginning of the series. For Kody Brown, his relationships with his wives in plural marriage has been difficult to share publicly, especially with the amount of scrutiny that comes from being open about their family. The backlash has gotten worse as Kody's relationships with his wives have changed over the years.\nAfter Christine Brown's departure on Sister Wives season 17, Janelle Brown and Meri Brown followed suit and left Kody with just Robyn Brown as his only remaining wife. While Robyn has never wanted a monogamous relationship, she's found herself in one with Kody at the moment being. As things have been difficult with the Browns at home with everyone moving around, there are times when Sister Wives requires an alternate location to film. For some time, a favored spot of the family's has been used in the series when they aren't able to film at one of their homes.\nOne of the most recognizable locations from Sister Wives season 18 is Salsa Brava, a local Mexican restaurant in Flagstaff, Arizona where the Brown family lives. Though they have homes in Flagstaff they could film at, it is often easier for them to meet at a neutral location for some of the mor difficult conversations they need to have. Salsa Brava is kind enough to allow Sister Wives to film, typically allowing them the privacy of the entire restaurant in order to keep things quiet surrounding the plot lines of the series.\nOne of the major moments of the early episodes of Sister Wives season 18 was Christine and Kody's first meeting after she left the family and moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. Kody and Christine decided to meet for a meal rather than her heading over to Kody and Robyn's, as it was far more neutral for them as co-parents. Their conversation was difficult, and they were able to have it more comfortably as they spoke in a private room at Salsa Brava. Though their conversation was civil, it was good to know the pair would've been on equal ground if things had gotten uncomfortable.\nAlthough Salsa Brava is likely one of the few restaurants in the Flagstaff area that felt comfortable shutting down big portions of their premises for the family to film, it also happens to be one of their favorite places to eat. According to Kody, the family has shared many big meals together at the restaurant, long before Sister Wives was a part of their life. Though they typically meet up at the restaurant to hash out tough moments, the Sister Wives cast also enjoy the atmosphere for gatherings.\nSister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT on TLC.\n"}
{"title": "Blade’s New Villain Has a Dark Version of Ghost Rider’s Signature Move", "date": "2023-10-02 23:30:23", "text": "The ancient evil Blade is currently facing pulls a page out of Ghost Rider's book, unleashing a terrifying version of the Penance Stare.\nWarning: Spoilers for Blade #3!The latest adversary to face Blade just pulled a page out of Ghost Rider's arsenal. The adversary in question is named the Adana, an ancient evil whom Blade was tricked into inadvertently bringing into prominence. A warrior he mistook for a foe was actually the key to stopping the Adana, and now that Blade has defeated the warrior, all hope seems lost. Blade has made it his mission to defeat the Adana, alongside a new sidekick of Blade's named Rotha.\nAs they try to find the weapon capable of defeating her, the Adana makes her presence known in Blade #3 by Bryan Hill, Elena Casagrande, Valentina Pinti, KJ Diaz, and VC's Cory Petit. The Adana is confronted by allies of Doctor Strange, hinting at a reunion with his friend Blade.\nThese would-be captors don't put up much of a fight, as the Adana sets their eyes ablaze with fire after urging them to \"see what I will make of this world.\"\nIf readers are to take her words literally, the Adana just inflicted pain by showing her victims a glimpse of a dark future. Anyone familiar with Ghost Rider will recognize that this sounds like a dark twist on his signature move, the Penance Stare. The Stare itself revolves around Ghost Rider staring deeply into the eyes of his latest victim, during which time he forces them to see the sins of their past until these sins become so overwhelming that they burn a hole through the victim from the inside out. While the Ghost Rider's move focuses on the victim's past, the Adana zeroes in on their future.\nConsidering that this would mark the second indirect reference to Ghost Rider during Bryan Hill's Blade run, the similarities between these moves can't be a coincidence. The first reference comes in Hill's Blade: First Bite Infinity Comic series, found exclusively on Marvel Unlimited. The series is a prequel of sorts to Hill's Blade series, acting as a direct prelude to Blade #1. The series does a lot to foreshadow the challenges Blade either will face or continues to face in Hill's series, but the second issue takes space to force Blade to consider his complicated role with teams, namely his past with the Midnight Sons team that included him and Ghost Rider.\nBlade likens the Midnight Sons to a family, but is certain he works better alone. The conclusion of Blade #3 suggests he'll have to get over that obstacle in the next issue's team-up with Doctor Strange, but all signs seem to suggest that the Devil's Bounty Hunter won't be far behind. Given the similarities of their moves, the Ghost Rider's Penance Stare may turn out to be the best way to combat the Adana. At the same time, the Daywalker is currently in search of the Lightbringer, the sword of Lucifer, as the weapon he needs to kill Adana. Blade may need a ride to Hell from an old friend in Ghost Rider to retrieve it.\nBlade #3 is on salw now from Marvel Comics.\nJoe Anthony Myrick (or JAM) is a comics writer who specializes in, of course, covering the big figureheads of the industry (Marvel and DC), as well as lesser-known indy parties and some personal favorites like BOOM!

{"title": "Will The Last Witch Hunter 2 Ever Happen? Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-02 23:44:05", "text": "The original movie was a fun but forgettable fantasy adventure. Will Vin Diesel return for The Last Witch Hunter 2? Here's what we know.\nWith all the uncertainty around a sequel to The Last Witch Hunter, it's understandable why so many have wondered whether there will be a sequel. The original was a fun but forgettable fantasy adventure that suffered from poor critic reviews, which brings into question the potential for Vin Diesel to return for more in The Last Witch Hunter 2. Given Vin Diesel's long-running success with the Fast & Furious franchise, it's hard to imagine a time when he was reluctant to make sequels. He passed on both 2 Fast 2 Furious and xXx 2 to work on other projects although it was his return in 2009's Fast & Furious that boosted his career to a new level.\nDiesel has starred in every Fast & Furious entry since with his most recent Fast X released in May 2023. Diesel also came back for Riddick and 2017's xXx: The Return Of Xander Cage as part of his career trend as a major blockbuster franchise leading man. The Last Witch Hunter had intended to be another potential movie series for the action star in which he plays an immortal hunter tracking down witches in modern-day New York but there has yet to be an official confirmation of any sequel. The Last Witch Hunter suffered a lukewarm box-office release which already put the sequel in doubt. Vin Diesel has shown to be persistent about projects he loves, however, so The Last Witch Hunter 2 could still happen.\nRELATED: How Much Vin Diesel Was Paid For His 8 Fast & Furious Movies\nThere has been very little concrete news about The Last Witch Hunter 2 despite Vin Diesel's verbal confirmation of it. It is still listed as being in the development stage on IMDb, which historically is very up-to-date about project statuses. The last public comment that Diesel made about The Last Witch Hunter 2 was to Collider more than 3 years ago, stating with conviction that The Last Witch Hunter 2 was in the works. “Lionsgate is coming and saying, ‘We’re putting a writer on for the next one.’ That’s kinda cool! … And this is just recent, by the way. But it’s funny that you mentioned Last Witch Hunter because I’m in a meeting with Lionsgate and they’re actively creating the sequel to The Last Witch Hunter.”\nGiven the unprecedented setbacks with the pandemic and the recently-ended Writers Guild Strike, The Last Witch Hunter 2 might have actually already been released by now in a world where neither of those things happened. According to the information in Diesel's statement, The Last Witch Hunter sequel likely would have been released sometime in 2022 or later if Lionsgate had greenlit the project back in March 2020 and Hollywood hadn't shut down immediately after. As far as cutting-edge news on the matter, there is nothing that adds confirmation to Diesel's original claims over three years ago.\nPrior to the release of the original, Vin Diesel informed fans the studio was so excited by the movie they wanted to start prepping The Last Witch Hunter 2 right away. The actor labeled the would-be series the \"Axe and Cross\" franchise and the studio wanted him to block out time in his schedule for a follow-up. Diesel's Kaulder character is actually based on the actor's own Dungeons & Dragons character but has no relation to the recently successful Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves. Rose Leslie, Elijah Wood, and Michael Caine co-starred in the fantasy blockbuster but have not commented on any plans for The Last Witch Hunter 2.\nInitial talks of a Last Witch Hunter franchise immediately went cold following The Last Witch Hunter's release. The film has an abysmal 18% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes and a Metacritic score of 34, which are both poor indications of its franchise potential. With the movie grossing less than $150 million worldwide on a reported $90 million budget, it's possible that Hollywood is much more inclined to keep paying Diesel to appear in more Fast & Furious movies than to try and revitalize the Witch Hunter series. Factoring in marketing costs, it's unlikely the original movie turned much of a profit during its 2015 theatrical run. The fantasy project did particularly poorly in the U.S. too, taking in less than $30 million.\nThe Last Witch Hunter 2 could continue to follow the saga of Kaulder while also expanding the fictional universe with the implementation of additional characters and backstory. The biggest question that would need to be answered from the original movie is whether Kaulder would finally become successful in killing the White Queen. If this were to happen, he would finally get revenge for the curse that the Witch Queen placed on Kaulder in which he was forced to experience the infinite loss of his wife and daughter.\nIn turn, Kaulder would also be giving up his immortality, since the first Last Witch Hunter movie identified that Kaulder would die if the Queen's heart stopped beating. The Last Witch Hunter 2 would have to sort out whether or not Kaulder's life could be separated from the fate of the Witch's Queen's heart, which was last heard as a part of Kaulder's weapon stash in his apartment at the end of the original movie.\nThe weak financial return of the original movie would seem to rule out The Last Witch Hunter 2 but Diesel isn't one to let go of a series he's fond of. The character of Riddick in Pitch Black helped make him a star even after the disappointing box office performance of 2004's The Chronicles Of Riddick in which the franchise appeared to be dead. Diesel refused to give up on it and helped finance a lower-budget follow-up simply labeled Riddick, which proved to be a hit back in 2013. In fact, Diesel was so sure of Riddick's potential that he appeared in a cameo in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift for no payment other than to receive the creative rights to the Riddick franchise.\nDielel pulled off a similar feat with xXx: The Return Of Xander Cage following the box-office flop of 2005's xXx: State of The Union. While xXx 4 and Riddick 4 are currently stuck in development stages, they are still reportedly being planned. The Last Witch Hunter may not have set the box office on fire but Diesel could find a way to keep the \"Axe and Cross\" series going. He could also explore options of the next franchise installment being a lower-budget sequel, video game, or some other form of entertainment through another medium. The Last Witch Hunter 2 doesn't appear to be officially in the works but given Diesel's track record with major movie franchises, a follow-up is always on the table.\nSource: Collider\n"}
{"title": "Will Maleficent 3 Ever Happen? Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-02 23:44:30", "text": "Maleficent: Mistress of Darkness left the door open for a Maleficent 3, but Disney has so far remained silent. Here's everything we know. \nDisney's Maleficent: Mistress of Evil perfectly set up a continued story for the reimagined villain - so will there ever be a Maleficent 3? Based on the famous Sleeping Beauty tale, the franchise stars Angelina Jolie as the titular character. The original Maleficent premiered in 2014 and introduced the new idea that the old villain and her relationship with Princess Aurora were misunderstood. Then, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, released in October 2019, explored how the pair's story progressed after King Stefan's death - and the film certainly left the door open for a threequel. \nMaleficent: Mistress of Evil picks up five years after the death of King Stefan, with Aurora (Elle Fanning) now ruling as Queen of the Moors. The young woman plans to marry her beloved Phillip - the Prince of Ulstead (Harris Dickinson) - but she doesn't fully understand how much his mother, Queen Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer), despises the Moors, their fairy culture, and especially Maleficent. The sequel explores the conflict and ultimate victory of Maleficent over the power-hungry Queen Ingrith, as well as her acceptance of Aurora and Prince Phillip's marriage. Still, there may be more to the story that a Maleficent 3 could cover.\nRelated: Maleficent: Mistress of Evil Cast & Character Guide\nThough there have been rumors regarding a Maleficent 3, Disney has yet to confirm that any of these are true. Though this may seem like bad news, the House of Mouse has also done nothing to shut down these rumors, so there is still hope for the Fae's continued story. After all, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil didn't perform too terribly at the box office, with a worldwide gross of about $492 million. This was a considerable drop from the first Maleficent movie's $760 million worldwide gross but could have been enough to justify Disney diving in to make the story a well-rounded trilogy.\nRELATED: Does Maleficent: Mistress of Evil Have An After-Credits Scene?\nEven if Disney were to confirm a Maleficent 3 immediately, it would likely be several years before the film ever hit theaters. Maleficent: Mistress of Evil was officially announced by Disney in 2015, and the film wasn't released until 2019. This means the earliest likely release date for Maleficent 3 would be 2026 or 2027. This comes down to the franchise's rather ambitious production scope. The second film came with all the thrills of an epic fantasy, and it's likely that Disney would want to top this—and that takes time to achieve.\nFans can expect Linda Woolverton to write the screenplay once again, but Disney may choose to keep the template for the first film and have Woolverton write it herself. The sequel’s script was co-written by Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue, and it's worth noting that Jez Butterworth (Ford v Ferrari) was hired at one point for a rewrite. In general, critics and moviegoers seem to appreciate the franchise’s visual aesthetic, but the script turned out to be a point of concern for Maleficent: Mistress of Evil's critics.\nMaleficent: Mistress of Evil ends with a showdown between the Dark Fae and Ulstead forces. Maleficent nearly kills Queen Ingrith but ultimately spares her life after listening to Aurora's pleas for mercy. Unsurprisingly, Queen Ingrith takes advantage of the moment and fires an arrow at Maleficent, but the plan backfires as the Dark Fae leader transforms into the mythical Phoenix. Queen Ingrith panics and pushes Aurora off a castle ledge, yet Maleficent/Phoenix saves the day once again and promptly turns the Queen into a little goat.\nAs for how Mistress of Evil sets up Maleficent 3, the second installment provides a sense of finality for Queen Ingrith. Still, it's possible that the character could return, if only because of Pfeiffer's on-screen charisma and franchise appeal as a baddie. For the third movie, Disney will likely focus on the marriage between Aurora and Phillip and conjure up a new villain that can command the screen like Jolie. Based on critic reviews, moviegoers are hoping that Maleficent 3 will be more focused on story rather than spectacle.\nMaleficent 3 couldn't possibly happen without Jolie and Fanning—the duos' performances make up the backbone of the Disney movie series. A recast for Diaval, Maleficent's loyal servant, would also be quite a disappointment since the character provides a lot of heart to the first two films. Prince Phillip was already recast in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, with Harris Dickinson taking over for Brenton Thwaites, so it would be frustrating to see yet another actor take on this role. Therefore, these four actors would likely need to get on board for Maleficent 3 to become a reality.\nRELATED: Angelina Jolie Reveals Why She’s Barely In Movies Anymore\nAs for the additional characters of Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, the majority were left with ambiguous endings that could lead to a role in a threequel. Pfeiffer's Queen Ingrith was only turned into a goat in the previous film, and though this was an implied ending for her character, she could always get turned back into a human. Ed Skrein's dark fae character, Borra, could also make a return. Ultimately, assuming the cast is willing to return, there's seemingly nothing stopping the characters of the Maleficent movies from coming together to bring audiences Maleficent 3.\nQ.V.

Since he returned to life after being murdered by Joker, the former Robin has embraced lethal justice, killing Gotham's biggest threats rather than locking them up in Arkham. Jason Todd and Batman have clashed again and again over his lethal tactics, and now the Dark Knight has had enough.\nThe face-off happens in Batman #138 by Chip Zdarsky, Jorge Jimenez, Tomeu Morey, and Clayton Cowles. After having a full-blown fight with the Bat-Family, Batman ends up kidnapping Jason, bringing him back to Bruce's new apartment where Batman puts Jason through a machine that alters his brain. This altered effect is so strong that Jason initially confuses it for Scarecrow's fear toxin. It turns out what Batman has done is simply edit Jason's brain so that anytime Jason experiences increased adrenaline, he is overcome with unbearable fear. Jason honestly can't believe that Batman would go so far as to change his brain, even suggesting that Batman is no longer in control of his actions. The moment is revealed in a preview of Batman #138 from DC Comics.\nBatman and Jason have always disagreed over how to handle criminals. Due to the death of his parents, Batman has been traumatized by the idea of death, he wants to avoid it by all possible means, for everyone. Jason, on the other hand, believes that instilling fear in criminals only goes so far and that sometimes certain evil-doers have to be killed. This philosophical disagreement has kept Batman and Jason at odds for years. Despite Jason trying to give up lethal force a few times, he's always gone right back to it: most recently Red Hood has sworn to kill the Joker, but Batman is done letting Jason choose murder.\nBatman has always been a control freak, but it's generally within reason. What Batman did to Jason completely crosses the line of what Batman typically finds okay, and even recalls a betrayal that he himself found it difficult to forgive. In the infamous storyline Identity Crisis, Batman walked in on the League wiping the memory of Dr. Light. Batman immediately attacked those responsible and had his memory wiped as well - when Batman learned of this, it's what spurred him to create his anti-Justice League protocols. This shows that Batman is clearly not okay with the idea of messing with people's minds, even if they are brutal criminals. However, the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh would be.\nBatman developed the Zur-En-Arrh persona to protect him in cases of psychic attack, but the extremist identity - which sees itself as a pure Batman, without humanity to hold it back - has been messing with his thoughts lately. Zur-En-Arrh set the deadly robot Failsafe on Batman, and now seems to be pushing him to end the threat of Red Hood for good. However, whether Batman is being controlled or not, Zur-En-Arrh is still a part of him, and it's unlikely Red Hood will be willing to forgive Bruce anytime soon. This is especially the case because Batman notes he can't remove things from Red Hood's personality - presumably including his new fear response. Red Hood faces a future where it will be impossible for him to operate as a crime-fighter, and where Batman's betrayal could cut him off from the Bat-Family for good.\nBatman #138 is on sale October 3 from DC Comics.\n"}
{"title": "It Took 10 Years, But G.I. Joe Finally Has A Great Movie Future", "date": "2023-10-03 00:10:27", "text": "Things haven't looked up for the G.I. Joe franchise in a decade. Now, thanks to the new Transformers movie, the G.I. Joe movie future is secure. \nAfter a decade-long wait, the G.I. Joe franchise finally has a great movie future thanks to Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. G.I. Joe Retaliation came out in 2013 to middling reviews, leaving its strength as a franchise in jeopardy, and another G.I. Joe film wouldn't come out until 2021, when Henry Golding starred as Snake Eyes. Due to a combination of factors, including the Covid-19 pandemic, a weak storyline, and divisive creative decisions, Snake Eyes didn't do well, leaving fans wondering if G.I. Joe 3 would ever happen, and the future of the action franchise continued to be in dire straights.\nThanks to Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, it doesn't matter that the previous two G. I. Joe movies bombed. The Transformers franchise has had its fair share of highs and lows, but it's been on an upswing now that the Transformers timeline has a lot of room to explore different characters and storylines. There are plenty of Transformers yet to appear in the films, and now with the inclusion of G.I. Joe characters in the eighth installment in the film series, there's a chance for both franchises to grow together in the ultimate crossover.\nAfter the main storyline there's a surprising twist in the closing moments of Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, where Noah Diaz, the main human character helping the Autobots gets a potential offer from the G.I. Joe. The Transformers' crossover with G.I. Joe sets them up to be part of a bigger universe than they would be on their own. Of course, the tantalizing teaser sets up some big questions about G.I. Joe's movie future, such as how the Joes would work with the Autobots, but the concept has a lot of potential, particularly since both franchises are tied to some of the biggest toy lines in history.\n No characters from the G.I. Joe franchise actually appeared in the film, and it's not clear yet if any of the original cast, like Channing Tatum would decide to return. But given that the series are both very similar in tone, and the Joes have integrated massive amounts of advanced technology into their storylines, it makes sense that in this mid-90s timeline, some of the research in the Joe program could be inspired by Autobot tech.\nThe G.I. Joe movies were heading for a third reboot after Snake Eyes underperformed, but the crossover with Transformers' will mean that the franchise won't have to be carried on its own merit. Bolstered by a stronger IP, it can be part of even bigger events, from the Earth-based to the intergalactic. The crossover also takes the pressure off for a third film which, given its budget and the cost of an ensemble piece, could disappoint at the box office again and kill the franchise for good.\nThanks to Transformers: Rise of the Beasts reinvigorating interest in Michael Bay's films, the Transformers franchise has already had another film in the timeline greenlit. With the strong personalities of the Autobots and Decepticons, combined with the Joes and members of Cobra, there's no end to the storytelling combinations. And now with the G.I. Joes, it's going to be every kid's dream to see their favorite heroes come together with the best visual effects.\n"}

The graphic novel, part of DC's \"Graphic Novels for Kids\" line, retells the story of Oliver Queen's time stranded on an island, as will be familiar to viewers of the CW series, Arrow. Stranded remixes the hero's classic tale, adjusting it for a younger audience.\nGreen Arrow: Stranded – from the creative team of Brendan Deneen and Bell Hosalla – presents a much younger version of the hero, as the thirteen-year-old finds himself having to survive in the wilderness of a desert island.\nOver the course of the book, Oliver develops the skills that will make him one of DC's iconic heroes, and the savior of Star City.\nRelated: \"No Arrows, No Tricks, No Gimmicks\": Green Arrow Finally Beats One of the DC Universe’s Greatest Villains (Again)\nIn Green Arrow: Stranded, Oliver Queen is on a trip with his dad, his dad's business partner, and the business partner's son. He is much younger in this iteration, a fresh-faced teenager, far from coming into his own as a superhero. Oliver has not been very good at the outings his father takes him on. As a result, he is seen as a bit softer and weaker than the son of his dad's business partner, Tyler, who makes fun of him for his seeming lack of skill. However, when their plane crashes on an island, Ollie is the one who must save the group.\nIn past iterations of Green Arrow's origin, Oliver frequently loses his father immediately after shipwrecks, or other similar incidents. He is usually the sole survivor, being forced to save himself before returning to become a hero in Star City. In Green Arrow: Stranded, Oliver has to save his father and their companions by moving past his past hesitations, and applying the knowledge he acquired, but hadn't previously had use for. Green Arrow: Stranded is a youthful and less grim iteration of the hero, allowing his skills and personality to shine in a more positive way than is usually seen with the character\nGreen Arrow has often tackled tough issues, with his older stories having a strong sociopolitical aspect. Green Arrow: Stranded offers a version of the character relatable to young audiences, making this version of Oliver Queen a bright light in DC's offerings since it captures and showcases his abilities and learning period. It may not show Ollie at his height as a hero in Star City, but it does bring positivity to the characte,r given that his recent media versions are grim and full of grief. Green Arrow: Stranded adds a child-friendly, young version of the titular hero that broadens the character's offerings in a big way that DC should continue providing for comic-loving families.\n"}

Sarper wasn’t shy when it came to talking about his past, claiming he slept with most of his 2,500 dates.\nHowever, Shekinah was going to be his last. Shekinah moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul on the reality TV spin-off. Sarper’s past made him look like a red flag to Shekinah, but she chose to ignore it. Sarper wanted Shekinah to be of a certain weight and dress in the way he liked. Still, the only thing truly problematic about Sarper for Shekinah is how he refuses to make their relationship Instagram official. Sarper is not afraid of his adventurous past, but is he too attached to it to tell the world that he’s quit it for good?\nSarper has been working as a professional model for a year. Someone offered him to model for a brand, and as someone who loves “exposing” his body, Sarper took up the opportunity. He did exotic dancing for seven years and enjoyed it a lot.

Stine's newest Stuff of Nightmares comic introduces readers to a killer with a stunning connection to one of his Goosebumps villains.\nWarning: Contains Spoilers for Stuff of Nightmares: Red Murder!\nThe newest comic from author R.L. Stine is redefining one of his most overlooked Goosebumps books. R.L. Stine has become one of the most successful children's authors in modern history. His success with the Goosebumps anthology franchise skyrocketed him to fame, and the name is recognizable to this day with countless reprints and an upcoming reboot series on Disney+. However, Stine is known for more than just his work on the kid-friendly horror series.\nStarting in 2022, R.L. Stine has been collaborating with comic-book publisher BOOM! Studios and a variety of artists to produce new tales of terror aimed squarely at adults called Stuff of Nightmares. In the latest entry, R.L. Stine and Adam Gorham present readers with Stuff of Nightmares: Red Murder. The story follows a comic creator down on his luck after he finds himself struggling to create something successful following the popularity of his first work, Red Murder. Suddenly, at a local comic convention, someone taking on the persona of his bloodthirsty antihero begins killing attendees. It's an interesting premise for a horror story, but fans of the Goosebumps franchise may notice some similarities to one of Stine's original Goosebumps stories.\nRelated: A Mall Santa is Out for Blood in R.L. Stine's STUFF OF NIGHTMARES: SLAY RIDE\nReleased in November 1994, Attack of the Mutant follows the adventures of a comic fan named Skipper who adores the supervillain the Masked Mutant. However, he soon realizes that his favorite villain may actually be real when he notices a building that looks like his base. Red Murder seems to have taken the premise of this Goosebumps story and recontextualized it for adults. After all, the Mad Mutant is not as bloodthirsty as Red Murder, but it's no coincidence that this is Stine's second time taking on the concept. In a way, it works better here, since Attack of the Mutant isn't regarded as one of the best Goosebumps stories. By reframing the tale for adults, the comic gives the concept new life — while also improving on it.\nThose improvements include a twist ending. The Goosebumps story ends nonsensivally with Skipper bleeding comic book ink, hinting that he himself is probably a comic book character. Red Murder, however, reveals that the killer was actually the author of the story the whole time, believing himself to be his non-existent brother. While this ending can be seen coming from a mile away, it makes far more sense than the twist from Goosebumps. But this opens up its own can of worms\nThe stigmatization of people with Dissociate Identity Disorder (DID) is all too prevalent, especially in the horror genre. Making a person with DID the villain has become a harshly negative trope. This comic may be an improvement on Mutant, but it comes at the cost of some ableist undertones. Despite these issues, it's interesting to see Stine take what didn't work when he tried this story in the past and recreate it for his now-adult fans. This opens up the doors to revamping some other past ideas, such as Why I'm Afraid of Bees and Go Eat Worms. The future looks bright for R.L. Stine and his latest series, and if he can continue doing to other Goosebumps books what he did here, Stuff of Nightmares could be even more popular than his beloved '90s classic.\nStuff of Nightmares: Red Murder is available now from BOOM! Studios.\n"}

Brandan started dreading their financial situation even more now because they had a baby on the way.\nBrandan may have been looking for jobs, but the couple seems to be relying on their 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way fame to make money.

Holly, a 44-year-old barber from Utah, was in a long-distance relationship with Wayne, 40, from South Africa. Holly met Wayne on a Jehovah’s Witness dating site a year before they began filming the reality TV show. She always wanted to marry someone with the same religious background. Wayne was also tired of having relationships with women that never lasted. In the first few days of using the site, Holly came into Wayne’s life.\nHolly and Wayne connected instantly. They sometimes spoke to each other for nine hours straight. Wayne and Holly were video calling for six months when she flew to South Africa to meet him. Wayne decided he wanted to marry her. Within three days, he asked her to marry him. Holly was frightened and ran away, only to say yes to him seconds after Wayne chased her. Holly moved to Johannesburg to get married to him within a week.\nHolly revealed she has been married twice before during her 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 introduction. Holly said that during her first marriage, she got married really young. Holly thinks she lived with her ex as husband and wife for “maybe two months.” They got divorced because Holly believed they were not compatible and total opposites. During her wedding, Holly knew in her heart that her ex was not her “person” and what she was doing wasn’t right.\nHolly’s second marriage lasted for 12 hours “at the most.” She had it annulled. Even during her second wedding, Holly didn't feel 100 percent about the marriage. She was so nervous that she decided to drink. Holly got so drunk that her father had to hold her up as he was walking her down the aisle. Holly knew that her third wedding would be different because she knew Wayne was the right person for her. However, nothing was going right as she got ready for the big day. Holly was an hour late to the wedding, and Wayne worried that Holly may have ran away.\nRegardless, Holly got the perfect fairytale wedding thanks to Wayne. Even if things were falling apart, she and Wayne became husband and wife in a ceremony that made Holly happy. Wayne and Holly have avoided sharing any recent photos together on Instagram, but they do follow each other, which is a good sign. The couple seem to be married, even if Holly suggests she’s back in the U.S. with her new updates. Wayne and Holly could be keeping their current relationship status a secret until the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way Tell All.

During the show, Brandan flew to meet Mary in her home country even though he had minimum savings.\nHowever, she repaid him with more doubts, called him out for sitting next to a female passenger, and warned him not to look at other females. Many thought Mary and Brandan would eventually split due to their insecurities. Regardless, the pair shocked everyone by sealing the deal. Recently, Mary revealed she was pregnant with Brandan's baby. The couple looked happier than ever to learn the news and seemed deeply in love. While Brandan and Mary will probably have a happy ending, their proposal and engagement on the show weren't as exciting.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nThere are a few reasons why Brandan's much-awaited proposal wasn't impressive. However, the main reason was a lack of preparation. Most people love planning the proposal, ensuring the timing is right, and making it special for their significant other. However, Brandan didn't do any of that. Instead, he proposed to Mary at the back of their shop. He had no speech and didn't even get on one knee. To make matters worse, Brandan didn't know Mary's finger size and gave her an engagement ring that was too big.\nMany 90 Day Fiancé stars have made mistakes in their relationship. However, Brandan probably surpassed them all by getting the ring engraved. The reality TV star got \"I'm Enough\" inscribed on Mary's engagement ring. He did it as a gesture, hinting at the times they fought and thought they weren't enough for each other. Brandan felt it was a good idea because he didn't want himself or Mary to doubt their relationship anymore. \nAnother big reason why Brandan's proposal flopped on-screen was Mary's reaction. Often, people are happy during these special moments. However, Mary was irritated that Brandan wasn't helping her with household chores. The financial struggle and the baby on the way were other things that stopped her from relishing at the moment. If Brandan had picked a better location, time, and moment, he could've impressed Mary during the proposal. However, his lack of concern or immaturity caused this major milestone to seem like just another day. Still, all that matters is that the new 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 couple is happy.\n90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\n"}

The latest installment of the Saw franchise takes place between the events of the original film and 2005's Saw II. For the first time, Tobin Bell's John Kramer takes center stage in the lead role as he travels to Mexico for a medical procedure to deal with his cancer. When the experimental procedure is revealed as a scam to defraud the sick, John vows to teach the con artists a lesson using his classic Jigsaw methods.\nThe Saw X post-credit scene shows John torturing the con-man who referred him to the scam medical procedure in the first place. In a surprise reveal, he is joined by Costas Mandylor's Mark Hoffman, a long-running villain of the franchise. However, what connects this scene to the original Saw is that it takes place in the iconic bathroom that served as the prime setting for the 2004 horror classic. In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, production designer Stabley explained how he and his team had to study the bathroom from the original film, saying:\n\"We looked at the tile, we were very precise in the way we recreated that...My set designers were pulling their hair a little because we wanted it to be so true. It's so iconic, so it was something that we were very excited to recreate\".\nSaw X has received the most positive reviews of any movie in the series thus far and earned the highest domestic opening weekend of any Saw film since 2010, a deeply impressive feat for the tenth film in a franchise. It is a return to form for a series that has been hit-or-miss, with many praising the characterization of John Kramer and the depiction of his relationship with his apprentice Amanda, portrayed by Shawnee Smith. Saw X also sharply deals with John's struggles with the for-profit healthcare system, reminiscent of another high point for the franchise, Saw VI, which had John take on the private insurance industry.\nRegarding whether there could be a Saw 11 next, the appearance of Hoffman in the post-credits scene appears to set up another installment in the franchise. The creative team has been careful not to commit to a follow-up, though Saw X director Kevin Greutert told Entertainment Weekly that they were \"superstitious about discussing\" more potential sequels before finding out how this installment performed at the box office. With the new movie earning some of the best reviews of the franchise and looking at a solid box office run, Jigsaw and his games could very well return for more.\nSource: EW\nBorn and raised in New Jersey, Anthony \"A.J.\" Ricci graduated from Rowan University with a degree in Radio-TV-Film.

When Kalani and Asuelu met, he was 23 years old, and she was 29. Kalani lost her virginity to Asuelu. He was the only man she ever loved until he repeatedly betrayed her trust despite the several chances she gave him to rectify his mistakes. Kalani and Asuelu came to the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off to save their marriage. Kalani had already used the hall pass that Asuelu gave her, and she began dating a man named Dallas Nuez.\nNow that Kalani knows Asuelu is beyond the point of forgiveness, she could have chosen to reveal his dark side to 90 Day Fiancé viewers. Kalani and Asuelu had a session with Dr. Janie Lacey. Kalani’s sister Kolini joined the couple as they used therapy to resolve their issues. Kolini was the only person in the world whom Kalani went to for support whenever Asuelu cheated on her, and there had been “numerous” times he cheated. Kolini’s feelings towards Asuelu changed to those of resentment. Fans never came to know why Kolini disliked Asuelu so much, and it was because Asuelu had cheated on Kalani for the length of their relationship.\n“It was like girl after girl after girl,” said Kalani. Kalani may have thought her 90 Day Fiance would change when he came to America. However, within a year, Asuelu started “online cheating.” Asuelu didn’t physically cheat on her. Asuelu was reaching out to different women online. He used to buy their naked pictures. That continued until the time Asuelu went to Samoa and indulged in oral sex with an unknown woman. Perhaps his getting yeast infection on his tongue was the last straw for Kalani.\n“So collectively, he’s cheated like 10-12 times,” revealed Kalani. She said she felt disgusted with herself just hearing herself say that. Kalani had put Asuelu in a position to allow him to hurt her over and over again. Asuelu defended himself by claiming that growing up his parents didn’t teach him that what he did was wrong. Kalani said “almost all of the men in Samoa think it’s okay.” As per Kalani, married men were hitting on her and Kolini when they were in Samoa. Asuelu’s friends who were married were also hitting on her.\nBy the time Kalani found out Asuelu had cheated on her, she was already pregnant and bringing Asuelu to America. She felt like she needed to “suck it up and hide it.” Kalani wanted Asuelu to get along with her dad and with her family members, so she kept it hidden to protect him. Kalani assumed if Asuelu came to America and was around her dad, he would be a “good guy.” But Kalani’s plan of getting Asuelu out of the environment didn’t help him change.\nKalani held onto the belief that Asuelu would change up until his Samoa trip cheating and up until the 90 Day: The Last Resort star moved on to be with another man who cared. Kalani kept warning him that they’d end up divorced while Asuelu kept cheating. Because Kalani never left, Asuelu believed she would never leave him. Asuelu is making it look like he’s admitting to his mistakes, but he may have lost Kalani for good. Their marriage is beyond saving.\n90 Day: The Last Resort airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EDT on TLC.\nSource: 90 Day Fiancé/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "Comedy Show From Monty Python Stars Thought Lost For 54 Years Is Found & Can Be Watched Right Now", "date": "2023-10-03 03:17:51", "text": "Once-lost comedy show A Complete and Utter History of Britain, which features Monty Python stars Michael Palin and Terry Jones, has been recovered.\nA decades old British comedy show featuring Monty Python’s Michael Palin and Terry Jones is recovered after it was thought to be long lost. Jones and Palin were two of Monty Python’s six founding cast members, which also included Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gillam, and Eric Idle. As a comedy troupe, Monty Python begin their act through the sketch comedy show Monty Python’s Flying Circus before going on to make a number of feature films, including Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Life of Brian.\nA 54-year-old pre-Monty Python comedy series called A Complete and Utter History of Britain has been recovered by ITV, according to British Comedy Guide. Featuring Palin and Jones, the six-part spoof documentary aired in January and February 1969. At one point, it was thought that only the first two installments of A Complete and Utter History of Britain had survived past the broadcast, but upon further investigation, ITV realized that the series had simply been \"mis-catalogued.\" Check out the statement from ITV below:\n\"The series had been sitting in the ITV vaults though mis-catalogued for decades, but through the identification programme we were able to make this remarkable find.\n\"We flagged it to our colleagues in streaming, had the film cleaned and restored from the 16mm telerecordings and then finally made available to our viewers for the first time since the original broadcasts.\"\nA Complete and Utter History of Britain was originally shot in seven parts, with the first two later edited down into one for the television broadcast. Content-wise, A Complete and Utter History of Britain was filmed as a spoof documentary of the British Isles. The mockumentary united Palin and Jones, who would go on to help form Monty Python soon after its broadcast. Monty Python’s Flying Circus ended up airing that same year, in October 1969.\nRelated: Every Movie Monty Python Worked Together In (That Isn't Monty Python)\nParodying British history as Palin and Jones did in A Complete and Utter History of Britain would lay the groundwork for later Monty Python work. Several of the troupe's movies poke fun at history, whether it be King Arthur in Monty Python and the Holy Grail or Jesus in Life of Brian. From the sounds of even the title alone, A Complete and Utter History of Britain exists in a similar vein to later Monty Python movies and shows.\nNow, comedy fans can see this pre-Monty Python work through ITVX Premium. The buildup to this moment is significant, as the previous surviving material for A Complete and Utter History of Britain was released on Blu-ray in 2014. Audiences who have gotten a pre-Monty Python tease with those episodes can now see the full show as A Complete and Utter History of Britain is recovered at last.\nSource: British Comedy Guide\n"}

{"title": "&quot;Always Keeps Its 16-Bit Heart In The Right Place&quot; - Pixel Ripped 1995 PSVR2 Review", "date": "2023-10-03 08:01:24", "text": "Pixel Ripped 1995 hits the PSVR2, a nostalgic and brief all-ages adventure through classic gaming that leverages 3D interactivity in inventive ways.\nThe Pixel Ripped series has maintained a consistent following while existing mostly under the radar, keeping perfect pace with new upgrades in VR gaming technology while sticking to its core retro throwback principles over a trio of releases. Pixel Ripped 1995 is the second title in the series, which now enjoys a spiffy PSVR2 update delivering smoother gameplay and some new features for Sony’s flagship headset. For millennial and adjacent gamers who grew up in the wood-paneled television age, Pixel Ripped 1995 hits that sweet spot of nostalgic resonance and good-vibes adventure, even though some of its best ideas could use a little more expansion and attention.\nAs with the other games, players primarily take on the role of a young person interacting with Dot, the hero of the video game realm of Far-of-a-Land. Dot presents most recognizably as Samus Aran of Nintendo’s Metroid franchise, sporting shiny armor and a hand cannon, and any scene in Pixel Ripped 1995 from Dot’s perspective features pixelated 2D graphics smoothly modeled and animated in a 3D space. It’s a consistently cool style that hasn’t really been replicated elsewhere, and the detailed environments from this perspective blend 16-bit textures with all the expectant tricks from immersive VR stationary games.\nPart of Pixel Ripped 1995’s approachability stems from its storytelling, which features a charming Saturday morning cartoon plot arc where Dot seeks the help of the greatest video game players in the \"real\" world to succeed against her arch nemesis, a megalomaniacal goblin named Cyblin Lord. To keep the peace, a cubic MacGuffin known as “The Stone” lies under lock and key in a temple, but Cyblin Lord steals it to subdue and hypnotize the residents of Far-of-a-Land.\nThe narrative progresses over the six chapters of the game, which see Dot and her champion player teaming up; the former typically on a screen and the latter with controller in hand. Pixel Ripped 1995 centers on David, an eleven-year-old video game wiz whose mother constantly harangues him about his constant positioning in front of the screen. Both she and David’s father are well-meaning but uninformed parents, and the game is filled with concerned critiques on gaming pursuits which will feel most familiar to those of a certain age.\nWith those tensions in place, most chapters see David attempting to play a game in his favorite series-within-the-game, Pixel Ripped. These feature various riffs on the 16-bit era and a little beyond, including mascot platformers, the Sega Genesis’ Road Rash series, Star Fox, and other teasing references. There’s a turkey hidden in a predictable wall during a Castlevania-like portion, and one of David’s needling frenemies mentions a secret in a game he learned from his uncle who works for the video game company du jour.\nOf course, there are never any overt mentions of real-life gaming corporations, but Pixel Ripped 1995’s developers clearly grew up among the era’s greats, and the more niche references are sure to resound. Beyond these tips of the hat are the more ineffable cultural details, like trying to play a video game while a parent vents on the phone to a relative about her son’s obsession, or the special thrill of playing an unowned console at a video game store’s kiosk.\nIn most cases, Pixel Ripped 1995 uses these scenarios to add a pleasant twist, complicating the otherwise simple games-within-the-game. In the latter case, Dot merges the game worlds in two different kiosks together, so that weapons picked up in a platformer on one kiosk can be transferred to the hero in the other. Players then have to swap the virtual controllers back and forth to make progress in each of the two games, all while David’s nemesis and a few browsing customers yammer on in the background.\nThis attention to atmosphere is one of Pixel Ripped 1995’s greatest strengths. The reality-bending boss battles that finish off each chapter are another, a set of curious encounters which merge David’s “reality” with Dot’s heroics, ramping up the interactivity further. In one, he tosses banana peels to trip up a two-dimensional boss while controlling a motorcycle-riding Dot, all while dad keeps asking about the commotion coming from the back of the car. In another, he guides her through space hazards wielding her spaceship like a paper plane, which is a strong enough gameplay mechanic to make for its own VR title.\nThe game is quite short, with start to credits requiring approximately three hours in total, though hunting for a series of tucked-away golden cartridges in the game might propel completionists to give it another spin. These collectibles unlock skins for Dot, and a few of their locations are satisfying to solve, though playing through certain chapters to track them all down might be a grueling exercise.\nCertain levels risk dragging the experience down, especially the beat ‘em up chapter. Here, David enters a competition at the local arcade, but the Streets of Rage clone he has to play is absolutely the worst game in the lot. The level boss is easy but noxious, presented as a 1v1 fighter rival, but the simplicity of the action here makes the experience feel broken and much less than the sum of its conceptual parts.\nThe rest of the game fares much better, and the Castlevania section in particular is a genuine treat. Even the stand-in for Belmont with his dopey narcissism could be a sly reference to the cartoon counterpart in Captain N The Game Master; that’s how deeply read the love of gaming is in Pixel Ripped 1995. In many ways the superior update of its predecessor, it’s a digestible VR nostalgia-fest which will resonate most with those of us who remember renting games at the nearby shop and running into a silly name left behind on the last player's save file. With this as the current best version of the game – and a thankfully free PSVR2 upgrade for anyone who still has it in their library – Pixel Ripped 1995 always keeps its 16-bit heart in the right place.\nSource: PlayStation/YouTube\nPixel Ripped 1995 is available on most VR headsets, with this newest edition arriving to PlayStation VR2 on October 3. A digital PSVR2 code was provided to Screen Rant for the purpose of this review.\n"}

Offered during a gig you receive as you explore the new area of Dogtown, this mission tests your stealth skills as you negotiate with some heavy hitters in Night City. Those looking to earn some sweet eddies will want to tackle this task carefully.\nYou will be given this task by Mr. Hands as a Gig side quest that appears toward the central parts of Dogtown close to the Pacifica area. This doesn't occur until you unlock different story endings in Cyberpunk 2077's DLC after completing the tenth main story mission, \"Firestarter.\" Once you travel to the gig location, Mr. Hands will call you to begin the mission with a cautionary tale about the son of a recent client.\nRelated: There’s One Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Side Quest You Should Do ASAP\nThe first part of this quest requires you to travel to the previously mentioned spot in Dogtown to meet with Michael Maldonado, the client Mr. Hands spoke of over the phone. The fixer has apparently spoken highly of V, leading Michael to request your services directly in Cyberpunk 2077. Talking to the man reveals that his son, Eric, has been targeted to be made an example of by the law despite the legitimate business he runs in Night City.\nApparently, an officer from the D.A.'s office named Georgina Zembinsky has been trying to bring down a crime kingpin named Hector Sacristán and forced Michael to testify against Eric. According to Michael, Eric has info that could incriminate Sacristán, which explains why Georgina wanted to put them in a place where he could testify so badly. Michael asks you to talk to Georgina and convince her not to send Eric to jail for this mission in Cyberpunk 2077.\nMichael lets you know that Georgina can be found at the Heavy Hearts club, the same place where he was beaten to testify against his son in Cyberpunk 2077. One of the optional goals here is to avoid raising the alarm while at the club, making this a stealth mission for those who want bonus rewards. To remain as hidden as possible, speak to the bartender and ask them about Georgina.\nThe bartender will say that the D.A. officer is likely in the VIP booth and to meet with a person named Jack in the bathroom for more information. You'll catch Jack in the middle of some sort of deal; go ahead and kindly interrupt him to find Georgina for you in Cyberpunk 2077. For a small price of 550 Eddies, you can get Jack to immediately contact his sources and confirm your target's location in the club.\nJack also happens to be a vendor that you can purchase multiple items from, including several items such as weapons in Cyberpunk 2077 that could help during this mission if you run into any trouble.\nThe moment you reach the VIP section, you will quickly realize that you aren't allowed in to reach Georgina, making it challenging to keep sticking to stealth. You might find Markus, an NPC that gets thrown out of the VIP section in Cyberpunk 2077 right as you're arriving, but you do not need to talk to him. Go up the stairs leading to the VIP space, but remember that you are in a hostile area where enemies could attack if you get caught.\nEnemies have to be looking in your general direction for you to be spotted, making it easy to get to VIP Rooms 1-3. To make it to the higher number areas, though, you need to hack and disable the security cameras on the ceiling to make it to Georgina.\nMake your way to Room 4, where Jack mentioned friends of Georgina were who would know her location. However, if you want to grab a special weapon, head down to Room 6 without getting spotted to retrieve the Crimestopper weapon in Cyberpunk 2077. Found in a suitcase within the room, this powerful gun lets you lock onto an additional enemy and immobilize targets when fired as a tool not found in any black markets in the Phantom Liberty DLC.\nEven if you aren't interested in the Crimestoppers, an Attorney in Room 4 will direct you to Georgina in Room 6 anyway. Continue to disable security systems and use the bars as cover to move stealthily through the VIP lounge until you reach this private space. The room is locked, so you must travel down the stairs at the end of the area to find a fusebox in Cyberpunk 2077 past some guards that can open a secret path.\nSimilar to the end of the \"Push it to the Limit\" quest in Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty, the last part of this mission is simply talking, leading to an interesting decision. No matter what you did to open the hidden path from the fusebox, it will lead to VIP Room 6 on the right. Here, you may finally speak to Georgina, who is flanked by a bodyguard named Hank, who makes the situation far tenser.\nDuring this conversation, Georgina will show V the whole confession from Michael, claiming that the father wasn't harmed and simply sold out his son for some quick money in Cyberpunk 2077. She offers you a deal to let her submit the testimony from an anonymous source so that Michael can be safe from Eric's anger. You can either take the deal or force Georgina to delete the footage if you don't entirely trust her story.\nAgreeing to the deal makes both parties happy, but refusing leads to Hank attacking V unless you have enough Body Attributes to intimidate him. Both decisions end the mission, opening up a passage that leads back to the club's first floor. For either choice, you gain 2,000 Eddies from Michael and another 6,000 credit bonus if you remain hidden for completing the \"Heaviest of Hearts\" mission in Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC.\n"}

This twin-headed chaotic evil must be driven back into the Abyss in the last portion of the story. However, doing this will challenge everything you've learned, testing your mastery over your character's class skills and abilities.\nBefore you take on this powerful enemy at the end of \"The Abyss Looks Back\" story Chapter, complete any side content you haven't done in the DLC already. This will earn you the money needed to buy the best items in this Minecraft content and level up your character's stats to better face off against Demogorgon. The impressive attention to detail on any side quests will also prolong your adventure.\nRelated: \"Impressively Like D&D\" - MInecraft x Dungeons & Dragons Review\nThe best strategy for defeating Demogorgon is to attack until you need to heal, then run away to recover your health before going back toward the boss. Unlike opponents like the early Juggernaut boss fight in Minecraft's D&D DLC, the Demogorgon has attacks that can counter almost every class. The boss' tendril arm attacks hit in an extremely wide range, either around its whole body or in front of it, knocking your character back when they hit.\nWith every physical strike pushing you away, it can be difficult to hit Demogorgon in Minecraft, while its limbs are easily able to attack your character from even far away in the area. As of this time of writing, there have even been instances of characters having to reset the battle because the boss knocks them out of the arena. Stay far away from Demogorgon when you can, and use long-range spells to damage it before it can reach you.\nIf you don't have long-range options, keep in mind that a poisonous miasma close to Demogorgon causes any character near him to take damage over time. One of the demon's heads can also shoot a purple beam that causes the screen to go dark and confuse you. Similar to the Larva Mage boss fight in Minecraft's D&D DLC, a slow effect can also be applied, making your character easier for the boss to attack.\nAs you continue to apply pressure and damage the boss, several allies from the story will begin to weaken Demogorgon with different magic. Stay alive, heal when you need to, and wait for your dragon friend to give you the perfect chance to slay Demogorgon once and for all to end Minecraft's D&D DLC story.\n"}

No matter who you want to end up with, giving the correct answers to Zethino's questions can improve your relationship with your partner-to-be. The love test gauges how well you know your companion and how compatible the two of you may be.\nZethino is a dryad found in Rivington's Circus of the Last Days. She offers a love test for you and one companion of your choice to see how well you know your love. She will ask three questions about your companion based on their hopes, fears, and personalities. You're sure to impress your crush if you get them all right.\nRelated: Every Baldur’s Gate 3 Romance Option, Ranked Worst To Best\nEach love test is structured the same way in Baldur's Gate 3. After picking a companion to take the test with, you will be telepathically teleported to a beautiful grove with a rolling waterfall. A large log crosses the stream made by the waterfall. You stand at one end while your companion and Zethino stand on the other. Zethino will ask her three questions and give her final verdict on your relationship afterward.\nIf you are hoping to romance Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3, you should know her well when you arrive at the Circus of the Last Days. Shadowheart finds comfort in good company and an even better vintage. You will earn her respect by being discreet. Sadly, her deepest shame is that she doesn't know who she is or where she belongs.\nNext on the list is Gale, the Human Wizard, who has a few interesting questions. Starting off with a question that is better suited to a high school icebreaker, Gale would be a shiny red apple if he were a food item. He is happiest while on his balcony in Waterdeep. Lastly, his biggest flaw is that he thinks both he and the world would be better off if he were dead.\nAstarion is a popular romance option in Baldur's Gate 3, so many players will want to invite him to play Zethino's little game. Astarion is happiest when he is elbow-deep in gore. He has a deep desire for revenge, as connected to his vampiric lore. Finally, his greatest fear is breaking a nail (at least, the fear that won't make him hate you). They may not be the deepest answers, but Astarion loves them.\nIf you weren't a fan of Astarion's vain and violent answers, Wyll the Warlock may be your better partner in the love test. On Wyll's darkest day, the best thing to cheer him up would be memories of the first night you shared with him, getting to know one another. He most admires his father, Ulder Ravengard. Because of that, Wyll's greatest regret is leaving his father and city behind.\nLae'zel's powerful skills in battle make her an attractive choice for some players. If you want to take the love test with Lae'zel, you will need to know her deepest desire: to find the truth about Orpheus amidst her queen's lies. Her fondest memory is of your night together. Her legacy will be that of a liberator for the Githyanki people.\nIf you want to romance Zarlach in Baldur's Gate 3, you're in for a fun, bloody ride that likely is not safe for work. Just remember that she hates Gortash above all others. Her perfect day involves bashing baddies interspersed with victory sex. Despite the bloodlust riddling her answers, she hopes to be settled down in a quiet village with a nice partner and a few kids in a decade.\nIf you've decided to romance Halsin in Baldur's Gate 3, the love test is a great way to strengthen your bonds. The first question asks where he is most comfortable, but comfort doesn't come naturally to him. He is most proud of protecting his grove from those who threatened it. Lastly, his greatest failure is allowing the Shadow Curse to blight nature for a hundred years.\nThe last romanceable companion in Baldur's Gate 3, Minthara, likely won't be in many player's parties, but if you're into her evil machinations, you can happily invite her to take the test. There are a couple of different ways you can answer this test, and while both are correct, one provides a stronger romantic outcome than the other. When asked about the Underdark, she misses spiced Ulaver wine and thinly sliced rothe steak. She most admires you of all people. Finally, the worst thing done, in her eyes, is letting herself get captured by the cult of the Absolute.\nIf Orin is still alive at this point, she may appear after the test with a cryptic word or two for you and your companion. However, if you've got all the questions right, that won't matter, as you have gotten one step closer to your desired romantic ending of Baldur's Gate 3.\n"}

{"title": "Should You Give Your Heart To Geppetto In Lies Of P?", "date": "2023-10-04 20:05:27", "text": "Near the end of Lies of P, Gepetto asks for your heart. Whether you give it to him determines what happens next, as well as the game’s ending.\nOne of the final scenes of Lies of P forces Pinocchio to decide whether to turn over his heart to his creator, Gepetto. Pinocchio's mechanical heart, the P-Organ, is part of what allows him to walk the line between puppet and real boy, exploring the desolate city of Krat as a freestanding automaton with a sense of will. It also functions as a complex, customizable skill tree, allowing players to upgrade the P-Organ throughout Lies of P to gain new skills and upgrade stats.\n[Warning: This article contains spoilers for all possible endings of Lies of P.]\nLies of P reaches its climax when Pinocchio storms the Isle of Alchemists and defeats the sinister faction's leader, Simon Manus, in what may be the game's final boss fight. He takes a lift down to a subterranean chamber, where Gepetto stands in wait. He greets his creation, and coos over the terrible ordeal he put Pinocchio through. He promises to put a stop to it; but first, he just needs Pinocchio's heart. There are two dialogue options here: \"Give your heart,\" or \"Refuse.\" This choice directly affects what happens next, and the ending after.\nRelated: Lies Of P: Should You Kill Alidoro?\nRegardless of any other choices made throughout the game, giving Gepetto the P-Organ always results in the same, \"Real Boy\" ending to the game. And that ending begins immediately. Gepetto praises Pinocchio's good behavior, and calls him the greatest puppet he ever made. He promises to turn Pinocchio into a real boy and leave Krat with him, before abruptly and violently removing his heart. Pinocchio crumples to the ground, but remains conscious; he watches as Gepetto tinkers with the P-Organ in his toolbox.\nThe scene fades to black, and then up again on a rainy night under the neon sign of Hotel Krat. Gepetto waits beneath the arch of the hotel doorway, a pile of luggage beside him. A bloodstained Pinocchio emerges, sees his creator, and smiles warmly. Gepetto smiles back with a heavy sigh, as he remarks on how he finally sees Pinocchio as his son. It's a happy ending, sure, but there are some nagging doubts. In a voiceover, Sophia asks, \"Is this truly the future you wanted?\"\nThere are still a few things players can do after beating Lies of P, even with this abrupt ending. Pinocchio can return to Hotel Krat, listen to any available Records, chat with NPCs, and play the piano for an easy achievement. However, besides a slightly disappointing, dubiously happy ending, there's not much else that giving Gepetto the heart unlocks.\nThings get a little more complicated if Pinocchio refuses. What happens here depends on a number of choices made throughout the game, not least of which are those that make up Lies of P's Truth and Lie system. Several important plot points come down to a simple decision between telling the truth and lying, and each time Pinocchio lies, additional points are added onto a hidden measure of his humanity. There are other important choices in Lies of P, to be sure, but the morality and humanity of lies are the main determining factors in how the game ends - along with whether Pinocchio gives Gepetto his heart.\nIf Pinocchio has primarily told the truth, and spared Sophia when he met her on the Isle of Alchemists, players will see the \"Free from the Puppet String\" ending after refusing Gepetto. Once they refuse, Gepetto's words of praise turn to admonishment. He calls Pinocchio useless, and resigns to take the P-Organ for himself. Gepetto then summons Nameless Puppet, a faceless marionette who serves as Lies of P's secret final boss.\nPinocchio and the Nameless Puppet spar, but as soon as it seems like Pinocchio has gained the upper hand, the Nameless Puppet knocks him to the ground and lines up a killing blow. However, Gepetto steps in front of its sword. He dies in Pinocchio's arms with one final insult. Pinocchio destroys the Nameless Puppet's heart, and the game ends on the spot.\nHowever, on New Game Plus, if Pinocchio has primarily lied, gave Sophia peace in death, and stolen the painting \"Portrait of a Boy\" from the Black Rabbit Brotherhood, he can unlock another ending, \"Rise of P.\" However, he must return to the hotel after beating Simon Manus, listen to all the Records in Lies of P, and examine the portrait. He notices the image's elongated nose, and can pry it out of the painting to use it as a weapon: the Golden Lie.\nPinocchio may then return to Gepetto and refuse to give him the heart. The final boss battle is much the same, except Gepetto compares the deceitful Pinocchio to his human son Carlo, and apologizes to him instead of scolding him. However, this does unlock a unique epilogue in which Pinocchio restores Sophia to life, transferring her Ergo and consciousness into a puppet body.\nThe best way to negotiate the Gepetto decision is to give him Pinocchio's heart the first time, and refuse him every time after. Those who want to see all possible endings will need to play through the game at least twice. That's because unlocking the \"Rise of P\" ending requires Pinocchio to collect and listen to all the Records in the game, and some of them are only available by making a one-time choice. For example, lying to Eugénie about Alidoro's identity grants him one Record, while telling the truth grants him a different one.\nTherefore, the most efficient way to see all three endings is to always tell the truth and spare Sophia on a first playthrough, then agree to give Gepetto the heart. After watching the \"Real Boy\" ending, players can load their most recent save file and refuse Gepetto to see the \"Free from the Puppet String\" ending. Finally, they can start a NG+, always lie, and kill Sophia to see the \"Rise of P\" ending.\nBut even for those who don't plan on completing NG+ to see that final ending, it's still worth giving up the heart, then reloading and refusing to see both options. Appeasing Gepetto ends the game in about two minutes, and creates an interesting character moment where Pinocchio questions whether he wants more than just humanity. Then, returning to the pivotal moment and trying the other option unlocks an extra boss and a somewhat more satisfying ending. This way, players can experience the best of both worlds in Lies of P.\n"}

Debuting in 2011, Bob’s Burgers quickly set itself apart from other animated sitcoms thanks to its uncanny ability to make even the most bombastic and wild plotlines seem grounded. Despite its surreal sensibilities the show is completely relatable and feels far closer in tone (somehow) to both King of the Hill and The Simpsons than South Park or Family Guy. After over a decade on the air Bob’s Burgers shows no signs of ending soon, and season 15 has been confirmed by Fox.\nWhile details on the next season of Bob’s Burgers after the current run are scarce, there’s still plenty to discuss around the show’s future. Since Fox was acquired by Disney in 2019, Bob and the rest of the Belcher’s have received a movie and a streaming home on platform Hulu. The future likely has much more in store for Bob, Linda, Jean, Tina, and Louise, and it will start with the upcoming Bob’s Burgers season 15.\nWhile there haven’t been any major updates on the development of Bob’s Burgers season 15 since the renewal was confirmed in January 2023, this is largely due to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Not only was development on the next season of Bob’s Burgers likely put on hold while both the writers and actors unions negotiated a deal for fair working condition with the AMPTP, but both the cast and screenwriters couldn’t promote the show.\nNow that the WGA have reached an agreement with the ATMPTP, with the SAG-AFTRA dispute expected to be resolved soon, it’s likely that more news on Bob’s Burgers season 15 will shortly follow. The current season of Bob’s Burgers only debuted in October, so once the finale airs more updates on season 15 may come soon after.\nFox renewed Bob’s Burgers for season 15 in January 2023, alongside the 14th season. The confirmation of two more Bob’s Burgers seasons came alongside commissioning more episodes of fellow Fox animation powerhouses Family Guy and The Simpsons. \n The official Bob’s Burgers Twitter account celebrated the renewal with a photo of Louise, Tina, and Jean skipping. Fox Entertainment President of Scripted Programming Michael Thorn spoke highly of the renewal at the time (via Collider):\n\n\"With this trio of renewals, we celebrate excellence in animation on Fox, our wonderful, longtime partnership with 20th Television, and the brilliant creators and incredible voices behind these forever favorites. Three-plus decades of 'The Simpsons,' more than two decades of 'Family Guy,' and over a decade of 'Bob's Burgers' proves the enduring power of the animation genre on our network and the infinite fan affinity for these outrageously funny comedy classics.\"\n\n\"With this trio of renewals, we celebrate excellence in animation on Fox, our wonderful, longtime partnership with 20th Television, and the brilliant creators and incredible voices behind these forever favorites.

It’s expected to arrive in the fall 2024 season, possibly in October. From the ninth onwards new seasons of Bob’s Burgers have consisted of 22 episodes, released weekly on Fox. Should season 15 follow the same pattern it will keep Bob’s Burgers on the air until 2025.\nThere have been no announced cast changes yet for Bob’s Burgers season 15. There aren’t any expected either, as the show has managed to keep its core roster of voice actors throughout. Provided there aren’t any unexpected exits in the interim, the cast of Bob’s Burgers season 15 is expected to include:\nJoining the Belchers (and Teddy) for Bob’s Burgers season 15 will also include many returning cast members who voice multiple supporting characters on the show. These include Kevin Kline as Mr. Fischoeder, Zach Galifianakis as his brother Felix, and Laura and Sarah Silverman as twins Andy and Aolly. Megan Mullally will also likely feature heavily as Linda’s sister Gayle.\nThere have been multiple celebrity cameos and guest appearances over the years as the show gained momentum on Fox. The cast of Bob’s Burgers season 15 will also likey include from guest-stars, though none have been revealed.\nNone of the plots or story threads from Bob’s Burgers season 15 have been revealed yet. It’s also quite possible that the scripts haven’t yet been written, given the WGA strike in 2023. Once the episode titles of the next season of Bob’s Burgers have been shared by Fox, along with a trailer, what awaits the Belchers when they return will become much clearer. Until then, however, the storylines in Bob’s Burgers season 15 are a total mystery.\n"}

Debuting on Fox in 1989, The Simpsons is one of the longest running TV shows currently on the air. It quickly became one of the most successful shows in the network's history, surviving until Disney purchased Fox in 2019. Now one of the tent pole franchises for the House of Mouse, The Simpsons is still going strong, with season 36 already confirmed and on the way.\nWhile there’s not much known about The Simpsons season 36 yet, anticipation is already high. New episodes of The Simpsons since the Disney acquisition have widely been regarded as being an uptick in quality for the show, with season 34 in particular being well received by fans and critics. With no signs of the show losing momentum anytime soon there’s plenty to digest when it comes to The Simpsons season 36.\nThere haven’t been any huge updates on The Simpsons season 36 since the news broke in January 2023 that Fox had renewed the show for another two seasons. However, there are two main reasons for this — the 35th season arriving first, and the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes meaning a general lack of promotion of in-development projects throughout 2023. Once the current run concludes there will likely be more information available about the 36th season of The Simpsons.\nThe Simpsons has been renewed for season 36. The renewal announcement came in January 2023 when Fox confirmed they’d greenlit The Simpsons for two seasons, which would extend the run of the show into 2025.\nThe release date for The Simpsons season 36 hasn’t yet been announced by Fox or parent company Disney. Previous seasons of The Simpsons have premiered on or close to the start of October, so a fall 2024 release window for the 36th season of the show is likely.\nUnless there are any surprise recasts, sudden exits, or tragic news like the passing of Marcia Wallace in 2013, the cast of The Simpsons season 36 will be unchanged from prior seasons of the show. This means the cast can be expected to include:\nThe cast of The Simpsons is also known for many celebrity and guest star cameos. The Simpsons season 36 will be no exception, although there haven’t been any reveals yet about who’s the next famous face to make a debut in Springfield.\nThere haven’t been any details yet revealed about what episodes are in The Simpsons season 36. The show has been going on so long that what the episode plots might be is unpredictable, but it might rehash or revisit former storylines (while being self-aware and lambasting itself for doing so, of course). While The Simpsons revisiting former episodes is always a risk, the show has been going so long that it’s inevitable plots focused around callbacks to stories from literally decades ago are going to appear, and the 36th season is no exception.\nIt’s expected that The Simpsons season 36 will feature Treehouse Of Horror XXXV, the infamous Simpsons Halloween special, though nothing’s been teased about which popular horror movies the citizens of Springfield will parody in The Simpsons season 36. The current season of the show is also set to feature the return of Sideshow Bob (Kelsey Grammar), who hasn’t been seen for several years. It’s possible that The Simpsons season 36 will also bring back some former characters from the extensive history of the show for some new storylines.\n"}
{"title": "Mortis Gods Explained: Star Wars History, Powers, Planet & Importance", "date": "2023-10-04 20:05:27", "text": "The Mortis gods are some of Star Wars’ most powerful Force-wielders, and Dave Filoni is using them to unite The Clone Wars, Rebels, and now Ahsoka.\nWarning! This article contains SPOILERS for the Ahsoka finale.\nStar Wars has introduced three powerful beings, the Mortis gods, who look increasing important after Ahsoka. The true nature and origin of the Force has always been a mystery in Star Wars, but it is clearly tied to mysterious beings known as the Mortis gods - beings venerated on Peridea, a planet situated in a distant galaxy. These seem to be tied to the mysterious agenda of dark Jedi Baylan Skoll, suggesting they will be extremely important going forward.\nPreviously, Mortis was thought to be a mystical realm that was separate from the Star Wars universe, much like the World Between Worlds. Nevertheless, depictions of the Mortis gods have been found scattered throughout the galaxy, such as the mural at the Jedi Temple on Lothal. However, Baylan’s discovery of the Mortis god statues suggests Mortis may physically reside on Peridea. It’s no understatement to say that the Mortis gods are some of the most important and allegorical characters in all of Star Wars. And if Baylan has found where they once dwelled, he may have stumbled across the power to harness the Force itself.\nRelated: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nThe three Mortis gods were introduced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars as immensely powerful beings, known as \"Force-wielders.\" The Father, the Daughter, and the Son served to guide the Force along its path in the galaxy. While these beings had a physical presence on Mortis, they also had the ability to shape-shift at will. According to one of them, their purpose was to guard “the power,” meaning the Force itself. The realm of Mortis acted as a conduit through which all the Force in Star Wars flowed, and the Mortis gods were the ones who controlled that flow while ensuring the duality between the dark side and the light side remained.\nThe Mortis gods were venerated throughout the galaxy as legendary. In Star Wars Rebels, Ezra Bridger found a mural of the Mortis gods on the Jedi Temple of Lothal that led to the entrance of the World Between Worlds; there are also inscriptions of the Mortis gods in some of the sacred Jedi texts used by Rey in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Although the Jedi Order clearly once knew of the Mortis gods, belief in their existence appears to have waned. Even the Father said that few still know of the Mortis gods’ existence. According to him, their unique ability to manipulate the Force compelled them to abandon the temporal world.\nIn The Clone Wars, the Father is portrayed as an aged man who maintains the balance of the Force by keeping his children in check. It’s likely he’s been performing this duty for several thousands of years, given the ancient depictions of him on Lothal and Peridea. He believed the realm of Mortis was the only place he could fully control his children and prevent them from tearing the fabric of the universe apart. However, the Mortis arc also revealed that the Father was dying, and that he was losing his grip on the ability to control his children.\nRelated: How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order\nThe Father was the most powerful Mortis god, and the children derived their power and immortally from him. Mortis acted as both a sanctuary and a prison for the three Force-wielders. While the Father was tempered enough to keep the balance, the Daughter and the Son were too far aligned to either side of the Force to be trusted on their own. In other words, though they desired to flee Mortis and exert their power over the galaxy in full, the Father kept them both shackled out of love. In his eyes, the dark and the light must wax and wane equally. If one side gained too much power, then the balance of life was thrown out of sorts.\nThe Daughter of the Father represented the light side of the Force, and the side that the Jedi tended to favor. She had the ability to transform into an enormous griffin. She was the day, and enjoyed giving life to Mortis by causing plants to bloom in the sun. Unlike her brother, who desired more and more power, the Daughter took her role as the light side in somberness. She believed and trusted her Father’s decision in keeping her and her brother captive, and she only exercised her power when her brother challenged her. In her own words, she constantly wishes to do what is selfless.\nInterestingly, the Daughter’s statue that Baylan finds on Peridea has been decapitated. As the light side of the Force, her absence symbolizes the state of the light side during Ahsoka's place in the Star Wars timeline. In The Clone Wars, the Daughter sacrifices herself to save the Father, and then transfers her remaining life into Ahsoka Tano. In many ways, her death represents Order 66 and the fall of the Jedi Order. Just as she died, so too the Jedi were killed. Meanwhile, the Son was left to gain power on Mortis alone, much like how Palpatine was able to rule the galaxy for a time.\nAs the representation of the dark side of the Force, the Son (voiced by Sam Witwer) continually seeks to usurp the Father and take his place as the most powerful Mortis god. There was a part of him that loved his sister, but it may have been solely because she gave his own power meaning. The Son was adept at shapeshifting into many different forms, his favorite being a giant bat. However, he also took on the guise of Shmi Skywalker, Anakin’s mother, in order to tempt him to the dark side. The Son also transformed into a small goblin in order to taunt Ahsoka and infect her with the dark side.\nWhile the Daughter was selfless, the Son was selfish. Like the Sith who derived their power from him, he delighted in decay, darkness, and the power hatred and malice gave him. After the Daughter died, Mortis became a realm of darkness and despair. The plants she’d grown withered due to the Son’s power. In a last-ditch effort to escape Mortis, the Son revealed Anakin’s future as Darth Vader to him, though these memories were later removed by the Father. Nevertheless, the Son’s victory over the Daughter represented the Empire and the dark side taking over.\nVery little has been revealed about where the realm of Mortis was located in the galaxy. Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Ahsoka were transported there by an octahedral monument floating near the Chrelythium system. While there, Obi-Wan said that his scanners couldn’t place where they were in the known galaxy. Ahsoka seemed to think the planet was barely larger than an asteroid. Nevertheless, Baylan Skoll may have proven that Mortis actually physically reside on Peridea. If this is the case, then Baylan is close to discovering the location of the conduit of the Force. Mortis itself amplifies Force-sensitivity, meaning Baylan could take his place as a Force-wielder or even harness the flow of the Force itself.\nThere are several notable locations on Mortis. The Well of the Dark Side was a fiery chasm that led deep beneath the planet’s surface, and was the place where all the dark side in the galaxy flowed through. Elsewhere, the Altar of Mortis housed the Dagger of Mortis, a weapon more dangerous than any lightsaber given its ability to kill Mortis gods. However, the majority of the action in the Mortis arc takes place in the Mortis monastery, which may be the same structure Baylan sees in the distance on Peridea.\nRelated: Star Wars: The Clone Wars Episodes In Chronological Order (Correct Watch Order)\nThe entire Mortis arc in The Clone Wars was precipitated by the Father to determine whether Anakin was truly the Chosen One. Given his failing health, the Father believed Anakin could remain on Mortis as his successor, though Anakin ultimately rejected this offer. Even with their mystical power, the Mortis gods still held the prophecy of the Chosen One in reverence. The Father says that it was foretold Anakin would remain on Mortis and continue to keep the balance. Nevertheless, Anakin's refusal ultimately led to the destruction of Mortis and the end of the Mortis gods.\nThe Mortis arc was intensely symbolic, making it hard to place in the Star Wars timeline. Though Anakin, Obi-Wan and Ahsoka were transported there during the Clone Wars, the days they spent with the Mortis gods did not occur in real time. Upon their return to the temporal galaxy, Captain Rex says that they only lost contact with them for a few moments. In other words, the realm of Mortis may not be bound by time, which would explain how the Father has been able to keep the balance between his children for thousands of years.\nThe Mortis arc takes place in Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 3, episodes 15, 16, and 17. In “Overlords,” Anakin, Ahsoka, and Obi-Wan first arrive at the strange realm of Mortis. Anakin also proved his ability to subdue both the Son and the Daughter simultaneously, solidifying his role as the Chosen One who can control the Force. However, in “Altar of Mortis,” the Daughter was killed while attempting to save the Father from the Son, nullifying Anakin’s need to remain and keep the balance. In “Ghosts of Mortis,” the Father chose to sacrifice himself in order to take away the Son’s power and immortality, allowing Anakin to deal the final blow.\nWhile Mortis itself does not appear, a depiction of the Mortis gods also appears in Star Wars Rebels season 4, episodes 12 and 13. In “Wolves and a Door,” Ezra Bridger and Sabine Wren discover a hidden mural of the Father, the Son, and the Daughter deep under the Jedi Temple on Lothal. By using the Force, Ezra was able to activate a gateway leading to the World Between Worlds, which may be intrinsically linked to the power of the Mortis gods. In “A World Between Worlds,” Ezra managed to save Ahsoka using time travel, though the mural and the Temple ultimately collapse in on themselves at the end.\nIn the brief years between The Clone Wars’ release and Disney’s eventual takeover, Aaron Allston further expounded on the mystery of the Mortis gods in his Fate of the Jedi series. Now a part of Star Wars Legends, Allston introduced an ancient being known as Abeloth, who was the primary antagonist of his works. Originally a mortal woman who stumbled across the three Mortis gods, she eventually took her place as the absent Mother in their family. Unlike the Father, who merely contained his children, Abeloth was able to get them to cooperate. However, as a mortal, Abeloth eventually grew old and longed to be immortal.\nRelated: Is Star Wars Bringing Back Legends' Most Powerful Dark Side Being?\nThough they are now a part of Legends, Abeloth drank from Font of Power and swam in the Pool of Knowledge. And while these acts granted her immortality, they also twisted her into a terrifyingly powerful entity of the dark side. The rest of the Mortis gods, fearing her power, had her imprisoned. However, their deaths in The Clone Wars ultimately freed Abeloth to wreak havoc on the galaxy. Furthermore, it’s possible that Lucasfilm's Dave Filoni means to bring Abeloth to canon; she could be the entity drawing Baylan to Mortis.\nIf Abeloth is not calling to Baylan, then it may be that the Mortis gods are not as dead as The Clone Wars led the audience to believe. Since the Mortis gods are heavily tied to the Force itself, its possible they persist even after their physical forms perished. The Father even tells Anakin that their physicality was merely a reflection of the surrounding energy. If the Mortis gods still exist within the Force, it could be that they’re calling to Baylan to come to Mortis and take their place as the keepers of the power.\nRegardless of whether it’s the Mortis gods or Abeloth who call to Baylan, Dave Filoni faces a difficult decision in wrapping up Baylan’s Mortis plot line. With the unfortunate passing of Ray Stevenson, Baylan’s character remains stuck atop the statue of the Father. His goal of reaching Mortis is in sight, yet he can no longer reach it. Regardless of how Filoni handles the loss, he’s managed to use the Mortis gods to tie together almost every Star Wars project he’s worked on, from The Clone Wars, to Rebels, and now Ahsoka.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka now streaming on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Superman: Legacy Risks Repeating The Snyderverse's Big Batman Problem", "date": "2023-10-04 20:10:26", "text": "Superman: Legacy will repeat one narrative trick the DCEU used with Batman. However, doing so comes with risks the franchise surely wants to avoid.\nSuperman: Legacy will officially kick-start the new DC Universe continuity on the big screen when it releases in 2025, and James Gunn's reboot is emulating a Batman narrative decision from Zack Snyder's DCEU. Not much is yet known about Superman: Legacy, though casting details have started to emerge, confirming several heroes like Green Lantern and Hawkgirl who will officially enter the DCU canon with their appearance. Of course, the focus will be on Clark Kent and his adventures as Superman.\nPlot details for Clark's next big-screen adventure are still being held under wraps, but we do know that Superman: Legacy won't re-tell Superman's origin story. Per Gunn, who is writing and directing the movie, \"I think we've seen his origin enough in film at this time!\" While the DCEU does show Bruce Wayne's parents getting shot, it does skip his backstory of becoming the version of Batman seen on screen. While it was likely smart to streamline the introduction of a familiar character like Bruce, it also introduced a few problems that Superman: Legacy will want to avoid.\nBatman has starred in enough beloved movies and TV shows that viewers can be reasonably expected to know who he is, why he does what he does, and how he operates as The Dark Knight. Because of this, and because Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne was introduced in a team-up movie instead of his own solo project, the DCEU presented a truncated version of Bruce's backstory. However, since Affleck is shown as a Batman late in his career, most of his work is left up to the imagination. For the most part, this isn't a problem. However, it also meant that certain DCEU character changes were never fully explored.\nNotably, the Batman presented in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is overly violent and jaded, a far cry from the intense but compassionate Bruce normally seen in DC media. Hints are dropped as to why this may be, such as the costume of a dead Robin in the Batcave, but by skimming over important elements of backstory, some of Bruce's characterization comes off as unwarranted, unearned, and unexplained. If Superman: Legacy wants to avoid similar characterization confusion, it must be more careful with what parts of Clark's backstory it chooses to leave out.\nThough his backstory may not quite be as ubiquitous in pop culture as Batman's, the big beats behind who Superman is are similarly known. Enough movies and TV shows have shown or mentioned the destruction of Krypton and why Clark is on Earth that Gunn is correct about it not being necessary to show again. However, given that Man of Steel is the most recent big-screen project to cover Kal-El's youth and that the movie takes big liberties with important plot beats, some might be risky to skip. Most notably, Man of Steel presented a controversial Jonathan Kent, one who was less optimistic and inspiring and more paranoid and unsure.\nRelated: Every Actor Cast In Superman Legacy (So Far)\nWhile Superman: Legacy's story doesn't need to show the destruction of Krypton, Kal-El crash-landing on Earth, or the Kent's raising Clark, his adoptive parents being a positive and formative impact on who he is may be important context for the older Clark seen in the movie. Of course, there are other options. Clark may still have a close and meaningful relationship with one or both parents in Superman: Legacy, or he could reminisce about their time together even without showing them on-screen.\nSuperman: Legacy will also benefit from the fact that Superman's background simply isn't as important to explore in detail as that of an older Batman in the DCEU. While broad strokes about where Clark is from are foundational elements of his person, he doesn't need a complicated chain of events to explain his optimism and belief in the potential of humanity to do good. At his best, Superman is guided by a relatively simple set of morals and ethics that drive him to be as good as he can be, and that's easy to understand.\nAffleck's Batman was presented as a markedly different character than most interpretations in DC Comics. While that was a good thing in many ways, it also raised valid questions about what happened to him that simply weren't answered. Unless Superman: Legacy plans to make dramatic changes to who Clark Kent is as a person, it should be just fine keeping his backstory to a minimum.\n"}
{"title": "How Napoleon's Large-Scale French Battle Rivals Gladiator's Epicness", "date": "2023-10-04 20:14:26", "text": "A new trailer for Ridley Scott’s Napoleon teases the film’s massive practical battle sequences that rival the major battle scenes from Gladiator.\nRidley Scott hypes Napoleon's upcoming practical battle sequences in a new trailer for the upcoming historical epic, and it looks like they're just as epic as Gladiator's. Scott's upcoming collaboration with Apple sees the director chronicling the life, career, and military exploits of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. After first directing him in 2000's Gladiator, Scott reunites with Joaquin Phoenix for the film, with the actor playing the titular role.\nNow, as the Napoleon release date approaches, Sony Pictures Entertainment has released a new featurette-style trailer for the movie, revealing how Scott pulled off the large-scale battle sequences. The film seemingly relied heavily on practical methods, with the director revealing that filming one battle involved \"300 men and a hundred horses.\" Check out the trailer below:\nRelated: Ridley Scott's Epic New Movie Is Flipping What Made Gladiator A $500 Million Success\nGladiator features a number of big fight sequences, with the opening one perhaps being the largest of them all. The film begins with Russell Crowe's Maximus leading the Roman Army against a Barbarian horde in Germania, and the sequence is complete with a horse charge, chaotic sword fighting in the mud, and explosive firebombs. The rest of the film is similarly action-packed, but many of the sequences are somewhat smaller in scale and a little more contained, with Maximus and his companions facing off against various threats within the Colosseum.\nNapoleon, on the other hand, appears like it might have more of a focus on large-scale battles than Gladiator did. Trailers for the movie have already provided a fairly good indication of the types of battle scenes to come, with Napoleon's Russia campaign, in particular, serving as the backdrop for much of the action. Imagines were recently released, for example, of Napoleon leading his army through a burning Moscow.\nThe Battle of Austerlitz, too, has been teased fairly extensively in the film's marketing. The battle, which was one of the most tactically impressive battles that Napoleon ever waged, famously features the French military commander using cannons to break the ice beneath retreating Russian soldiers. It remains to be seen whether Napoleon's battles will exceed what Scott did previously in Gladiator, but the latest trailer is certainly a promising sign that the movie will be truly epic in scale.\nSource: Sony Pictures Entertainment/ YouTube\n"}
{"title": "10 Best Korean Shows On Netflix", "date": "2023-10-04 20:20:27", "text": "From worldwide hits like Squid Game and All of Us Are Dead to hidden gems from all genres, here are the best Korean shows on Netflix right now.\nThe best Korean show on Netflix includes heavy dramas, action-packed adventures, sci-fi tales, and romantic comedies. Korean TV shows have been among the most successful and well-received works of fiction globally for several years now. Thanks to the streaming era, watching the best K-dramas from anywhere in the world is now far easier, which allows incredible stories and great actors to reach an even bigger audience. From massive pop culture hits like Squid Game to hidden gems, Netflix has some of the best Korean TV shows currently available.\nK-drama episodes tend to be significantly long, with some shows including 60-minute or even 90-minute-long episodes. That said, even successful shows tend not to go on for multiple seasons and are instead wrapped up in a couple of series, which can be helpful for those who are looking for titles to binge. There are great Korean dramas from almost every genre, not to mention series that combine two or three different styles. Here are the 10 best Korean shows on Netflix right now.\nGenre: Romance, Sci-Fi\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Ahn Hyo-seop (Koo Yeon-jun / Nam Si-heon), Jeon Yeo-been (Han Jun-hee / Kwon Min-ju), Kang Hoon (Jung In-gyu)\nOne of the latest K-drama releases on Netflix, A Time Called You is also one of the best K-dramas about time travel. Jun-hee has just lost her boyfriend, Yeon-jun, who was about to become her fiancé, in a plane crash. The character is still grieving when a series of strange encounters begin to happen, leading her to investigate Yeon-jun’s past. What could be just a story about overcoming grief and solving mysteries takes a fantastical turn when Jun-hee somehow wakes up 25 years in the past in the body of a different person. A Time Called You is emotional, instigating, and full of twists that will get viewers theorizing in every single episode.\nRelated: A Time Called You's Ending & Time Travel Explained\nGenre: Romance, Comedy\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Hyun Bin Ri (Jeong-hyuk), Son Ye-jin (Yoon Se-ri)\nThe life of Se-ri, one of South Korea’s most successful CEOs, takes an unexpected turn after a paragliding accident. Se-ri accidentally lands in North Korea and is unable to cross the border. She is found by a group of North Korean soldiers, one of whom believes her story and agrees to help her as much as possible. Se-ri’s energy and naivety compared to Jeong-hyuk’s seriousness makes for a hilarious contrast that sets up an unpredictable love story. Crash Landing on You includes some classic love story tropes, such as “fake dating,” in a Romeo and Juliet-like story that is funny, charming, and emotional.\nGenre: Comedy, legal drama\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Park Eun-bin (Woo Young-woo), Kang Tae-oh (Lee Jun-ho), Kang Ki-young (Jung Myung-seok)\nWoo Young-woo is an Autistic lawyer who graduated as the best of her class and is about to enter a new phase in her career. The character joins a law firm as a trainee, during which she meets new friends and foes. While Extraordinary Attorney Woo tells an overarching story, the show does have an episodic nature in which Woo Young-woo will go from case to case. With engaging pacing and fun cases that will show how incredible of a lawyer Woo Young-woo, Extraordinary Attorney Woo is one of the best legal dramas on TV right now. The show also includes comedy and love stories.\nGenre: Drama\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Song Hye-kyo (Moon Dong-eun), Jung Ji-so (young Dong-eun), Lee Do-hyun (Joo Yeo-jeong), Lim Ji-yeon (Park Yeon-jin), Shin Ye-eun (young Yeon-jin)\nThe Glory, a TV-MA-rated show, deals with heavy themes and is one of the darkest, most violent dramas on Netflix. It follows the story of Moon Dong-eun, who suffered bullying during her school years. The Glory sees Dong-eun as an adult who returns to her hometown seeking revenge against those who hurt her in the past. The show intercalates Dong-eun’s quest for revenge with flashbacks that showcase everything she went through during school. While some of The Glory scenes may be too heavy, the show acknowledges the dangers of bullying in a thrilling story that is also full of twists.\nGenre: Horror\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Song Kang (Cha Hyun-soo), Lee Jin-wook (Pyeon Sang-wook), Lee Si-young (Seo Yi-kyung), Go Min-si (Lee Eun-yoo)\nFor those who may already be tired of zombie movies and TV shows, Sweet Home is a great pick. The show reinvents the post-apocalyptic format with a story about how to survive a “monster apocalypse” that is different from the classic zombie tropes. After a massive tragedy changes the course of Cha Hyun-soo’s life, this recluse teenager finds himself in a city taken over by monsters. Sweet Home is action-packed and features some solid visual effects, and all of the characters are interesting and engaging. Sweet Home was one of the first major Netflix Korean drama hits, and Sweet Home season 2 is set to premiere in 2023.\nGenre: Romance, Fantasy\nAvailable seasons: 1-2\nCast: Lee Jae-wook (Jang Uk), Jung So-min (Mu-deok / Nak-su), Hwang Min-hyun (Seo Yu)\nAlchemy of Souls invites audiences to a world full of magic and action. With 30 episodes between seasons 1 and 2, Alchemy of Souls features extensive worldbuilding and includes dozens of characters. That said, the story is centered on Mu-deok, a legendary warrior who accidentally has her soul sent to the body of a far weaker person, Nak-su. She then starts to work as a servant for Jang Uk, the heir to a wealthy family. Alchemy of Souls’ visuals, characters, and lore all add to a love story that discusses themes like honoring, belonging, and fate. Presumably, Alchemy of Souls Part 2 was the end of the story.\nGenre: Romance, Comedy\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Ahn Hyo-seop (Kang Tae-moo), Kim Se-jeong (Shin Ha-ri)\nFeaturing one of the best K-drama couples in a story full of charming tropes, Business Proposal is a great romantic comedy. Shin Ha-ri replaces her friend on a blind date with specific plans of getting rejected, only to discover the date in question is her boss. Kang Tae-moo is not aware that Ha-Ri is one of his company’s employees, let alone that she is not the person she is claiming to be. To make things more complicated, Tae-moo wants to enter a fake relationship, so that his father will stop arranging blind dates for him. This sets up a hilarious, entertaining show full of sweet moments.\nGenre: Horror, Fantasy\nAvailable seasons: 1-2\nCast: Ju Ji-Hoon (Lee Chang), Bae Doo-Na (Seo-Bi), Ryoo Seung-Ryong (Jo Hak-Joo)\nKingdom is another example of how there can still be fresh, original zombie stories. The show, which is set in the 16th century during Korea’s Joseon period, can be considered a manga adaptation loosely based on Kingdom of the Gods. Crown Prince Lee Chang is tasked with investigating a mysterious disease that is spreading across the kingdom and has already contaminated the king.What could be just a political thriller about conspiracies within the kingdom becomes a monster story when Lee Chang discovers what this virus has done to his father. Scary and action-packed, Kingdom combines horror and fantasy in one of the best Korean shows on Netflix.\nGenre: Horror\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Park Ji-hu (Nam On-jo), Yoon Chan-young (Lee Cheong-san), Cho Yi-hyun (Choi Nam-ra), Lomon (Lee Su-hyeok)\nAll of Us Are Dead can be seen as just another zombie show at first. However, despite the simple premise of a zombie outbreak that has just started, All of Us Are Dead is one of the most entertaining zombie series and one of the best Korean dramas on Netflix in general. The buildup to the zombie outbreak is done incredibly well, and the idea of following a strict set of characters inside just one location for multiple episodes was perfectly executed. All of Us Are Dead’s characters are part of what makes the show great, and the first season works as a standalone story despite an already confirmed season 2.\nGenre: Drama\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Lee Jung-jae as Seong Gi-hun, Park Hae-soo (Cho Sang-woo), Wi Ha-joon (Hwang Jun-ho), Jung Ho-yeon (Kang Sae-byeok).\nSquid Game, themost-watched Netflix show of all time, became a worldwide phenomenon thanks to its engaging, original story about a group of people who accept playing deadly games for a massive amount of cash. From the classic games turned into horrific killing sprees to relatable characters struggling with financial issues, Squid Game connected with audiences from all over the world. The simple premise combined with fast-paced episodes and great performances makes Squid Game one of the best Korean shows on Netflix and a must-see for those who haven’t already, especially because Squid Game season 2 is happening.\n"}
{"title": "&quot;His Brain Looks Like Bubblegum&quot;: Homer Simpson's Treehouse Of Horror Injuries Examined By Medical Expert", "date": "2023-10-04 20:25:29", "text": "A real-life ER doctor reacts to The Simpsons season 13 episode, \"Treehouse of Horror XII,\" examining Homer's bubblegum-looking brain injury.\nHomer Simpson’s injuries in The Simpsons episode, “Treehouse of Horror XII,” are analyzed by a real doctor. Released roughly around Halloween, “Treehouse of Horror” is a series of horror-spoof episodes originating in season 2 and has since become an annual event on The Simpsons. At the time of writing, there are a total of 34 “Treehouse of Horror” episodes in the show's entire run. A sought-after annual entry in the comedy show, the episodes are known for their deployment of movie parody and animation experimentation.\nIn a reaction video from Doctor ER, a real physician examines one such “Treehouse of Horror XII” episode from The Simpsons season 13, explaining the realism (and lack thereof). Breaking down the components of the “Ultrahouse 3000” clip, ER Docter Jordan Wagner explains the extent to which Homer could have gotten hurt due to his sleepwalking. Then, Dr. Wagner details the inaccuracies of the bright pink, pulsing brain portrayed in the episode, which he described as looking “like bubblegum.” Wagner revealed that in his experience, brain matter is more often “grayish, white tissue that’s super soft and super fragile.” Check out the full quote from Wagner below:\n“People do sleepwalk. You have to be careful with that. Some people are a little bit more apt to doing that than others.\nBeing jammed into the edge of the table, depending on where you get hit, you can actually injure your groin. You can actually cause bruising to the lower abdomen, and you can also cause injury to the internal organs depending on how hard you hit into the table.\nOh my god! His brain looks like bubblegum. His brain is out, so everybody can see skull fractures. It wouldn't be necessarily bulging like that. If this does occur, you probably want to have some like wet gauze, something sterile, wet to cover the area and get that person to the hospital ASAP. Oh my gosh, the brain is still hanging out. I’ve seen many injuries, and a lot of brain matter. It’s grayish, white tissue that’s super soft and super fragile. Back of the head, typically it’s the visual cortex area. Also has to do with the balance center of the brain, so you’re going to be off and feel like you have vertigo. Things might not be working correctly. You might have an inability to do certain movements correctly.”\nAs expected from a cartoon take on the brain, The Simpsons plays into visual conventions in this sequence. Much like the commonly portrayed heart shape, the brain is often depicted as a pinkish quality. The Simpsons play into this misleading stereotype, making Homer’s brain appear “bubblegum” pink. This makes sense given the show's comedic sensibilities, and Homer’s exposed brain is immediately identifiable as such despite the anatomical inaccuracies.\nFor all its misrepresentation of the medical details, “Treehouse of Horror XII” has some brilliant parody elements that cement it as one of the best in the perennial show. In this “Ultrahouse 3000” segment, Homer and his family live in a fully automated, futuristic house. This house is manned by a central operating system with voice options, including a “Pierce Brosnan” option, voiced by the actor himself. This mechanism mocks the classic sci-fi movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, whose HAL-9000 operates using similar functions.\nRelated: The Simpsons Pennywise Spoof References A Classic Treehouse of Horror \nThe 2001: A Space Odyssey parody is one of many in the “Treehouse of Horror” series. Originating from a Poltergeist and Amityville Horror spoof, the “Treehouse of Horror” episodes took on everything from Soylent Green to Frankenstein. As is common in The Simpsons, these Halloween episodes prove the show’s ability to pay homage to a vast array of works within movie and TV history. In that regard, “Treehouse of Horror XII” is an archetypical example of the high level at which The Simpsons operates.\nSource: Doctor ER\n"}
{"title": "Ahsoka Revives Colin Trevorrow's Canceled Star Wars 9 Plan (But Makes It Even Bigger)", "date": "2023-10-04 20:30:27", "text": "Ahsoka's finale has revived plans from Colin Trevorrow's canceled plans for Episode 9, though it seems Dave Filoni intends to go even bigger.\nWarning! This post contains SPOILERS for Ahsoka episode 8\nAhsoka's finale episode looks to be reviving concepts from Colin Trevorrow's original plans for Star Wars' Episode 9. Originally titled Duel of the Fates, Trevorrow and his script were ultimately abandoned by Lucasfilm in favor of J.J Abrams returning with The Rise of Skywalker. Now, Ahsoka seems to be exploring some of the original ideas from the first script, albeit in a much bigger context thanks to showrunner Dave Filoni.\nAs seen in Ahsoka's finale episode, Grand Admiral Thrawn has successfully escaped from the extragalactic world of Peridea where he'd been exiled for years, having missed the entirety of the original trilogy's war between the Rebellion and Empire. While Jedi Ezra Bridger escaped Peridea disguised as a stormtrooper on Thrawn's ship, the titular Ahsoka Tano and her apprentice Sabine Wren didn't make it. However, Baylan Skoll chose to stay in search of greater power. As seen in the finale, Baylan discovered major connections to Mortis and the Force gods known as the Ones from The Clone Wars, an idea Trevorrow's Episode 9 would have connected with as well.\nIn Colin Trevorrow's Duel of the Fates, the original script released online in 2020 confirms Mortis would have played a major part in Episode 9. First seen in The Clone Wars season 3, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano unintentionally come across this ethereal Force realm. There they meet the Father, Son, and Daughter, immortal gods representing different aspects of the Force itself. While the Daughter represented the light, the Son represented the dark. To that end, The Father was tasked with keeping his children in balance, acting as a fulcrum for the state of the Force in the galaxy overall.\nWhile The Clone Wars' three-episode arc on Mortis confirmed that Anakin Skywalker was the prophesied Chosen One who could have taken the Father's place, it also saw the aforementioned fulcrum being undone with the deaths of all three Force gods. Nevertheless, the realm would have been featured later on in the canon had Lucasfilm stuck with Colin Trevorrow and the original plan for Episode 9. After all, its key significance and strong connection to the origins of the Force itself would have more than justified its appearance in the culminating movie of the Skywalker saga, the perfect means of bridging the Star Wars timeline together across trilogies and eras.\nDuel of the Fates would have seen Rey experiencing a Force vision showing that she was meant to duel Kylo Ren on Mortis. As such, the bulk of Rey's role in this version of Episode 9 was to find the Force realm. After dueling the Knights of Ren and brushing with the dark side, Rey would have indeed faced Kylo on Mortis who'd become even more powerful in his own right. However, Rey would have eventually embraced both the light and dark, achieving true balance as neither Jedi nor Sith. Naturally, this would have been very powerful on Mortis given its own role in the Force's need for balance.\nRelated: 15 Star Wars Easter Eggs In Episode 8\nNow, Ahsoka has brought back the Mortis gods in a pretty big way. Having confirmed to his apprentice Shin Hati in previous episodes of Ahsoka, something had been calling to Baylan ever since they came to Peridea. Baylan then went on his own to find this source of power he believed even the Nightsisters' Great Mothers feared, hence their alliance with Thrawn to leave the remains of their former witch kingdom behind. To that end, one of the final shots of Ahsoka's finale sees Baylan discovering massive statues of the Father and Son along with the destroyed remains of the Daughter.\nThese Force god statues clearly point to a major connection between Peridea and Mortis. However, it could also be more than that. After all, it was confirmed in previous episodes that Peridea was but one name the. myths and legends had given to the Nightsisters' original homeworld. As such, the possibility exists that Peridea and Mortis are one and the same in the Star Wars canon. Furthermore, Obi-Wan did say in The Clone Wars that he couldn't determine where in the galaxy they were or if they were even still in their own galaxy after they were drawn to Mortis by the Father. This does fit with Peridea existing in another galaxy.\nAt the very least, Peridea was a world that was known to the Mortis gods who were likely worshiped by its residents (perhaps even by the Nightsisters). If Peridea and Mortis are later revealed to be separate planets, it follows there could still be points of access to Mortis on the planet itself, potentially providing Ahsoka and Sabine with a new means of escaping the extragalactic world. However, it's also possible that Peridea has a major connection to the Force gods' Legends history and a horrifying new threat to the Star Wars galaxy.\nFollowing this major Mortis reveal in Ahsoka's finale, it's clear that Star Wars is likely setting up returns for The Father, Son, and Daughter in some way. If not them, then perhaps the Mother from Legends who became corrupted as the Force entity known as Abeloth, a being of complete entropy and chaos. Having been imprisoned and contained by the Force gods for millennia, Legends saw Abeloth breaking free in the wake of their deaths and becoming a major threat during the New Republic era.\nKeeping that in mind, perhaps Abeloth is the great power of legend who's been calling out to Baylan. She'd certainly be big enough to scare the Nightsisters' Great Mothers. Seeing as how Abeloth wanted to wipe out the entire galaxy in order to create a new one, perhaps Baylan is seeking her power in his mission to end the galaxy's never-ending cycle of conflict between the light and dark. Naturally, re-canonizing and adapting Abeloth and her history with the Mortis gods would be huge for the Star Wars franchise.\nIt's very important that Ahsoka is now stranded on Peridea as well, seeing as how she carries the essence of the Daughter within her as seen in The Clone Wars season 3. It's why the Daughter's convor owl named Morai has watched over Ahsoka ever since, having made multiple appearances across Tano's journey (including Ahsoka's final episode). As such, seeing Morai on Peridea is a very strong sign that Ahsoka and her apprentice are destined to be on Peridea (to likely stop Baylan).\nRelated: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nIt's very exciting that Ahsoka is reviving the idea of using Mortis and the Force gods in live-action after Duel of the Fates was canceled. However, it's quite evident by this setup alone that Filoni's plans will be much bigger in scale and scope than Trevorrow's were for Episode 9. While Trevorrow's concept sounded quite good, it's for the best that Filoni is continuing the concepts of Mortis and the Force gods instead, having conceived their inception in the first place. If Star Wars is going to do a new Mortis story in any form, it's hard to beat Dave Filoni being the one behind the Ones.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Jacob Elordi's Elvis Presley Is Already Beating Austin Butler In One Big Way", "date": "2023-10-04 20:30:27", "text": "Austin Butler almost nabbed an Oscar for playing Elvis Presley, but Jacob Elordi's portrayal as the King of Rock in Priscilla could be even better.\nPriscilla is the upcoming biopic about Elvis Presley's wife from Sofia Coppola, and Jacob Elordi already seems like a better Elvis than Austin Butler in one specific way. As the title alludes, the biopic focuses on Elvis's wife more than the King of Rock himself, and it explores the toxic relationship between the couple that most other media about them has often sidestepped. In the new movie, Elvis is depicted as a villain, throwing chairs at walls and trying to take control of Priscilla's whole look, even down to how much eye makeup she wears. Priscilla ultimately wants to be her own person.\nPriscilla follows the 2022 hit Elvis, though they're completely different films with different approaches to the same real-life people. Where the Priscilla trailer showcases a harrowing drama, Elvis focused as much on the spectacle of Elvis Presley's life with some thrilling musical sequences. However, it's impossible not to compare the two, especially as their release dates are so close to each other (Elvis was released in July 2022 and Priscilla is out on November 3, 2023). The 2023 movie doesn't shy away from the facts that Baz Luhrmann's Elvis tried to hide, but there's one major comparison between the two movies, and that's Jacob Elordi and Austin Butler's voices.\nBased on the Priscilla trailer, Jacob Elordi's voice already sounds better than Austin Butler's. Elordi's voice sounds more realistic, authentic, and natural compared to Butler's. Butler's Elvis voice sometimes felt like an impression of the King of Rock with all the \"uh-huhs,\" though that still worked because of how intentionally theatrical and over-the-top Elvis is. Interestingly, while Elordi's voice sounds more natural, Butler spent two years in vocal training just to sound like Elvis. Ironically, Butler has been struggling to drop the Elvis accent (via Variety), and it was only eight months after Elvis' release when Butler finally started losing that accent.\nPriscilla isn't Elvis' movie and, in fact, Elvis is something of a villain in the film. The movie doesn't shy away from some dark facts, such as the Elvis and Priscilla age gap - Priscilla was just 14 years old when she met the 24-year-old King of Rock - and there are shots of the young girl learning in school to emphasize exactly that. Nevertheless, while there's no denying that Butler was great as Elvis Presley in the 2022 movie and totally deserved the Academy Award nomination, based on the trailer, Elordi's Elvis is already looking like he could be the better of the two 2020s on-screen Elvises.\nNevertheless, while Jacob Elordi might outdo Austin Butler in some instances, it's a completely different performance. Elordi doesn't have to perform in the same way that Butler did, and Elordi's performance is on a much smaller scale. Ultimately, they're both extremely different portrayals of the same character and while Elordi might excel in some dramatic areas, the Priscilla actor isn't required to commit to the role in the way that Butler did. There's plenty of room on the cinema landscape for two great Elvis performances.\nSource: Variety\nCurrently splitting his time between Madrid and Chicago, Stephen Barker has been a staff writer at Screen Rant since 2020.

Wally West's intense connection to the Speed Force makes him a conduit to a powerful and other-dimensional plane of energy that nobody truly understands. Unfortunately for the Flash, that lack of understanding seems to be coming back to haunt him now that the mysterious Force has seemingly robbed him of one of his most world-breaking powers.\nThe Flash #1 by Si Spurrier, Mike Deodato Jr., Trish Mulvihill, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou opens with two non-titular speedsters – Max Mercury and Impulse – seeking to transcend time and space, as Max has done many times before, using the Speed Force. Unexpectedly, the Speed Force instantly rejects them, hurtling them back with an unexpected ferocity and apparently closing the door on the Flash Family’s dimension-hopping and time-traveling capabilities.\nBased on Wally’s tempestuous relationship with the Speed Force seen throughout the rest of the issue, it’s clear that the Flash is in a dangerous new era of his career as the protector of Keystone and Central City.\nRelated: Flash's New Villains Put a Sick Twist on the Entire Flash-Family\nIn this very issue, the Flash’s ally and employer, Mr. Terrific, tells the hero that “thinking sideways” will get them through their current crisis, and with Wally’s powers on the fritz, that seems to be exactly what he’ll have to do. Wally notoriously hates time travel, and, in the DC Universe, changing the past very rarely has any positive repercussions. Despite all that, that the Flash can always turn back the clock when things don’t go his way has always hung over the character and affected the stakes of his stories. Now that his powers are more erratic than ever, there’s no chance for a do-over should things go wrong for the Crimson Comet, raising the stakes for both Wally and the audience.\nAside from speed, the heroes who have used the mantle of the Flash have always been known for their unique perspective and their abilities to think outside the box. Whether it’s Barry Allen with his famous Flash Facts or Wally’s more instinctual and borderline-mystical connection with the Speed Force, the Flashes’ ability to always use their powers creatively to outsmart dangerous foes is inherent to the Flash Family legacy. Clearly, these heroes are no strangers to thinking sideways, and, as Mr. Terrific says, that’s exactly what Wally West will need to hone that creative edge more than ever — especially if the Speed Force continues to glitch.\nThe Flash is the Fastest Man Alive, but even he has to slow down every now and then. Now that the Speed Force is cracking down on Wally West’s overpowered nature, the stakes are incredibly high for Wally, Max, Impulse, and the rest of the Flash Family. Whether these fan-favorite speedsters ever fully regain their reality-distorting abilities remains to be seen, but until then, the Flash is going to have to think even faster than he can run.\nThe Flash #1 is on sale now from DC Comics.\n"}
{"title": "All Child's Play Movies, Ranked Worst To Best", "date": "2023-10-04 20:40:28", "text": "Chucky is a longstanding icon of the horror genre with eight movie installments in his celebrated Child's Play franchise. Here's every film, ranked.\nThe evil doll Chucky's best movies of the longstanding Child's Play franchise are ranked here from worst to best. The original Child's Play movie started out as a script called Batteries Not Included by writer Don Mancini which was later retitled Blood Buddy. The initial concept was that a boy named Andy was given a doll that was filled with fake blood but would later come alive when Andy accidentally mixed his own blood with it. The doll, who would become known as the infamous Chucky, would come to life when Andy went to sleep, acting out his unconscious desire to kill. The story had intended to be a mystery with viewers unsure if it was Chucky or Andy carrying out the murders.\nWhen Tom Holland (Fright Night) came on board to direct Child's Play the concept was completely changed. A serial killer named Charles Lee Ray transfers his soul into a Chucky doll just before his human body dies. With his soul trapped in a toy, he needs to transfer his evil spirit to a human body or be trapped in the doll for good so he selects Andy as a host. The movie was a smash hit and Chucky would return many times in the years that followed although the tone and genre of each sequel would vary wildly. With a 2019 remake and a 2021 TV series presenting fans with a fresh take on Chucky, let's take a look through the franchise and rank each entry from worst to best.\nRELATED: Chucky: 10 Movies & TV Shows Where You've Seen The Cast\nThe only entry in the franchise that's a true disappointment is 1991's Child Play 3. This sequel was released a mere nine months after the second movie. This rush to shoot a new sequel ultimately hurt the final product. The premise finds Chucky coming back to life 8 years after part two and tracking his old nemesis Andy to a military school. While the setting is unique and Brad Dourif (The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers) is typically excellent as Chucky's voice, the third movie lacks in suspense and new ideas. Outside the occasional inspired touch like a showdown in a funhouse, Child's Play 3 is a relative dud.\nSeed Of Chucky was series creator Don Mancini's directorial debut. He decided to completely embrace a cartoony tone instead of making a straightforward slasher. Seed of Chucky picks up after the ending of Bride Of Chucky, which features Chucky's girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) giving birth to a baby doll. The movie has been accurately described as an over-the-top farce with numerous creative stretches such as Tilly playing both herself and Tiffany and cameos from John Waters (Feud) and Redman. While it's silly and fun in its own right Seed of Chucky hardly feels like a horror movie at all, which is why it's one of the least loved entries.\nRELATED: Child's Play: How to Watch Every Chucky Movie in Order\nDon Mancini returned for 2017's Cult Of Chucky which finds the survivor of the previous film Nica (Fiona Dourif) in a psychiatric rehabilitation center. Cult of Chucky is arguably the most experimental installment of the series and features bizarre visuals and creative deaths likely inspired by Mancini's work on the Hannibal series. The movie also features surprise cameos by previous cast members and ends on an intriguing note that sets up a further story. While Cult of Chucky is a solid and suspenseful entry, it feels a little underwhelming after the home run that was Curse Of Chucky.\nChucky and the Child's Play franchise arrived at an interesting time in the world of slasher films. Major series like Halloween and Friday The 13th were starting to wind down after disappointing sequels. Child's Play 2 picks up two years after the original with Andy taken in by a foster family. The toy company behind the Chucky doll decides to rebuild the destroyed doll which comes to life and seeks out Andy. Child's Play 2 embraces a more comic tone and features a number of fun set pieces. One scene features Chucky a Terminator-style showdown in a toy factory. The sequel doesn't go too far outside the standard but it's a lean, energetic follow-up regardless.\nRELATED: 10 Most Consistent Horror Franchises To Binge, According To Reddit\nThe Child's Play remake has proven somewhat controversial, with creator Don Mancini distancing himself from it while he focuses on the Child's Play TV show Chucky. The movie also marks the first time Brad Dourif hadn't voiced Chucky but with a great replacement in Mark Hamill. Despite this outside drama, the remake is a surprisingly fun reinvention of the Child's Play franchise. It takes the basic concept of a lonely boy being given the Chucky doll only to discover he has advanced A.I. built in which gives him control over gadgets.\nAfter forming a bond with the new Andy, the defective doll takes offense to anyone hurting Andy and starts offing victims in gory yet darkly comedic ways. The cast is also a highlight, especially Gabriel Bateman (Light's Out) as the new Andy. The humor in the remake can be too broad at times and Chucky's backstory is rather thin but the Child's Play 2019 reboot is much better than expected.\nAfter a decade of slashers with a repetitive but unique gimmick like A Nightmare On Elm Street's Freddy Krueger, Child's Play introduced the murderous doll Chucky to the world. The original movie is quite tame for much of its runtime, playing out more like a suspenseful thriller than a bloody horror flick. The central relationship between Andy and his mother is sweet and director Tom Holland milks a good amount of tension from the stalking sequences. The movie might be a touch slow for modern tastes but Child's Play is still a great and efficient thriller.\nRELATED: Does Jade Kill Chucky In Bride Of Chucky?\nFollowing the lukewarm response to Child's Play 3, the series appeared effectively done. Horror movies, in general, entered a weird time in the 1990s. It wasn't until Scream revitalized the genre that studios regained interest. This led to Bride Of Chucky, where Charles Lee Ray's former girlfriend Tiffany brings him back to life once more and they go on a romantic killing spree. Bride has all the gore and creative kills fans could ask for but the comedic interplay between Dourif and Tilly and Ronny Yu's (Freddy Vs Jason) energetic direction is what makes it click. The movie also introduced Chucky's iconic scarred look and is arguably the most popular entry outside the 1988 original.\nFollowing the box-office disappointment of Seed Of Chucky, Mancini considered remaking the original and revisiting his Blood Buddy idea. When untangling the rights proved too difficult, he instead opted for Curse Of Chucky, a tonal reboot that was also the first to go straight to DVD. While this has spelled the death of other horror franchises like Hellraiser, it surprisingly resulted in the best entry in the Child's Play series to date. Everything about Curse Of Chucky works superbly.\nThe best features include Fiona Dourif's strong new heroine Nica, the overall gothic tone, the intriguing family drama, the impressive set pieces, and the surprising links to past entries. Curse of Chucky is a love letter to the franchise and to its dedicated fans, proving that Chucky actually could be a hit again. These qualities solidify Curse of Chucky as the greatest movie in the Child's Play series.\n"}
{"title": "What's Going On With Jonathan Majors?", "date": "2023-10-04 20:51:28", "text": "After his MCU debut as Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Jonathan Majors was arrested for assault. Here's what's going on now.\nAfter his debut in season 1 of Loki as the Kang variant He Who Remains and as Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Jonathan Majors was charged with domestic violence and assault, raising big questions for the future of the MCU. After the defeat of Thanos in Avengers: Endgame, the MCU turned to its next big bad, hiring Jonathan Majors to play the time-traveling, multiversal villain Kang the Conqueror (and all his variants). However, serious charges leveled at the actor now put Disney and Marvel Studios in a tight spot.\n2023 was off to a big start for Jonathan Majors. Creed III debuted to rave reviews and a strong box office performance, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania marked his first theatrical outing as Kang the Conqueror, but in March, Jonathan Majors was arrested for misdemeanor charges of assault, strangulation, and harassment after an altercation with his girlfriend. Majors' attorney insists the actor is innocent of the charges, claiming video evidence and witness testimony will exonerate him, putting a big wrinkle in the future development of the Marvel Cinematic Universe until there's a clear resolution to his case.\nAfter the MCU's Infinity Saga featured Josh Brolin's Thanos, culminating in his defeat in Avengers: Endgame, the MCU was without an overarching antagonist until the introduction of Kang the Conqueror. Kang is a time-traveling supervillain from the future who leverages his superior intellect, advanced technology, and numerous variants to wage war on the multiverse. As teased in the post-credits scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, there are numerous iterations of Kang, with dozens of versions played by Jonathan Majors already depicted on-screen, making him far more difficult to recast than Thanos, who was portrayed by a different actor in his initial tease at the end of The Avengers.\nMajors' first appearance was in the season 1 finale of Loki, followed by a bigger role in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but he had multiple additional appearances slated in the coming years. A post-credits scene from Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania already teased his expanded part in Loki season 2, which is set to release in October, but the next Avengers movie, scheduled for May 2026, has the character's name in the title: Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. It's unclear how Disney and Marvel Studios will react to the charges against Majors, but his big role in the MCU's future makes the issue impossible to ignore for too long.\nMajors was initially arrested in New York on March 25, 2023, under charges of strangulation, assault, and harassment. The NYPD says the arrest was in response to a 911 call from the victim in which she \"informed the police she was assaulted.\" The statement from the NYPD also said the victim \"sustained minor injuries to her head and neck and was removed to an area hospital in stable condition.\" On April 19, a report revealed multiple additional alleged victims of Jonathan Majors were working with the Manhattan district attorney’s office on additional abuse allegations.\nAfter the charges, Majors was removed from ad campaigns for the United States Army and the Texas Rangers, and his role in Nadia Latif's movie The Man in My Basement, in addition to Majors being dropped by his management company and PR representation. Majors is presumed innocent until proven guilty, but the fact that he's being dropped by his representation indicates a lack of confidence in his defense. Even if Majors is innocent, the allegations have already had serious consequences on his career. If he's convicted of the charges, it will only get worse, including criminal penalties potentially including up to one year in prison.\nMajors' lawyer, Priya Chaudhry, claims he's innocent of all charges and is \"provably the victim of an altercation with a woman he knows.\" She says witness testimony and video evidence will fully exonerate Majors. Additionally, Chaudhry claims the charges are an example of racial discrimination by the New York justice system: “This glaring double standard between the treatment of Jonathan Majors, a Black man weighing 200 lbs, and his accuser, highlights the racial bias that permeates the criminal justice system.”\nAfter Majors' initial arrest, Chaudhry released text messages to TMZ featuring the alleged victim apologizing to Majors for putting him in this position and saying she would \"make sure nothing happens about this.\" The text messages from the victim also show her taking blame for the incident and that she told police \"it was my fault for trying to grab your phone.\" Despite the texts deflecting blame from Majors, they still implicitly acknowledge some sort of violent altercation occurred, which, paired with the victim's documented injuries, will be difficult for Majors to dismiss in court.\nDuring the Sept. 15 hearing, Judge Michael Gaffey set Wednesday, Oct. 25 for the next hearing, per Variety. In September, Majors' attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the case and the Manhattan District Attorney's office must respond by Oct. 6; then the defense must respond by Oct. 13.\nOn Sept. 6, a short hearing was held where it was decided that another would be held on Sept. 15, as reported by Deadline. The cause for the latest delay comes from the defense, who stated there were “deficiencies” in discovery on their end. Majors did not appear in person for the Sept. 6 hearing, but did appear virtually.\nPreviously on Aug. 3, 2023, Majors appeared in person in a lower Manhattan courtroom for what was meant to be the start of his trial. However, according to Deadline, Judge Gaffey approved a postponement following Assistant D.A Kelli Galaway's request for more time for discovery. Following the hearing, DA spokesperson Doug Cohen told Deadline, \"We look forward to presenting the full facts and evidence at trial.\" Chaudhry issued a statement after the court hearing:\nFor an excruciating four months, Jonathan Majors, the real victim in this shameful ordeal, has had his life, career, and reputation torn apart. Yet he remains unwavering in his determination to be absolved from this harrowing ordeal.\nPreviously on June 20, 2023, Majors appeared in court for the first time since his March arrest. Shortly after, Chaudhry issued a statement that noted how Majors' legal team had urged the judge to instantly dismiss the charges brought against the actor and initiate proceedings against Grace Jabbari, Majors' first alleged victim, who Majors' legal team now claims attacked him first. Per Deadline, the NYPD has \"no plans\" to make an arrest.\nMajors is just the most recent superhero star to encounter legal trouble and negative press after Ezra Miller, Amber Heard, Anthony Starr, and other comic book actors have faced similar criticisms in recent years. While none of those actors lost their roles due to the allegations against them (with Starr being the only one actually convicted of assault), Marvel previously fired James Gunn from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 over offensive tweets he'd made in the past. Gunn obviously eventually returned to direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, but they may not be so quick to pull the trigger with Jonathan Majors.\nThe allegations against Majors are concerning and should be taken seriously, but Disney and Marvel Studios will likely wait to make any serious decisions about the actor's future until the case has been resolved in a court of law. While the accusations are sure to tarnish his career even if he's ultimately found innocent, Majors wouldn't be the first MCU star in legal trouble. The MCU kicked off by taking a big swing on Iron Man by casting a then-disgraced Robert Downey Jr., and Thanos actor Josh Brolin was also arrested for domestic battery in 2004, although Majors' charges are far more serious.\nWhile Avengers: The Kang Dynasty is still a few years away, Loki season 2 is a far more immediate concern for Marvel Studios. Majors' role as the Kang variant Victor Timely was already teased in Quantumania, but the actor could also portray multiple other variants in the series. Originally expected to release on Disney+ in the summer, Loki season 2 will now premiere on October 6. The reason for the delay is unclear, though it may be an attempt to avoid overlap with Majors' legal proceedings. Marvel Studios has not yet commented on the reason for Loki season 2's delay to October 6, 2023.\nIn the lead up to Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's Disney+ release on May 17, Jonathan Majors' Kang was featured only very briefly in the two trailers Marvel Studios posted online. The focus of the trailers was put more on Paul Rudd's Scott Lang, Evangeline Lilly's Hope Van Dyne and Katherine Newton's Cassie Lang, which makes sense given they're the lead heroes. However, Majors' Kang was a focal point of the promotion for the initial theatrical release of the movie, so his lack of presence in the streaming release promotional material is notable.\nFurther, at Disney's upfront presentation on May 16, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige spoke to assembled advertisers and press about upcoming MCU shows, including Loki. He announced Loki season 2's October release date, spoke about the series, and screened a trailer. According to Axios reporter Tim Baysinger (via Twitter), Feige didn't mention Majors, nor did Victor Timely or any other Kang variants appear in the Loki season 2 trailer. As previously stated, it's expected Majors will have a sizable role in Loki season 2 following Quantumania's post-credits scene, but Marvel Studios may be choosing to downplay his involvement in the marketing of the show.\nNeither Disney, Marvel Studios, nor Kevin Feige have commented on Majors' assault arrest as of the publication of this article. Previously, a Deadline report published on April 17, 2023, stated Marvel had not discussed recasting Majors in the MCU at that time. With the MCU's Phase 5 continuing after the June premiere of Secret Invasion on Disney+, however, Marvel won't be able to stay quiet on Majors for much longer.\nAccording to Joanna Robinson, author of the book MCU: The Reign of Marvel Studios, Marvel changed their plans for MCU Phase 5 and 6 after seeing Jonathan Majors' performance as He Who Remains in Loki season 1 and Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Further, Robinson said she's heard different stories about what the studio plans to do in regard to Majors' role in the MCU following his arrest. Robinson said:\nI was told by someone who works for Marvel, it was not the plan to make Kang the center of everything until they saw the dailies from Quantumania and after his performance in Loki, which was so strong they were like, 'This is it. This is our way forward'... They don’t usually hang this much on one person in the way that they did here. And that has put them in the bind. We do not know what they are going to do. I've heard conflicting stories about they are going to replace him, they’re not even considering replacing him etc. etc. But it’s just one more thing.\nSince Robinson didn't go into further detail, it's unclear what Marvel Studios' original plan for the Multiverse Saga, which concludes with Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars, may have been. It's been speculated Doctor Doom could've been a major threat for Secret Wars, since Phase 6's Fantastic Four movie releases prior to The Kang Dynasty. It's also uncertain what Marvel Studios may do in light of the charges against Majors. Until Marvel Studios releases an official statement, it can be presumed the studio is moving forward with Kang the Conqueror as a major villain in the MCU Phase 5 and 6.\nDuring an interview with Inverse, published on June 28, 2023, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier star Anthony Mackie was questioned about the future of Kang the Conqueror in the MCU after Majors' arrest. Mackie responded to questioning by stating:\nWe're a country that was built on 'everyone is innocent until proven guilty,' that's one of the staples of this country. Nothing has been proven about this dude. Nothing. So everyone is innocent until proven guilty.\nMackie became the first individual within Marvel Studios to make any comment on the arrest and allegations, though he refrained from speculating whether Jonathan Majors would be recast in the MCU's future.\nIn the lead up to the premiere of Loki season 2, producer Kevin Wright was asked by Variety about whether Majors' assault arrest affected the show. Wright explained that it didn't, largely because all filming on the season wrapped in 2022, prior to Majors' arrest. When asked if the arrest led to any discussions of making changes to Loki season 2, Wright said:\nNo. And that mainly came from — I know as much as you do at the moment. It felt hasty to do anything without knowing how all of this plays out.\nBased on Wright's comment, it seems Marvel is waiting to see the result of Majors' trial before making any decisions about how to proceed with his involvement in the MCU. However, it's clear that no changes were made to Loki season 2 due to the arrest of Jonathan Majors.\n"}
{"title": "Will Baylan Skoll Be Recast In Ahsoka Season 2?", "date": "2023-10-04 21:00:31", "text": "The tragic passing of Ray Stevenson means Lucasfilm is faced with an impossible choice; what do they do with Baylan Skoll after Ahsoka?\nThis article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nRay Stevenson's Baylan Skoll was one of the highlights of Ahsoka, but now Lucasfilm is faced with a difficult choice about whether to recast the character. Already no stranger to Star Wars, Ray Stevenson was delighted to be joining Star Wars in live-action. His presence was one of the highlights of Star Wars Celebration 2023, with Stevenson radiating sheer joy as he anticipated the reception of his character, Baylan Skoll.\nRay Stevenson sadly passed away on May 21, 2023, leaving the cast and crew of Ahsoka shaken. Ahsoka's premiere released with a touching tribute - \"For Our Friend, Ray\" - and in interviews his fellow stars have continually stressed their love for him. He was clearly a joy to work with, and is sadly missed. But, unfortunately, the ending of Ahsoka leaves Lucasfilm in a very difficult position - because Baylan Skoll is set up for an important future role.\nThere can be no doubt Ray Stevenson's dark Jedi Baylan Skoll was one of the highlights of Ahsoka. Baylan was a fascinating and complex character, and his motives are still a mystery; he seems to have had great hopes for his Padawan, Shin Hati, only to give them up when he heard a siren song from the ancient world of Peridea. Stevenson gave Baylan a certain intensity and resolve, and the dynamic he shared with Ivanno Sakhno (who played his violent Padawan Shin Hati) was tremendous. But he'll best be remembered for the stunning fight scenes he shared with Rosario Dawson's Ahsoka Tano; Baylan proved to be the one foe Ahsoka couldn't defeat, and he almost killed her.\nRelated: Ahsoka Ending Explained In Full\nThe problem, though, is that Ahsoka has left Baylan's story unfinished. His backstory is a mystery; how does he know so much about Anakin Skywalker, given his transformation into Darth Vader was a closely guarded secret? His motives remain inscrutable, clearly tied to the Mortis gods by Ahsoka's finale, but that in itself sets him up for an even greater role. He was seen stood next to the statue of the Father, a cosmic being who sought to strike a cosmic harmonious balance between light and dark, a hint at his true agenda. All this means there's absolutely no way Lucasfilm can continue this story without Baylan Skoll.\nIt's nothing short of a tragedy that Ray Stevenson passed before he got to see how much Baylan Skoll was loved by viewers. What's more, it's to Lucasfilm's credit that his story was not adjusted in any way, because there's no hint the overarching narrative was changed after Stevenson's passing. This means viewers - as well as the cast and crew - got to say farewell to a tremendous actor, to see his last performance in full.\nRelated: When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline\nBut this also means that Lucasfilm's Dave Filoni has left everything up in the air for Baylan. His story ends on an ambiguous note, with the dark Jedi continuing to explore Peridea, heading toward what seems to be a powerful Force vergence that called to him across the galaxies. What's more, given three other major characters are stranded on Peridea as well, this feels as though it is being set up in a concrete direction. There's no writing Baylan out, and no additional footage that can be refashioned as a homage. The only way to continue to honor Ray Stevenson is now to recast the character, allowing audiences to see Baylan Skoll's future.\nThis is all the more important because Ahsoka's ending kept Baylan as something of a mystery box. Such a mystery only works if the payoff is worth it, meaning Baylan's role in Ahsoka would be retrospectively damaged if Star Wars chose to somehow drop the character, perhaps killing him off-screen. The sense of anticlimax would echo back to the earlier stories, because they are left feeling incomplete and unsatisfying. To preserve Baylan's story in Ahsoka season 1, it is necessary to continue it.\nThis will, of course, be a very difficult and painful process. Ray Stevenson wasn't just a colleague; it's abundantly clear he was a good friend to many in Lucasfilm, and they mourn his passing. There's a sense of intense pressure to get this right. Meanwhile, the Star Wars fanbase - always noted for its divisiveness - will be watching carefully. Baylan Skoll needs to be recast for Ahsoka season 2 (or whatever comes next) - but it won't be easy.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are streaming now on Disney+.\nTom Bacon is Head of Screen Rant's Star Wars coverage. Although he's now dedicated to Star Wars content, he's a lifelong fan of several other major franchises including Doctor Who and Marvel. You can find him on Twitter @TomABacon.

{"title": "10 Best Movies Like The Creator", "date": "2023-10-04 21:00:31", "text": "Gareth Edwards’ The Creator features impressive visuals as it explores the nuances of AI, and there are several other good movies just like it.\nGareth Edwards' latest film, The Creator, has been positively received, and there are plenty of movies just like it for those wishing for more. The science-fiction film takes place in a futuristic world where Western civilization has declared war on AI. The efforts to eradicate AI are combated by the fictional nation of New Asia. An ex-special forces agent is tasked with traveling to New Asia and destroying a new AI weapon. The Creator explores ideas about humanity's relationship with AI, debuting at a time when its core theme couldn't be more relevant.\nThe Creator uses science-fiction as a medium to tell a story about empathy and what it means to be sentient and human. This is a story that's been explored in Hollywood before. While the movie's premise received a mixed response from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, Edwards' visual style was met with near unanimous praise. A similar approach can be seen in Edwards' best movies, as well as in the projects that inspired his work.\nOne of the best science-fiction movies of all time, Blade Runner is the most obvious next stop for fans of The Creator. Ridley Scott's 1982 film is massively influential on the science fiction genre, having popularized a cyberpunk aesthetic that's used in video games, anime, and other mediums. Speaking to Far Out Magazine, Edwards cited Blade Runner as one of his primary inspirations for creating a visually stunning backdrop. Like The Creator, Blade Runner is set in Los Angeles in a world ravaged by nuclear warfare. It also features a hero tasked with hunting AI, who develops more complicated feelings on the matter as the film goes on.\nFor Edwards' signature sci-if visuals, there's no better option than Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. While Godzilla and Monsters have great shots, Rogue One sees Edwards working with his highest budget, bringing to life bright and beautiful worlds. The film tells the story of the rebel team that steals the Death Star plans just before A New Hope. Edwards has mentioned his great affection for Star Wars, and he's cited the design of the original trilogy as one of his chief inspirations for The Creator.\nDirected by Alex Garland and produced by A24, Ex Machina is one of the most popular sci-fi films of the 2010s. The film follows a programmer named Caleb, who is brought to the private estate of his company's CEO, where he's shown a humanoid robot named Ava. Caleb is prompted to interact with Ava and judge whether she's capable of consciousness. While it doesn't have the heavy action of The Creator, Ex Machina features similar themes and ideas. Ex Machina explores the complicated relationship between human beings and AI, as well as the potential consequences of further developing AI.\nAlfonso Cuarón's Children of Men is one of the most iconic sci-fi films of the 21st century. Set in a grim world that's been ruined by environmental issues and war, infertility has become an existential threat. Like with The Creator, Children of Men follows a man traveling with and protecting someone he believes could be the key to saving humanity. In this case, it is the only known pregnant woman on Earth.\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day is one of James Cameron's most influential science-fiction films ever, and its among the best for fans of The Creator. Terminator 2 subverts expectations by making T-800 a protagonist, exploring the ideas of the positive use of AI. While humans are at war with AI in The Creator, the film explores the complexity of the issue, a discussion that's highly prevalent through the ending of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. In addition to sharing similar themes with The Creator, the first two Terminator movies are just incredible sci-fi action features that are must-watch materials for those who enjoy the genre.\nDirected by Stanley Kubrick, 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the most important science-fiction movies ever made. While its pacing is slower than what modern film fans might be used to, it's an essential film that everyone should watch at least once. The influence of 2001 is everywhere in science-fiction and pop culture, from the space scenes in early Star Wars to the opening scene in Barbie. Most notably for fans of The Creator, 2001's HAL-9000 character is one of the earliest and most prominent explorations of AI in cinema.\nAkira is one of the most well-known anime movies in the West, Edwards drew inspiration from the animated classic for The Creator. While Akira doesn't explore AI, it shares similar stylistic choices and ideas, such as a newly formed Eastern nation following a devastating blast, satellite weapons firing blue beams down on Earth, and super-powered children. Akira is set in a futuristic world where science is seeing great progress, but that progress is primarily helping bureaucratic and wealthy bodies.\nSoylent Green is an underrated gem of sci-fi movies, released in 1973 and starring Charlton Heston. The film follows an NYPD detective in a dystopian, futuristic world where the natural resources have run dry. People are reliant on mass-produced, factory-made wafers of different colors and unknown ingredients for their food, with the latest being \"Soylent Green.\" The film explores a ravaged society and ideas of government conspiracy, much like The Creator, which critiques the U.S. government.\nA Perfect World is not a sci-fi movie, but it was mentioned by Edwards, along with Rain Man, as a narrative inspiration for The Creator. The 1993 film, which stars Kevin Costner and Clint Eastwood, sees Costner playing an escaped prisoner who kidnaps a young boy. The prisoner and his captive travel across the U.S., forming an unexpected bond. For viewers of The Creator who were interested in the relationship between Joshua and Alphie, A Perfect World will make a solid follow-up.\nLike A Perfect World, The Road is a film with a similar relationship to the one between Joshua and Alphie in The Creator. The Road follows a father and son in a post-apocalyptic world, surviving and scavenging on their journey toward the sea. The world of The Road is much more grim than society in The Creator, but it's one of the best examples of stories that show the importance of family and companionship in dark times.\nSource: Far Out Magazine\n"}

With the secret knowledge of Yggdrasil now revealed, it begins to paint a picture of why stories and storytelling are among the most important forces in the Asgardian mythology and reframes several crucial tales from years past.\nImmortal Thor #2 (written by Al Ewing, penciled and inked by Martin Cóccolo, colored by Matthew Wilson and lettered by VC’s Joe Sabino) reveals exactly what wisdom Odin learned millennia ago, aka the Odin-Knowledge. In flashback, readers see Odin cut out his eye before Yggdrasil. After, as his pulled into the tree by its roots, he is told by the World Tree: \"Yes. This is the lesson. This is the parable. The story always changes. The meaning always remains. There is always a sacrifice. Always a cost Bor-Son. For the Winter to end. For Spring to come again.\"\nIt seems this wisdom is, at least partially, the knowledge that all stories have common elements. The exact story might change, but their shape remains the same.\nRelated: \"I Have to Try\": Immortal Thor's Writer Promises His Best Work Yet\nIn both Norse mythology and in Marvel’s own version, Odin takes out his own eye at the foot of Yggdrasil, the World Tree. In most retellings he also hangs himself on the tree’s branches. This sacrifice gives him some form of wisdom, secret knowledge and/or understanding of the deepest Asgardian mysteries. In Thor vol. 6 #20-23 (written by Donny Cates, penciled and inked by Nic Klein, colored by Matt Wilson and lettered by Joe Sabino), Odin dies, passing on the full power of the Odin-Force to Thor. Now, sidled with the wisdom of his father, Thor must find a way to balance ruling Asgard with his other responsibilities.\nThe Odin-Knowledge ties directly into the importance of stories for the Asgardians. In Loki: Agent of Asgard #13 (written by Al Ewing, penciled and inked by Lee Garbett, colored by Antinio Fabela and lettered by Clayton Cowles) Loki is remade as not the God of Lies, but the God of Stories. Al Ewing himself has been one of the primary architects of this evolution for Loki, exploring their development throughout Loki: Agent of Asgard, Defenders: Beyond and now Immortal Thor as well. This reveal of the Odin-Knowledge only ties Loki’s status quo more directly into the very fabric of the Asgardian gods.\nThis also adds depth to a crucial Thor story. In Thor: Disassembled (Thor vol. 2 #80-85, written by by Michael Avon Oeming and David Berman, penciled and inked by Andrea DiVito, colored by Laura Villari and lettered by Randy Gentile) Thor repeats Odin’s sacrifice, taking out both his eyes and hanging himself on Yggdrasil to gain that same wisdom. It’s this that leads him to discover that the cycle of Ragnarök is an endless blood-tithe to the parasitic Those Who Sit Above in Shadow. If the Odin-Knowledge is about the cyclical nature of conflicts, it's no wonder that Thor is able to discern that he is trapped in exactly such a tale.\nImmortal Thor #2 is available now from Marvel Comics.\n"}

Still possessing a profound hatred towards serial killers, as well as his remarkable skills and experience as a detective, he now solves murder cases by using the Mizuhanome System and investigating id wells, getting to know criminals better than they know themselves.\nWhile not a detective per se, given that Houtarou Oreki is still in school, he could easily become one of the best, should he make up his mind to expend the necessary energy. Hyouka follows Houtarou as he uses his exceptional deduction skills to solve mysteries, prompted by the ever-curious Eru Chitanda, whom he has feelings for. He is generally passive and apathetic, living by the idea that he should only do what is necessary, but whenever Eru comes up to him with something she wants to find out the truth behind, he proves that he is significantly smarter than his grades would have one believe, displaying unexpected skills.\nBeautiful Bones -Sakurako's Investigation-'s titular protagonist is Sakurako Kujou, a trained osteologist with a genuine passion for bones and skeletons. Moreover, she was also mentored by a renowned forensic scientist, further increasing her repertoire of skills. Using her rich knowledge and expertise, she often acts as a forensic consultant for the local prefectural police, assisting them in solving murder cases that would otherwise seem impossible. While the scope of the cases she solves may not be particularly large, Sakurako would certainly be able to figure out any mystery involving bones, as no bone can keep any secrets from her and her investigative skills.\nInitially affiliated with the Public Safety Bureau, working for the Criminal Investigation Department's Division 01, Shinya Kougami is a brilliant detective who would go to any lengths to uncover the truth behind any mystery, no matter what there is to lose in the process. At first, he is an Inspector, but after one of his colleagues becomes victim to the murderer they were investigating together, Shinya's feelings intensify and his crime coefficient goes up, after which he is demoted to being an Enforcer. Psycho-Pass' first protagonist combines his knowledge, experience, and instincts with an unparalleled fearlessness, to deal with cases in a way no one else possibly could.\nRelated: PSYCHO-PASS Gives Fans A Full Recap Video Ahead Of New Movie (Exclusive First Look)\nWhile Gosick's protagonist, Victorique de Blois, was already born with seemingly superhuman intelligence, her knowledge was further honed during her childhood, as she was forced to live in the dungeon of the de Blois Mansion, constantly reading books that most adults couldn't even begin to comprehend. She was later sent to Saint Marguerite Academy, where was supposed to remain mostly isolated from her peers. Victorique may just be one of the smartest anime characters ever, shown to not only read and absorb knowledge at tremendous speeds, but also possess unparalleled skills in terms of observation, analysis, investigation, and logic, nearly being able to predict the future perfectly.\nWhile The Millionaire Detective – Balance: UNLIMITED follows a pair of detectives, Daisuke Kanbe is certainly the more interesting of the two. As the titular millionaire detective, Daisuke seems to hold the belief that everything can and should be solved through money, which, as the scion of a billionaire family, he possesses in abundance. Typically solving mysteries in a somewhat aggressive manner, in ways that involve bribery, cutting-edge technology, and showy connections, he always gets to the bottom of a case, no matter how much money it takes. While his methods may be unconventional and occasionally morally ambiguous, their effectiveness is undeniable, proving that his belief about money is correct.\nSet in a dystopian future, Un-Go follows Shinjuurou Yuuki and his associate Inga, as they solve various cases together. While Inga also plays a role in pinning down the truth, thanks to their ability to force a subject to truthfully answer a single question, it is Shinjuurou who can investigate the details and find the perfect question to ask. Some people refer to him as \"The Defeated Detective\", because he was once proven to incorrectly assess a situation, but he seems to have resolved himself not to repeat that mistake since, as he continues to use his extraordinary intelligence and analytical skills to solve case after case.\nPsychic Detective Yakumo's titular protagonist Yakumo Saitou is a seemingly normal college student who has the ability to see ghosts and spirits. Somehow getting dragged into various cases, he always manages to solve the case before anyone else does, including the police, and not just because of his special ability. He is shown to be not only extremely intelligent, observant, and logical, but also absolutely willing to resort to tricks and traps if they allow him to get what he wants. While being able to see ghosts does occasionally help, it has in fact caused him more hardships than fortune in life, which is why he typically hides his crimson-red eye with colored contacts.\nDeath Note's L is perhaps the medium's most famous detective, known for his attempt to discover the identity of the mass murderer known as Kira. Found and taken to an orphanage for gifted children by Watari, who would later become his assistant, L displayed incredible intelligence early on, becoming a reputable detective at a young age. Though his disheveled appearance may cause people to doubt his credibility, he is known as the world's greatest detective for a reason. His analytical and deductive skills are second to none, and he's not afraid to lure suspects into a false sense of security to ensure his success, whether that requires deception or subterfuge.\nEven though not all of these characters may be proper detectives, with some working as independent consultants and others merely solving mysteries on a whim, prompted by circumstances, they all prove to have the necessary intelligence and deduction skills to excel in the field. Perhaps, if they put their mind to it, they could even solve some of anime's biggest mysteries. Whether they aim to identify the culprits behind cruel homicidal cases, or simply seek to explore local mysteries, all of these characters are worthy of being known as the best anime detectives ever.\nRemus Badescu is a writer for ScreenRant's anime section. He discovered his passion for the medium as a child, watching shows like Death Note on late-night TV, and has been enthralled with it ever since. In order to deepen his understanding of the industry, he obtained a degree in Communication & Media from the Erasmus University of Rotterdam, where he also found his passion for writing and analyzing pieces of media. "}

The long-running comedy sketch show, which features a regular cast of comic actors along with weekly rotating guest hosts, is preparing to run season 49 with a cast that includes Punkie Johnson, Chloe Fineman, Kenan Thompson, Heidi Gardner, Ego Nwodim, and Bowen Yang. Season 48 ended early when the Writers Guild of America went on strike, but now that the strike has ended it can return despite the ongoing Screen Actors Guild strike. This is because the cast's contracts are not among those currently under dispute as the union fights for fair pay.\nPer The Hollywood Reporter, an official release date has been set for Saturday Night Live season 49. The show is officially set to return on October 14 with SNL alum Pete Davidson returning as host alongside musical guest Ice Spice. The following week, the episode will be hosted by Bad Bunny, who will do double duty as the musical guest.\nPete Davidson’s return to Saturday Night Live has come rather soon after his original departure. He exited the show in 2022 after eight years as part of the cast. However, he hasn't rested on his laurels since he exited the show alongside other veteran performers including Aidy Bryant, Kate McKinnon, and Kyle Mooney.\nIncluded among his many post-SNL roles are a variety of cameos capitalizing on his notoriety, both from his stint on SNL and his string of tabloid-fodder romantic relationships. These cameos included surprise appearances in the big-budget movies Fast X and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 as well as the Netflix Christmas special Who Killed Santa? A Murderville Murder Mystery. However, 2022 also saw him hold major roles in Bodies Bodies Bodies, Meet Cute, and Good Mourning.\nAs if his 2022 wasn't busy enough between those titles and Saturday Night Live, Davidson has held a variety of roles this year before his return to the stage on the iconic late-night show. Since the year began, he has appeared on episodes of The Freak Brothers and American Dad as well as playing Dumb Money's Kevin Gill and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts' Mirage. He also played a fictionalized version of himself on the Peacock dramedy show Bupkis, more than earning this victory lap on Saturday Night Live.\nSource: THR\n"}
{"title": "Gen V's First Major Death Was Already Teased In The Boys Season 3", "date": "2023-10-04 21:18:32", "text": "Gen V does not hold itself back from featuring two horrific deaths in its first 3 episodes, one of which was even hinted at in The Boys' season 3.\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for Gen V.\nAs shocking as the first major death in Gen V may seem, it was already teased in The Boys' season 3 — here's how. Despite being a show about teenage supes, Gen V ups the ante of The Boys' shock value with unforeseeable character deaths, slambang supe showdowns, and boundary-pushing portrayals of sex. For instance, in its opening episodes, Gen V beats The Boys' gross Ant-Man parody scene by putting Little Cricket's sexual endeavors on full display.\nEven when it comes to character deaths, the spin-off series takes a no-hold-barred approach like its parent series. Its first three episodes have already featured two major character deaths, potentially setting the stage for many more. Despite being surprising, however, one of these character deaths was a long time coming, and The Boys season 3 even hinted at it in one of its episodes.\nRELATED: The Boys: Gen V Soundtrack Guide - Every Song & When It Plays\nIn The Boys' season 3's episode 5, \"The Last Time to Look on This World of Lies,\" Blue Hawk brings up Brink, recalling how he and A-Train trained under him at Godolkin University. Both A-Train and Blue Hawk call him \"Coach Brink,\" hinting at how he has been a prominent figure in The Boys' universe for a long time. Although The Boys does not reveal anything else about Brink, it sets him up as an important character in the live-action franchise's overarching storyline, hinting that he would be a key player in the narrative arcs related to Godolkin University. By setting up Brink as one of the higher authorities at Godolkin, The Boys established how his characterization and, ultimately, his death will be instrumental to Gen V's story.\nA-Train and Blue Hawk's respect for \"Coach Brink\" shows how most Godolkin University graduates love him. Gen V affirms this in its opening episode by highlighting how he looks out for the top supes of the academy by covering up for their crimes from behind the scenes and even ensures that supes like Jordan Li do not feel ostracized at the academy. When A-Train and Blue Hawk were at Godolkin's University, Brink must have pulled some strings for them as well to ensure they did well as supes once they graduated.\nHowever, at the same time, A-Train and Blue Hawk's \"Coach Brink\" reference from The Boys also highlights how Brink is not the kind of man anyone would want to mess with. Even though he does not have supe powers, he holds enough power and influence to be revered by powerful supes like A-Train and Blue Hawk. This again comes into play in Gen V, where Brink earns the trust of many young supes like Jordan Li but crosses all moral boundaries to exploit supes and their abilities by expelling unprivileged students like Marie and being involved in the malicious experiments at the Woods.\n"}
{"title": "Stranger Things Season 5 Will Finally Prove The Show's Real Main Character Isn't Who You Think", "date": "2023-10-04 21:20:32", "text": "Characters like Eleven and Mike have always been considered the protagonists of Stranger Things, but season 5 may shift that perspective.\nStranger Things season 5 has been confirmed as the Netflix show’s final outing, and many audiences are expecting it to shift to focus and reveal a certain character to have been the protagonist all along. In the show’s fourth season, the ensemble cast faced their greatest enemy yet — Vecna — who managed to escape at the last moment. Stranger Things season 4's ending saw the Upside Down bleeding through to the real world courtesy of this villain. It was a shocking cliffhanger that helped build the tension for the show’s fifth and final season.\nWhile Stranger Things has always been an ensemble show, it’s become even more so over the past few seasons. There are plenty of entertaining side characters that fans have come to know and love, but certain individuals have always been in the spotlight, leading most audiences to loosely call them the show’s main characters. However, one specific moment at the end of Stranger Things season 4 suggested that things aren’t quite as they seemed. It's possible Stranger Things is building toward the dark reveal that it’s been somebody else’s story all along.\nSince the beginning of Stranger Things season 1, Mike and Eleven have been the pair at the center of events. This always made sense, as Eleven was the outlier with her supernatural powers, and Mike was arguably the leader of their group of friends. Their importance in the narrative only grew stronger as Stranger Things began to explore Eleven’s backstory more thoroughly, revealing how she was connected to the Upside Down and proving that her character is necessary to defeat the demons that came from it.\nStranger Things set up Mike and Eleven’s romance very early in the show, which further helped solidify them as its main characters. While the surrounding cast might have changed, with new characters joining and old characters leaving between seasons, they’ve always remained at the cornerstone of the narrative. Other characters like Dustin, Will, and Lucas have frequently lost out on screen time in order for Stranger Things to prioritize Eleven’s story. This was necessary in order to fully explain how the Upside Down works and why characters like Vecna are so dangerous.\nAlthough she's been in the spotlight for much of Stranger Things, Eleven isn’t the only character with a tight connection to the Upside Down. Will Byers was among the first people to enter this dark dimension, and it took hold of him. He’s connected to both the Mind Flayer and Vecna, which will surely prove handy during the gang’s final battle. Eleven might have been a useful vessel for explaining the Upside Down and saving the day when nobody else could, but Will has been through so much over the past four seasons, and it might be time for Eleven to step back and let him fend for himself.\nMany fans are concerned that Will Byers might die in Stranger Things season 5, and the theory actually makes a lot of sense. He’s connected with the Upside Down in a way that seems to be impossible to undo, so destroying the dimension might require Will to sacrifice himself. This would definitively prove that Will has been the show’s protagonist all along, as everything he’s been through builds toward that climactic moment. The end of season 4 teased Will’s psychic connection with Vecna once again, proving that it’s going to be important in the future.\nAlthough it seems strange to suggest that Mike and Eleven aren't Stranger Things’ main characters, Will has arguably been at the center of the story from the very beginning. Despite being absent from Stranger Things season 1, Will was the one who set the story into motion with his disappearance. He was the one who bound the group together, even if it happened without him actively doing anything. Mike and Eleven likely wouldn't even be together if it weren't for Will's disappearance, so the claim that he's the show's protagonist isn't as outlandish at it first seems.\nStranger Things' writers also promised to give Will Byers a larger role in season 5, which suggests that something important is in store for the character. Perhaps this is when his true potential will really shine through, allowing him to overcome the hurdles that held him back in the past so that he can fully step into his protagonist role. The show has focused on developing Will Byers' character through his feelings for Mike and his mental health struggles after being trapped in the Upside Down. As such, it'd make sense if his Stranger Things storyline amounts to something big.\n"}
{"title": "The MCU's Deadpool Vs Wolverine Fight Can Only End One Way", "date": "2023-10-04 21:31:31", "text": "The fight between Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine in Deadpool 3 is highly anticipated, but its outcome might be predictable.\nThe fight between Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU's Deadpool 3 will be exciting, but the outcome likely won't be surprising. With Hugh Jackman's Wolverine joining Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool in the MCU, Deadpool 3 can finally display a live-action battle between the two Marvel icons in all their glory. Deadpool 3's potentially gory fight between Wolverine and Deadpool will be like nothing the MCU has ever seen before, though the aftermath might be of little importance.\nA rematch between Deadpool and Wolverine on the big screen has been brewing since 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, where Wolverine had a tough time keeping up with the monstrosity that took up the Deadpool name, but ultimately came up victorious by beheading him. Years later, Fox's two Deadpool movies gave Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool a makeover, not only fixing his costume and personality but also his abilities. As it stands, Deadpool and Wolverine's MCU rematch may end very differently.\nHugh Jackman's return as Wolverine has been one of Deadpool 3's biggest reveals since the movie was first announced. Despite saying goodbye to the character in James Mangold's Logan, the idea of joining the MCU and crossing paths with Deadpool was evidently too exciting to pass up. And given both character's abilities and shared comic book history, a fight scene where both heroes go all-out against each other is all but inevitable. Deadpool 3's R rating also raises expectations, as the MCU can finally do the characters' brutal nature justice on the big screen.\nShortly after Deadpool 3's first set image featuring Hugh Jackman's Wolverine was made public, more behind-the-scenes footage provided a deeper look at Wolverine's role in the movie. As shown in set photos and videos, Wolverine and Deadpool will fight beside a wrecked Fox logo, which suggests that Deadpool, Wolverine, and possibly other non-MCU Marvel characters will get ripped out of their home universes. Whether this scene is the only fight between Deadpool and Wolverine in Deadpool 3 is yet to be seen, however.\nDeadpool and Wolverine's battle in Deadpool 3 has the potential to become the MCU's most brutal fight so far. However, there's little mystery around its outcome. Wolverine and Deadpool have incredibly fast healing factors that could extend the fight indefinitely. Wolverine has only died once in the X-Men movies, and that was only because of adamantium poisoning in a future timeline. Deadpool has been split in half and shot while wearing a mutation inhibitor, but he also recovered quite quickly. Since expecting one of them to die is futile, the only way Deadpool and Wolverine's fight can end is if they give up or if something else distracts them.\nBesides, Deadpool 3's first set photo features Wolverine and Deadpool walking side by side, which suggests that they will team up at some point in the movie. An R-rated buddy-superhero adventure is more innovative than a straightforward fight to the death, and it makes more sense for Wolverine and Deadpool to join forces to face a bigger threat together. Ultimately, Wolverine and Deadpool's MCU arrival could set up future multiversal storylines for upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe titles like Avengers: Secret Wars, so a death from either character is highly unlikely.\nDeadpool and Wolverine's similar abilities provide many opportunities for creative fight scenes. Unlike most characters, they can land brutal blows and chop each other to bits over and over before the fight ends. The main appeal of the fight lies in how they attack each other, and not how either of them dies. Wolverine and Deadpool's inability to die provides a believable reason for their friendship, and it even acknowledges Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman's playful real-life feud and friendship. Both characters and actors are equals inside and outside Deadpool 3.\nAlso, letting Deadpool and Wolverine survive the events of Deadpool 3 can make them available for future MCU movies and shows. While Deadpool 3's plot may feature Deadpool killing Fox's X-Men universe and all its characters, Deadpool and Wolverine themselves are too popular to kill off in a one-off MCU story. Instead, Marvel Studios could keep them around at least until a franchise-wide crossover event, where they can interact with other MCU characters and receive a final sendoff as satisfying as Iron Man and Captain America's Avengers: Endgame farewell.\n"}
{"title": "&quot;House of X-Sized&quot;: Jonathan Hickman Reveals G.O.D.S Hardcover Will Contain Previously Unreleased Material", "date": "2023-10-04 21:31:31", "text": "Jonathan Hickman spoke with EW about G.O.D.S., saying the collected edition will feature even more material than the already-packed single issues\nMarvel is radically redefining its cosmic order with the freshly launched G.O.D.S. series from game-changing X-Men scribe, the author behind 2019's \"House of X\" and the entire direction of the X-franchise in the years since. \"House of X\" was a massive book, loaded with supplemental materials, which provided rich, and at times critical, context for the massive era-defining saga. In an interview discussing his latest offering, Hickman suggested readers should expect similar from G.O.D.S.\nSpeaking with Entertainment Weekly, Hickman said that the hardcover edition of G.O.D.S. will be \"House of X-size,\" with much of the writer's signature surplus content appearing for the first time in collected form.\nEven before it reaches its collected form, G.O.D.S. will be eight issues that are, according to Hickman, \"about 12 issues worth of pages.\"\nAs a comic book creator, Jonathan Hickman has become synonymous with world-building. Marvel's trust in him with one of their tentpole franchises was validated by the success of \"House of X\" and \"Powers of X,\" the foundation-shifting, timeline rearranging saga that ushered in the X-Men's Krakoan age, widely regarded as among the greatest X-Men stories to date. G.O.D.S. is Hickman, and Marvel's, attempt to replicate that success at the cosmic level of the Marvel Universe, with the series set to be characteristically dense in style – and complete in form, telling a story with a definite beginning, middle, and end.\n\"I am guilty of writing for the trade,\" Hickman told EW, \"I think about the collection from day one.\" While he went on to clarify that the plan could change as issues of the series are released individually, the \"extra content, the data pages, all that kind of stuff,\" that people have come to expect from his work, \"isn't going to show up until the hardcover.\" The reason for this: issues of G.O.D.S. are already giant-sized, packed with detail, action, and lore. Presumably, if a particularly critical piece of information needs to be delivered to the reader, a data page may find its way into an issue, but currently, readers will have to wait.\nHickman promised that the hardcover collection will \"be a completely different experience than the monthly book.\" The writer may craft his stories with the final, collected version in mind, but he emphasizes \"still maintaining the importance of the monthly book\" during the creative process. G.O.D.S. is an opportunity not just for Marvel to open up an unheralded frontier of storytelling in its fictional universe, but for Jonathan Hickman – who Marvel has also given the privileged task of reinventing its Ultimate Universe – to solidify his status as the most vital comic book creator working in the industry right now.\nSource: Entertainment Weekly\nG.O.D.S #1 is available now from Marvel Comics.\n"}

The service's catalog has a number of options that are award-winning and critically acclaimed, as well as some underrated gems. For a night of suspenseful film viewing, Netflix has plenty of offerings to keep viewers on the edge of their seats.\nRELATED: 10 Best Thrillers Of All Time To Watch Right Now\nNominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and a number of other honors, 2022's All Quiet on the Western Front is a masterful work of high-stakes suspense in World War I. The story follows an idealistic group of young friends who enlist in the German army together. They're immediately shocked by the horrific world of death and violence they find themselves in. Like other modern war films, such as Dunkirk or 1917, All Quiet on the Western Front is filled with incredible cinematography, and it's a sensory overload sure to ramp up tension.\nBerlin Syndrome is one of the most genuinely horrifying films on Netflix, following a passionate romance gone wrong. An Australian photographer traveling in Berlin falls for a local teacher, who then traps and imprisons her in his apartment. The film is a psychological thriller that will leave its audience terrified, even though it doesn't rely on monsters or jump scares. Instead, Berlin Syndrome uses the strong performances of its stars to summon feelings of terror and dread.\nMike Flanagan has earned a reputation for his horror films, like Doctor Sleep, as well as his Netflix series, like The Haunting of Hill House and Midnight Mass. Gerald's Game is one of Flanagan's most terrifying projects, and it is an adaptation of Stephen King's work. The film follows a married couple who travel to a remote lake house to rekindle their romance. Following a violent argument during foreplay, the man dies of a heart attack, leaving the woman handcuffed to a bed and forced to find a way to break free and survive. The premise is unique and daunting, making this an ideal suspense movie to watch.\nLéon: The Professional is a 1994 action thriller about a hitman who reluctantly bonds with a 12-year-old girl after her family is murdered. Léon tries to help the girl, Mathilda, get revenge on DEA agent Norman Stansfield by training her to kill. Gary Oldman's Agent Stansfield is an iconic and likable movie villain, setting the tone for many antagonist performances of the 21st century. The film is highly stylized with a dramatic, violent ending that will get viewers' hearts pumping.\nBird Box is an exciting horror movie and one of the best and most-watched Netflix original movies. Starring Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich, Bird Box is set in a post-apocalyptic world where a mysterious force has killed off a large portion of the population. Survivors can't look at it, so they must be blindfolded at all times to protect themselves. This premise is claustrophobic and terrifying as is, but Bird Box also raises interesting questions about mental health and social behavior.\nMichael Mann is a master of stylized crime films full of beautiful visuals and well-written characters. Collateral brings together Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise, with Cruise playing the film's villain, a silver-haired assassin named Vince. Foxx plays Max, a Los Angeles-based taxi driver who picks up Vince and is offered $600 to make five stops. When Vince realizes he's taking part in a series of hits, the conflict begins. Collateral is an incredibly engaging crime thriller that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish, utilizing strong dialogue and exciting action to tell its story.\nThe 2016 film Nocturnal Animals is a psychological thriller about a woman named Susan, who receives a violent manuscript written by her ex-husband. Seeing the similarities between the novel and their past, Susan is forced to reexamine her life. The film is incredibly dark and has some disturbing scenes, with strong performances from Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, as well as great direction from Tom Ford.\nMission: Impossible has changed in many ways over its seven-film run. While it's now known as the action franchise where Tom Cruise tries to outdo himself with insane stunts, the first film in the series is a slower-paced espionage thriller. Directed by the great Brian De Palma, 1996's Mission: Impossible is a well-written thrill ride with an old-fashioned feeling similar to classic James Bond films. The cable drop scene, in particular, is one of the most suspenseful sequences of the saga.\nThe combination of Denis Villeneuve and Roger Deakins guarantees a beautifully shot film, but it's the writing and performances from stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Hugh Jackman, and Paul Dano that make Prisoners a thrilling masterpiece. The film follows Jackman as Keller Dover, the father of a six-year-old girl who's gone missing. When Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki is forced to free the primary suspect due to a lack of evidence, Keller seeks justice on his own. Prisoners is as tense as mystery films get, with Jackman's performance standing out in particular.\nLike Collateral, Heat is a crime thriller from director Michael Mann. The 1995 film sees Robert De Niro as a master thief going head-to-head with Al Pacino, who plays the police lieutenant trying to catch him. It's fun seeing two all-time great actors face off, and Heat is full of excellent writing and incredibly intense action sequences. Heat is one of the best heist movies ever made, and the pacing and build-up make its longer length fly by.\nJaws is one of the most influential suspense films of all time and has been giving audiences a fear of the sea for generations. In Jaws, a giant shark terrorizes a beach town in New England, setting the stage for the film's trio of police chief, marine biologist, and ship captain, to and hunt the beast. Jaws is old enough that its effects are easier to spot, making the shark a bit less threatening. However, the atmosphere, music, and directing from Steven Spielberg still manage to make Jaws a nail-biting experience. It's worth watching on Netflix, especially for those who haven't seen it.\n"}
{"title": "Loki Season 2 EP Explains How Victor Timely Creates Conflict Between Loki, Sylvie, & The TVA", "date": "2023-10-04 21:35:10", "text": "Exclusive: Loki season 2 executive producer Kevin Wright breaks down how Victor Timely will cause Loki, Sylvie, and the TVA to question everything.\nLoki season 2 executive producer Kevin Wright explains how Victor Timely stands out from He Who Remains and will force Loki and his allies to question everything. Victor Timely was teased in the post-credit scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania as the next variant of Kang that Loki will be dealing with. The first season ended with Sylvie killing He Who Remains after a warning about his death, leading to a new multiverse war. The MCU is setting up a major conflict with Kang at the center of it as the next Avengers-level threat in Avengers: Kang Dynasty.\nIn an exclusive interview with Screen Rant for Loki season 2, Wright discussed the new Kang variant, Victor Timely. He explained why the idea of a sci-fi villain being from the past was intriguing to the team. Wright also shared how Victor Timely will force Loki, Sylvie, and the TVA to question their initial thoughts about him and the idea of free will. Check out Wright's full quote below:\nKevin Wright: So it started just in the concept of Victor. I think in what we were trying to do at the end of season one was to get everybody obviously terrified of, \"War is coming. This is going to be scary.\" You see the scary character in Ant-Man and just the idea that the sci-fi villain is not coming from the future, but maybe is this unassuming, slightly eccentric inventor from the past was fun. It allows us to go to exciting places.\nBut really, what was exciting about it from a character standpoint is he is kind of the perfect person to fuel the character conflict between Loki, Sylvie, and the TVA of, \"You're saying something scary is coming. You are saying that you want everybody to have free will, but you're also swearing that you're going to kill the next variant of him to pop up.\" It creates almost a contradiction or a paradox of, if you truly believe in free will, you've got to believe that man's words when he says, \"I'm my own person. I can make my own choices. I'm not the man you think I am.\" And I think it was just for somebody like Jonathan, it just fuels what he does best, which is creating really deep and complex characters.\nHe Who Remains was the first variant of Kang introduced into the MCU, and although he seemed like a clear villain, the more he explained to Loki about the TVA and multiverse, the more complicated things became. He Who Remains made it seem like the TVA was the only thing protecting their universe from the dangers, notably his variants, in the others. His warnings seemed to prove true when Sylvie killed him and the branches of the other timelines burst out from the \"sacred timeline.\"\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Breaks 2 MCU Trends That Have Defined The Last 10 Years\nThe next variant introduced was Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, who proved to be a major threat even at such low power. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania also introduced the Council of Kangs, who have their eye on the \"sacred timeline\" now that Kang is gone. Then comes Victor Timely, the main Kang variant in the new season of Loki. Although he is a Kang variant, Victor Timely is a bit of a mystery.\nInstead of a villain with impressive technological advancements, he is from the past. Victor Timely will also force Loki, Sylvie, and the TVA to question everything they believe. Sylvie wants everyone, notably herself, to have free will. However, this cuts both ways because it means she can't assume Victor Timely is predestined to be evil. Loki will have to grapple with He Who Remains' warning, what it means that there is another variant, and how to protect the world.

Halloween is a time for the spooky and supernatural. The holiday is one of the few times of the year when it is acceptable to focus on ghoulish, macabre, and downright frightening subjects. This prompts many movie buffs to spend most of October celebrating Halloween by watching classic horror movies. However, it also means that the cinematic representation of the holiday is somewhat imbalanced.\nEven though Christmas is a time for family, friends, and peace on earth, there are a veritable deluge of horror movies, action thrillers, and bawdy comedies that subvert this tradition. By contrast, Halloween horror movies dominate the holiday's contributions to cinema. Almost every movie set on Halloween is a horror movie of some sort, whether it is as anodyne and family-friendly as Hocus Pocus or Halloweentown or as chilling as the classic slasher Halloween. Discounting movies with horror elements, there are surprisingly few scare-free movies set on Halloween night.\n2014’s Song of the Sea is a poignant, funny, and inventive Irish animated adventure movie. Although it's technically a fantasy adventure about selkies, much of Song of the Sea is a sweet cartoon dramedy about a pair of mismatched siblings getting into scrapes and coming to each other’s rescue. The most important plot points take place on Halloween night, but there is nothing horrifying about this fantasy movie’s ending. As inventive and charming as it is moving, Song of the Sea is a great animated movie that proves Disney and Studio Ghibli aren’t the only creative powerhouses in the industry.\nDirector Steven Spielberg’s E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial blends family drama, science-fiction, and comedy, but the movie steers clear of horror for the most part. Admittedly, some small children were likely afraid the first time they saw the eponymous alien sprint at the camera. However, it soon becomes clear that he is one of the cutest aliens in cinema history. Despite this, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial’s entire story takes place on Halloween night, and the practice of trick-or-treating is central to the movie’s ending.\nThe Australian drama Boys in the Trees is a lyrical fantasy movie mixed with a coming-of-age story. Although it's far from a traditional horror movie, it is likely the most unsettling movie listed here. With a tone similar to Mike Flanagan’s Netflix shows, Boys in the Trees uses ghosts and spirits as metaphors for trauma and tragedy. However, these never feel forced or clumsy. Instead, this coming-of-age story manages to turn a tale of two friends drifting apart into something that is equal parts life-affirming and heartbreaking.\n2013’s Grow Up Tony Philips is a fascinating non-horror Halloween movie, as the coming-of-age dramedy is also the director’s first departure from the world of horror comedy. Director Emily Hagins is best known for beginning her career with the zombie movie Pathogen, which she directed at the ripe age of 12. However, Grow Up Tony Philips is a very different proposition. A dramedy about the titular antihero coming to terms with his friends growing out of their old Halloween traditions, Grow Up Tony Philips asks viewers what it means to grow up and what teenagers should be willing to sacrifice in the name of friendship.\nWhile Amazon’s Jack Reacher adaptation nailed the tone of the Lee Childs novel series, there is something to be said for the enjoyable silliness of 2016’s Jack Reacher: Never Go Back. This thriller is a classic Reacher adventure as Tom Cruise’s version of the heroic drifter races against time to clear the name of a framed friend. The action-thriller makes good use of the Halloween setting during its climax. While admittedly a by-the-numbers procedural, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is elevated by Cruise’s screen presence and some stylish action sequences that prove Halloween is a holiday woefully underutilized by the genre.\n1997’s Affliction is an intense, emotionally moving effort from indie director and Taxi Driver scribe Paul Schrader. Nick Nolte plays a small-town cop who becomes obsessed with a hunting death that took place on Halloween. He's convinced that it was a murder and that there is a conspiracy to cover up the truth. Like another popular movie no one talks about any more — Mystic River — this grim crime drama offers no easy answers. Dark, brutal, and believable, this soulful thriller might be a harder watch than many Halloween horror movies.\nIronweed tells the tale of a drifter suffering from an unspecified mental illness who returns to his hometown on Halloween night, but viewers shouldn’t be discouraged by this seemingly dark synopsis. Where the superficially similar Spider and Possum mine this setup for nightmarish journeys into broken psyches, Ironweed instead offers a warm, elegiac, and at times, surprisingly sweet story of love and loss. Jack Nicholson is stellar as ever as the troubled lead, but it is Meryl Streep’s spirited turn as his dying old friend that makes Ironweed essential viewing.\nWhile Clint Eastwood is one of the best Western movie directors of all time, he is also accomplished when it comes to smaller, more intimate stories. A Perfect World is one of these, as Eastwood’s camera follows a convict and a sheltered orphan on the run across the U.S. Surprisingly moving, A Perfect World's plot centers around a touching moment where the movie’s troubled anti-hero helps his shy new friend celebrate Halloween for the first time.\n1976’s Kenny and Company was largely overshadowed by director Don Coscarelli’s next effort, Phantasm. However, as a tribute to misspent youth, this 1976 coming-of-age story is worth a watch. Kenny and Company follows a group of kids as they prank, play, and otherwise mess around during one long Halloween night. Essentially a preteen spin on Dazed and Confused or American Graffiti, this nostalgic comedy is a sweet watch for viewers of all ages.\nAlthough 2012’s Fun Size was intended to be a launching point for Nickelodeon star Victoria Justice’s movie career, the comedy proved too raunchy for kids and too anodyne for grownups. However, Fun Size is better than its brutal reviews suggest thanks to Justice’s charming central turn and a scene-stealing role for Evil Dead remake star Jane Levy. The plot, which sees Justice's heroine attempting to find her missing brother, is admittedly thin. Nonetheless, this non-horror Halloween movie offers a PG-13 spin on the Superbad/Booksmart template that is well worth a watch.\n"}
{"title": "Castlevania: Nocturne Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-04 22:00:38", "text": "From the return of a beloved Castlevania character to Erzsebet Báthory’s plan, here is Castlevania: Nocturne season 1’s ending explained.\nWARNING: This article contains SPOILERS for Castlevania: Nocturne.\nFrom Alucard’s return to the Erzsebet Báthory’s plan, Castlevania: Nocturne episode 8 concluded the season with major twists and set up a potential season 2. Castlevania: Nocturne followed Richter Belmont, a descendant of Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades, in a story set 300 years after the original show. After several mentions of the Vampire Messiah and her twisted goals, Castlevania: Nocturne ended with the vampires achieving a major victory, but not all hope was lost.\nAlucard returned in Castlevania: Nocturne episode 8, bringing Netflix’s Castlevania franchise full circle and setting up the next chapter in Richter’s story. While Alucard looked different in Castlevania: Nocturne, this is the same character from the original show. Alucard’s actor was not initially listed as part of Castlevania: Nocturne’s cast, which helped keep the character’s return a surprise. Tera has been turned into a vampire, Richter can now use magic again, and Annette learns that Edouard’s soul has a new purpose. Here is a breakdown of the Castlevania: Nocturne ending, and how it sets up season 2.\nAlucard is the son of Dracula in the world of Castlevania. He was introduced at the end of Castlevania season 1, episode 1, and went on to become one of the show’s main characters. While the Castlevania franchise is focused on the Belmont family, Alucard is a huge part of that universe, both in the games and the Netflix adaptation. Born to a vampire father and a human mother, Alucard is somewhat immortal. Dracula’s son does not age, which makes him the perfect character to bridge Castlevania and Castlevania: Nocturne. Alucard fought side by side with Trevor Belmont in the original series and now appeared to help Richter in Nocturne.\nAlucard is one of the most powerful beings in the Castlevania universe, which is why he did not even struggle to kill Drolta. Alucard’s sword, which he can command from a distance through magic, quickly puts an end to one of the strongest vampires in Nocturne. Alucard’s return in Castlevania: Nocturne’s ending was very much a sequel hook for a potential Castlevania: Nocturne season 2, which has yet to be confirmed by Netflix. Richter, Annette, and Maria have not saved the world from Erzsebeth Báthory, but fortunately, Alucard is now joining them. As the son of Dracula put it, though, he was a bit late.\nWhile Castlevania: Nocturne is connected to Castlevania, the show did not have too many direct connections to the original series. This is because Castlevania: Nocturne is set 300 years after Castlevania, meaning most of the characters audiences followed in the first show have been long dead by now. Richter Belmont is a descendant of Trevor Belmont and Sypha, both of whom were Alucard’s best friends. The Castlevania trio was the heart of the show, and both Trevor and Sypha left a huge mark on Alucard’s long life. This is why the son of Dracula was expected to appear in Castlevania: Nocturne eventually.\nRelated: Castlevania: Nocturne Is Based On These 2 Games (But With One Fundamental Change)\nThanks to Alucard appearing in Castlevania: Nocturne episode 8, the show is now directly tied to its predecessor. While names like Sypha and Dracula were mentioned in Castlevania: Nocturne, the animated series did not focus on things that had happened in the first Castlevania show. Now that Alucard has joined the heroes, there may be more mentions of Trevor and Sypha in a potential Castlevania season 2. In addition, Alucard’s return sets the stage for Dracula to come into play, even though Vlad Tepes had a happy ending with Lisa in Castlevania season 4’s finale. Regardless, Alucard will be an important ally in the fight against Erzsebet Báthory.\nCastlevania season 4’s ending saw both Dracula and Lisa being resurrected. While those behind their resurrection planned on transforming Dracula and Lisa into the Rebus, the heroes managed to stop the creature before it was too late. Dracula and Lisa, now back in the world of the living, were free again. Castlevania ends with Dracula and Lisa hugging each other, suggesting they had a happy ending away from all the pain and misery from their original lives. Castlevania: Nocturne suggests Dracula as a monster that hasn’t been seen for hundreds of years, and there are even those who do not even know who Dracula is.\nThe main Castlevania: Nocturne villain was Erzsebeth Báthory, who is described by her followers as the Vampire Messiah. Erzsebeth, who believes herself to be a goddess, plans to create an endless night in which vampires will no longer have to hide from the sunlight. However, Erzsebeth also wanted to forge a symbolic ally with humans, particularly with the Abbot and the Catholic Church. The final stop in Erzsebet’s plan was to take on a human sacrifice inside the church to cement her powers and officially begin her rule. The Devourer of Light originally planned on taking Maria as a sacrifice, but plans changed after Tera, Maria’s mom, offered herself instead.\nTera, who had already been a victim of the Devourer of Light, offered herself as a sacrifice to save her daughter. Tera, who is a Speaker, argued that she would make for a far more powerful vampire than her daughter. While Erzsebet hesitated, the Vampire Messiah eventually agreed to replace Maria with her mother. This is why Tera stayed behind in Castlevania: Nocturne episode 8. Maria’s mom was bitten and turned into a vampire before Richter and the others had even left the church. While this was a tragic turn of events, Tera managed to save her daughter after the child’s father, Abbot Emanuel, almost got her killed.\nCastlevania: Nocturne’s season finale directly sets up season 2. Similar to the original Castlevania show, most of the conflicts were not resolved at the end of season 1, which mainly served to introduce characters and plot points for future stories. This includes the return of Alucard, who killed Dracula in Castlevania season 2 and now joins the fight against the Vampire Messiah. Tera’s future as a vampire will also be an important storyline in a potential Castlevania: Nocturne season 2. In addition, Castlevania: Nocturne has only now begun to show Richter Belmont’s powers and skills, as the character could not use magic for most of season 1.\nCastlevania: Nocturne’s final episodes also hinted at a relationship between Richter and Annette, which happens in the games. While this could only be a nod to their video game counterparts’ history, this potential relationship could be revisited in Castlevania: Nocturne season 2. Lastly, The Devour of Light essentially won in episode 8, having accomplished her goal of turning a sacrifice into a vampire inside a church. Erzsebet Báthory’s plan of world domination continues, meaning there are more than enough stories for Castlevania: Nocturne season 2 to tackle.\n"}
{"title": "Jujutsu Kaisen Will Force Its Heroes To Fight Without Their Strongest Ally", "date": "2023-10-04 22:00:38", "text": "After the most recent episodes of Jujutsu Kaisen's Shibuya Incident arc, the series' protagonists won't be able to rely on their most powerful ally.\nWarning! Contains spoilers for Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #9Despite facing arguably their biggest threat yet, Jujutsu Kaisen is now forcing its heroes to fight on without their greatest ally Gojo after a shocking twist in the anime's latest episode. This makes sense from a narrative perspective as Gojo was powerful enough to trivialize most threats in the series on his own, but it is still surprising given his extreme power level and popularity.\nIn Season 2 Episode #9 of Jujutsu Kaisen, the curses were able to enact their ultimate plan to stop Gojo from interfering with them. After tiring the sorcerer out by forcing him to kill a slew of transfigured humans quickly, Geto showed up with a mysterious item known as the Prison Realm. This box was able to capture Gojo as long as he was incapacitated for a mental minute, which Geto's shocking arrival enabled. Despite Gojo's immense power, once he was trapped by the Prison Realm, it seemed he was powerless to escape, even as the villain taunted him, which shows that the other heroes of the story will now have to fight on without him.\nThis is an incredibly tall order especially given the power level of the enemies they must face in Shibuya. While Gojo was able to easily defeat Hanami in that episode, the other Disaster Curses are still free to wreak havoc on a massive scale, and each one has a devastating ability. Jogo can wield massive amounts of firepower, Mahito can transfigure humans with one touch, and the newest introduction Choso appears to be able to manipulate blood. This isn't even including the sorcerer controlling Geto's body, who can call forth several potent other curses to fight at his disposal. These villains are also incredibly disturbing in the Jujutsu Kaisen anime, meaning there is no moral limit on what they might do.\nWith all these powerful threats against them, the good sorcerers will likely be hard-pressed to bring the Shibuya Incident to a happy conclusion. There are many powerful sorcerers in the series besides Gojo, but they are all separated among various teams and none of them are as untouchable. Gojo's Limitless technique granted him both powerful offensive and defensive techniques, and no other sorcerer could match that level of versatility. This leaves them with clear weaknesses that the Curses can exploit, which means that a fair amount of them will likely get killed or extremely injured.\nGojo's sealing represents a major status quo change for the series. Before this point, sorcerers could rely on Gojo to handle any enemy they deemed too dangerous, which gave them a bit of a crutch when dealing with dangerous Curses. Now this support is gone and the heroes of Jujutsu Kaisen must fight against the series' incredibly powerful enemies alone.\nBen Sockol has been writing articles for the comics section of Screen Rant since early 2022.

The Help is an impeccable fighter, able to stand his ground against Batman. Since his original appearance, he’s been one of DC’s most dangerous combatants, and now he’s heading back to Gotham.\nThe Penguin #2 – by Tom King, Rafael de Latorre, and Marcelo Maiolo – finds Oswald Cobblepot working toward taking back his position in Gotham. Unable to do it alone, he seeks out the most powerful henchman in the world: the Help.\nThe Help has not only stood against Batman, he’s had a hand in training several other incredibly skilled fighters and heroes.\nThe Help was first introduced in Batman: Killing Time #3 – by Tom King, David Marquez, and Alejandro Sánchez – where he was hired by Penguin to settle his conflict with Riddler and Catwoman. Now, writer Tom King has brought the character back in The Penguin #2, once more as a reluctant associate of the Penguin. Killing Time #3 established the Help as the most skilled person in the fight immediately upon his entering the frat, as he shot Riddler and defeated Batman. Not only was he able to counter Batman’s moves, he named the tactics and their origin, explaining his own experiences with everyone from Ted Grant to Ras al Ghul.\nIn Killing Time #3, the Help gave a sense that the fight didn't require his full concentration; he had energy left over afterward to be complimentary toward Batman. The Penguin #2 offers further insight into the Help’s history. His students include Lady Shiva, widely regarded as the most lethal fighter in the world. As he and Penguin hunt on the grounds of his home, he mentions being employed by the Queens to train their son Oliver years earlier. Previously, he name-dropped Black Canary as a former trainee, meaning he’s had a hand in both Canary and Green Arrow’s origins. Nearly ninety years old, the Help exceeds Batman in both training and experience.\nAfter the events of Batman: Killing Time, during which he retrieved the incredibly valuable object known as the Eye of Christ, the Help retired, settling in to a life of luxury. Yet, in spite of his imposing skill as a fighter, Oswald Cobblepot was able to force the Help to join him in his campaign for criminal supremacy in Gotham. In The Penguin #2, the eponymous crime lord killed the Help's staff, citing being served and waited upon “wasn’t him.” Now, Cobblepot will take his rightful place in Gotham with Earth’s greatest henchman at his side – ensuring that whoever comes out on top, the Help or Batman, the Penguin may be the only winner.\nCheck out The Penguin #2, available now from DC Comics!\nAshley is a long-time comics nerd, a parent (to a human, a dog, and too many houseplants), and a big fan of all things dark and spooky.

{"title": "The Boys Just Revealed A New Weapon That Could Defeat Any Supe (Even Homelander)", "date": "2023-10-04 22:10:37", "text": "As potent and invincible as Homelander may seem in The Boys, Gen V has finally revealed a powerful weapon that can potentially be used to defeat him.\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for Gen V.\nThe Boys' Gen V just revealed a new weapon that could potentially defeat any supe, including Homelander. Although Gen V seems to follow a self-contained story in The Boys' universe, it has been dropping several subtle hints that could become major plot points in the franchise's overarching storylines. For instance, Gen V hints that Homelander is already on trial after he killed a man in broad daylight in The Boys' season 3. This revelation alone sets the stage for many narrative avenues for The Boys season 4.\nBy highlighting how Brink offers Luke a place in The Seven, Gen V also confirms that Starlight and Maeve's departure from the supe group has left two empty spots for new supes to fill. However, besides these evident references and story setups, Gen V also secretly reveals how one weapon can be used to overpower any supe. The spin-off show's depiction of the weapon and its impact on supes almost confirms that even Homelander would not stand a chance against it.\nRELATED: Gen V Continues An Episode 1 Tradition The Boys Has Followed For 3 Seasons\nA sonic weapon generates high-intensity sound waves that may not be lethal but can cause severe damage to a targeted individual. Most supes not only possess special powers but also have advanced senses that complement their unique abilities. Owing to this, they are more sensitive to the extreme frequencies and amplitudes of high-intensity sounds, leaving them vulnerable to the detrimental effects of sonic weapons. Gen V establishes this in its opening episodes, where Andre fails to stand his ground against a non-supe human who uses a tiny device that generates high-intensity sounds.\nDespite his best efforts to fight back, Andre falls to the ground, struggling to get up because his augmented hearing enhances his auditory perception and prevents his ears from filtering out the sound from the weapon. The fact that the human guard seems unscathed by the sound from his sonic weapon shows how sound waves that non-supe folks can comfortably hear can cause severe damage in supes like Andre. Although Gen V explicitly portrays how augmented hearing is the Achilles heel for many supes, The Boys has previously hinted at this weakness.\nIn The Boys' season 2, episode 8, \"What I Know,\" Frenchie intentionally sets up a loud sonic weapon to distract Homelander while Butcher and Becca rescue Ryan. A regular sound would not have bothered Homelander. However, when he hears the sound waves from the weapon, he instantly flies out to destroy it, proving that Gen V's sonic weapon would also be effective against Homelander. This Gen V revelation not only proves that Homelander has a clear weakness but also highlights how Supersonic was literally a walking weapon against several supes in The Boys and could even kill Homelander with his Sonic Clap powers.\n"}

The fantasy action show was cancelled by Netflix in December 2022, leading fans and Barry himself to rally for its renewal through online and real-life efforts. In August, it was announced that a Warrior Nun film trilogy was happening thanks to the efforts of the campaign.\nNow, Barry has confirmed he will not be involved in creating the upcoming Warrior Nun movie trilogy.\nIn his post, Barry reveals he doesn't know what to expect from future updates regarding the new movies. This indicates the trilogy may not have the same creative team as the Netflix series.\nWhile Barry will not be involved in the upcoming movies, executive producer Dean English will be returning to bring the new installments to life. However, it's now unclear if the films will follow Barry's original vision for Warrior Nun season 3 and beyond, or if the series will go in a different direction. It also calls into question which members of the cast and crew from the original show will be returning.\nThe end of Warrior Nun season 2 saw Ava go through the Ark in order to heal in Reya's dimension as Beatrice quit the OCS. Lilith also hinted at a looming holy war, which may pit the OCS against a new threat. It appears the upcoming movie trilogy will continue the story from the end of season 2, though it remains to be seen how it will unfold.\nWhile English's involvement is a good sign for the film trilogy, Barry stepping away could be a worrisome development for the future of the franchise. However, nothing is certain about where the series will go from here until more information about the movies gets revealed. For now, Warrior Nun fans whose ardent campaigning saved the series will have to wait and see.\nSource: Simon Barry/Twitter\n"}
{"title": "The Exorcist: Believer Can't Compete With The RT Score Of Blumhouse's Other New Horror Movie", "date": "2023-10-04 22:27:48", "text": "While The Exorcist: Believer lands on Rotten Tomatoes with a startlingly low score, a new Blumhouse horror movie earns vastly superior reviews.\nThe Exorcist: Believer's Rotten Tomatoes score pales in comparison to its Blumhouse competition Totally Killer. Both movies are set to premiere on October 6, with The Exorcist: Believer, a legacy sequel about two possessed girls who must be helped by original Exorcist character Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), set to debut theatrically in wide release. Totally Killer, which follows a teenager (Kiernan Shipka) being transported back in time to 1987 and trying to save her mother's friends from a serial killer, will be released as a streaming exclusive on Prime Video.\nJust a few days before the official Exorcist: Believer release date, the possession movie debuted on Rotten Tomatoes with a startlingly low score of 26% at the time of writing. Totally Killer, which also has a new score on Rotten Tomatoes, completely blows the legacy sequel out of the water. Although both scores are due to fluctuate as more reviews are added over the weekend, the slasher comedy is currently more than 50% higher than the other title with a thoroughly Fresh score of 81%.\nWhile this sharp divide between the movies' Rotten Tomatoes scores is surprising, Blumhouse is nevertheless set to dominate the lead-up to Halloween this year. The Fresh score may help boost Totally Killer's profile this weekend for streaming audiences, but the low score for The Exorcist: Believer may not tarnish its ability to draw theatrical viewers. At the time of writing, the Exorcist: Believer box office is still projected to take in an opening weekend of a possible franchise-best $30-$35 million.\nWith these titles set to dominate both theatrical and at-home viewership during the first weekend in October, Blumhouse is kicking off what should prove to be a very fruitful Halloween season. Because Saw X opened slightly earlier on September 29, the month only has one other major wide release horror movie on the schedule. That would be the buzzy video game adaptation Five Nights at Freddy's, which is set to premiere on October 27.\nBecause Five Nights at Freddy's is also a Blumhouse production, it cements in the company's domination over the horror genre during its most important season. Even if the The Exorcist: Believer release comes in below expectations, horror-hungry audiences will have plenty of other Blumhouse options to choose from this month. The Totally Killer Rotten Tomatoes score is merely the cherry on top of what promises to be a robust period at the movies.\nSource: Rotten Tomatoes\n"}
{"title": "10 Coolest Iron Man Armors Tony Stark Built for Other Heroes", "date": "2023-10-04 22:31:41", "text": "Every one of Tony Stark's Iron Man suits are better than the last, and that extends to other heroes who have worn them. Here are the Top 10 coolest! \nIt’s no secret that Tony Stark has created some absolutely jaw-dropping pieces of tech throughout his Marvel Comics history, including and especially his legion of Iron Man suits. While fans have seen Stark donning pretty much every variation of Iron Man armor he’s crafted for himself, they’ve also seen the ones he’s made for other people, and those suits are equally awesome.\nTony Stark doesn’t have any superpowers aside from his inherent brilliance. This means that he relies on his increasingly impressive Iron Man suits to keep up with the likes of Captain Marvel, Thor, or the Hulk. This also means that Stark pretty much has a monopoly on such super-suits in the meta-sense, as they are Tony Stark's unique path towards super-heroism that becomes cheapened with every copy. Technically anyone who wears an Iron Man suit immediately gains all of Iron Man’s powers (minus the inherent intelligence, anyway), so it makes sense that Marvel Comics doesn’t give everyone who isn’t as strong as Captain Marvel or Thor an Iron Man suit. That being said, there have been a few occasions where Iron Man has shared his tech with those around him, and in such occasions, the results were phenomenal. Here are the Top 10 coolest Iron Man armors Tony Stark built for other heroes!\nJames “Rhodey” Rhodes is someone who’s been a significant part of Tony Stark’s life since his debut in Iron Man #118 by David Michelinie, Bob Layton, and John Byrne, even so far as taking up the Iron Man mantle in Iron Man #170. However, Rhodey wouldn’t become a hero in his own right until Avengers West Coast #94, which is when he made his official debut as War Machine. Designed by Tony Stark, the War Machine armor is incredibly reminiscent of the classic Iron Man suit (which Rhodey was familiar with), except it was decked-out with massive weapons and reinforced armor for extra security and power. This is the longest-lasting suit Tony made for another hero, and is easily one of the most significant.\nTony Stark made Black Widow an Iron Man suit on two separate occasions - in two separate universes. The first was in the Ultimate Universe, as shown in Ultimates 2 #4 by Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch. Tony Stark gifted Black Widow her own ‘Iron Maiden’ armor that was stylistically similar to his own, though fully blacked-out in color. Over in the prime Marvel Comics universe of Earth-616 (specifically in Avengers #28 by Jason Aaron and Ed McGuinness), Iron Man designs Black Widow a suit that’s more akin to War Machine armor, though a bit more sleek and with specialty designs that made it stand out as a Black Widow suit - and that armor was dubbed the War Widow.\nIn the Iron Cat series (by Jed MacKay and Père Perez), Tony Stark builds Felicia Hardy aka Black Cat her own Iron Cat armor. Visually, the armor looks more or less identical to Tony’s classic Iron Man design, with the addition of energy claws on the suit’s fingertips, a black mask-like design around the eyes, and cat ears that sit atop the armor’s helmet. This is the first suit on this list that didn’t grant someone with no superhuman powers all the abilities of Iron Man, but rather enhanced the preexisting superhuman abilities of the established hero. The Iron Cat complemented Black Cat’s aesthetic and powerset, while still looking and feeling like an Iron Man suit.\nBrian Braddock, or Captain Britain in Earth-616, was just a regular human in the universe in which he wore a version of the Mark 1 Iron Man suit as shown in What If? X-Men Age of Apocalypse #1 by Rick Remender and Dave Wilkins. In that alternate universe of Earth-93074, Braddock wears the original Iron Man suit, but rather than it being all gray, it is covered in the Union Jack. This armor was designed by the Tony Stark of this reality, but seemed more like repurposed armor than a specifically designed gift, though it was enough to make Braddock a formidable hero.\nWhile Luke Cage is probably the last person who would need the protection of a suit of armor given his powerset, he didn’t say ‘no’ to the offensive upgrades that came with his very own Iron Man suit. In fact, the style of the suit itself reflects that, as it is very minimal with only the necessary placements of armor on Cage’s body that offer superhuman enhancements, like gauntlets for energy blasts, boots for flight, and a helmet to navigate/pinpoint targets. This suit was featured in the Venomverse: War Stories #1 story “Force Majeure” by Aaron Covington and Khary Randolph, where Luke Cage used it to face off against Doctor Doom.\nIn Marvel Comics’ Empyre event by Al Ewing, Dan Slott, and Valerio Schiti, Tony Stark made Reed Richards his own Iron Man suit, complete with Mister Fantastic’s usual costume color scheme and the Fantastic Four insignia on the chest. This entry is especially entertaining, as Reed was very reluctant to wear one of Tony Stark’s suits, but was forced to in a last-ditch effort to save the world. This suit is a cool addition to Fantastic Four canon (as well as Reed Richards’ wardrobe).\nPerhaps the most iconic suit made but not worn by Tony Stark is the Iron Spider Armor, which was created specifically for Spider-Man and made its debut in The Amazing Spider-Man #529 by J. Michael Straczynski and Ron Garney. Similar to the suit made for Black Cat, the Iron Spider Armor complimented Spider-Man’s powers and enhanced them in creative and useful ways - including the extra mechanical arms. This suit not only enhanced Spider-Man’s powers and gave some variety to his many costumes, but it also was a standout aspect of the entire Civil War event.\nThis entry is the purest example of Tony building a suit of armor to protect someone he loves, rather than attack his enemies. Stark made the Rescue Armor specifically for Pepper Potts, who found the specialty suit in Invincible Iron Man #10 by Matt Fraction and Salvador Larroca. It was called the ‘Rescue Armor’ due to the fact that Rescue was Pepper’s superhero codename while wearing the suit. However, the undertones of Tony building the armor for Pepper in an attempt to ‘rescue’ her from the dangers of the world surrounding them is clearly present, making this suit especially significant.\nWhile Tony Stark is a master in developing his unique style of high-tech suit, he ventured into the realm of anime mechs for one storyline, as these suits were more akin to those featured in popular anime series like Vultron or Neon Genesis Evangelion. As shown in Avengers: Mech Strike by Jed MacKay and Carlos Magno, Iron Man developed gigantic mech-suits for every member of the Avengers, transforming Earth’s Mightiest Heroes into the world’s most technologically advanced protectors in truly epic (and undeniably awesome) fashion.\nSimilar to the above entry, this one shows Iron Man using his technological genius to create robotic Avengers. The difference, however, is that the so-called Iron Avengers are immeasurably darker than the Mech Strike Avengers. The Mech Strike Avengers were the core team each with their own fun, giant robot fighter that displayed their logo and costume. The Iron Avengers, however, was a sick attempt at replacing the Avengers with hollow suits of armor that pale in comparison to the originals. In Earth X #1 by Alex Ross, Jim Krueger, and John Paul Leon, the Avengers are dead, and Iron Man attempts to replace them with robots of his own design. This entry is admittedly less of a suit built for someone, and rather a legion of suits built to replace a whole team of 'someones', making the Iron Avengers the most extreme (and sick) example on this list.\nFrom giving his friends and allies an extra power-boost in battle and protecting the ones he loves with a personally-made suit of armor, to literally building an entire Avengers-level mech-squad, it’s easy to see how these are the Top 10 coolest Iron Man armors Tony Stark has built for other heroes.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

This article contains SPOILERS for Reptile (2023)!\nJudy putting Tom's hand in wax at the end of Reptile plays an important part in the thriller's conclusion, but the scene's inclusion is largely unexplained by the 2023 movie. In director Grant Singer's feature-film debut, a detective named Tom Nichols (Benicio del Toro) must work to track down a killer after a young real estate agent named Summer is killed. However, his investigation causes him to unravel all the truths he believes about his life and the institutions he's involved in.\nThis crime thriller – led by Benicio del Toro, Alicia Silverstone, and Justin Timberlake – was released in theaters on September 22 before arriving on Netflix to a mixed critical response. While Del Toro offers a compelling performance, Reptile is frustratingly uneven and much of its plot is confusing. One such perplexing scene in Reptile is when Judy dips Tom's hand in wax and then peels it off; however, there's both a health and symbolic reason for this action.\nRelated: Reptile Cast & Character Guide\nWhile it seems extremely random at first, there's a practical reason for Judy dipping Tom's hand in the wax at the end of Reptile. By this point in the movie, Tom's cut on his hand has healed, but he still feels the impact of this injury. However, paraffin wax therapy offers numerous health benefits that could help Tom's recovery. According to Healthline, paraffin wax baths can increase blood flow, decrease inflammation, relax the muscles, reduce muscle spasms, and lessen pain. By engaging in paraffin wax therapy, Tom hopes to experience less impairment due to his hand injury.\nRelated: Where Was Reptile Filmed? Thriller Movie's Filming Locations Explained\nTom Nichols deals with a hand injury that bothers him throughout Reptile, with this cut representing the physical and psychological toll that the investigation takes on the detective. However, by Reptile's ending, Tom wraps up the investigation and finds the killer, just as he wraps up his hand and prepares for recovery. Additionally, he copes with the inner turmoil of learning that the people he trusted act in corrupt and harmful ways. The wax scene combines the character's background with Reptile's title in order to send a powerful message about healing.\nSnakes, a type of reptile, shed their skin because the outer layer is old, worn, and doesn't fit anymore, which also helps rid them of harmful parasites. This biological process provides insight into the significance of the paraffin wax at the end of Reptile. After going through the investigation, Tom is worn and weathered due to the emotional turmoil. However, he has changed his relationships and beliefs, making him a different person internally. Tom metaphorically sheds his skin in Reptile by removing the wax layer and becoming a new person. Moreover, Judy's involvement proves that she recognizes his mental changes.\nSource: Healthline\nDani Kessel Odom (they/them) works as a Core Features Shift Writer for Screen Rant.

Many of the best movies of all time come from the crime genre, including classics like The Godfather and Goodfellas. The crime film genre has only grown over the years, and this has prompted heavy competition between streaming services to acquire the rights to classics and produce new hits in this area.\nNetflix has done a good job of balancing its volume of classic crime movies and its production of new films of this type, leading to a strong overall selection. While Netflix's catalog is in a state of constant change, its current roster of crime movies is excellent, which reflects the company's efforts to stay stocked up on this popular genre.\nRelated: 10 Best Mystery Movies On Netflix\nThe Irishman is one of the biggest Netflix originals ever, earning numerous accolades, including an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. Based on a true story, The Irishman is widely considered one of the greatest films of the 21st century so far and is among the greatest of all Martin Scorsese movies. Starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci, this mobster movie follows a truck driver who becomes a hitman for a prominent crime family. The Irishman combines an excellent cast of seasoned A-list actors with Scorsese's masterful directing to craft one of the finest mafia movies ever made.\nRelated: Al Pacino's Best Movies, Ranked\nDirected by and starring Clint Eastwood, The Mule is another fantastic crime movie currently streaming on Netflix. The Mule is based on a true story and features an engaging plot and poignant themes. Eastwood stars as Earl Stone, an elderly man who begins smuggling cocaine for a cartel after his horticulture business goes bankrupt. The movie received praise from critics and was a box office success, grossing around $175 million (via Box Office Mojo).\nDonnie Brasco is an American crime drama that follows an undercover FBI agent (Johnny Depp) as he attempts to infiltrate a prominent crime family in New York City during the '70s. The film is loosely based on the true story of Joseph Pistone, who went undercover using the titular alias, and it also stars Al Pacino as real-life mobster Lefty Ruggiero. This riveting story, which earned it an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, is complemented by expert directing from Mike Newell.\nRelated: Johnny Depp's Mob Movies Prove He Wasted Too Much Time On Jack Sparrow\nPublic Enemies explores the Great Depression crime wave and the birth of the FBI through the lens of notorious criminal John Dillinger (Johnny Depp). The movie follows the final years of Dillinger's criminal career while FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) pursues the infamous bank robber. This gripping crime drama was praised by critics and was a success at the box office, grossing over $200 million worldwide (via Box Office Mojo). The performances and script are excellent, and its gritty cinematography puts Public Enemies firmly among Netflix's best crime movies.\nRelated: 10 Best War Movies On Netflix\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie serves as a sequel/epilogue to the iconic TV series Breaking Bad. The Netflix original film follows Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) after the conclusion of the show and features several other returning cast members, including Bryan Cranston. El Camino was widely praised by critics, and it received numerous award nominations for made-for-television movies. El Camino captures the gritty feel of Breaking Bad while telling a characteristically engaging story that makes it a worthy successor to the hit show.\nRelated: The Breaking Bad Episodes To Watch To Understand El Camino\nHeat is a trailblazing movie that follows the struggle between an LAPD detective (Al Pacino) and a successful career criminal (Robert De Niro) as they vie to outwit each other. It is highly regarded as one of the most influential crime movies of its age, giving way to a slew of similar works over the next couple of decades. Heat tells a riveting story which is complemented by outstanding directing by Michael Mann and strong performances from the cast, making it another strong option for Netflix streamers in search of a good crime movie.\nCatch Me If You Can stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks alongside an excellent supporting cast that includes Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, and James Brolin. Directed by Steven Spielberg, Catch Me If You Can tells the mostly true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio), who, according to his memoir, gathered millions of dollars through various cons. The veracity of Abagnale's claims has been widely challenged, but the story he tells is fascinating regardless. This is another Spielberg masterpiece, so it's worth a watch for Netflix subscribers.\nDespite its initial criticisms for being overly violent, Scarface is now considered one of the greatest gangster movies ever made. Scarface stars Al Pacino as Cuban immigrant Tony Montana as he rises to become one of the most powerful drug lords in Miami. Scarface is considered a cult classic, and its gritty portrayal of drug trafficking paved the way for more similarly graphic crime movies. This is one of the best movies on Netflix period, making it an easy inclusion on this list.\nThe Good Nurse tells the true story of serial killer Charles Cullen (Eddie Redmayne), who murdered a still-unknown number of people during his 16-year career as a nurse. The movie follows the case through the eyes of one of Cullen's coworkers, Amy Loughren (Jessica Chastain), who begins to suspect him after one of their shared patients dies mysteriously. This heart-pounding crime thriller keeps audiences on the edge of their seats, as Chastain and Redmayne's captivating performances steal the show.\nLéon The Professional is another fantastic crime film currently available on Netflix. Written and directed by Luc Besson, the movie follows Léon (Jean Reno), a hitman who takes charge of a 12-year-old girl (Natalie Portman in her film debut) after her family is murdered by a corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman). Critics praised the film, and it was a commercial success as well, with its worldwide box office gross nearly tripling its production budget (via The Numbers). This gritty, emotional film is defined by outstanding acting and a well-conceived script that make it one of the best crime movies of the '90s.\n"}
{"title": "90 Day: The Last Resort: Is Angela's Age Affecting Her? ( Maybe It's A Midlife Crisis)", "date": "2023-10-04 22:52:15", "text": "90 Day: The Last Resort's Angela Deem often runs hot or cold. She's moody, erratic, explosive, and possibly going through a midlife crisis. \n90 Day: The Last Resort star Angela Deem's erratic and out of control, and since she's now 57, her age may be changing her personality. Since she's one of the more mature 90DF franchise stars, the fact that Angela still lashes out like an angry child's surprising. Fame may have gone to her head, stalling her personal growth. Sometimes shockingly immature, Angela said onscreen that she finds it hard to express herself with words. Over the years, she's proven that's true. Once, in a fit of rage, she threw a strawberry shortcake at Michael Ilesanmi. She hasn't calmed down much since then.\nRight now, on 90 Day: The Last Resort season 1, Angela's in a good place with Michael, but based on their turbulent history, their happiness may not last. Onscreen, she just celebrated her third anniversary with Michael, albeit virtually. Even via video, Michael was able to excite his much-older partner. Just the sight of Michael makes her, \"cooter tingle.\" While there's nothing wrong with a mature woman having a libido, Angela's signature TMI's just another example of how she goes for shock value. Does she fear getting older and try to compensate with wild behavior? Or is she just enjoying her life?\nRelated: 90 Day Fiancé's Angela Deem Confirms If She Actually Loves Michael Ilesanmi\nAngela's known for reckless conduct, and that's a key indicator of a midlife crisis. On 90 Day: The Last Resort, she flirted with a resort worker while holding divorce papers in her hand. She knows she's acting up while the cameras roll, and that may provoke her to try and one-up herself. While that could explain certain histrionics, with or without 90 Day Fiancé's Michael Ilesanmi, some of it may be the byproduct of aging.\nAngela may not realize that a midlife crisis is driving her behavior... and pushing her to go way too far. Self-examination isn't exactly her strong suit, and that's why she's such an interesting addition to the 90 Day: The Last Resort cast. The show's about therapy, and the extrovert Angela prefers to act out, rather than looking within.\nAngela leaned into her \"wild woman\" persona long ago. On 90 Day: The Last Resort, she's trying to change. This attempt to \"soften\" her personality may not stick, and it may be a sign that she's currently confused about her identity. A person who's having a midlife crisis may find that their sense of self's shakier. They're changing due to aging, and may have trouble reconciling who they are now with who they were in the past.\nDoes Angie still want to be the wild woman? Or is she looking for personal growth that makes her a more serene person? Right now, she's waffling. It's possible that part of her is truly open to change. However, change is hard, especially for a reality celeb who might bore viewers if she calmed down too much. Angela's savvy enough to understand why people are watching. All she really needs to do is be herself without hurting anyone else. If she's authentic, but not getting into physical altercations, she can weather her midlife crisis without serious repercussions.\nIt's unrealistic to expect a lot of maturity from Angela, but sometimes, she's underestimated. She worked in palliative care, at a hospice. That's the kind of work that requires endless empathy and compassion. Also, she's there for her family through thick and thin. Since she does have a lot of different sides to her personality, it may be hard for her to balance her mature and more \"out there\" traits. As she gets older, it could get easier. Sometimes, people \"age out\" of certain things. That may happen to the Georgia peach from Hazlehurst.\nNot too long ago, Angela got into a brawl with a \"pal.\" They fought in a hotel elevator, and Angie seemed to be the aggressor. She gets angry too fast, and never stops to think. In her relationship with Michael, she's been aggressive too. Does irritability lead her to attack? She overreacts to things, and Angela's so easily triggered. While there are good reasons why she's been upset with Michael, as he's an admitted cheater, she chose to stay with him. If a person chooses to stay, they should try to honestly forgive. Angela holds grudges, and midlife irritability may make it even harder for her to hold back.\nShe didn't get cast in 90 Day: The Last Resort because she's a serene woman. She's there because she's a hothead and her marriage is hanging by a thread. While she seems to love Michael, if she's having a midlife crisis, it may be hard for her to keep things on an even keel, like they were in the last episode.\nAngela has talked to therapists on the show, so she's trying. She and Michael are currently happy, but the real issue may be more serious than a midlife crisis. The underlying problem is that Michael may not be sincere. Does he really love Angela? While he's putting on a good show during the 90DF spinoff, a cheater who has repeatedly betrayed his partner may not reform. He could pretend to be different for personal gain.\nFor reality TV show star Michael, there are benefits to staying with Angela. There's money in it, and clout too. Without Angela, where would he be? She suspected he was a scammer, and those doubts may have been something she could have paid more attention to. Instead, she wasted years on Michael. If he doesn't actually love her, it's all so pointless.\nTrying to make things work with Michael may exacerbate any midlife crisis symptoms she's having, and those efforts could ultimately be futile. A \"happy\" spinoff episode doesn't mean long-term happiness. It's quite likely that the problems she's had with Michael will resurface, and when they do, her coping skills may not be good as they are right now on 90 Day: The Last Resort. In the tropical locale, everything may seem solvable, but when the cameras stop filming, life can be very different. Michael and Angela are like oil and water, and making them mix requires enormous effort, which is unlikely to be worth it in the end.\n"}
{"title": "10 Space Movies That Experts Claim Are Wildly Inaccurate", "date": "2023-10-04 23:01:44", "text": "Although space movies transport viewers beyond Earth, experts have found that not every movie set in space is getting the science right.\nWith so many space stories out there, it's no surprise that experts have found that many science-fiction movies get real-life astronauts and the science of space wrong. Although space movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey are often praised for their stunning visuals, providing extremely accurate representations of space is not always prioritized. This may be frustrating for those who know better, but it's often done so that movies can focus on visuals or plot points instead.\nThat said, sometimes realism can help validate a film franchise's internal science. Keeping ideas rooted in reality — whether it's Newton's laws of motion or quantum mechanics — can add authenticity to a space movie. In turn, this can end up helping the plot. So, when real-life details are way off the mark, it can prove jarring for audiences. That's why experts have pointed out the scientific flaws in these space movies.\nIn a BuzzFeed video, astrophysicists Jason Rhodes and Alina Kiessling reviewed a scene from The Last Jedi during which an explosion occurs aboard a ship, sucking Princess Leia out of the hole the blast creates. The pair credited the film for successfully mimicking what would happen during an explosion like this — the exposure to space would pull back anyone and anything — but they noted that more people should have been sucked into the vacuum later on, when a door was opened nearby. Additionally, the experts confirmed that the frost forming on Leia's face was plausible but that her eyes functioning normally was unrealistic.\nRhodes and Kiessling also reviewed a scene from Guardians of the Galaxy, during which Peter Quill exits a spacecraft in order to save Gamora, who is floating in space. Peter removes his helmet and exposes his face, which Kiessling noted wasn't accurate. \"His eyes are still working; they would have frozen instantly,\" Kiessling said. Additionally, once Peter and Gamora are back in a pressurized space, they're immediately fine with no real side effects of their exposure to space. This could be attributed to Gamora's inhuman qualities and Peter's godly parentage, but the science behind this scene is inaccurate from a real-life standpoint. \nRelated: NASA Astronaut Explains What GOTG 3 Got Wrong About Star-Lord Almost Dying In Space\nTo add to this, astronaut Chris Hadfield shared in a 2023 Vanity Fair video discussing the second sequel that \"beyond about a minute and a half there's going to be stuff that happens to you that does permanent, irreversible, and deathly damage [when outside a spaceship without a space suit].\" He explained that because one would expel oxygen, they would essentially have blood with no oxygen. Once that blood reached the brain, they'd become unconscious.\nWhile Wall-E is a beloved and acclaimed movie from Disney and Pixar, it's not necessarily revered for its scientific accuracy. Discussing a scene where Wall-E and EVE are floating around in space, Kiessling explained, “There’s no atmosphere to carry the sound in space,” even though audiences can hear Wall-E and EVE speaking to each other and making noises. Additionally, Rhodes noted that while Wall-E pushing himself with a fire extinguisher is plausible, the precise direction and steering he exhibits while doing it is incorrect. According to Kiessling, “That level of control would not be possible.”\nWhile gunfights aren't the first thing most think of when it comes to astronauts and space, Total Recall is jam-packed with action that requires it. In a scene where Douglas Quaid shoots a firearm, he moves backwards. Rhodes explained that \"unless you are shooting the gun from exactly your center of gravity, instead of just moving in one direction, you would start to spin.\" So, while the scene showcases backward movement accurately as a result of the pressure released when firing, it doesn't account for the physics of shooting at the level of gravity Douglas finds himself in.\nAlthough guns are not unheard of in space, especially in fiction, the way they function is different there. Hadfield told Vanity Fair, \"Guns don't need oxygen to work. It's the exploding gas inside the confines of the rifle that make the projectile come out the end really fast.\" Because there's about one-sixth gravity on the moon, the bullet's fall is slower than on Earth, so it takes longer to hit its target. \"That means the bullet with the same speed horizontally would go further around the moon,\" said Hadfield. During a shootout in the film, however, the speed of the bullets seems to match that of bullets fired on Earth.\nRELATED: Why Passengers' Ending Was So Controversial\nThe same chase scene's shootout also uses diegetic sound to heighten the action, yet the lack of air on the moon makes it so that sound wouldn't carry like that. Additionally, astrophysicist Adam Frank shared in an NBCNews piece that the film's correlation between time, supposed low gravity, and space travel is incorrect, as Roy's three-month journey to Neptune requires constant movement. He explained this as follows:\n\"To get to Neptune that fast, the ship’s engines would have to be running the whole time, meaning Pitt would experience “gravity” because the acceleration produced by his rocket motors (what’s called thrust) would push his back into his chair (or his feet onto the floor).\"\nHadfield discussed how, for the sake of compelling storytelling, Passengers is inaccurate in its portrayal of centrifugal force and gravity. \"If you shut off the spinner [that simulates gravity for the spacecraft], it would continue to spin for quite a while,\" Hadfield said. That's mostly because there's \"nothing to slow the spin down.\" However, in Passengers, when the ship stops spinning instantly, everything starts floating due to zero gravity. Hadfield noted that to achieve this effect, the ship would actually need brakes of some sort.\nAurora swims when this happens, causing water to react to the lack of gravity. Hadfield went on to explain that water typically floats and naturally forms into a ball due to surface tension. While he applauded this aspect of the scene, he emphasized that the resolution is less likely. It would require a lot of force to get the ship spinning again in order to send the water back down once gravity was restored. However, in the movie, it's instantaneous and used to create tension when Aurora is finally able to resurface and take a big breath.\nRhodes and Kiessling agreed that there was little realism in Gravity in terms of science. For the movie to be accurate, Rhodes admitted that Sandra Bullock's Ryan Stone \"would've died in every scene.\" Hadfield echoed that sentiment in the Vanity Fair video as he analyzed the scene where astronauts are caught in an asteroid debris field while repairing the Hubble telescope. He mentioned that the movie's representation of astronauts is \"so different from the people who are actually exploring space,\" citing oddities like Matthew contacting Houston when Ryan is propelled into space, Ryan’s frantic uncertainty about what to do when there’s an issue, and their recreational trips outside their spacecraft.\nRelated: The 15 Best Movies About Being Lost In Space\nHadfield criticized the premise of Life, calling it \"farfetched\" and expressing that, despite Ryan Reynolds' consideration for weightlessness, there are numerous improbabilities. Hadfield said in the 2023 Vanity Fair video that one of three main crises on a spaceship or space station is a fire. So, when Reynolds' character fills up the spaceship with fire and no alarms go off, it's unrealistic. Additionally, the use of an oxygen candle, which has \"a certain chemical in it that if you heat up one end, the chemical reaction releases great amounts of oxygen,\" as a means to eradicate the alien on the ship is undermined by the destructive use of a flamethrower.\nWhile The Martian may be scientifically accurate in some ways, such as Mark Watney's resourcefulness with food, it does contain some dubious science. Hadfield explained that Mars' atmosphere is extremely thin, which is \"the worst part of the whole movie.\" So, in the scene when Mark is tossed around due to a storm, it's unlikely that the large debris pieces would be picked up, blown, or used to knock Mark over. Hadfield elaborated that, because of the thinner atmosphere, \"there'd be so few air molecules going by, that you'd hardly even feel them.\"\nMoreover, the film's mirroring of Earth's gravity with Mars' is also inaccurate. Hadfield shared that Mars' gravity is 38% of Earth's, meaning that \"[Mark would] only weigh one third as much as he does on Earth.\" This indicates that the solidity of Mark's movements and his physique throughout his isolation on Mars are too far from what traversing and living on Mars is actually like.\nHadfield pointed out some issues with First Man, which is a movie about real astronaut Neil Armstrong's life. Like a few other entries on this list, First Man misuses sound in space. When Neil, played by Ryan Gosling, flies an X-15 aircraft in the opening scene, the sound is particularly inaccurate as Neil undergoes a test flight. Hadfield said, \"It's sort of like he's in a pickup truck, driving across a field with this big whiny noise that tells you just how fast he's going all the time.\" He goes on to say this would not be heard in a cockpit and that the extreme vibration is exaggerated.\nWhile space movies often take creative liberties, especially ones that lean more into science-fiction territory, the ones rooted in already-established science can sometimes be a bit too far off from reality. Whether it's in favor of drama, visual scale, or action, it's clear that space movies shouldn't always be treated as the be-all and end-all of astronomy, astrophysics, or life in space. That said, slight deviations from scientific accuracy can still make for enjoyable viewing experiences.\nSource: BuzzFeedVideo, Vanity Fair, NBCNews, Vanity Fair\nWith a BA in screenwriting, film and TV, and media studies, Kelly has explored storytelling from academic and pop-culture perspectives.

And in an End of the Spider-Verse-related comic, The House of Ideas secretly killed off one of these hybrid heroes named Spider-Boy, only to turn around and repurpose his codename for a completely different superhero just recently introduced!\nCombining Ben Reilly’s Spider-Man and Connor Kent’s Superboy into Peter Ross aka Spider-Boy, this hero was one of the more visually appealing characters springing from 1996’s DC vs. Marvel comic event, as he perfectly blended Spidey’s more arachnid-focused outfit with Connor’s “bad boy” leather jacket design. Unfortunately for this version of Spider-Boy, Marvel decided he was better off dead, with the company not only brutally murdering him offscreen, but by the climax of the End of the Spider-Verse event, replacing him with another Spider-Boy, one that holds no ties to Marvel’s “Distinguished Competition.”\nRelated: Iron Man's Amalgam Armor Gave Him Green Lantern's Powers\nPermanently culling the jointly owned Spider-Boy in 2022’s Spider-Man #2, by Dan Slott and Mark Bagley, this issue acted as part two of the End of the Spider-Verse event and explained how the brutal spider-villain of Morlun traveled to another universe looking for a portal device that would allow him to traverse alternate realities more easily. Shown arriving in Loomworld holding the severed arm of a spider-person looking awfully similar to Spider-Boy’s leather-jacketed arm and spider-patterned glove, it’s heavily implied that Morlun killed this Spider-Man and used his device for his own means, effectively erasing a character from Marvel continuity that hasn’t been seen in almost 30 years.\nTossing the dismembered arm to the side now that the OG Spider-Boy’s usefulness had run its course, it’s here where Marvel’s secret elimination of this hero gives way to an all-new, all-different Spider-Boy named Bailey Briggs, adding further insult to injury as the character is officially introduced in the finale to the very story that offed his Amalgam counterpart in the first place. Making perfect sense to kill the first Spider-Boy as Marvel couldn’t feature him in full for this event nor any other comic story due to the understandably tricky legal issues with DC, Bailey inheriting the Spider-Boy moniker is an inspired choice that simultaneously dashes any lingering hopes of seeing the Ben Reilly/Connor Kent version of the character pop up in the Spider-Verse ever again.\nSo while it was already unlikely Marvel or DC would have utilized their shared characters again after the epic event that brought them together concluded, seeing the sneaky way Marvel did away with the Amalgam Universe’s Spider-Boy only to reintroduce the character as a Marvel-owned sidekick is not only a slick way to go about removing Spider-Boy from the overarching conversation, but also acts as the final “appearance” of this hybrid hero entirely. Marvel’s composite Spider-Boy is dead, and although he technically lives on, it’s unfortunately in name only.\nBrian is first and foremost a nerd in every way shape and form.

Some remakes can retell a classic story, some can add a new twist, and some can re-imagine the story differently from the original. The success of a remake depends on its similarities to the source material, its production, and its connection to both audiences and critics.\nSome movie remakes such as King Kong, A Star is Born, and West Side Story have been released to critical acclaim and regarded as a refreshing take on the original story. Other remakes miss their target and are a bitter disappointment. There are plenty of movie remakes out there that have been seen as entirely unnecessary and unneeded by anybody at all. Here are a few of them.\nReleased in 1980, Alan Parker's Fame centers on students attending New York's High School of Performing Arts, as they progress from their first day to graduation. The 1980 film received praise for its acting, music, and ability to portray the highs and lows of success in a relatable manner to audiences. The film won two Academy Awards for Best Original Song and Best Original Score and is still regarded as one of the best musical drama films of the 1980s.\nThe 2009 remake followed the same storyline of attending a performing arts school while using different characters but was regarded as shallow compared to the original film. It received criticism for its clichéd stories, lack of proper character development, and removing the serious and darker themes that were an essential part of the 1980 film. Critics and viewers alike agreed that this remake tried to take advantage of High School Musical's success and relate to a younger audience, but it lacked the soul and heart that made the original a hit.\nThere were high hopes for 2017's The Mummy; it was intended to be the first in Universal's Dark Universe based on their classic monsters of the 20th century. With Tom Cruise starring as Sergeant Nick Morton, the film sees an Ancient Egyptian queen being accidentally released from her tomb and causing havoc across present-day London. The Mummy is regarded as one of the most legendary monsters of all time, so there were hopes that the 2017 film would bring a new exciting take on the story.\nWhen the film was released, however, it failed at the box office and received a cold response from audiences. Critics felt the movie stripped away all the humor and fun that made the original 1999 trilogy a success. The original trilogy's star, Brendan Fraser, has stated that removing the fun is where the movie went wrong. Despite strong action sequences and an interesting take on the story, The Mummy couldn't connect with viewers, which led to Universal canceling the Dark Universe altogether.\nDirected by Herbert Ross, Footloose is a 1984 musical drama film that follows Kevin Bacon's teenager Ren, who moves to a small town where dancing is banned. With the help of new friends and his new crush Ariel, Ren fights to overturn the town's views on dancing and the right to express themselves through music. The original was a box-office success and is memorable for its popular soundtrack; it received more recognition in recent years thanks to its multiple references in the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise.\nParamount released a remake of Footloose in 2011, starring Julianne Hough and Kenny Wormald. Unlike other remakes, it wasn't a complete failure, receiving moderate reviews and performing decently at the box office. But critics agree that a remake of Footloose just wasn't needed in the modern era and it didn't have the same emotional impact on viewers as the original did.\nProduced by Steven Spielberg, 1982's Poltergeist looks at a suburban family whose home is haunted by a host of ghosts that abduct their youngest child. Thanks to its talented cast, relatable characters, and gripping story, the original Poltergeist delivers pure terror and suspense and is regarded as a horror classic. Heather O'Rourke's line \"They're here!\" is oft-quoted as one of the more memorable lines in the horror genre.\nMany horror movies have received a remake over the years, so it was no real surprise that Poltergeist would end up receiving one in 2015. However, many agree that the remake fell flat, relying too much on jump scares and adding nothing new or exciting to the story. Despite the cast giving their all, the Russo Bros' Poltergeist remakeis largely regarded as a pointless and unnecessary rehash of an already iconic horror film.\nLike Poltergeist, House of Wax is another remake of a classic horror film, the 1953 Andre DeToth film, which itself was a remake of 1933's Mystery of the Wax Museum. The 2005 film sees a group of friends stranded on their way to a football match, and they seek assistance at a wax museum. But they soon find themselves in a fight for survival and must try to escape before they find themselves becoming the wax museum's next exhibits.\nHouse of Wax tries to deliver a new twist to the original story, adding an amount of gore and slash that was not seen in the original two movies. Despite receiving some praise for its casting and new take on the original story, House of Wax was ultimately written off as being too bland and mundane. It certainly couldn't quite hold a candle to the terrors of the original films.\nThere have been many adaptations of Stephen King's works; his first novel, Carrie received its first film release in 1976. The original film, starring Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie, is regarded as one of the greatest horror films ever made. It has had a major influence on pop culture and is considered an inspiration for many horror films.\nRemaking an already iconic film is never easy, but director Kimberly Peirce brought Carrie into the 21st century with a 2013 remake. Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore did a decent job as Carrie and Margaret White, respectively, and the film tried to embrace a modern setting, but it was jarring that a few old bits of slang were still included in the remake. Ultimately, critics felt Carrie brought nothing new or thrilling to the original story, regarding it as a redundant version of the 1976 classic.\nPlanet of the Apes has seen many film adaptations thanks to its fascinating concept. Its most iconic adaptation is the 1968 sci-fi movie starring Charlton Heston as an astronaut who finds himself stranded on a planet that is inhabited by talking apes. It is considered a classic science fiction film with one of the best sci-fi twist endings ever.\nTim Burton decided to bring a modern take on the story with his 2001 remake. But despite stunning visuals and make-up designs, critics considered the remake a letdown, due to its confusing story, lackluster performances, and unpopular take on the iconic ending. It was such a failure that a sequel was shelved, and it would be another decade before the franchise was rebooted again, this time much more successfully.\nProbably one of the most infamous remakes of all time, The Wicker Man has become a movie that has achieved \"so bad, it's good\" status. Marketed as a horror movie, The Wicker Man has been regarded by critics and audiences as unintentionally funny thanks in part to Nicolas Cage's over-the-top acting and its poorly written script. The unintentional comedic aspect has allowed the movie to become a cult hit and a part of internet meme culture.\nIn contrast, the original 1973 film is considered a cinematic masterpiece. It was praised for its subtlety in its portrayal of horror with the beliefs of Christianity and paganism as well as stunning performances from Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee. The final scene of the movie is regarded as one of the most frightening moments in movie history; considered one of the greatest folk-horror films, the 1973 original stands tall against the abysmal 2006 remake.\nAlfred Hitchcock's Psycho is one of the most influential movies, regardless of genre. Starring Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, proprietor of Bates Hotel and sadistic murderer, Psycho is seen as one of the best psychological horror films and one that laid the blueprint for movies that came after. Psycho's iconic shower scene, where Janet Leigh's Marion Crane is murdered by Bates, left such a mark on visual style in filmmaking that it continues to influence certain shots in modern movies today.\nGus Van Sant's 1998 remake film is notorious for recreating the original as a shot-for-shot remake, copying Hitchcock's camera style and the original script. Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche were seen as greatly miscast in their roles as Norman Bates and Marion Crane, and critics despised the film for its lack of thrills and horror. Winning a Razzie award for Worst Remake, Van Sant's Psycho is a remake that nobody needed.\nRecreating a classic film is no easy task, but the remake of 1959's Ben-Hur was a critical and commercial disaster. Adapted from the novel by Lew Wallace, 1959's Ben-Hur sees Charlton Heston as the titular character, fighting against the Roman Empire and trying to restore honor to his family name. It is hailed as one of the best religious drama films ever made, thanks to its influential musical score, its talented cast, and its iconic chariot race scene. It won a record 11 Academy Awards in 1960 and is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time.\nThe remake failed to make any significant impact, being deemed a pointless endeavor by critics. With the 2016 Ben-Hur remake losing close to $120 million at the box office, audiences clearly felt the same. The CGI effects and modern edits couldn't hold up to the epic cinematography and production of director William Wyler's original film. A misguided and incompetent remake that pales in comparison to its predecessor, Ben-Hur is perhaps at the top of the list of the most unnecessary remakes of classic movies.\nEidhne Gallagher is a writer, creator and researcher  based in Ireland, the Land of Saints and Scholars.  A self-described bookworm, she lived her childhood with her head stuck in a book.

{"title": "A Million Miles Away True Story: What Really Happened To Astronaut José M. Hernández", "date": "2023-10-04 23:20:44", "text": "A Million Miles Away is a biopic based on the life of Astronaut Jose M. Hernandez. From cast to theme, here's how it compares to his real life. \nA Million Miles Away is a biopic based on the life of NASA Astronaut Jose M. Hernandez, and, as with any biopic, it's fair to wonder how closely it sticks to his true story. Directed by Alejandra Marquez Abella, the film is based on Hernandez's 2012 autobiography Reaching For The Stars: The Inspiring Story Of A Migrant Farm Worker Turned Astronaut. A Million Miles Away combines the collaborative efforts of NASA and Amazon Prime with the passion of the film's director. It stars Rosa Salazar as Jose's caring and devoted wife Adela and Michael Peña in the lead role of Jose.\nA Million Miles Away depicts one man's relentless pursuit to make his dreams come true, a concept many can relate to. The film has received a co-sign from the NASA astronaut himself, who has gone on record to praise how \"masterful\" of a job the film's portrayal of his life is. Although the film checks off boxes for style and tone, Abella was allowed some room for poetic reinvention. Here's how the film compares to the real-life story of Jose M. Hernandez.\nJose M. Hernandez was born on August 7, 1962. He was born in French Camp, California (although he considers Stockton, California his hometown) to a family of migrant farmworkers from Mexico. According to an interview with ABC News, Hernandez knew as young as 10 years old that he wanted to fly out to space. After seeing astronaut Gene Cernan grace the moon during the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, he was inspired to be among the stars.\nJose's dreams took him all the way from the fields of California to the halls of the University of California Santa Barbara, where he earned his Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. In 2001, he began his career with NASA when he joined the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. By 2004, he was accepted into NASA's highly competitive astronaut program after reportedly being rejected 11 times. In August 2009, he embarked on a 14-day mission to the International Space Station on the STS-128 and made history as the first migrant farm worker to travel to space.\nSince retiring from his career at NASA in 2011, Hernandez has become a multi-hyphenated success as a philanthropist, author, and CEO of his own engineering company. When he's not promoting the advancements of Tierra Luna Engineering, he can often be found performing outreach for underrepresented youth, encouraging their dreams of pursuing careers in STEM, and exposing them to the fascinating world of space exploration.\nA Million Miles Away chronicles Jose's journey from migrant worker to NASA astronaut. The movie includes major key moments in Hernandez's life, touching on both advancements in his career to his home life in California. Although A Million Miles Away focuses on Hernandez's story, it also highlights integral players and components of his life that helped him become the successful man he is today.\nA Million Miles Away doesn't just showcase Jose's roots as a means to an end, it plays up how Hernandez's background as a Mexican-American farmer influences his career in science, equipping him with the necessary tools he needed to thrive. The film not only depicts a groundbreaking tale, it also glorifies the discipline, persistence, and support he needed to take his life from farm to space.\nA Million Miles Away checks off boxes for style, tone, and attention to detail. It manages to sneak in moments both big and small from real conversations with family members to the moment he gets accepted into NASA. This realistic depiction of success demonstrates how small fragmented moments all play a major role in the outcome of someone's success.\nThe inclusion of moments like his first day of work at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where a receptionist mistakes him for a janitor, is a testament to the kind of roadblocks Hernandez faced as a man trying to achieve the seemingly impossible. In the same interview with ABC, Hernandez admits that he had moments of self-doubt where he questioned whether he was worthy of the opportunities he'd been given. He also suspected that his background as a migrant worker may have been held against him in some capacity.\nHowever, his persistence and unwavering support from his loved ones helped him get to new heights, and in the film, this is especially apparent. Hernandez's network of real supporters is highlighted in A Million Miles Away. From his parents (who reportedly gave up their dreams of being homeowners to help support Hernandez) to his second-grade teacher Ms. Young (who allegedly encouraged his parents to settle in one place), the film features references to real tender moments that shaped the trajectory for Jose and his family. With the help of NASA's clearance, A Million Miles Away was able to secure real-life footage, locations, and technical expertise.\nTo take it a step further, the film's portrayal of Mexican-American culture has made it a hit among the Latino community, something that gives director Alejandra Marquez Abella pride. The film is praised for its authentic portrayal of the Latino community all across the board. A Million Miles Away features Mexican food, music, and celebrations that help capture the essence of the Mexican-American lifestyle. Additionally, the film portrays the strong sense of interconnectedness among family and community that is a driving force in the Latino community.\nAs heartfelt and authentic as the movie is, it does leave out a few details. This tends to happen when someone condenses an entire life into a two-hour film. Although a reference to Hernandez's career at The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory makes it into the film, it neglects to touch on one of his most vital career milestones.\nWhile employed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Hernandez contributed to the creation of a tool that broke ground in cancer screening and imagery. He was the co-creator of the first full-field digital mammography system that detects early signs of breast cancer. Although he reportedly wishes this groundbreaking moment in his career would've made the cut in A Million Miles Away, Hernandez is still fully supportive of the biopic. In essence, while a few things were left out or tweaked, the biopic is about as close to Hernandez' real story as possible.\nSource: ABC News\nIG: @kysheeta_c\n\nKaillaby is a writer from NYC with a passion for anime, movies, and all things pop culture.

Produced by Walt Disney Pictures and released in 1993, Cool Runnings was based on the true story of the first Jamaican national bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Olympics. The sports comedy starred the late John Candy as the former Olympian Irving Blitzer who coaches the four-man bobsleigh team, which includes Derice Bannock (Leon Robinson), Junior Bevil (Rawle D Lewis), Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), and Sanka Coffie (Doug E Doug).\nIn a new interview with The Independent for the film's 30th anniversary, Turteltaub and the Cool Runnings cast opened up about the controversy regarding the characters’ Jamaican accents. The actor credited as Leon says that Disney wanted him to \"sound like a black Aladdin.\" It was also suggested to Turteltaub that the cast sound like Sebastian the Crab, a Disney character with a Trinidadian accent. Read what the cast and director shared below:\nLewis: I saw it morph into the movie that it is now. It was something that had never been told before – Jamaicans in tights? People were like, \"How’s this going to go under the Disney umbrella?\"\nLeon: They wanted me to sound like a black Aladdin. They wanted a Disney version. It was tough because if anybody wants to be authentic, it’s me — but I’m a professional and I had to do the job.\nYoba: They’d say, \"People in Middle America won’t be able to understand you.\" At that time, people had less access to cultural differences and didn’t know how Jamaican really sounded.\nTurteltaub: The next day, I told the cast, \"I’m going to get fired if you don’t sound like Sebastian the Crab. Please don’t get me fired.\" We joked about it but they got it. They understood. \"We’re not going to do Sebastian the Crab but we’re going to make an Americanized version of the movie that people around the world can understand.\" Times have changed a lot in 30 years. There’s zero chance I’d get this job – and I probably shouldn’t get it. I’m on the side of the people who say I shouldn’t have directed this and yet we ended up with a pretty great movie. It’s tricky.\nBefore Turteltaub took over the movie, Brian Gibson was attached to direct a more serious take on Cool Runnings. Once Disney took over the film, they removed all references to sex and drugs and turned it into a family-friendly film. This creative shift caused Gibson to drop out and in turn, Turteltaub was hired, though he had several battles with then-Disney boss Jeffrey Katzenberg, who worried that the characters' Jamaican accents would be difficult to understand. From that point on, this became a point of constant contention.\nRelated: The 90 Best Movies On Disney+ (October 2023)\nKatzenberg and company wanted a more Disneyfied version of the characters' Jamaican accents, a \"black Aladdin,” as Leon says. However, the cast wanted to present a more authentic Jamaican cadence. Katzenberg threatened to fire Turteltaub if he couldn't understand the characters' accents, so the cast agreed to \"make an Americanised version of the movie that people around the world can understand.\" While Cool Runnings would go on to become a beloved feel-good classic, it was criticized for perpetuating caricatures rather than authentic representations of the Jamaican dialect.\nSource: The Independent\n"}
{"title": "8 Witcher Book Moments That Will Help Liam Hemsworth’s Geralt Win You Over", "date": "2023-10-04 23:31:44", "text": "Liam Hemsworth has big shoes to fill as he steps in as Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher, but these 8 book moments can allow him to win fans over.\nLiam Hemsworth has big shoes to fill as he prepares to take over the lead role of Geralt of Rivia in Netflix's The Witcher, but there are eight big moments from the books that can help Hemsworth win over The Witcher's fans. Henry Cavill played Geralt in the first three seasons of The Witcher, inhabiting the role with a natural ease that made him the main attraction of this Netflix original. However, Cavill grew fed up with the show's controversial creative decisions, finally abandoning the show and leading Netflix to replace him with Liam Hemsworth.\nTaking over for Cavill will be no easy task, and The Witcher seems to have already lost a big chunk of its viewership with Cavill's departure, but Hemsworth is an accomplished actor with as good a chance as anyone of revitalizing this struggling franchise. He will have to do his best to replicate the things that Cavill did well, but he needs to put his own spin on the character as well. These eight big moments from the books will give Hemsworth the chance he needs to ingratiate himself with fans and leave his mark on the franchise.\nRelated: 10 Most Important Characters Introduced In Witcher Season 3 (& How They Set Up Season 4)\nOne of the most important parts of Hemsworth's role in replacing Henry Cavill will be how well he handles the action sequences. Geralt's fight with the half-elf, Schirrú, represents a good early opportunity for Hemsworth to show that he is up to the task. Shirrú is one of Vilgefortz's (Mahesh Jadu) hired assassins sent to kill Geralt after Yennefer (Anya Chalotra) reveals his location under torture. If The Witcher season 4 can save the show, this fight against Shirrú can play a big part in that. It may end up being brief, but it's one of the earliest book moments for Hemsworth to demonstrate his swordsmanship in.\nIn The Witcher novels, Cahir (Eamon Farren) begins shadowing Geralt's group after Emperor Emhyr (Bart Edwards) order his execution for failing to capture Ciri (Freya Allan). Geralt saves his life when they stumble onto him in the woods, but he refuses Cahir's help in the search for Ciri. Eventually, after the two are stranded together following Cahir's injury from Schirrú, Geralt accepts Cahir's help and his honest intentions concerning Ciri. This is a heartwarming moment in the books that could provide a good way for Hemsworth to display emotion and compassion, and possibly, ingratiate himself to fans.\nThe Witcher season 3's Cahir twist seems to have started this process early, so it's possible that Geralt's acceptance of Cahir will come earlier than it does in the books. That might be a good thing though since it is a valuable opportunity for Hemsworth to display his emotional range as an actor. This is also a significant moment in the story because, for a time, Geralt wants to refuse everyone's help in the search for Ciri, so the fact that he is willing to accept help here represents a big moment of personal growth for The Witcher's main character.\nGeralt being knighted by Queen Meve (Rebecca Hanssen) of Lyria and Rivia after the Battle for the Bridge is a big moment because it gives Geralt a right to use the title, \"Of Rivia\", which until this moment, he had simply used to make him sound more trustworthy. This is another great opportunity for Hemsworth to show off his acting range as he tries to capture Geralt's mixture of bemusement and pride at being knighted. Geralt has always been scornful of knights up to this moment, but he feels some sort of honor in being recognized by a monarch, leading to an emotionally nuanced moment for Hemsworth to execute.\nThe Battle for the Bridge is an epic confrontation in which Liam Hemsworth's Geralt can show why he is one of the characters who could beat Vilgefortz in the future. Geralt and his company end up getting entangled in this fight when the ferry they are traveling on is trapped between a Nilfgaardian army and an army of Lyrian and Rivian resistance. This conflict comes to a head when Geralt and his friends are forced to depart their ferry and choose a side or risk being killed in the crossfire.\nNaturally, they choose not to fight with the Nilfgaardians, instead choosing to aid the Lyrians and Rivians in their attempt to gain control of a critical bridge that crosses the mighty Yaruga River. Geralt fights with uncontrolled rage, running along the edge of the bridge and cutting down anyone in range. Geralt turns the tide of this battle almost single-handedly, as the close quarters on the bridge force the Nilfgaardians to challenge him one at a time, leaving them with no chance of defeating the magically mutated witcher. Hemsworth can use this moment to prove his swordsmanship is worthy of succeeding Cavill.\nGeralt's final confrontation with Vilgefortz is one of the most epic moments in the entire Witcher book series. This is an absolutely critical moment for Hemsworth's Geralt to nail, but if he does, he can change the narrative around his replacement of Henry Cavill. Geralt fights Vilgefortz for the second time with the help of a protective amulet he receives from Fringilla Vigo (Mimi Ndiweni). The duel happens in Stygga Castle after Geralt overhears that Vilgefortz is hiding out there. This is the biggest opportunity for Hemsworth to prove his worth in the role of Geralt of Rivia.\nRelated: This Witcher Book Character Will Fix The Show's Villain Problem In Season 4\nGeralt will eventually befriend a highly intelligent higher vampire named Regis, whom Geralt has lots of interesting philosophical discussions with. These conversations can allow Hemsworth to display the intelligent side of Geralt that loves to debate intellectual topics. This side of the character has largely been absent from Netflix's adaptation of the series, but Hemsworth can bring this side of Geralt into the show and improve the character as a whole while potentially winning over fans in the process.\nAnother moment with Geralt and Regis that Hemsworth can take advantage of to win over fans is their rescue of an innocent woman being accused of witchcraft. Geralt and Regis manage to outwit the man trying to have her executed, ultimately using Regis' vampire abilities to complete a trial that is invented to be impossible. This is the type of noble deed that makes fans like Geralt in the first place, so Hemsworth needs to take advantage of it and win over fans by showing his ability to portray Geralt's altruistic side.\nOne of the final opportunities Hemsworth will have to win over Witcher fans will be in the Rivian pogrom that takes place at the end of The Lady of the Lake. Geralt nearly dies trying to protect his dwarven friends from the rioting humans, proving again that he is a caring friend who is willing to die for others. Hemsworth needs to depict Geralt's desperation in the face a charging mob without losing his characteristic bravery. This will be a final moment of desperate altruism as Geralt does his best to defend his friends and stop the killing.\n"}
{"title": "1 Far Side Comic Is Hiding a Surprisingly Dark Joke About Charlie Brown", "date": "2023-10-04 23:31:44", "text": "One Far Side strip imagined a universe where all the newspaper comic strips are real - and Charlie Brown has a much darker side than anyone realized.\nGary Larson's The Far Side was a longtime hit in the newspapers – and one installment of the strip suggested it kept its place there through underhanded means. The comic employed dark humor and morbid surrealism over the course of its original 16-year run, and wasn't afraid to tease its neighbors in the funny pages.\nThe \"Far Side's Spy Center\" strip is on the surface a seemingly lighthearted bit, a wall of television screens depicting other cartoon characters, being watched by Far Side regulars: two stereotypical Larson-style humans, a snake, and a cow.\nIt is only as the reader takes a closer look at the TV screens that this Far Side panel reveals its darkest joke: Charlie Brown, threatening to put down Snoopy.\nRelated: Far Side's Most Confusing Comic Has an Incredibly Simple Explanation\nAll the references in this Far Side strip can be hard to catch, but eagle-eyed readers can depict references including Bloom County's Opus realizing he's being watched, and Hobbes about to attack Calvin. Gary Larson himself is apparently under observation as well, appearing in the top right-hand corner of the frame. In the center of the frame, however, good ol' Charlie Brown is threatening to have Snoopy put down. It is a particularly dark joke, which works because it is the diametric opposite of Charles Schulz's Peanuts. The Far Side, no stranger to controversy, made several Peanuts references throughout its run, in typical dark, and bizarre Far Side fashion.\nAnother stand-out Peanuts reference in The Far Side, similarly a dark reference to Snoopy's demise, plays on his iconic \"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\" stories. A fighter pilot stands next to his plane, with his kills painted on the side – including the silhouette of a familiar scarf-wearing dog, on top of a familiar dog house. Additionally, Peanuts character, Lucy Van Pelt, was the subject of her own Far Side joke, this one featuring a group of anthropologists instead come across ancient art, depicting Lucy as drawn by Charles Schulz. At the time of its printing, Peanuts had been running for about 30 years, making this an off-brand homage to the comic's longevity.\nGary Larson often used parody in The Far Side, and it is clear that his references to Peanuts and other comic strips resulted from a love of the medium; being lampooned in a Far Side strip was an honor, not an insult. \"Far Side's Spy Center\" is one of Larson's most visually ambitious strips, as he often favored minimalism in his cartoons. Here, the caption is minimalized, but the references to other comic strips speak volumes, both about Larson's own humor, and what he thought of the humor of his contemporaries. Charles Schulz was without a doubt a major influence on Larson's The Far Side, who in turn paid homage in his own particular style.\nAs far back as she can remember, Casey Connor always wanted to be a Goodfeather writer.

Action movies are some of the most common films out there, and consequently, there is a huge variability in the quality of action films that any streaming service holds. Prime Video, specifically, has a massive selection of action flicks, but not all of them can live up to the standards of its best 10.\nSome of Prime Video's best current movies come from the action genre, though to be fair, some of its worst probably come from the action genre as well. It's particularly easy in action movies to focus solely on spectacle and let the narrative and acting go by the wayside, which leads to some really poor flicks. Luckily, Prime Video is well stocked with movies that manage to avoid that mistake, especially in the case of these 10 outstanding action movies.\nRelated: 10 Best Crime Movies On Netflix\nTop Gun: Maverick is one of the six movies to make $1 billion at the box office since 2020, proving that this sequel film is well worth a watch. Top Gun: Maverick was acclaimed by critics who called it a big step from the first film and praised its striking visuals and audio. The film is probably one of Tom Cruise's best, and the addition of Myles Teller only adds to the quality of the cast. Top Gun: Maverick was tellingly nominated for six Academy Awards, proving that the production of this movie is of the highest quality.\nGuy Ritchie's The Covenant stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim, telling the story of a US Army Green Beret sergeant named John Kinley (Gyllenhaal) and his Afghan interpreter, Ahmed (Salim). Kinley and Ahmed are ambushed by Taliban forces during the War in Afghanistan, starting the film off on an action-packed note. The Covenant received positive reviews from critics and did fairly well at the box office during its limited theatrical release. This is easily one of the best action movies currently on Prime Video, especially for fans of military films.\nAlthough Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves bombed at the box office, it's still a great action movie that's available to stream on Prime Video. Honor Among Thieves received positive reviews from critics despite its poor box office performance, and now that it's on Prime Video, the film's streaming numbers can help recover what was lost at the box office. This film has a lovable blend of humor and dramatic storytelling, interspersed with engaging action sequences and memorable characters, making it well worth a watch for Prime Video subscribers.\nThe Batman, starring Robert Pattinson as the title character, is another worthy addition in the long line of Batman movies. This riveting action filmed was widely acclaimed by critics and performed strongly at the box office, bringing in around $770 million worldwide. The Batman is driven by strong performances from the cast and expertly crafted visuals. The film's dark camera lenses give it an ominous feel that contributes to the film's dark overall feel. The Batman is perfect for superhero fans, and a quality movie for any general action movie fan as well.\nRelated: 10 Best TV Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now\nThe Bourne Identity, the first film in Matt Damon's Bourne trilogy, is one of the best action movies Prime Video carries.

{"title": "In Transformers' New Continuity, The Decepticons Won", "date": "2023-10-05 00:00:47", "text": "The recently-released Void Rivals #4 has revealed that the Decepticons are in control of Cybertron, and the ramifications will be massive.\nWarning: Contains SPOILERS for Void Rivals #4!\nSkybound’s new Transformers series is set to debut in October 2023, but the publisher has already revealed that Optimus Prime’s Autobots will have their backs to the wall in the Energon Universe. Appearing in Void Rivals #4, the Decepticon Shockwave is left in control of Cybertron, suggesting that the Decepticons won the Cybertronian war millennia ago.\nSkybound shocked the world when they revealed they had acquired the Transformers license with the surprise appearance of Jetfire in Void Rivals #1, and now they’ve provided a shock of a different kind with the latest Transformer to appear in the Energon Universe. The appearance of Shockwave in Void Rivals #4 by Robert Kirkman, Lorenzo de Felici, Matheus Lopes and Rus Wooten is a major revelation, not least because the Decepticon warrior’s appearance confirms that the Decepticons have won the war.\nShockwave appears on Cybertron as a Skuxxoid bounty hunter attempts to sell off a bounty to the Decepticons. Shockwave turns the Skuxxoid away, saying they don’t have the resources on Cybertron to keep themselves running full-time, let alone to pay for any bounties.\nThe Decepticons ruling Cybertron following some failure on the part of Optimus Prime is something that’s been hinted at since the Energon Universe was first announced, so getting confirmation of that story point is a huge reveal and should amp up the stakes for the coming Transformers series by writer/artist Daniel Warren Johnson and colorist Mike Spicer. The set-up is reminiscent of the original G1 Transformers cartoon, which features a band of Autobots and Decepticons stranded on Earth following the great Cybertronian war.\nAt that point, Shockwave was left in control of the remaining Decepticons on Cybertron while Megatron followed after Optimus Prime to search the universe for more Energon. It further hammers home how Skybound is pulling heavily from Transformers’ G1 era, and it’s not a bad direction for the franchise to take. Having Optimus Prime and his Autobots reeling from losing the Cybertronian war makes for a great starting point for the new series, as they now must overcome insurmountable odds by standing up to the triumphant Decepticons once more.\nWhere the Energon Universe era goes from here is anyone’s guess, but Skybound has certainly given fans plenty to be excited about. By aligning fellow Hasbro property G.I. Joe more closely to the world of the Transformers than ever before, the creators have found a way to relaunch both properties in a way that’s generated unprecedented levels of excitement for both franchises.\nVoid Rivals #4 is on sale now, and Transformers #1 is on sale October 4th, both from Skybound Entertainment.\n"}

During the Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike, The Drew Barrymore Show came under fire for deciding to resume production without its WGA writers. Following extensive criticism and backlash, Barrymore made the decision to not resume the show until the strike ended, only for it to conclude a week later.\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, White, Kinon, and Koe turned down an offer to return to the show, which is slated to return on October 16 for season 4. The Drew Barrymore Show is now interviewing and seeking new writers under the new WGA guidelines.\nWhite, Kinon, and Koe choosing not to return to The Drew Barrymore Show marks the beginning of a change in Hollywood following the end of the WGA strike. With the WGA holding out for 148 days, the writers stood firm until they received a new deal that guaranteed fair pay, better working conditions, and restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence. Even though the strike has ended, the WGA and its members are continuing to fight for what they deserve.\nRelated: Writers' Strike Deal Explained: 8 Biggest Points & Agreements Confirmed\nWhen the talk show planned to return without its WGA writers, it sent a clear message that the writers' work was not valued. They understandably do not want to return to a production that does not fully value them or their work. White, Kinon, and Koe are setting a powerful example, showing that television and film writers do not need to settle, and they deserve productions that value them. The new WGA guidelines that they fought for tirelessly over the course of 148 days not only offers protections and better compensation, but has also set a new precedent across the industry.\nWhen the SAG-AFTRA strike ultimately ends, there will likely also be a shift among actors, with there being less tolerance in the industry for productions where the work of writers and actors are not fairly valued. As for The Drew Barrymore Show, the talk show is unlikely to have a smooth return given their initial decision to return without their WGA writers. Drew Barrymore couldn't have known when the strike would end, but the decision to resume during the WGA strike feels even more unwise and short-sighted given how soon the strike ended after the initial announcement.\nSource: THR\n"}

The streaming platform has a large library of films, both new and old, and many of them chronicle blossoming relationships and rekindled romances. Whether they're modern classics or newer releases, these movies are sure to evoke some major emotions. As for which feelings they'll conjure, it depends on the type of romance film in question.\nAmazon's got something for everyone, whether it's an entertaining rom-com, like The Wedding Singer, or a more dramatic tale of love, like Chemical Hearts. The streamer's offerings run the gamut, showcasing a variety of different relationships. Some will have viewers cheering the main characters on, while others will leave them with tears running down heir cheeks. If one thing's certain, it's that all of these romance movies will hook the Prime Video subscriber watching them from start to finish.\nRELATED: 10 Of The Most Romantic Movies Ever Made, According To Reddit\nBased on Casey McQuiston's best-selling book of the same name, Red, White & Royal Blue is a newer addition to Amazon's lineup of romance movies. The Prime Video exclusive follows Alex Claremont-Diaz (Taylor Zakhar Perez), the son of the current U.S. president, and Prince Henry (Nicholas Galitzine) of Britain as they begin a secret romance. The politics of their relationship force them to keep things under wraps, but that proves much easier said than done. When their roles threaten to tear them apart, Alex and Henry must choose between people's expectations and each other. Despite all the high-stakes drama, Red, White & Royal Blue is a breezy and fun romance.\nAnother movie based on a best-selling romance novel — this time from author Sally Thorne — The Hating Game is currently available to rent or purchase on Prime Video. And it's well worth the investment. Following corporate rivals Lucy Hutton (Lucy Hale) and Joshua Templeton (Austin Stowell), The Hating Game is the perfect watch for anyone who enjoys a good hate-to-love relationship. As two assistants at the same publishing company, Lucy and Joshua are constantly attempting to outdo one another. However, their intense office rivalry evolves into a steamy attraction. It's one that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats for the movie's full runtime.\nDirected by Eugene Ashe, the 2020 romance movie Sylvie's Love is among the most compelling currently streaming on Prime Video — and it's the perfect option for anyone who enjoys a good period piece. Opening in 1950s Harlem, the film follows the titular Sylvie (Tessa Thompson) as she falls for a saxophone player named Robert Halloway (Nnamdi Asomugha). The pair embark on a whirldwind romance that will sweep viewers up with it. Even after the pair separates for years, their feelings remain strong as ever. This second-chance romance is bound to tug on viewers heartstrings, especially with the standout performances from Thompson and Asomugha.\nRELATED: 10 Films To Watch If You Liked Prime Video's Sylvie's Love\n2022's Bros is another LGBTQ+ romance movie streaming on Prime Video, and Bros truly deserves to be a hit despite its box office flop. Directed by Nicholas Stoller, the movie follows Bobby (Billy Eichner) and Aaron (Luke Macfarlane) as they reluctantly develop feelings for one another — a development that threatens their beloved \"freedom.\" So begins a comical narrative that sees them dealing with their commitment issues, all while an eclectic soundtrack plays and numerous A-listers cameo. Bros is an all-around fun time, and its ending is equal parts realistic and satisfying.\nThose looking for more of Lili Reinhart after Riverdale's series finale should check out Chemical Hearts on Prime Video — though no one should go into this particular romance movie looking for a cookie-cutter happy ending. The film sees Reinhart starring opposite Austin Abrams. The two play Grace Town and Henry Page, and their teenage characters fall head over heels for one another. Unfortunately, like most high school romances, things don't play out as expected. Chemical Hearts showcases stellar performances from both its leads, along with a number of scenes that will leave viewers misty-eyed before the movie is through.\nThose looking for a more fantastical story can relive the hype of 2008's Twilight, a supernatural romance based on Stephenie Meyer's book of the same name. Most people have heard of Twilight by now, but the film follows vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) as he develops feelings for the new girl in town, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart). Cheesy and occasionally funny without meaning to be, Twilight is by no means a masterpiece within the romance genre. However, it's fun and delivers on the intense feelings of its leads. There's a reason the movie became so popular, spawning multiple sequels and building a fanbase that still exists over a decade later.\nThose searching for a lighthearted romance movie on Prime Video should look no further than 2022's Ticket to Paradise, which combines an A+ cast and a stunning setting to stellar effect. Starring George Clooney and Julia Roberts — and yes, that duo is enough reason to check this out — the film follows two divorced parents as they travel to Bali to stop their daughter from making a huge mistake in the name of love. Naturally, this stirs up all kinds of feelings between the two characters, delivering a second-chance romance that will leave even the most hard-hearted viewer in their feelings by Ticket to Paradise's ending.\nA movie that's a bit heavier than the standard rom-com, 2023's Somebody I Used to Know is still worth the watch, if only for Alison Brie's and Jay Ellis' performances. They play Ally and Sean, two exes who have seemingly moved on from one another — though that's quickly called into question when Ally returns to her hometown and they reunite. The fact that Sean is engaged complicates matters, raising all kinds of difficult questions for Ally. These don't lead where viewers might expect, with Somebody I Used to Know turning some of the genre's most problematic tropes on their heads in favor of a more modern and surprising conclusion.\nThe oldest romance movie on this list, Four Weddings and a Funeral holds up as a solid viewing experience nearly three decades after its debut. Streaming on Prime Video, the film follows the English Charles (Hugh Grant) as he courts an American named Carrie (Andie MacDowell), who he continues to run into at weddings and eventually a funeral. The performances from Grant and MacDowell are enough reason to give this a watch, but the movie's focus on fate is also a compelling one that will leave viewers feeling uplifted.\nThe Wedding Singer is a classic rom-com movie, and it's among the most well-known ones streaming on Amazon Prime Video. Starring Adam Sandler as Robbie Hart and Drew Barrymore as Julia Sullivan, this movie is worth watching for its star power alone. Of course, the fun plot, which sees Robbie and Julia realizing they're engaged to the wrong people — conveniently at the same time they meet one another — adds to the viewing experience. The Wedding Singer is one of those romance movies that remains entertaining no matters how many times viewers have seen it. Perhaps that's why its popularity has lasted for so many years.\nAmanda Mullen is an entertainment writer with a passion for all things books, films, and television.

Nicole noticed that he was tall.

He continued, \"I traveled the lands near and far, making headlines with fellow adventurers and idols.\" He then appeared on a beach, during which a wind once again blew him away, along with a beach umbrella. The Masked Singer season 10 contestant went on to say, \"It was bliss,\" as the camera zoomed in on a picnic basket, a Chicago deep dish pizza, and two yellow and black cans of \"Masked Soda\" in the sand.\nAfter that, S'More stood next to a Christmas tree in the woods decorated with silver ornaments, saying, \"And when I finished with my travels, I hung up my cape.\" A gold ornament of an angel was then shown at the top of the Christmas tree. S'More added, \"I thought it was the end of the road, but I was still hungry for a new journey. So that's why I'm here to conquer the Masked Singer stage. This S'More's gonna make you melt.\"\nAfter S'More's performance, another clue was revealed to help figure out his identity. It was a shiny silver film reel that said, \"Starring S'More.\" S'More explained, \"As you can tell, I'm very talented on and off stage.\" This lead to Nicole to theorize that S'More might not only be a singer, but maybe an actor too.\nRelated: All 16 Masked Singer Season 10 Costumes Revealed\nFor S'More's second performance on NFL Night, he sang and danced to a rousing rendition of \"Moves Like Jagger\" by Maroon 5. In his second clue package, he began by saying, \"Last week, I burst forth with bravado, and I'm thrilled to have made it to NFL Night.\" S'More then shared how he got started in show business, stating, \"I was born for the fearless life in the spotlight, but my father was afraid to lose his son to the fantastical world of fame.\" S'More said this while he was on a theater stage. He was then shown standing in front of a bubbling cauldron.\nS'More went on to say, \"While I was still in high school, a huge opportunity to work with an industry legend came my way.\" A television set with an M on it was then shown. S'More then looked at a picture of his father, an older S'More, saying, \"But when my dad found out, he told me to turn down the gig. I made the hard decision to move out.\"\nS'More was next seen taking a bow on stage. He said, \"Years down the road, I conquered the Broadway stage, a lifelong goal.\" There was then a Masked Singer game console with a video game controller on the screen. S'More shared, \"There was no way it could get any better, until one night after curtain call, I saw my dad backstage. Hearing him say he was proud of me was really the biggest win I could ask for. So dad, this one's for you.\" \nAfter S'More's performance, he moonwalked on the stage. Then, NFL player DeSean Jackson brought out a clue. It was a bucket full of oranges. S'More explained, \"I've tasted victory before, and it's so sweet. I hope to do so again here at The Masked Singer!\"\nThe Masked Singer season 10 panelists offered some interesting first guesses for S'More's identity. Nicole commented that the first thing that popped out to her was \"step by step.\" She pointed out that they've had members of boy bands such as *NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, and 98 Degrees, and now they were due for a member of the New Kids on the Block, who have a hit song called \"Step By Step.\" Because of this, Nicole guessed that S'More could be Joey McIntyre.\nJenny focused on S'More's instant rise to fame, and guessed Justin Guarini, who was the runner-up to Kelly Clarkson American Idol season 1. S'More's mustache and goatee reminded Robin of Kevin Richardson from the Backstreet Boys. On NFL Night, the panelists continued to focus on boy bands from Florida because of the oranges clue. Nicole guessed JC Chasez from *NSYNC, who originated in Orlando. Robin stuck with his guess of Kevin because Kevin was on Broadway in Chicago. He also thought the game console could refer to the Backstreet Boys' song, \"Quit Playing Games (With My Heart).\" However, Ken thought that S'More could be actor Simu Liu.\nAlthough these guesses make sense, another possibility for S'More's identity could be Ashley Parker Angel, who was a member of O-Town, the group that was formed on MTV's reality television series, Making the Band. The M on the television set might refer to MTV. In addition, the O in O-Town stands for Orlando, which could be represented by the oranges. O-Town was the first group to be signed by Clive Davis to his record label, J Records, so he could be the industry legend S'More was referencing.\nThe angel clue could refer to Ashley's last name. The pizza clue could reference his appearance in the film, Pizza Man. Ashley has appeared on Broadway in Hairspray and Wicked. The cauldron clue could be a reference to Wicked.\nS'More is definitely still melting hearts with his soulful singing and smooth persona. There will certainly be many more clues about his identity because he made it through to the next round of the competition. Whoever S'More turns out to be, the competition is heating up because of his sweet and sizzling vocals.\nThe Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EDT on FOX.\n"}

Although many fans on social media have been guessing that Gazelle is Carrie Underwood, the clue about her crashing and burning during a national talent competition seems to have ruled her out, since Carrie won American Idol season 4.\nDuring NFL Night, Jenny used the villain clue to guess Gossip Girl's Leighton Meester. However, Ken thought she might be Constance Wu. He got choked up when he made the guess because Constance is a dear friend of his, and Gazelle's voice moved him.

Find out the clues about the singer, and who might be hiding behind the mask.\nThe Masked Singer season 10 features 16 mystery celebrity singers, and Cow is one of them, with many clues to the bovine singer's identity. The reality competition series welcomes back host Nick Cannon, along with panelists Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, and Nicole Scherzinger. In one of the biggest unmaskings in the show's history, Demi Lovato was revealed to be Anonymouse during The Masked Singer season 10 premiere.\nThe Masked Singer season 10 had five contestants in the first Group A competition episode: Cow, S'More, Gazelle, Diver, and Rubber Ducky. Rubber Ducky was eliminated and revealed to be Anthony Anderson. On NFL Night, he was replaced by a Wild Card, Pickle. Future competitors include Anteater, Candelabra, Cuddle Monster, Donut, Hawk, Hibiscus, Husky, Royal Hen, Sea Monster, and Tiki. Here are the clues and identity guesses for Cow.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nAlthough Cow looks like a woman, dressed like a 1950s diner waitress, complete with an apron and red glasses, his voice indicates that he's most likely actually a man. Cow sang a powerful version of \"Bones\" by Imagine Dragons, and commanded the stage through his entire performance. His voice has incredible range, as it soared on the high notes. Cow danced during his performance, getting the crowd going.\nCow's clue package began in black and white in a kitchen. He said, \"Cows like me don't often make it out of their pen. When I was younger, I felt destined to stay home and live out a simple life in black and white.\" The camera then zoomed in on a package that read, \"All New! Two-Step Coffee. Step 1: Add coffee. Step 2: Add sugar.\" Cow continued, \"But I always knew I wanted to stand out. I had big dreams of being a big star, but I used to have a little trouble handling my emotions, until I discovered I could write, and leave whatever I was feeling on the page.\"\nThe camera then panned across a shelf that had some books, and a calendar turned to July 4. Cow pulled out a book with the title, \"Classic Culinary Cuisine for Cows,\" and turned to a page with a recipe for \"Classic Cow Cake.\" The ingredients were \"flour, sugar, milk, eggs, butter, vanilla, baking powder, and heavy cream.\" The scene then turned to color as The Masked Singer season 10 contestant announced, \"After that, everything changed. The gift eventually led me to number one.\"\nCow began to dance around the kitchen gathering ingredients for a cake. The retro pink refrigerator had a magnet that said, \"Welcome to fantastic Las Vegas.\" Cow continued, \"I won Grammys, traveled the world. I made hit after hit after hit. I guess you could say, I was kinda my own cash cow. Anyway, I was always meant to live my life in color, and I'm bringing that same energy to the stage because you're about to see there's no one like me.\" Cow then pulled a strawberry cake out of the oven, with pilot's wings as a decoration on the top.\nAfter Cow's performance, another clue was revealed about him. The clue was a container of popcorn with a movie ticket that read, \"Blockbuster Movie.\" Cow explained, \"One of the better things known about me all started with a moooo-vie.\"\nRelated: The Masked Singer: S’More Identity Prediction & Clues\nFor NFL Night, Cow sang a rousing rendition of Bruno Mars' \"Treasure,\" singing and dancing. Cow's clue package began with him saying, \"Last week was utterly fantastic, and I'm excited to make it this far with the cream of the crop.\" Cow revealed some information about his family, saying, \"Tonight I'm honored to be part of NFL Night, even though I don't have many memories of watching the big game with my dad. He wasn't really around, and I didn't have a lot of positive male role models growing up.\" The camera then panned to a pair of red boxing gloves with a gold down arrow on one of them.\nCow continued, \"I was raised in a house of all women, who made me the sensitive Cow that I am.\" Cow then looked at a picture of himself as a child, posing with a grown-up Cow wearing a hat that resembles Mickey Mouse's Sorcerer's Apprentice hat. Cow also revealed that he's a father. He said, \"Now, as a parent, I know the value of being present for my children. I've always achieved a lot of success in my life, but my greatest accomplishment has always been my kids.\"\nCow was shown with three young cows. There was a piece of paper with a red heart drawn in crayon, along with crayons scattered on the paper. He shared, \"It's so easy to get overwhelmed by the smoke and mirrors of fame, but I told myself early on that I am a family cow first. So when I get on that stage, I'll be thinking of them and treasuring every single moment.\"\nAfter Cow's performance, The Masked Singer season 8 contestant Le'Veon Bell (Milkshake), brought out another clue. It was a pair of black tap shoes, carried out in a giant purple bowl with a gold star on it. Cow explained, \"Much like a Super Bowl Half Time show, I am known for my killer moooo-ves.\" He then showed off some of his dance moves.\nRelated: The Masked Singer: Gazelle Identity Prediction & Clues\nAfter Cow's first performance, Jenny guessed Shawn Stockman from Boyz II Men because he has a biopic coming out, and the group has had a Las Vegas residency and won a lot of Grammys. However, Nicole didn't agree. Jenny was also thinking of Usher. Nicole put the clues together to guess Leslie Odom Jr. because of the July 4 clue that might be a Hamilton reference. Robin said that whoever Cow was, they were definitely a pro, and had been on stage their whole life.\nOn NFL Night, the panelists guessed many different R&B singers for Cow's identity. Nicole mentioned Usher, while Robin guessed Trey Songz, and Ne-Yo. Jenny wondered if Cow could be Mario, but he doesn't have kids. She then guessed Nelly, but Nicole didn't know if Nelly could sing like that. She then said Cow could be Jason Derulo, who can sing, dance, and has a child. Nick mentioned that clearly the Cow knows him because he kept picking on him.\nCow is a seasoned performer, who will have many more clues revealed about him because he made it through to the next round, which is 2000s Night. He's sure to deliver more exciting performances in the weeks to come. As a Masked Singer preview stated, Cow is legen-dairy.\nThe Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EDT on FOX.\n"}
{"title": "The Masked Singer: Diver Identity & Clues", "date": "2023-10-05 01:20:26", "text": "The Masked Singer season 10's Diver is one of the 16 contestants singing in mystery celebrity competition, and there are many clues to his identity.\nThe Masked Singer season 10 features 16 mystery celebrity singers, and Diver is one of the contestants who has many clues to his identity. The Masked Singer season 10 again features host Nick Cannon and panelists Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, and Nicole Scherzinger. During the season premiere, Demi Lovato was revealed to be Anonymouse, which was one of the biggest unmaskings in the show's history.\nThe Masked Singer season 10 features some fantastic costumes including Diver, Gazelle, S'More, Rubber Ducky, and Cow, who competed in the first competition episode. Rubber Ducky was revealed to be Anthony Anderson. He was replaced by the Wild Card contestant, Pickle, on NFL Night. Also singing in the show's milestone season will be Anteater, Candelabra, Cuddle Monster, Donut, Hawk, Hibiscus, Husky, Royal Hen, Sea Monster, and Tiki. Here are the clues and identity guesses for Diver.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nDuring The Masked Singer season 10 premiere, Diver gave a clue about himself stating, \"Usually I'm pretty pumped, but lately I've been lost in the abyss. I might be the most hated creature in the ocean right now. Usually you can find me under the sea, but, for this clue, you'll have to look to the sky.\" The clue was a picture of a cardinal.\nWhen Diver came out on stage to perform, Robin commented that he was tall. Diver sang a rousing rendition of \"Any Way You Want It\" by Journey, with much of the song being sung in a high pitch. His clue package began with him stating, \"Diving into a completely different persona feels like a nice escape.\" Diver then held up a newspaper called The Masked Singer Post with a headline that read, \"Extra! Extra! Read All About It!\"\nDiver confessed, \"I've been everyone's favorite person to hate, and, to be honest, I get it.\" An hourglass with sand pouring out of the bottom then appeared on the screen. He continued, \"I'm the first to admit, I've made mistakes. But, honestly, I did it for love.\" Diver went on to admit, \"It hurts when I get judged by people who never even met me, and I become a scapegoat for every bad dude they've ever known.\" A knight's shiny armor was then shown on the screen.\nDiver then shared, \"But I'm hoping all that will melt away when I hit the stage. Getting to share my voice without the preconceived notion of who I am is really what I need right now.\" Diver then held a compass that pointed to the Midwest. \"So tonight, I'm really getting my head in the game because I'm not ready to go back to the real world just yet.\"\nAfter Diver's performance, another clue was revealed. It was a magazine cover that said, \"Masked Money Money Money.\" The headlines read, \"Diver Opens Another Business!\" and \"11 Million Eyes on Diver!\" Diver explained, \"The more people talk about my business, the more I want 'em out of it.\"\nRelated: How The Masked Singer Season 10’s Anonymouse’s Clues Related To Demi Lovato\nOn NFL Night, Diver sang \"I Ain't Worried\" by OneRepublic. He once again showcased his high vocal register, and also performed a full dance routine. He interacted with the audience, and really got the crowd going. In Diver's clue package, he shared, \"Making my debut as the Diver last week was so rewarding. It felt great to get all the love from the panel and audience: something, as you know, I haven't gotten much of lately.\"\nDiver went on to reveal, \"As a kid, I always wanted to be famous. I modeled, I acted, and, of course, sang. I was always waiting to become a household name. I just didn't know it would be for everyone hating me.\" Diver was then shown watching his Masked Singer performance on a screen.\nDiver continued, \"But I'm here to show the world that I'm more than my mistakes. Being here already feels like a healing experience.\" A pair of red high heel pumps then floated across the screen. Diver said, \"Getting to share my talent, instead of my drama, is exactly what I've needed.\" He declared, \"So, tonight, I'm gonna keep my eye on the ball 'cause I am not ready to take off this mask.\"\nAfter Diver's performance, a superfan in the audience revealed another clue about Diver. He had a black club painted on his chest. Diver explained, \"I'm well-suited for the club. I know how to get the club going! What's up!\"\nAfter Diver's first performance, the panelists had some very varied ideas about who he might be. Nicole guessed that he might be Adam Levine, while Ken declared that Diver could only be Tom Sandoval. Fans on social media agree with his guess. Jenny believed that Diver might be Scott Disick. Based on the clues, Diver seems to be someone from the Midwest, possibly St. Louis, Missouri, because of the cardinal, which is the city's major league baseball team.\nOn NFL Night, Nicole guessed that Diver might be Pete Davidson, while Ken continued to insist that Diver was Tom Sandoval. Robin thought Diver might be Pauly D from Jersey Shore. For their final guesses, Robin stuck with Pauly D, and Nicole agreed with him. However, Ken had his second correct guess of the season, with Jenny agreeing. Diver ended up being Tom Sandoval.\nTom's clues led to Vanderpump Rules, including the premiere night \"pumped\" clue and the red high heel pumps. Tom is from St. Louis, which is why there was a cardinal and Midwest clue. Tom is a singer, who is currently in a band called Tom Sandoval & The Most Extras, which explains the \"Extra! Extra! Read All About It\" clue, in addition to him making headlines.\nAll of the clues about being hated refer to Scandoval, in which Tom was revealed to have been cheating on his girlfriend of nine years, Ariana Madix, with one of Ariana's best friends, Raquel Leviss. Because of Scandoval, Vanderpump Rules season 10 had 11.4 viewers, which explains the number in his premiere night clue.\nPerhaps The Masked Singer can be Tom's redemption story, as he proved that there's more to him than his mistakes. With his impressive vocals and energetic dance moves, he showed off his talents. However, a deep dive into Tom's past may cause some to feel that he has a lot to make up for after cheating on Ariana. Fans will see more of him as he currently stars on Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test season 2. Whatever happens next, as Diver, Tom dove headfirst into The Masked Singer season 10 and gave fans two fun and impressive performances.\nThe Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EDT on FOX.\n"}
{"title": "Jamie Lee Curtis' One Piece Season 2 Casting Talks Will Happen, Insists Showrunner", "date": "2023-10-05 01:28:21", "text": "One Piece showrunner Matt Owens offers a positive update for Jamie Lee Curtis' campaign to play the character Kureha in season 2 of the show.\nOne Piece showrunner Matt Owens has offered a positive update on Jamie Lee Curtis' campaign to play Kureha in season 2. Kureha first appears in the manga's Drum Island Arc as a reclusive doctor the Straw Hats go to in order to help a sick Nami. Curtis will campaign to play Kureha after the Hollywood actors strike is over, as she herself is a fan of the franchise and wants to be involved in its live-action adaptation.\nSpeaking with Deadline, Owens revealed the team behind One Piece season 2 wants Curtis to portray Kureha. He revealed that, while the actors strike is preventing any negotiations from happening right now, there are plans to talk with Curtis about having a role in the show. Check out what Owens had to say below:\nWe have opportunities to stunt cast some roles, some rules that are very important, and it came out that Jamie Lee Curtis is a One Piece fan. As soon as she said that, we were like, okay, we have to try and get her on the show. What can we do? And Doctor Kureha, very luckily, is a character who is coming up in our story, and is someone who is perfect for Jamie Lee Curtis.\nSo we tried to start manifesting this dream of ours. After she won her Oscar, the writers room sent her a figure of Doctor Kureha with a nice note that said, 'Congratulations on your statue, here’s another one to put next to it. Hope to speak to you soon.'\nWhen she reposted that, it got a lot of fan interest, and I commented on it. We’re trying to manifest it. Yes, as of right now, SAG is still striking so there have not been real conversations. But as soon as there can be, I’m ready. I will take her out to dinner, we’ll talk about it. We’ll do all of it because at this point we’re writing for her — we really, really want her to come and play with us in Season 2.\nCurtis announced she wanted to play Kureha in late September, reposting fan art of herself as the doctor in her signature outfit. Since both Curtis and Owens are interested in her hopping aboard for season 2, it wouldn't be surprising if she's cast soon after the actors strike ends. Not only would this reveal how far the story of One Piece season 2 will take the Straw Hats, but it would also guarantee a fitting actor for the role of Kureha.\nBeyond saving Nami, Kureha also introduces the crew to Chopper, a mysterious reindeer who can turn himself into different forms after eating a Devil Fruit. Chopper is trained in medicine just as much as Kureha, prompting Luffy to ask him to join the Straw Hats as their doctor. Because of this, Kureha plays a significant role in the story beyond her primary purpose, making an acclaimed actor like Curtis the perfect casting choice.\nThe fact that Curtis may join the One Piece live-action cast in season 2 also reveals the next season will cover at least up through the Drum Island Arc of the Arabasta Saga. However, since the season will likely focus on the Straw Hats' journey to Arabasta like in the manga, the show may go beyond Drum Island. However much of the manga the next season covers, it appears Curtis will be part of bringing it into live-action form.\nSource: Deadline\n"}
{"title": "All 3 One Chicago Shows Re-Open Writers Rooms Following WGA Strike Ending", "date": "2023-10-05 02:32:23", "text": "All three One Chicago shows - Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D., and Chicago Med - re-open their writers' rooms following the WGA strike's conclusion.\nAll three shows within the One Chicago franchise have officially re-opened their writers' rooms following the end of the Writers Guild of America's (WGA) strike. The WGA's 148-day strike ended on September 27 after the writers negotiated a fair new deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). While much of Hollywood is still on pause due to the ongoing Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) strike, some aspects of production are resuming, particularly when it comes to writing.\nAs reported by Deadline, the writers' rooms for the One Chicago shows have re-opened following the end of the WGA strike. This means Chicago Fire season 12, Chicago P.D. season 11, and Chicago Med season 9 have all resumed writing and are one step closer to returning to the air. In addition to the One Chicago shows, NBC’s Law & Order and Law & Order: SVU and CBS' three FBI dramas are also resuming writers' rooms this week.\nPreviously, the One Chicago shows always premiered new episodes during the fall TV season. However, it has been quite clear for a while that the shows won't make their usual release dates this year. Even though the writing is back on, the SAG-AFTRA strike will prevent filming from getting underway. Still, despite the uncertainty around the SAG-AFTRA strike, industry insiders had a relatively optimistic outlook on the shows' returns.\nInsiders estimated Chicago Fire and its spinoffs' returns in the days leading up to the WGA securing a deal with the AMPTP. While they acknowledged that many factors could impact the timeline, they correctly predicted that writers' rooms would be open by early October. From there, they predicted One Chicago shows could be released as early as March 2024. This might sound fairly speedy, but production on procedural dramas like the One Chicago shows tends to be pretty swift. Plus, with speculation that the SAG-AFTRA strike will resolve soon, it's possible that the shows could make a spring 2024 return.\nHowever, it's important to remember that it's still unknown for sure when the SAG-AFTRA strike will end. Negotiations recently resumed, and the end of the WGA's strike is expected to pressure the AMPTP to also strike a fair deal with the actors. Still, without a confirmed end in sight, negotiations may take longer than expected. Plus, the shows must film enough episodes to keep up with weekly releases once everything is running again. Hence, while a March 2024 release date seems possible for One Chicago shows, it remains to be seen if they can make it.\nSource: Deadline\n"}
{"title": "Wonka Receives Family-Friendly MPAA Rating, But There's A Unique Twist", "date": "2023-10-05 03:27:25", "text": "Wonka's MPAA rating has finally been released, revealing that the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory prequel features some surprising violent moments.\nWonka's MPAA rating has finally been released, and while it isn't too surprising, there's a little twist. The prequel to Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chcolate Factory was directed by Paddington's Paul King and features an all-star cast including Timothée Chalamet, Sally Hawkins, Olivia Colman, Keegan-Michael Key, and Hugh Grant as an Oompa-Loompa. In Wonka, a younger Willy Wonka sets out to make his name as a world-class chocolatier in a rags-to-riches tale.\nWith Wonka's December 15 release date drawing closer, FilmRatings.com has unveiled the MPAA's official rating. While it has expectedly earned the family-friendly PG rating similar to the Gene Wilder-led Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory and Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the reasons for prequel movie's rating are somewhat surprising. The MPAA awarded Wonka a PG rating due to \"violence, mild language, and some thematic elements.\"\nWhile Wonka's rating could raise brows, its reasons aren't out of the ordinary for previous adaptations of the Dahl novel, which each had their own challenging elements. Despite its G rating, the first 1971 adaptation features moments where Charlie is threatened by the seemingly sinister Slugworth, Charlie and Grandpa Joe narrowly escape razor-sharp blades, and Wonka takes everyone through a terrifying tunnel. Meanwhile, Burton's quirky scenes, mild language, and heightened action in the 2005 adaptation saw that movie being given a PG rating like Wonka.\nFor Wonka, the noted violence could be due to it having clear, definitive villains as opposed to abstract concepts and archetypical characters. Willy will have to make his name for himself while avoiding the wrath of the \"Chocolate Cartel,\" an alliance of greedy chocolatiers consisting of Paterson Joseph's Slugworth, Mathew Baynton's Fickelgruber, and Matt Lucas' Prodnose. While the Wonka trailer reveals them confronting Willy in public, they have also been seen trapping him beneath a glass floor while the room fills with liquid chocolate, teasing their dangerous methods.\nWhile it remains to be seen just how Willy and the Chocolate Cartel will come to blows, Wonka's trailers hint that Chalamet's chocolatier will have to quite literally be quick on his feet to not suffer their wrath. Though the movie is being presented as a whimsical musical, the stakes could become quite high. Nevertheless, while some moments may be intense, they won't stop Wonka from maintaining a family-friendly tone.\nSource: FilmRatings.com\n"}

In Our Flag Means Death season 1, gentleman-turned-pirate Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby) renounced his family's wealth and aristocratic title for a life of piracy. However, it wasn't all smooth sailing for Stede, who found himself falling for the once-ruthless Captain Blackbeard, a.k.a. Ed Teach (Taika Waititi), against his better judgment. At the end of Our Flag is Death season 1, Stede fakes his death to return to Ed and their pirate life.\nUnlike Stede, though, Ed isn't taking their sudden separation well. Consumed by heartbreak, he ignores his duties as captain of the Revenge, inciting anger from his first mate — and notorious Stede hater — Izzy Hands (Con O'Neill). After being accused of going soft, Ed tosses one of his own overboard to flex his power, dumps all of Stede's belongings overboard, and strands the gentleman pirate's crew on a deserted island. Little does Ed know, Stede is dead-set on being reunited, which is right where Our Flag Means Death season 2 picks up.\nRELATED: Everything We Know About Our Flag Means Death Season 3\nHaving officially renounced his wealth and recovered most of his crew, Stede is trying to make his way in the pirate world. In the Our Flag Means Death season 2 premiere, he pens a message in a bottle to Ed, narrating the ups and downs of his misadventures. Mostly, things have been challenging, though Stede tries to put a positive spin on it all: \"We're in a rebuilding phase as a crew,\" he writes. But what's really driving Stede is his love for Ed and his desire to find the wayward captain. \"To reiterate, we’re doing great,\" Stede narrates. \"I think of you, often.\"\nWhile Stede is turning his heartbreak and hardship into action, Ed isn't handling the separation so well. Instead of being driven by purpose, he's compelled by his off-the-handle emotions and reverts back to his Kraken persona. \"I’m the f***in’ devil,\" Ed announces in true Blackbeard fashion as his crew murders an at-sea wedding party just for kicks. Even to Ed's crew, the violence seems uncharacteristically hollow and aimless, making Blackbeard and Stede's awkward breakup all the more troubling.\nRelated: Who Is Anne Bonny? Minnie Driver's Our Flag Means Death Season 2 Character Explained\nIn Our Flag Means Death season 2, episode 1, \"Impossible Birds,\" Stede and his crew find themselves without many options. Hoping to save enough for a proper ship, they broker a deal with Spanish Jackie (Leslie Jones), a much-feared pirate bar owner who boasts 19 husbands, working for her at the Republic of Pirates. After Stede's crew tries to rob Spanish Jackie of her chest full of precious indigo, they find themselves in a tight spot until the local soup kiosk owner, Zheng Yi Sao (Ruibo Qian), saves them.\nZheng Yi Sao reveals herself to be a revered pirate queen and takes Stede and his comrades about her ship, the Red Flag. Earlier in the episode, the faux soup server explains that she prizes action over ambition, which becomes a running theme for the season. Generally speaking, the captain of the Red Flag doesn't take men aboard her vessel but makes an exception for Stede's crew of \"tender as hell\" guys. At first, that seems like a life-altering favor, but things grow more complicated on the pirate queen's ship.\nAfter Izzy encourages them to dump loads of loot from the Revenge just so they can plunder more, Blackbeard's crew starts to speak up about what's happening aboard the ship. \"We think you’re in an unhealthy relationship with Blackbeard,\" Jim (Vico Ortiz) tells Izzy. But that's not the only friction point. As a heartbroken, angry Blackbeard creates an increasingly \"toxic atmosphere,\" the crew isn't just worried about Izzy, but themselves too. Unfortunately, things don't go well when they voice these concerns.\nIn season 1 of Our Flag Means Death, Izzy had accused Ed of being a \"shell\" of his former self after the once-ruthless captain continually hesitated to kill Stede. Outwardly, Ed has tried to project strength and rehabilitate his soft image, though that's caused him to backslide and take things too far. The friction between Izzy and Ed is still very much there, so when Ed draws his pistol on the crew during the workplace meeting, the first mate has no problem telling Ed that what's ruined him is, \"You’re feelings for Steve f***in’ Bonnet.\" Without a second thought, Ed shoots Izzy.\nRELATED:  10 Memes That Perfectly Sum Up Our Flag Means Death\nWhile aboard the Red Flag, Stede and his crew meet the only other man the pirate queen ever took aboard: Lucius (Nathan Foad). Formerly Stede's scribe and the lover of Black Pete (Matthew Maher), Lucius is somewhat glad to be reunited with his former crew, but the events of the Our Flag is Death season 1 finale loom large. In fact, pushing Lucius overboard was one of the heartbroken Ed's first acts that was meant to prove his still-callous nature. At first, Lucius hides the truth, but after Stede fixates on finding Ed, Lucius points out that Blackbeard might not be the person Stede wants him to be.\nAfter Ed shoots Izzy, he makes Frenchie (Joel Fry) his new first mate. Unwilling to be the next one in the line of fire, he tries to talk down his credentials. But the ever-unhinged, heartbroken Ed demands the appointment and Frenchie has no choice but to accept. His first act as Ed's new right-hand man is to finish off Izzy, but Frenchie and the crew decide to secretly stow Izzy below deck instead. Meanwhile, aboard the Red Flag, Zheng Yi Sao's first mate dubs Nathaniel Buttons (Ewen Bremner) a \"sea witch.\" Perhaps just a funny reference to the pirate's ability to commune with seagulls, it could point toward a future season 2 plot point.\nGiven Frenchie's inability to lie well, Ed deduces that his former first mate is still alive and on the Revenge. Below deck, Jim amputates Izzy's wounded leg just before Ed discovers them. After handing Izzy his pistol and telling him to finish himself off, Ed decides to blow off some steam. He steers the Revenge directly into a raging storm and then shatters the wheel. Still not satisfied, he forces his crew to fight each other and threatens to fire a cannon at the mast, in the hopes of killing everyone on board. Breakups really are rough.\nUnable to tolerate their captain's barbaric behavior any longer, the crew of the Revenge take matters into their own hands and fight back. After knocking Ed to the ground, Jim raises a cannonball high into the air — seemingly to crush Ed's skull. However, the camera cuts away, leaving Ed's fate up in the air. When the battered Revenge washes up beside the Red Flag, the pirate queen's first mate suspects mutiny and suggests they kill Izzy, Frenchie, Jim, and the rest of Ed's crew.\nRELATED: Our Flag Means Death Season 3 Confirmed To End The Show (But That Depends On 1 Factor)\nBack at the Republic of Pirates, Zheng Yi Sao falls for the ever-level-headed Oluwande Boodhari (Samson Kayo), as he and Stede were regulars at the soup kiosk. Previously, Oluwande was romantically linked to Jim, who, in turn, gets involved with Madeleine Sami's pirate character —nothing says romance like amputating a leg together. When Oluwande and Jim reunite during Our Flag Means Death season 2, episode 3, \"The Innkeeper,\" it's clear their connection remains, further complicating Oluwande's budding relationship with the pirate queen.\nWhen it becomes clear that Zheng Yi Sao is going to heed her first mate's advice and kill the remainder of Ed's crew, Stede takes matters into his own hands and devises a clever escape plan. Not only does he bust out the rest of the crew, but he manages to get everyone safely aboard the Revenge. To ensure the pirate queen doesn't pursue them, Stede's crew steals the wheel of her ship. While the escape may be glorious, Stede has clearly made a powerful enemy.\nEarlier in the third episode, Ed washes ashore on a seemingly deserted island. This somewhat tracks with what Izzy and the others say when they're accused of mutiny, claiming they just marooned a \"retired\" Ed. However, Ed's unconscious body lies below deck while his mind and spirit go on a journey of self-discovery. As it turns out, the island is Ed's version of purgatory. There, he meets his mentor, the late Captain Ben Hornigold (Mark Mitchinson).\n\"You’re afraid you’re unlovable,\" the purgatory Hornigold tells Ed when he can't decide whether to return to the world of the living or accept his demise. This ties into Ed's history with his own father, whom he killed, as well as why he took the breakup with Stede so hard. When Ed says he hates Hornigold, the ex-pirate captain points out that he's just a projection of Ed's inner turmoil, pushing Ed to have the hard realization that he actually hates himself.\nAs Ed has his moment of self-discovery in purgatory, Stede finds his body and begs him to come back. In his vision, Hornigold ties a rock to Ed and pushes him off a cliff. Struggling to surface with all that weight dragging him down, Ed thinks about giving in to what's heaviest. But when he hears Stede's voice, Ed fights to return to the light. Unfortunately, episode 3 cuts to the credits after Ed opens his eyes. Can Blackbeard and Stede find their way in Our Flag Means Death season 2? If the sure-to-be emotional reunion is any indication, it seems the two pirates might be fated for each other.\nNominated for an LA Press Club National Arts & Entertainment Journalism Award in 2022, Kate is a freelance entertainment writer and editor.

{"title": "True Story Of Zheng Yi Sao, The Pirate Queen In Our Flag Means Death", "date": "2023-10-05 07:01:28", "text": "Dubbed one of the most successful pirates in history, Zheng Yi Sao is the latest iconic figure to appear in the series Our Flag Means Death.\nSpoilers ahead for the first three episodes of Our Flag Means Death season 2.\nIn season 2, Our Flag Means Death wastes no time introducing Zheng Yi Sao, a pirate queen with an incredible true story that puts the tale of Blackbeard to shame. Of course, the series is accustomed to pulling figures from the pages of history. Created by David Jenkins, the swashbuckling, period rom-com focuses on gentleman-turned-pirate Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby), who renounces his family fortune in favor of misadventures on the high seas. Soon enough, the captain of the Revenge meets one of history's most notorious pirates: Captain Blackbeard (Taika Waititi).\nWhile Blackbeard, a.k.a. Ed Teach, and Stede are the couple at the series' center, other real-life pirates populate the first 10-episode season of Our Flag Means Death. Most memorably, Will Arnett plays Calico Jack, an old friend of Blackbeard's who encourages the captain to give in to his most reckless impulses. A handful of new additions to the cast were announced ahead of the season 2 premiere: the sophomore outing of Our Flag Means Death has Minnie Driver's Anne Bonny join the crew as well as Ruibo Qian's Chinese pirate queen, Zheng Yi Sao.\nRelated: Where You've Seen Frenchie From Our Flag Means Death\nDuring China's Qing Dynasty, Zheng Yi Sao made a name for herself, becoming one of the most successful pirates in history. A former sex worker, Zheng Yi Sao was known to be a formidable businessperson, which attracted the attention of the pirate Cheng I, who lorded over the Red Flag Fleet. After marrying Cheng, Zheng Yi Sao became immersed in the world of piracy. Even though one of the names history knows her by, Ching Shih, simply means \"Cheng's widow,\" her piratical legacy is even greater, as Our Flag Means Death season 2 suggests.\nWhen her husband died, Zheng Yi Sao stepped in to lead Cheng's fleet, cleverly outmaneuvering his heir apparent and lover, Cheung Po Tsai. According to Atlas Obscura, she commanded a staggering 1,800 ships and 80,000 men — numbers that make Blackbeard's four ships and 300 men pale in comparison. To keep the Red Flag Fleet unified, the pirate queen implemented a strict code of laws, vowing to behead those who broke the oaths. Even with the East India Company, Chinese, and Portuguese fleets on her case, Zheng Yi Sao remained undefeated and, eventually, retired from a life of pillaging in exchange for amnesty (via Google Arts & Culture).\nWhile it's not known if the showrunners have mapped out Zheng Yi Sao's story into Our Flag Means Death season 3, it is clear that the pirate queen will play a crucial role in the second season. Zheng Yi Sao is most well-remembered for commanding a massive fleet. In the first three episodes of Our Flag Means Death's sophomore season, the Red Flag fleet amounts to just a few ships. Given Stede and his crew's betrayal of Zheng Yi Sao, they've made an enemy of the formidable captain, which means it's likely that she'll return with the full force of her infamous fleet.\nWhile the series isn't set in the South China Sea, Our Flag Means Death keeps what's known about Zheng Yi Sao's disposition intact, as she's portrayed as a confident leader and skilled negotiator. However, there are some embellishments: the Our Flag Means Death season 2 villain runs her vessel by relying on the principles of unity, cohesion, and balance. Moreover, in the series Zheng Yi Sao's crew is made up almost entirely of women, which wasn't the case in real life. Regardless of the changes the show makes, Our Flag Means Death stays true to Zheng Yi Sao's spirit, further cementing her legacy as one of history's most accomplished pirates.\nSources: Atlas Obscura, Google Arts & Culture\nNominated for an LA Press Club National Arts & Entertainment Journalism Award in 2022, Kate is a freelance entertainment writer and editor.

From breathtaking landscapes to limited resources on desolate islands, many places will test your ability to endure. Those looking for unique biomes, mobs, or other locations could also pick certain seeds to survive in areas they enjoy the most.\nTo input a world seed, press the \"Advanced\" button from the \"Create a World\" menu before changing your World Type to \"Infinite.\" Unless a specific Seed says otherwise, you can input a code into the \"Seed\" box without grammatical errors. No matter whether you are entering sequences for worlds with one type of biome, canvases for Creative mode, or the best speedrun seeds in Minecraft, this process remains the same.\nRelated: 10 Best Seeds For Minecraft 1.20\nWhere you spawn in any Minecraft seed can be extremely important in Survival mode since this determines what resources you can access at the start of a new adventure. This world places you right on top of a Mansion structure in a dense forest, surrounding you with trees to cut down for early materials. Nearly every type of forest can be found here, allowing you to harvest many different types of wood.\nThe village near this area also has a Stronghold underneath it, making it very easy to reach The End from where you spawn.\nA sharp contrast in biomes can make for some splendid scenery, which this seed does by creating a world with a desert Badlands and snowy mountain ranges only 600 blocks from each other. Along with the meadows and plains here, the ease at which you can travel between each biome could lead to incredibly different explorations. Two Dripstone Caverns inside these spaces contain all the resources you could ask for, from iron to diamonds in Minecraft.\nRelated: 10 Best Minecraft Seeds For Diamonds\nThe best Cherry Blossom seeds in Minecraft give you a chance to experience the new biome added to the 1.20 update, which features beautiful pink flowered trees within a new type of forest. This seed puts you on an island of Blossoms, surrounded by every other biome in the game. While you could travel anywhere to create your main base, there's something special about a pristine pink island that sits near such interesting landscapes.\nWhile you may only see it in the distance when you spawn into this seed, this world has a massive Ice Spike biome that stretches for thousands of blocks. With two ruined Nether portals near where you begin, you can also find a River Mansion and several Villages. The abundance of smaller regions around a central snow environment can be great for anyone looking for a cold theme to their Minecraft Survival world.\nShipwrecks can be valuable structures to discover in Minecraft, with this world seed giving you two broken vessels close to the desert island you spawn onto. The chests in these ships give you a great head start in Survival mode, including raw materials, tools, weapons, and maybe even some armor. According to the YouTube creator Minecraft & Chill, other landmarks like an Outpost and Village found in a nearby tundra are places you may also loot for helpful gear.\nVillages, Outposts, and Temples are essential places to travel to during a good Survival run of Minecraft, making this seed popular by including all three early on. Spawning in this world puts you on the sands of a beach next to a Jungle biome with four Temples hidden inside the dense forest. A nearby Village, both in the forest and in the close desert, should give you everything you need to get started very quickly in your adventure.\nThere are a few Witch Hut structures within the Jungle biome of this seed as well, but some dangerous mobs guard them. You may want to get some protection against them before trying to loot their homes.\nOne of the biggest challenges with Survival seeds with tons of biomes is the sheer amount of time it takes to travel to each important location. Thankfully, this world provides an easy solution to this problem, with a vast river connecting almost every Minecraft environment. In addition, a Shipwreck and an interesting collection of Cherry Blossom trees inside an enclosed icy mountain give you some advantages to work with when you spawn.\n\"Warm\" biomes like Deserts, Badlands, and Jungles are all present here, with several Temples in each region to explore to your heart's content. Three of these spaces also give you access to Strongholds underground, which are perfect for those in Survival mode who eventually want to take on the Ender Dragon. There are so many Ruins, Villages, and even a hidden Igloo base in Minecraft that will keep you busy for a long time.\nThis seed has every Overworld biome within just over 1,000 blocks right when you spawn, creating a shockingly even distribution of environments. A large Badlands biome is located next to a large ocean that connects all these places with every type of aquatic biome. Even the incredibly rare Lush Cave biome is seen underneath a large ravine, allowing you to harvest almost every known material in Minecraft.\nThis seed has the greatest potential in Survival mode because of the presence of every biome in the game at equal distances from the island you spawn on. Anyone who will be dedicating a lot of their time to a Minecraft world should be able to visit various unique places to keep the experience fresh. All you need is a boat to go anywhere you could imagine in this limitless seed.\nThe best seeds for Survival in Minecraft provide the resources your character needs to live and a wide variety of places to go that make your adventure constantly exciting through discoveries.\nSource: Minecraft & Chill/YouTube\n"}
{"title": "The Best Cleric Multiclass Build In Baldur’s Gate 3", "date": "2023-10-05 09:00:27", "text": "Playing a multiclass hero in Baldur’s Gate 3 can be beneficial, but you need to know how to build them. Here are the best Cleric multiclasses so far.\nUsing a Cleric Multiclass in Baldur’s Gate 3 is an excellent way of optimizing your character’s potential as a divine damage dealer or a team supporter. Multiclassing is a feature available in Larian Studio’s popular turn-based RPG that essentially allows you to undertake two distinct classes and level them up with a single character. Doing so will open up your list of potential skills, thus giving you completely different approaches to the game. Using some of the best Multiclass combinations allows you to expand your character’s range of abilities, making them a more skilled healer or perhaps a more versatile DPS.\nUsing Multiclasses, however, is optional. They can provide benefits if you are thinking of optimizing the character’s build for a specific archetype that fits a well-rounded party composition. Alternatively, it can also become a mess of stats thrown around, where a character can do many different things but doing all these things rather poorly. As such, players should be using the best Multiclasses available, and part of doing so is using the Cleric as a base, as one of the best classes in Baldur’s Gate 3 – even if it is one of the least popular ones.\nRelated: 5 Best Multiclass Combinations In Baldur's Gate 3\nThe Cleric and Paladin Multiclass combination may be one of the most traditional ones that stem from Dungeons and Dragons, and, once again, it proves its value in Baldur’s Gate 3. Mixing these two classes will allow you to transform your character into an envoy of holy powers, not only dealing a lot of damage but also healing and protecting yourself and your teammates. With the Cleric’s healing and buffing powers, you can make yourself even stronger when jumping into the heat of the battle to start smiting opponents, as Paladins often do.\nCleric & Paladin Multiclass Build\nCleric Level\nAt least 6\nPaladin Level\nAt least 2\nBest Abilities\n \nA fun and devastating strategy is to use the Cleric’s Spirit Guardians and head over to a group of enemies to start beating them up with the Paladin’s various smite abilities. In addition to this, Paladins can also use Bonus Actions starting at level, which allow them to strike twice. This can also be used against bosses like Ketheric Thorm in Baldur’s Gate 3. Because Clerics rely heavily on Wisdom and Paladins often depend on Strength, Constitution, and Charisma, finding the sweet spot can be tricky.\nUltimately, it comes down to your desire to mold them into an offensive light powerhouse or a more support-focused tank with excellent offensive capabilities. Either one works well, as the Cleric and Paladin Multiclass stands as one of the best Multiclasses in the game. Even a stealthier approach with a combat focus on debuffs against enemies can be achieved through a Trickery Domain Cleric and Oathbreaker Paladin Multiclass. In terms of roleplaying campaigns in Baldur’s Gate 3, the Cleric and Paladin Multiclass may be one of the best to use, as Clerics’ and Paladins’ proficiency with the holy light makes for a perfect match.\nIf your approach to the playable character is proper support for the rest of the team, then one of the best possible combinations is a Cleric and Bard multiclass build. This special mash-up will give you healing and protective abilities from Cleric in Baldur’s Gate 3, but the Bard will be the one doing the shining in terms of buffs. In fact, it is recommended for the Domain of Life Cleric to be leveled only a little bit so that you can unlock the essential skills, giving room for the Bard to develop more.\nCleric & Bard Multiclass Build\nCleric Level\nAt least 3\nBard Level\nAt least 7\nBest Abilities\n \nThe main focus of this build will be upgrading your buffing capabilities, which comes at the expense of your offensive powers. That is not to say you will be completely useless in terms of damage output, but this Cleric and Bard Multiclass hero will not be the spearhead of the party. On the other hand, it may be the most important piece of a team composition in Baldur’s Gate 3, as the Cleric Bard mix will protect allies consistently while empowering the main damage dealer to wreck opponents. An additional advantage of this build is applying the occasional debuff to enemies.\nRelated: Baldur’s Gate 3 Classes Are Going To Save Your Campaign From Disaster\nAnother positive aspect of this Cleric and Bard Multiclass build is that the stat spread is much more organized than the one with Cleric and Paladin, which has the risk of going all over the place. With a Cleric Bard in Baldur’s Gate 3, you will want to invest in Charisma and Wisdom. This will, in turn, also allow you to take on the role of the persuasive and deceitful negotiator, capable of talking your way out of most situations, should you have that option. Characters that deal damage tend to steal the spotlight, but this Multiclass mix is second to no DPS.\nIf you want one of the most overpowered Multiclass builds in Baldur’s Gate 3, mixing Cleric and Sorcerer is the solution. Not only are these two of the best classes in the RPG, but they are also complementary to one another. While Cleric will thrive with protective abilities and an occasional buff, the Sorcerer will wreak havoc with its elemental abilities across the arena. This Multiclass is not as tanky as the Paladin Cleric, which can endure many rounds of incoming damage, but it is one of the finest DPS builds available.\nCleric & Sorcerer Multiclass Build\nCleric Level\n5\nSorcerer Level\n7\nBest Abilities\n \nThe Sorcerer alone is already an S-tier class to choose from with its Lightning-based abilities, but mixed with a class that protects itself like the Cleric; you get a master magic user. In addition, both use the same types of weapons and armor, so there is no need to unlock proficiency with heavy armor or certain weapons, for instance. Like the Cleric Bard Multiclass in Baldur’s Gate 3, you will want to invest in Charisma and Wisdom, as the Cleric will play a less important role than the Sorcerer for damage purposes. Nevertheless, this is much more balanced.\nYou will need to increase Cleric to a fairly high level, even if the Sorcerer class is to be the priority. If you focus your character into a Tempest Domain Cleric with a Storm Sorcerer, you may as well be invincible – you even get the ability to fly.

{"title": "Assassin's Creed Mirage: How To Decrease Notoriety", "date": "2023-10-05 09:30:25", "text": "Basim’s Notoriety in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage can land him in big trouble, so decreasing it as soon as possible is a necessary evil.\nIn Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, Basim’s Notoriety will change the way you are able to play the game, and it is essential to learn how to decrease that notoriety early. With a high Notoriety, Basim will be easily spotted throughout Baghdad and unable to avoid guards who are furtively searching for him. Fortunately, there are several ways players can decrease Basim's Notoriety throughout the game and ensure he stays unnoticed.\nAssassin’s Creed: Mirage takes place slightly before the last entry in the series, Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla, expanding on the story of Basim to explore how he got from street thief to the Hidden One. This entry in the series is much more focused on stealth like many of the earlier games, and being seen doing something illegal will instantly increase your Notoriety. Players should note that engaging in open combat will increase Basim's Notoriety immediately.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nThere are four levels of Notoriety in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage that will affect how Basim can travel through the city of Baghdad. Starting at the first level, Wanted Posters will appear throughout the city, and some civilians and guards may notice Basim. At level two, guards will likely find you and start patrolling rooftops, and more civilians will recognize you. At the final level, the elite Shakiriyya guard will begin following you, and civilians will regularly notice you.\nBasim should rely much more on stealth mechanics in Assassin's Creed: Mirage to complete missions, as completing tasks without being seen will not raise his Notoriety. However, there are several points in the game, including very early on, where Basim will be forced to do something in the open, or you will accidentally murder someone in front of a civilian you did not know was there. Luckily, there are two main ways to decrease your Notoriety.\nIf you start to get spotted, run for it and hide until things have calmed down. The Notoriety bar fills up incrementally, so disengaging and letting things calm down could keep the bar from reaching the next level.\nThe first and perhaps easiest method to decrease Notoriety is to remove Wanted Posters. They will appear on the bar at the top of the screen when Basim is near one, and Basim can approach and interact with the poster to remove it from the city. However, this can be risky when many civilians or guards are nearby, as getting caught removing it by a guard will not decrease your Notoriety. When Basim's Notoriety is high, Wanted Posters will almost always appear near Basim on Assassin's Creed: Mirage's map.\nThe second main way is to use a Power Token to bribe a Munadi. Power Tokens can be acquired through quests or pickpocketing, and Munadi can often be found standing on a platform in the middle of busy areas. Approach one and offer them a Power Token to spread false rumors about you, and Basim’s Notoriety will decrease immediately. This can be done anytime in Assassin's Creed: Mirage, even in the middle of quests, so take advantage of it if you can.\n"}
{"title": "All Ditto Disguises In Pokémon GO (October 2023)", "date": "2023-10-05 10:00:27", "text": "In Pokémon GO, as of October 2023, Ditto has eight different common Pokémon it can appear as in the wild, ranging from Generations 1 to 6.\nThe hunt for a Ditto in Pokémon GO is one of patience, luck, and travel. Dittos don't appear like most Pokémon. In fact, when you're out walking, you won't see a single Ditto. Dittos disguise themselves as a different set of Pokémon every month. If you're lucky, one of these Pokémon will transform into a Ditto after capture.\nShiny Dittos are even rarer than their regular counterparts. If you catch a shiny Pokémon, it is guaranteed to not be a Ditto. Shiny Dittos have the same disguises as regular Dittos. The shiny spawn rates for a Ditto are about equal to those of rare spawns. There are eight different Pokémon that could secretly be Ditto.\nDitto's disguises are spread between generations 1 through 6, with two Pokémon in Generation 1 and two in Generation 5. Nintendo last updated Ditto's disguise list during the March 2023 Let's GO/Team GO Rocket Takeover. Each copy behaves under the same rules as a real Pokémon of its type, despite being a Ditto.\nThe two Generation 1 Pokémon that Ditto likes to disguise itself as are Diglett and Grimer. As Generation 1 Pokémon, both of these are common in the wild and easy to track. Diglett is the safer bet of the pair, as it loves to spawn in wide-open spaces. This makes it easy for more players to catch Digletts and maybe find their first Ditto.\nSnubbull represents Generation 2 in the disguise line-up and is the only Fairy-type Pokémon on the list. Snubbull's followed up by Generation 3's Corphish, who got an upgrade in September 2023. Corphish now has Razor Shell in its move collection. If bulldogs and crabs aren't your style, you can look for a Starly, Ditto's Generation 4 disguise.\nRoggenrola and Tympole are both Generation 5 Pokémon and more disguise options for Ditto. Roggenrola is usually stronger than Tympole, so if you want to farm one of these two, Roggenrola would be more worthwhile to collect, just in case you find one you'd like to add to your permanent collection. The last character Ditto can turn into in Pokémon GO is Litleo, the humble lion from Generation 6. Litleo is an excellent pick for any Pokémon master building a team off of cuteness due to its big eyes and feline appearance.\nIf you want to increase your chances of finding a Ditto in Pokémon GO, keep an eye on your Nearby tab. If you find one of these eight Pokémon on the list, hurry to their location as quickly as you can. It may take a while, but if you focus your catching efforts on these Pokémon, you may find a Ditto sooner than you think.\n"}

Whatever your reason, whether it's to assist you in a difficult part of the game, unlock certain endings, or outfit your V with the best gear, console commands can make it happen. The possibilities of what you can accomplish with console commands are practically limitless.\nOn the other hand, console commands aren't always about acquiring the best Cyberpunk 2077 weapons, Cyberware, and vehicles or unlocking every possible ending. Sometimes, they're used as a quality-of-life mod. For example, removing the encumbrance on V so that you can spam pick up useless items to your heart's content. Even if console commands aren't your cup of tea, everyone can benefit from them in Cyberpunk 2077.\nRelated: Cyberpunk 2077: Ranking Every Possible Ending From Worst To Best\nAlthough update 2.0 brought many improvements and modifications to Cyberpunk 2077, a console command window was not one of them. As a result, you will need to install the Cyber Engine Tweaks mod by Yamashi to use console commands and cheats in the game. The mod itself has been updated to support Cyberpunk 2077 2.0. And, once downloaded, it's as simple as pressing the Tilda key (~) in-game to open the console commands menu.\nYou can use the Cyber Engine Tweaks mod for other applications, such as a UI, to configure other mods, set up hotkeys, and turn on/off certain game settings you would not otherwise have access to.\nUnfortunately, it's limited to PC players because you must download Cyber Engine Tweaks to access console commands. In other words, Xbox and PlayStation users cannot access or use console commands in Cyberpunk 2077.\nAlthough console commands have many applications in Cyberpunk 2077, most players immediately gravitate toward cheats. Cheats are commands that change your character's performance, such as adding unfathomable amounts of health, money, or XP to them. Here are some of the best console commands and cheats using the Cyber Engine Tweaks mod - though it's merely scratching the surface.\nConsole Command\nWhat It Does\nGame.AddToInventory(\"items.money\", 100000)\nAdds 100,000 Credits into your pocket.\nGame.ModStatPlayer(\"Health\", \"100\")\nAdds health points to V.\nGame.ModStatPlayer(\"Armor\", \"100\")\nAdds armor points to V.\nGame.ModStatPlayer(\"CarryCapacity\", \"100\")\nIncreased V's max carrying capacity.\nGame.InfiniteStamina(true)\nGrants V infinite stamina.\nGame.SetLevel(“Level”, x)\nLet's you change V's in-game level.\nGame.SetLevel(\"StreetCred\",x,1)\nLet's you change V's Street Cred level.\nvs = Game.GetVehicleSystem ()\nOpens the command to allow players to unlock every vehicle in the game.\nvs:EnableAllPlayerVehicles()\nThe player unlocks all the vehicles in the game.\nGame.AddToInventory(\"Items.QuickHackLegendaryMaterial1\", 10000\nAdds 10,000 Tier 5 Quickhack Components to V's inventory.\nGame.AddToInventory(\"Items.CWCapacityPermaReward_Legendary\")\nInstalls a legendary Cyberware Capacity Shard.\nGame.PrevSys_off()\nTurns off getting wanted by the police.\nGame.AddToInventory(\"Items.PerkPointSkillbook\")\nGrants V one perk point.\nAny console command that ends with a numerical value can be modified. For instance - Game.AddToInventory(\"items.money\", 100000) - that 100,000 can be changed to 200,000, 300,000, and so on. Furthermore, if a command ends with an \"X,\" it means you must include your own numerical value of what you want, such as Game.SetLevel(\"Level\", x).\nAlthough these are some of the best console commands and cheats from the Cyber Engine Tweaks mod, it's not nearly all of them. In fact, there are thousands of commands and cheats at your disposal with this mod, all of which can be found online.\nYou can find commands and cheats on that list for practically everything. There are commands for acquiring every weapon, such as the best Katanas. Alternatively, acquiring certain pieces of clothing, such as David's Jacket in Cyberpunk 2077. What's more, unlocking Cyberware, vehicles, weapon mods, and anything else contributes to a more memorable experience in Cyberpunk 2077.\nSource: NexusMods/Yamashi\nRiley grew up in the golden era of Xbox vs PlayStation and has fallen in love with RPGs and action-adventure games as a result.

It is focused on committing crimes, which can alienate companions but also leads to great rewards.\nThe Crimson fleet is one of the many factions in Starfield. They are a criminal organization operating out of the Kryx system. Joining them will require breaking the law, stealing, and other dubious actions.\nInitially, you must join the Crimson Fleet as an undercover spy for the UC Sysdef. However, as the story progresses you can choose to become truly loyal and betray your UC Sysdef handlers. This is a stand-alone questline and does not interfere with joining any other faction.\nThe Crimson Fleet will not invite you directly. Instead, you must first commit some type of crime within the United Colonies space and get caught. This could include theft, smuggling, assault, trespassing, or murder. Upon being arrested, you will be sent to meet with Commander Ikande, who will brief you on the job for the quest Deep Cover.\nYou will be sent to the planet Cydonia to meet with Saorise Bowden. You can either bribe her for information or refuse and be imprisoned. The latter will lead to you receiving an anonymous letter with the same details. Either option will eventually lead to the Broken Spear to speak with Alder Kemp.\nYour next task is to go and wrangle out money from Karl Fielding. Either persuasion or combat will convince him to hand over the cash. Report back to Alder and he’ll explain that you may now meet with the starship Astraea in the Europa system. This will give you an audience with Naeva, who will have a short request to kill Austin Rake on board the Ragana.\nGo to the Enceladus system and board Ragana. Locate Austin and either execute him or convince the captain to do it for you. Upon successful completion, talk to Naeva again and she will send you to The Keys to meet Delgado and join the Crimson Fleet, proper.\nDuring this whole time, UC Sysdef will keep hounding you to relay back info about the Crimson Fleet’s operations. This will cumulate in the mission Legacy’s End. There is the option to side with either the Crimson Fleet or UC Sysdef for the remainder of the game’s story. To truly be part of Crimson Fleet, head to The Key and agree to ship Kryx’s Legacy to the faction.\nRelated: Best Starfield Companions\nThis is a rather evil act, and many companions will disagree with the choice. However, staying with the Crimson Fleet will also recruit Mathis Castillo to your side. You also get several exclusive rewards, including taking part in the Crimson Fleet’s mission board for side quests. But, you also lose out on some of the best weapons, including the option of looting Delgado’s personal gear.\nTo play things safe, consider making a separate save at the beginning of Legacy’s End. If you become unsatisfied with the Crimson Fleet, you will always have the option of reloading and making another choice. This can even include not resolving the quest at all, leading to having access to both factions for the remainder of Starfield. You can also simply wait until New Game Plus to take the other route and view both outcomes.\nKurtis Seid has been covering the game industry for over a decade.

{"title": "Assassin's Creed Mirage Map Size: How Big Is AC Mirage?", "date": "2023-10-05 11:00:26", "text": "Assassin's Creed Mirage returns to the franchise's roots with a smaller title set in a stunning recreation of 9th-century Baghdad.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage has been a return to the franchise's roots, with a smaller, more stealth-focused title set in a stunning recreation of Baghdad in the year 861. The title tells the origin of Basim Ibn Ishaq, a character who was introduced in the franchise's last title, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, by which time he was already a Master Assassin on his travels to Norway​​​​​.\nAssasin's Creed Mirage's story brings the series back by returning to the Middle East. Many years before Altair's story in the first Assassin's Creed, which took place during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land (modern-day Israel, Palestine, and Syria), a 17-year-old Basim worked alongside his mentor, Roshan. He would go on to grow from being a common street thief in Baghdad to a fully-fledged member of the Hidden Ones by taking down members of The Order of the Ancients.\nRelated: \"A True Return To The Series' Best\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Preview\nAssassin's Creed Mirage's developers compared the game's map to previous entries in the long-running series during 2023's Summer Game Fest. During this interview, Ubisoft stated that Assassin's Creed Mirage's depiction of Baghdad would be similar in scale to Constantinople in 2011's Assassin's Creed Revelations and Paris in 2014's Assassin's Creed Unity. However, these maps varied quite significantly in size. The Constantinople map was 0.94 km², whereas Assassin's Creed Unity took advantage of the improved hardware available with the release of the PS4 and Xbox One and offered a hugely detailed Paris map more than twice as large at 2.40 km².\nThis comparison was presumably intended to point out a difference between the scale of Assassin's Creed Mirage and the massive maps of the franchise's last three mainline entries, Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla. After years of the franchise using a similar formula with annual releases, Ubisoft opted to change the direction of the series by adding more ARPG elements and showcasing huge open-world maps consisting of parts of Egypt, Greece, Norway, and England. Valhalla's total map size came in at over 99.7 km², which is a far cry from the likes of Revelations and Unity.\nWhile this change has received praise from many, there are members of the Assassin's Creed fandom who have complained that these games feel too large for their own good and would rather see the series return to its roots. Fortunately, Ubisoft seems to be catering to both parts of the fanbase with smaller, stealth-heavy titles like Assassin's Creed Mirage and larger ARPG titles like the upcoming Japan-based Assassin's Creed: Codename Red in the coming years.\nRelated: \"What [Players] Loved First\" - Simon Arseneault On Assassin's Creed Mirage\nAssassin's Creed Mirage's Baghdad map will be around 2.30 km², which is nearer to the size of Assassin's Creed Unity's Paris than Assassin's Creed Revelations' Constantinople. Previously, images of the game's physical copies — some of which included a physical map — revealed that players could visit the surrounding areas outside the city, such as the Abbasiyah, Harbiyah, and Karkh districts, and Alamut. The latter of which should be familiar to long-term fans of the franchise as a major stronghold of the Hidden Ones and Assassins.\nThis led YouTuber DG VFX to make calculations using gameplay footage objective markers. According to these calculations, Assassin's Creed Mirage's total map size is 45 km², with the playable area being 13 km². This makes the game larger than both of the titles Ubisoft previously compared it to, but fortunately, much smaller and more manageable than entries such as Odyssey or Valhalla​​​​.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nWhile the Assassin's Creed series does have its mythical and fantasy elements, it has also been known for its incredibly detailed reconstructions of real-world locations. The most famous example was when Assassin's Creed Unity's depiction of Notre Dame was used to assist in rebuilding the real Paris landmark after a structural fire in April 2019. Ubisoft and its team of designers, artists, and historians who had spent years researching and recreating the cathedral and offered its 3D model to the French government and other organizations involved in the effort. The company also pledged to donate half a million Euros to help with the restoration and encouraged fans to donate as well.\nTherefore, it should come as no surprise that Assassin's Creed Mirage's depiction of Baghdad is following this trend. Assassin's Creed Mirage's Art Director, Jean-Luc Sala — who has a personal connection to the location, having grown up on the other side of the Tigris River from Baghdad in Iran before moving when he was 11 — had previously spoken on the challenge of recreating a 9th-century version of the Iraqi capital with Gamesradar+.\nThe main challenges stemmed from the fact that Baghdad during that time was technically a lost city after being burned down by the Mongols in the 13th Century. Therefore, little is known about the location in that era, and historians actually wished the team at Ubisoft Bordeaux luck with their recreation, warning them that the lack of information would be \"problematic.\"\nThis didn't deter the team, however, who continued to work with historians and scholars around the globe to piece together as much knowledge as they could from archeology and references in literature to recreate the location as faithfully as possible. Sala stated, \"It's not 100% accurate, but this is the best it can show,\" and explained that historians can now use the game's 3D model to talk more about the subject.\nAccording to Sala, Dr. Ali A. Olomi, the esteemed historian of the Middle East and Islamic history, was \"like a kid\" when Ubisoft showed him around Assassin's Creed Mirage's recreation of Baghdad. Olomi had spent his life studying that period and that city, and therefore, Sala stated that it was an incredibly \"emotional\" experience for both the professor and the developers, showing that Ubisoft's hard work and dedication had truly paid off.\nTherefore, while Assassin's Creed Mirage's map may be smaller than other games in the series, it has plenty for players to explore. With the game taking place during what historians have referred to as the Golden Age of Islam, it should also offer a unique experience for those wishing to visit a previously unseen version of Baghdad and its surrounding areas via Basim's story and one that's extremely different from most modern depictions of the Middle East.\nSource: DG VFX/YouTube, Gamesradar+\n"}

Returning to NBC with a batch of new episodes, Quantum Leap season 2 begins in a destabilizing place for Ben Song (Raymond Lee). He has to go through a leap in Russia, without his team. And then, towards the end of the premiere episode, titled \"This Took Too Long,\" it's revealed that Ben has been missing and presumed dead for three years.\nIn an interview with TV Insider, executive producer Chris Grismer confirms the three-year decision came from the writers room. Grismer sheds light on what went into the decision, and the benefits of handling the reveal in that way. Fellow executive producer Deborah Pratt discusses what the story means for Quantum Leap's characters, specifically mentioning Addison (Caitlin Bassett) Ian (Mason Alexander Park), Magic (Ernie Hudson), and Jenn (Nanrisa Lee). Their quotes are below:\nGRISMER: “[It] came from the writers’ room. I think it was a great way for us to not have to sit in all the fallout from the original story and just sort of get ahead to the meat of what’s going on. I really liked that it wasn’t three years for him and to watch that contrast, that struggle between two people experiencing time differently.”\nPRATT: “The big question is, what happened to everybody in those three years? The fact that Ben has no recollection of three years passing is a true — I could go nerd out on you and talk Einstein’s theories of time-space continuums, but the reality is he now has to deal with everybody else’s life went on. Where is Addison? What is she dealing with? That mourning and that loss or the belief of that loss and how she kept herself together and the fact that she now has to face somebody that she thought was gone forever is a huge journey for not just Addison, [but also] for Ian, Magic, and Jenn because suddenly they have a chance to bring him home.”\nRelated: Quantum Leap Season 1 Ending & Time Travel Twists Explained (In Detail)\nThe premiere episode saves the clarification on Ben's twist until the last moment. After successfully completing the objective behind his leap, Ian finds Ben. The emotion of their reunion is short-lived, as Ben has all sorts of questions. Ben observes that Ian looks different and is wearing a forlorn expression. With hesitance, Ian shares the reality of the situation: It's been three years. Ben is thought to be dead. The Quantum Leap project is shut down.\nBefore Ben can even process the information, he's sent away on another leap as the NBC reboot balances its weekly stories with the larger overall arc. But in terms of that overall arc, Ben now has a closer connection to Scott Bakula’s Sam Beckett. The updated series has been focused on figuring out what happened to Beckett, who also vanished in the original series. Ben will presumably now learn for himself what that experience can be like.\nThere's also the question of how the new characters will impact the story. There's Hannah Carson, played by The 100 alum Eliza Taylor, a complex woman \"who is more than she appears to be.\" Quantum Leap season 2 trailers reveal that Hannah knows about Ben's secret, which could suggest that the three-year gap has a lasting impact on the team. It could be the case that they'll struggle to get close again.\nSource: TV Insider\nAbdullah Al-Ghamdi joined Screen Rant in 2019.

{"title": "The X-Men's Biggest MCU Challenge Was Subtly Set Up A Year Ago", "date": "2023-10-05 12:00:27", "text": "The smooth introduction of the X-Men faces a lot of challenges, but something that was set up in a movie one year ago might have helped with this.\nWhile the details of the X-Men group's arrival in the MCU remain unclear, a solution to one of the biggest challenges may have been set up a year ago. With theories abounding over how the X-Men will finally make a full appearance in the MCU timeline, there are many questions that need answering, including how the typical air of distrust between mutants and humans will be justified. It is a narratively messy plot point that even plagues the comics, as the difference between mutants and other super beings is often tenuous.\nUntil now, the humans of Earth that don't possess superpowers or galaxy-sized brains have very little reason to distrust their super-powered protectors. The Blip, the Battle of Earth, and many other humanity-saving feats have all but cemented the Avengers and their ilk as protectors of Earth and bona fide celebrities. Although the argument could be made that they entice the trouble they then defend against, the consensus seems to be that without the likes of the Avengers, humanity would be doomed. It surely stands to reason, then, that the mutants would be seen in the same way.\nRelated: Marvel's X-Men Movie: Everything We Know\nThe MCU's biggest challenge with regard to the X-Men now (aside from explaining away their absence over the last several years) is differentiating them from other super-powered beings that have won the hearts and minds of the general population. This could be done through the public vilification of the main villain in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Namor, the MCU's oldest mutant. Aside from inflicting a lot of damage to Wakanda itself, he and the Talokanil had grander designs: to take control of Earth with Wakanda's aid.\nNamor's bad relationship with humankind could be the springboard the MCU needs to stoke resentment against those who call themselves \"mutants.\" The term has not been thrown around too often in the MCU, leaving it wide open to being co-opted by just about anyone looking to besmirch the innocence of mutantkind. Namor could then be the perfect target of a smear campaign against any who would call themselves \"mutants,\" suggesting that any who do so ascribe to the same nefarious anti-human sentiments as Namor. Then all that's required is for Magneto to further widen the rift between mutants and humankind by giving credence to their fears.\nPart of the central themes of the X-Men lore is how they can be ostracized from society due to their unique set of gifts. This is, after all, the driving force behind Magneto and his team of \"bad guys,\" as many retaliate against the bigotry of human beings who consider themselves to be \"normal.\" The theme opens up a plethora of storytelling possibilities, sympathetic villains, and allegories that stand the test of time and help to make the X-Men as popular as it is today. As a group, the X-Men represent a safe haven for their kind, and their fight against those who consider mutants to be either inferior or superior to humans is central to their existence, and something the MCU will need to embrace.\nOllie discovered his love for all things nerdy very early on in life and has only gotten nerdier with age after only discovering the magic of Dungeons & Dragons in his 30s.

This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nDave Filoni has re-introduced a massive Star Wars story in the Ahsoka finale that he first started 12 years ago, and it has huge implications for the future of the galaxy. The course of Ahsoka season 1 has drawn upon plenty of characters, moments, and other story threads that Filoni first debuted in animation, largely due to the fact that most of Ahsoka Tano's (Rosario Dawson) story has occurred in animation up to this point. Now, the finale of the Star Wars Disney+ TV show has tied the two mediums even more closely together.\nMuch of the interest and intrigue of Ahsoka season 1 lingered with Ray Stevenson's Baylan Skoll, and what power or entity the dark Jedi kept sensing on Peridea. He told his apprentice Shin Hati throughout the series that he heard it calling to him even before they made it to Peridea, and he described it as some kind of \"beginning\" - a way to end the cycle of Jedi versus Sith. It's now been revealed that it was the Mortis gods calling to him, and their origin goes all the way back to an animated Star Wars series.\nThe Mortis arc was a part of Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 3, which saw Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka, and Obi-Wan Kenobi all mysteriously stranded on the mystical planet with three Force-gods. This is how Ahsoka ended up being tied so closely to the Daughter, the Force-goddess who gave her life so that Ahsoka could live. The Mortis gods were also seen in Star Wars Rebels season 4, as they opened a gate for Ezra Bridger into the World Between Worlds. Now, 12 years after this The Clone Wars arc first premiered, Filoni is continuing its story.\nNot only is Baylan last seen standing on the hand of a statue of the Father, but Ahsoka is also visited by her convor Morai, the owl who's been connected to her ever since the Daughter sacrificed her life for Ahsoka's. The stone statue of the Daughter is also the only one on Peridea that's destroyed, as both the Father and the Son still remain standing. Many viewers have thought this could be pointing towards an introduction to Abeloth, the Mother who was overcome with darkness when she tried to gain the same immortal powers as her family.\nRelated: When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline\nEither way, there's no doubt Filoni plans on completing his massive Star Wars story centered around Mortis in the near future.

It also gives you opportunities to play longer balls, that would normally be intercepted with ease.\nThe dead ball PlayStyle does exactly what it says on the tin. While most players online tend to play the ball short from free-kicks around the edge of the box, it can be worth having a player with this trait in your team to have direct shots on goal.\nThe accuracy of free kicks and the line that is drawn on the screen showing the ball path are both increased, meaning if you know what you are doing you can score a high percentage of the time with them. While free-kicks do take practice, having a Dead Ball specialist can make the difference in tight games.\nSpeed has always been a key attribute across sports titles and those players with the Rapid attribute have an even greater increased speed. They are also able to keep control of the ball while dribbling at a higher speed. Top stars such as Kylian Mbappe have the Rapid PlayStyle and it will make them even harder to stop this year.\nCombining this with other PlayStyles has the potential to change a number of stars to become overpowered cards and the majority of those playing online will look to take advantage of this.\nThe Technical PlayStyle increases speed during Controlled Sprints and enables precise wide turns while dribbling. Dribbling is more effective in EA Sports FC 24 than in previous entries in the series, which makes the Technical PlayStyle even more powerful. Players such as Lionel Messi, who already excel at close-control dribbling, are now even harder to take the ball off.\nLast-second movements with the ball can give players that opening to pass or shoot and this PlayStyle will allow that.\nIn the late stages of matches, stamina plays a huge role, with players struggling to stay at top speeds the longer the game lasts. The Relentless PlayStyle reduces fatigue loss during the game and gives players more of a boost at half-time. A great option for those in the middle of the park, it can make a huge difference in the final ten minutes or in any games that go into extra time.\nInterceptions are a key part of football and can make a huge difference in matches on EA Sports FC 24. The PlayStyle increases the chance to intercept a ball, as well as the distance a ball can be intercepted. Players automatically intercept well in this year's game and this takes it to another level.\nHaving this on a defensive midfielder can pick off a lot of dangerous passes and in turn start a counter-attack quickly.\nSkill Stars have previously determined what special moves a player can make in the FIFA series. However, the new Trickster PlayStyle enables the execution of unique flick Skill Moves. For those who like to show off on the field including a player with this PlayStyle will open up new options and ways to beat defenders.\nLots of the top stars including Heroes and Legends available in EA Sports FC 24 have the Trickster ability, so for those who can afford them, they are worth it.\nWhile several of the best defensive players are already capable of blocking a lot of shots, those with the Block PlayStyle, such as Liverpool defender Virgil Van Dijk, have enhanced blocking range and an increased success rate of blocks. Like interceptions, a lot of this will be done automatically when defending, but those with the PlayStyle will feel impassively for the opposition. When using players with the Block ability, no extra action needs to be taken, but their presence when defending will be felt.\nFor a number of years, Finesse Shots have been overpowered in the FIFA series. On certain games in particular any shots from around the edge of the box would fly into the top corner. While this isn't the case with normal Finesse Shots in EA Sports FC 24, those with the PlayStyle attribute can score from a host of different positions and angles.\nChelsea's star striker Sam Kerr is one such player to have this PlayStyle and if you give her room to shoot outside the box it could easily end up in the top corner.\nWhile all of the PlayStyles have their uses, the Power Shot is the best and most effective. In the most important areas on the pitch, Power Shots can be extremely effective, but they take time and space to use. With this PlayStyle players will shoot faster, meaning defenders will have less time to react.\nPower Shots, if on target, are rarely saved by goalkeepers and this will allow you to get your shots off quicker in EA Sports FC 24.\nSimon is a Gaming Guides writer for ScreenRant focusing on FIFA and Pokemon.

Debuting in 2021, the Showtime original horror series follows the girls of the WHS Yellowjackets soccer team as their plane crashes in the Canadian wilderness, and have to resort to extreme measures to survive. The series also follows some of the girls 25 years later as they are still dealing with the fallout of their dark past. Endlessly creepy and brilliantly acted, Yellowjackets only got better in its second season, despite some very conspicuous changes to the main cast.\nThe character of Akilah is only featured in the flashback storyline, but her deft Girl Scouts abilities made her something of a team leader despite their obvious limitations. It hasn't been revealed what was the ultimate fate of Akilah in the Yellowjackets timeline, but it could be speculated that she didn't make it judging by the fact that she has not appeared in the present day. The role was originally played by Keeya King, a Canadian actor who gained acclaim for playing the role of Violet in the Syfy Channel series Van Helsing. Recasting on TV is common, but the sudden change was an odd departure for the creepy series.\nFans of Yellowjackets immediately noticed a change to the supporting cast of the series when Keeya King was replaced by Nia Sondaya in the role of Akilah for season 2. As previously stated, recasting is a common practice in TV, but the departure of King was never officially explained by those involved with the show. However, Sondaya proved herself to be just as capable in the role as she grew the character who teetered between sanity and madness as she found herself swept up in the frenzy of the other girls.\nAkilah in season 2 went from just a helpful rookie with a bit of Girl Scouts experience, to a full-fledged character as she became a follower in the group's eventual descent into cannibalism. The ending of Yellowjackets season 2 left Akilah in a fascinating position, and she will likely grow more when season 3 finally rolls around and the season might also reveal her final fate. As for King's departure, it could have simply been a matter of scheduling, since the talented young actor has been quite busy since she left the cast of Yellowjackets after season 1.\nRELATED: Yellowjackets Season 2 New Cast & Returning Character Guide\nA consummate show business workhorse, Keeya King has kept herself quite busy since leaving Yellowjackets, and she has seen the size of many of her roles increase since playing in the prestigious series. In 2022, King starred in the Tubi TV original thriller film Rush For Your Life where she played journalism student Tasha who goes undercover to expose the secrets of her college's sororities. In the same year, she played the small role of Nikki in the Bruce Willis-led geezer teaser action film, Detective Knight: Rogue.\nKing's final role in 2022 was a three-episode stint on the Canadian legal drama Diggstown, and she landed another film role in 2023 when she starred in Pride: Seven Deadly Sins, a TV movie. In the Lifetime original, King played the role of Ella, which once again allowed her to expand her horizons as a dramatic actor. While she has yet to star in a project that has rivaled Yellowjackets on its critical success since she departed, it's clear that Keeya King has no issues getting work.\nDalton is a freelance writer, novelist, and filmmaker from Orlando Florida. He currently lives in Charlotte, North Carolina, and pursues writing full-time. He is an avid reader and film buff who also publishes novels on the side. Dalton graduated from the University of Central Florida with a BFA in Film and he often applies his industry-specific knowledge when writing about film and television.

With her power to rearrange the molecular structure of all matter, Atom Eve is one of most powerful heroes in any universe, something that is shown off to stunning effect in new cosplay honoring one of Invincible’s premiere superheroes.\nShared via Instagram by photographer Pat Loika, the photos depict cosplayer Kira Kelly mid-flight as Atom Eve.\nCreated by Robert Kirkman and Corey Walker, Eve’s classic superhero design is perfectly captured by Kelly's cosplay, with its bright, primary colors and a simplistic silhouette. Check out Loika and Kelly’s brilliant work below.\nRelated: Invincible's Last Line Redefines the Meaning of Omni-Man's \"Think, Mark!\" Speech\nRunning for 144 issues, Invincible was one of the most popular independent comics of the past several decades. The story of teenager Mark Grayson, son of the world's most famous superhero, featured the character following in the footsteps of his father Omni-Man, becoming the eponymous \"Invincible.\" Atom Eve is depicted throughout Invincible as Mark's one true love, a hero as formidably powerful himself, and a strong, capable love interest. Cosplayer Kira Kelly delightfully brings Eve to life, with some excellent Photoshop effects completing the effect, allowing Atom Eve to show off her matter manipulation powers with some swirling atom energy designs.\nInvincible was notable in how it followed its characters in real time, staying with Mark as he graduated from high school, went off to college, and eventually settled down and started a family with Atom Eve. In a world dominated by Marvel and DC, Invincible's ability to build its own universe of superheroes to stand alongside the Big Two was a remarkable achievement.The world of Invincible was filled with heroes and villains who felt iconic the way the best Marvel and DC characters do. There’s Atom Eve, of course, along with fellow heroes in the original Teen Team, like Robot, Dupli-Kate, Monster Girl and Atom Eve’s original boyfriend, Rex Splode.\nUnlike the Marvel and DC universes, these characters were able to grow and change in real time, making them feel like real people who were living actual lives on the page. This is one reason why Atom Eve and Invincible’s story resonates with so many readers, and why Kira Kelly's collaboration with Pat Loika, bringing to life a dynamic representation of Atom Eve, is one of the most engaging cosplays of the year. With Invincible having a second life thanks to its current Amazon Prime Video adaptation, the series' characters are still at the forefront of many fans memories, something Loika and Kelly's cosplay expertly taps into.\nSource: Pat Loika, Kira Kelly\n"}
{"title": "12 Most Iconic Disney Villain Songs, Ranked", "date": "2023-10-05 12:00:27", "text": "Whether they're sang by the villains themselves, their henchmen, or the heroes of the story, these iconic songs reveal Disney's darker side.\nThe most iconic Disney villain songs are a unique and captivating facet of the studio's musical legacy. These songs serve as a musical canvas for the darker and more complex characters in the Disney roster, allowing them to express their nefarious intentions with style and flair. These songs often encapsulate characters' motivations, fears, and aspirations, becoming integral to the overall narrative.\nAs proven by the best Disney songs of all time, the emotional depth conveyed through music allows audiences to more profoundly connect with the characters - even if they're extremely nefarious villains. Disney songs that reveal the villains' innermost desires convey just the right amount of context for adults - without crossing the line in movies made primarily for children. Both enthralling and disturbing, iconic Disney villain songs are a testament to the studio's ability to infuse even the darkest characters with a certain charm. In the musical world of Disney movies, even the most evil of villains have a chance to steal the spotlight with their wickedly enchanting melodies.\nRelated: 10 Animated Disney Movies With The Most Songs, Ranked\nThough The Jungle Book's King Louie isn't much of an antagonist, he's still technically a Disney villain, and his song is inarguably better than any other villainous tunes in the movie. Performed with lively flair, \"I Wanna Be Like You\" is a whimsical plea from the smooth-talking orangutan to Mowgli, expressing a desire to learn the secret of humanity's fire, in order to become more like humans.  \"I Wanna Be Like You\" is notable for its catchy beat, tune, and infectious rhythm with swing jazz elements, and King Louie's performance effortlessly captures the essence of fun and mischief prevalent throughout The Jungle Book.\nPerformed by the lovable bear Little John, one of the most likable members of the Robin Hood cast, \"The Phony King of England\" is a good old medieval hoedown. It isn't sang by a villain, but it's about the movie's main antagonist, the self-serving lion Prince John. A lively and humorous tune that explains the relationship between the common folk and their cowardly lion monarch, the song encapsulates the film's theme of standing up against injustice. \"The Phony King of England\" isn't that well-known compared to other iconic Disney villain songs, but it's quite a clever and well-disguised nod to folk protest songs in the real world.\nSang by the villainous Brom Bones, this song narrates the legend of the Headless Horseman, a ghostly rider seeking a replacement for his missing head in The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad. The eerie and ominous lyrics create a sense of foreboding and excitement, combined with a darkly melodic traditional pop tune that balances the themes. The song is also performed by the legendary Bing Crosby, who voices not just Brom, but also the narrator and Ichabod Crane in the movie. Largely underrated, both \"Headless Horseman\" and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad went on to inspire Disney's latter, more famous musical numbers.\n\"You're Only Second Rate\" from The Return of Jafar is performed by the charismatic antagonist Jafar himself. This song unfolds as Jafar, having returned in his quest for revenge, revels in his wickedness, malevolence, and magical prowess. In the signature style of the Aladdin franchise, the song combines Arabian influences with a Western orchestra, the perfect epic backdrop to a villain of Jafar's stature. Genie is on the unfortunate receiving end of \"You're Only Second Rate,\" and apart from the clever wordplay being funny and entertaining, it also underscores how easily Jafar can dominate Genie in a contest of magic - making the villain all the more frightening.\nRelated: Aladdin 2: The Return Of Jafar Is The Best Disney Sequel\nCruella de Vil doesn't sing her eponymous song in 101 Dalmatians. Instead, video game designer Roger comes up with \"Cruella de Vil\" on the spot at home, as his wife Anita's boss Cruella comes over for a visit. While trying to come up with the lyrics for a jazzy melody, Roger gets inspired by Cruella's impending presence, resulting in a darkly humorous and smooth tune that uses Cruella's own name as its catchy hook. With Roger's voice, the rhythm of the song is hypnotic, and serves as the perfect introduction to one of the most evil, memorable, and complete villains in Disney history.\nRelated: All 101 Dalmatian & Cruella Movies Ranked, Worst To Best\n\"Mine, Mine, Mine\" from Pocahontas is a bold and brassy musical number that epitomizes the greedy ambitions of Governor Ratcliffe. In this song, Ratcliffe expresses his desire for gold and riches as they embark on a journey to the New World - and even betrays Ratcliffe's true intentions of somehow claiming the British throne. The upbeat tempo and triumphant orchestration highlight Ratcliffe's imperialistic mindset and unchecked avarice, contrasting sharply with the film's themes of harmony and understanding. The lyrics emphasize the conquering mentality of the colonial expedition, echoing the historical narratives on which the film is based.\n\"Be Prepared\" from The Lion King is secretly one of the darkest moments hidden in a '90s children's movie. With Scar explaining his evil and meticulous plans while assembling his army, \"Be Prepared\" is an epic war anthem that illustrates Scar's cunning nature and the impending threat he poses to the Pride Lands. What's even darker is that the song was inspired by The Lion King artist Jorgen Klubein sketching Scar as Adolf Hitler. After seeing this sketch, the directors where inspired to use scenes from the Nazi propaganda film Triumph of the Will in order to give chilling life to the marching scenes in \"Be Prepared.\"\nWith its New Orleans jazz-inspired vocals and riffs, \"Oogie Boogie's Song\" set a new high standard for catchy Disney tunes - while also being perfectly suited to giving the villainous Oogie Boogie his most crucial moment in the film. One of the best songs from The Nightmare Before Christmas, \"Oogie Boogie's Song\" is an aptly soulful gem sang by the eponymous boogeyman of Halloween Town. The song is a lively, swing-inspired piece with dark undertones, blending whimsy and malevolence seamlessly, just like Oogie Boogie himself. The epitome of macabre and charming, this tune deserves the praises it has garnered over the years.\n\"Gaston\" from Beauty and the Beast is a boisterous and humorous musical number that serves as an ode to the film's primary antagonist, Gaston. Performed by Gaston himself and his fawning sidekick LeFou, the song celebrates Gaston's egoistic and testosterone-driven prowess. The upbeat and lively tune, accompanied by a tavern full of enthusiastic townsfolk, creates a jovial atmosphere that contrasts with the film's more somber moments. The lyrics humorously highlight Gaston's exaggerated self-confidence and how he's idolized by the locals, hinting at an antihero underneath the comically arrogant figure. Contextualized with the plot of Beauty and the Beast, \"Gaston\" highlights the eponymous villain's underappreciated complexity.\nRelated: 10 Disney Villains Who Were Almost Heroes\n\"Hellfire\" from The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a dark and haunting masterpiece that briefly but deeply dives into themes of lust and obsession. In a raw reveal of the character's most turbulent inner conflicts, Frollo's powerful vocals convey a sense of torment as he grapples with his forbidden desires for Esmeralda. The intense orchestration, chilling lyrics, and overall stark dramatic flair perfectly capture Frollo's struggle with its own sense of morality. \"Hellfire\" stands as a unique Disney song, pushing boundaries and exploring darker aspects, showcasing the versatility of the studio's musical repertoire.\nThe Princess and the Frog's \"Friends on the Other Side\" is sang by Dr. Facilier, arguably the most underrated Disney villain of all time. Dr. Facilier uses the catchy jazz-inspired tune to revel in his role - as an intermediary between the world of the living and the dead. From parlor tricks to actual glimpses into the other side, Dr. Facilier wows the naive and selfish Prince Naveen - and corners him into making a deal. After \"Oogie Boogie's Song\" raised the standard for soulfal jazz in Disney musical numbers, Dr. Facilier's \"Friends on the Other Side\" answered the call with this smooth, sultry, and cajun-flavored ode to voodoo.\n\"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" from The Little Mermaid is a spellbinding showcase of villainy sung by the sea witch Ursula. The song begins with Ursula telling Ariel about how she uses her powers to help the unfortunate - but it ends in Ursula's Faustian bargain to transform Ariel into a human in exchange for her voice. The sultry melody, coupled with Ursula's tongue-twisting verses and clever wordplay, captures the character's cunning nature. One of the most iconic Disney villain songs of all time, \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" is a haunting anthem about making a deal with the devil - but from the devil's abyssal point of view.\n"}
{"title": "One Small Baldur's Gate 3 Decision Makes The Battle At Last Light Inn So Much Easier", "date": "2023-10-05 12:00:27", "text": "The battle at Last Light Inn can be a challenging obstacle in Act 2 of Baldur's Gate 3, but it's possible to smooth things over with one choice.\nThe battle at Last Light Inn can be a challenging and even frustrating encounter in Act 2 of Baldur's Gate 3, but it doesn't have to be. As a deep, choice-driven roleplaying game, Baldur's Gate 3 is all about offering multiple approaches to overcoming the hurdles that it presents throughout the story. Some enemies can be defeated through persuasion rather than battlefield prowess, and certain encounters may never even arise depending on the decisions made beforehand. The ability to choose the order in which the party does many tasks can also be a great way to dodge certain complications that only arise with specific sequencing.\nLast Light Inn is a rare beacon of safety in the Shadow-Cursed Lands of Baldur's Gate 3, but the battle that occurs there threatens that sanctified nature. The Selûnite cleric Isobel provides the protection for the inn through the power of her goddess, and when the Flaming Fist traitor Marcus comes to take her away, the inn will lose that protection entirely. Avoiding this outcome in the battle requires the party to keep Isobel on her feet, a task that can be tricky given her inclination toward exposing herself to danger.\nRelated: Baldur's Gate 3: Should You Save Isobel Or Side With Marcus At The Last Light Inn?\nIt seems counter-intuitive to suggest avoiding a story encounter in Baldur's Gate 3, but when it comes to the Last Light Inn, it can actually be a viable plan. Marcus' arrival at the inn is a planned cutscene moment rather than a background activity in the world, meaning that the party has to initiate a conversation with Isobel for it to ever occur. Going about other Act 2 business instead of rushing to converse with the cleric has the odd side effect of actually protecting the inn rather than bringing it under threat.\nTaking this approach doesn't mean that the Last Light Inn has to be avoided entirely, as Isobel doesn't lurk the common area waiting to spring a cutscene upon the party. It's fully possible to explore everything else to do in the Last Light Inn before venturing out into the rest of the Shadow-Cursed Lands, as initiating the conversation with Isobel requires entering her room and approaching the porch where she performs a ritual. Although some conversational triggers in Baldur's Gate 3 are easy to initiate by accident, this isn't one of them.\nThe story of Baldur's Gate 3 makes it seem imperative to speak with Isobel, as the Shadow-Cursed Lands feature an oppressive darkness that can easily sap health from the party. Isobel, however, isn't the be-all and end-all for curing this issue. The blessing she gives the party will remove them of their need to use generic light sources like spells or torches for the moderately dangerous areas of the shadow curse, but it doesn't protect against the areas where the problem is deepest, rendering it convenient but unnecessary as a navigational tool.\nThe Moon Lantern is the actual key object for protection against the deepest areas of the shadow curse, and this can be safely acquired without Isobel's involvement. Although certain triggers can induce her to offer it to the party, it can also be acquired by venturing out with the Harpers to defeat a patrol that carries a functional Moon Lantern. This is a manageable fight that doesn't make protecting NPCs either particularly difficult or strictly necessary, so it poses little in the way of an obstacle to comfortable exploration of Baldur's Gate 3 Act 2.\nRelated: How To Get (& Fix) The Moonlantern In Baldur's Gate 3\nThe biggest concern with skipping out on the initial conversation with Isobel at the Last Light Inn would be the amount of Baldur's Gate 3 story content that could be lost by the decision, as ignoring NPCs can sometimes lead to parties missing intriguing side narratives. This method does obviously require the sacrifice of the initial key scene with Isobel, but it doesn't cut off any significant moments later in the story. The party can safely speak with her after carrying out an important mission in the Shadowfell, resulting in a different interaction that would otherwise be missed and putting the story back on the same track.\nThe consequences for this choice come back to haunt Marcus rather than Isobel, resulting in his apparent death at the hands of Ketheric Thorm in Baldur's Gate 3. When it comes to the climactic battles and story beats of Act 2, everything will ultimately sync up with the path of saving Isobel in combat while avoiding the potential risks that the battle can incur. It's undeniably the safest way to ensure that the Last Light Inn doesn't fall in Act 2, making it a reasonable option for anyone who wants to protect everyone while avoiding reloads.\nRelated: Should You Enter The Shadowfell Before Moonrise Towers In Baldur's Gate 3?\nDespite all the advantages of not talking to Isobel, it's ultimately just a surprisingly effective alternative rather than a definitive way to play through Act 2. The main downside to this method is the loss of potential XP from the Last Light battle, which could make later encounters a bit more challenging if it prevented a timely level up. It also doesn't feel quite as seamless in the story, as Act 2 is clearly written around the expectation that parties will speak to Isobel first. The later dialogue option is a nice contingency plan that shows consideration for a different order, but its more of a bandage than anything.\nUltimately, there's no wrong way to approach the story at the Last Light Inn in Baldur's Gate 3, as any technique can lead to interesting outcomes. For parties unwilling to risk the lives of the inn's inhabitants, however, talking to Isobel is the most dangerous decision to make. Various patches have made the inn fight less of a struggle than it was at launch, but no method of protecting the Last Light Inn in Baldur's Gate 3 is as surefire as leaving Isobel to her own devices.\n"}

These Tokens are essential, but at that point, there will be no easy way to find or locate Contracts and the game does not give any hint as to when these will become available. It is not until a certain quest becomes available that Basim can find and complete Contracts.\nDue to returning to stealth-favored mechanics in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, players will have to find ways to decrease their Notoriety and ask for favors from other characters. These are all connected in the game, and players might find themselves frustrated if they cannot find Contracts to earn the Khidmah Tokens. There is another way to do so, but finding Contracts is by far the easiest method.\nRelated: \"A True Return To The Series' Best\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Preview\nDuring the quest to find Ali ibn Muhammad, Basim will be tasked to regroup at the Bureau after freeing a group of rebels. This will be the point in the game where the Contract Board is available for Basim to peruse. Once it is available, interact with the Contract Board at any Bureau location, and accept any number of Contracts you want. There will usually be around five Contracts available for Basim to accept if he has none selected.\nBasim can accept every single Contract on the Board if he so wishes, and this can allow for more choices when exploring the world. It will also allow you to see where on the map the Contract is and the level of the area it is located in. Players can view more details in the menu.\nTo fulfill a Contract, go to the Investigation screen in the menu, and select “Contracts.” There will be a list of all available Contracts that Basim has accepted, select the one you want to do, and travel to the point on the map. Accepted Contracts can be seen on the map of Baghdad as a pinwheel with a question mark in it.\nOnce Basim is close, he can use Enkidu to mark the exact location and from there complete it like you would any other quest. Optional objectives are tracked from the moment you enter the Quest area to the time you finish the Contract. You will not have to return to the Bureau, instead, Basim receives the rewards as soon as he has finished the job. New Contracts will become available at the Bureau when Basim finishes a Contract on his list, which all allow Basim to explore the city of Baghdad in Assassin's Creed: Mirage.\n"}

Derrickson directed 2016's Doctor Strange, which introduced Benedict Cumberbatch's titular Master of the Mystic Arts to the MCU, and after the Phase 3 film's positive reception, Derrickson was expected to return for the much-anticipated sequel. However, despite a great deal of development on Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness taking place, Derrickson stepped down in January 2020, replaced by Raimi, yet both Derrickson and Marvel Studios noted that they were thankful for their collaboration.\nSpeaking once again in an upcoming episode of The Playlist's The Discourse Podcast, Scott Derrickson reiterated that parting ways with Marvel Studios wasn't filled with animosity. He noted that there is \"no bad blood\" between him, Marvel Studios, and Sam Raimi, though mentioned that his vision for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Marvel Studios' vision didn't match. While Derrickson wanted the sequel to be an \"extreme departure from the first film,\" and \"a genuine horror film of sorts,\" Marvel Studios went in a more light-hearted direction, shedding more light on Elizabeth Olsen's corrupted Scarlet Witch as the villain. Read an excerpt from Derrickson's interview below:\nAll I can say is that what we said publicly is exactly the truth... We had real creative differences. You know, the movie I wanted to make and how I wanted to make it was different than–it was just increasingly obvious that we were pulling against each other. And that’s how you make a really bad movie, I think. When the producer or the studio and the filmmaker are making different movies, you end up with a monstrosity and, you know, that’s why I had to bounce... I went to the premiere. I’m still friends with Kevin [Feige] and everything with me and Marvel is really cool... They invited me to the premiere and I went. And I’m friends with Sam [Raimi]. I love Sam, so there’s no bad blood over that.\n ​​​​​​​\nConcept art from Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness revealed details about Scott Derrickson's original plans, which would have focused on a different villain and provided more insight into Doctor Strange's backstory in the MCU. While Elizabeth Olsen had signed on to be involved in Multiverse of Madness prior to Derrickson's departure, the villain of the film would have been Nightmare, the ruler of Marvel Comics' Dream Dimension. After battling Dormammu, the ruler of the Dark Dimension, in 2016's Doctor Strange, Strange going toe-to-toe with Nightmare in the sequel would have been fantastic, though it seems Strange and the Scarlet Witch would have teamed up against the villain.\nThe original Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness would have also shown audiences Strange's sister, Donna's, tragic death in the Wendigo Forest in their childhood, which was mentioned in Raimi's version of the film. It was also reported that the multiverse would have been explored in far more detail, with Strange traveling to numerous new realities, expanding on the dark, otherworldly multiverse that was glimpsed throughout the first film. Sam Raimi's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was met with a mixed response, but Derrickson's gritty exploration of Strange's persona, and the MCU's multiverse as a whole, might have been more popular.\nSource: The Playlist\n"}

Created by Casper Kelly (Adult Swim), very Short Treks celebrates the 50th anniversary of Star Trek: The Animated Series. The five very Short Treks episodes, which are decidedly not part of Star Trek canon, are animated in Filmation's style from the 1970s, with some modern animation from Star Trek: Lower Decks and Star Trek: Prodigy worked in.

Star Trek legacy actors who returned include George Takei as Mr. Sulu, Jonathan Frakes as Commander William Riker, Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher, Armin Shimerman as Quark, Ethan Phillips as Neelix, and Connor Trinneer, who played Commander Trip Tucker for the first time since Star Trek: Enterprise ended in 2005.

The premise of the third comedic short involves Star Trek: The Next Generation's Commander Will Riker, Dr. Beverly Crusher, and an unnamed crewman from the USS Enterprise-D attempting to make First Contact. \"Worst Contact\" rapidly devolves into gross-out humor by the aliens who resemble the Talosians from the first Star Trek pilot, \"The Cage.\" There's not much to enjoy in \"Worst Contact\" besides hearing McFadden and Frakes play Dr. Crusher and Riker again (with Beverly calling Commander Riker \"Bill\").\nYou can watch \"Worst Contact\" here:\n\"Skin a Cat\" is an inauspicious debut for Star Trek: very Short Treks. Set aboard the USS Enterprise of Star Trek: The Animated Series, the short has some clever jokes involving turns of phrase that the increasingly strange alien crew members of the Enterprise take offense to. While Ethan Peck plays Mr. Spock in lieu of the late Leonard Nimoy, Pete Holmes plays a confused, generic starship Captain who doesn't seem to be James T. Kirk (thankfully). The oddball designs of some of the alien Enterprise crew are funny, but the overall experience of watching \"Skin a Cat\" leaves a lot to be desired.\nYou can watch \"Skin a Cat\" here:\nThe presence of a very much alive Lt. Hemmer, and Nyota Uhura wearing a Starfleet Cadet's uniform, confirms Star Trek: very Short Treks episode 2 is set during Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 1. A holiday party aboard the Starship Enterprise turns awkward fast when Lt. Spock unveils a \"blooper reel\" where the jokes are thousands of horrific deaths in a nod to the series premiere of Star Trek: Discovery, crew members being maimed by transporter malfunctions, and Spock getting dumped by his Vulcan fiancée, T'Pring (Gia Sandhu). The gallows humor of Spock not understanding what a \"blooper\" is does come off as funny, and \"Holiday Party\" is a step up from \"Skin a Cat.\"\nYou can watch \"Holiday Party\" here:\nThe final Star Trek: very Short Treks episode ends the series on a musical high note. Going full meta, \"Walk, Don't Run\" is hosted by Star Trek: Lower Decks' Ensign D'Vana Tendi (prior to her season 4 promotion to Lieutenant, junior grade). Unfortunately, the upbeat Tendi runs afoul of Scotty (Carlos Alazraqui), who takes offense to some of the Orion's verbiage. But their arguments, which include an amusing debate about Star Trek: The Animated Series' rec room vs. Lower Decks' holodeck, are diffused by the arrival of Commander Riker and Mr. Sulu, who kick off a wacky musical number. Of course, the song in \"Walk, Don't Run\" can't compete with the quality of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds' musical numbers, but Noël Wells' singing voice as Tendi shines in this homage to animated Star Trek combining the TAS and Lower Decks animation styles.\nYou can watch \"Walk, Don't Run\" here:\nAt a breakneck two minutes, \"Holograms All The Way Down\" is half the length of the other Star Trek: very Short Trek episodes, but it crams in over a dozen Star Trek characters and manages to be genuinely funny. Written by Star Trek: Prodigy executive producer Aaron J. Waltke, \"Holograms All The Way Down\" kicks off by returning to the Enterprise NX-01 with sly wink at Commander Trip Tucker's death in Star Trek: Enterprise's controversial series finale before it turns into a madcap holodeck adventure uniting characters from every Star Trek series, including Star Trek: Prodigy. \"Holograms All The Way Down\" even jokes about Star Trek: Deep Space Nine's classic \"In The Pale Moonlight\" as the holodeck plot spins toward a truly bizarre sight gag. \"Holograms All The Way Down\" is easily the best Star Trek: very Short Treks episode, and it's a loving ode to Star Trek overall.\nYou can watch \"Holograms All The Way Down\" here:\nJohn Orquiola is Screen Rant's Star Trek Beat Editor, Senior Features staff writer, and interviewer."}

{"title": "The Boogeyman Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-05 12:10:26", "text": "The Boogeyman ties up its loose ends and sees Sadie battling the titular monster. We break down the film's ending & the changes from the short story.\nWarning: This post contains spoilers for The BoogeymanThe Boogeyman’s ending ties things up, but teases a potential second chapter to the story. Directed by Rob Savage from a screenplay by ​​Scott Beck, Bryan Woods, Mark Heyman, The Boogeyman is adapted from Stephen King’s short story of the same name. The horror film, which has received mostly positive reviews from critics, includes a final scene that suggests the story may not be over, and that The Boogeyman 2 could potentially be on the horizon.\nThe Boogeyman ends with Sadie (Sophie Thatcher), Sawyer (Vivien Lyra Blair), and Will Harper (Chris Messina) battling the titular creature. The Boogeyman is intent on killing Sadie and Sawyer, and uses Will as bait after killing Rita, Lester Billings’ wife. After a few violent attacks, Sadie and Sawyer set fire to the terrifying creature. Seemingly dead, the house also catches fire, but Sadie and her family are able to make it outside to safety. Sadie and Sawyer return to therapy, and Will finally talks about his grief. After the session, Sadie hears the voice of the therapist, but the closet door is open, indicating The Boogeyman’s presence.\nSadie hears what she believes is her therapist’s voice calling out to her, but when she enters the room there’s no one there. The closet opens on its own and as Sadie draws closer, there’s a sense that the creature is still around, taunting her. She’s pulled back to reality by the actual therapist, and The Boogeyman is never shown. But after a fiery end, could The Boogeyman still be alive? It’s possible Sadie is hearing things after such a traumatic experience. She’s still reeling from what happened, but it could also be that a creature like The Boogeyman never truly dies, haunting its victims until they’re dead.\nThe Boogeyman stays in the shadows and shies away from light, therefore it can only be bested by fire. Fire is the original source of light discovered by humans, and brought people out of the dark at night. Hypothetically, this also kept the monsters at bay, so it makes sense that The Boogeyman, an ancient creature, would be afraid of fire; it’s the one thing that can cause it physical harm. Humans can wield fire to combat it, since the creature can control regular lights, flicking them off at will. It’s why Rita had so many candles lit in her house, which kept The Boogeyman at bay.\nThe monster called The Boogeyman has many origin points. First and foremost, what The Boogeyman is can be traced back to a short story written by Stephen King. The story follows a man named Lester Billings, who is telling a therapist, Will Harper, about the monster terrorizing him and his family. In terms of the movie's lore, The Boogeyman's origins are somewhat murky, but it's clear that it has existed for quite a long time. Furthermore, The Boogeyman seemingly appears after a significant trauma has occurred, or an individual is overcome with grief. The Boogeyman also targets children over adults, therefore, a grieving child like Sadie is the perfect target.\nThe Boogeyman latches onto those who are emotionally vulnerable. The Boogeyman sought out children specifically because they were easier to scare, preying on their weaknesses and emotional exposure in a way that it couldn’t do as easily with adults. Children and teenagers were also less likely to be believed by adults regarding what they were seeing, thus isolating them completely from their support systems. This allows The Boogeyman to lurk and toy with its prey, mimicking the voices children trusted, including their parents, to lure them into the shadows before attacking. Without the emotional vulnerability, the creature wouldn’t be as strong as it is.\nThe creature set its sights on Sadie and Sawyer after following Lester to their home. The sisters were still emotionally raw from the death of their mother a month before, and they were grieving her loss. Their guards were down, making it easy for The Boogeyman to make them its victims. Unlike their father, Sadie and Sawyer were open about their grief. They were also isolated — Sadie couldn’t rely on her friends or Will, who refused to talk about his wife or openly grieve like his daughters, and Sawyer faced The Boogeyman alone at first since no one believed her.\nWhen Lester (David Dastmalchian) comes to Will Harper for help after The Boogeyman killed Lester's kids, the creature continues taunting him until he is dead. Though the nightmarish creature tends to only go after children, it likely went after Lester because he actually believed The Boogeyman existed, and he felt guilty about not being there for his kids. Lester believed his children when they said they saw it, and he was vulnerable emotionally, wanting others to know that the monster existed. Will, on the other hand, was in denial; he was also less vulnerable, closed off emotionally from himself and his kids.\nThe Boogeyman’s ending teases that the creature is not actually dead, and that it could come back to attack Sadie and Sawyer. The Boogeyman is relentless in preying on its victims, and there’s no way to determine whether the monster is permanently dead or if setting it on fire was just a temporary setback. It’s possible the creature could return, terrorizing Sadie and Sawyer until they’re dead before setting its sights on another family. Battling the ancient monster again could be redundant, but The Boogeyman left off in a way that sees Sadie’s family united, which might force the creature to up its game in a sequel.\nStephen King’s short story is wildly different from the film adaptation. Whereas the short story is focused on a long conversation between Lester Billings and Will Harper, The Boogeyman movie expands the story to include Will’s daughters. In the source material, Sadie and Sawyer don’t factor into the story at all; they’re created for the film adaptation. In fact, Lester is the main character, and The Boogeyman short story follows his retelling of the events leading to the death of his three kids, ending with him coming face-to-face with the creature. Everything after that is an addition. It’s only after Lester dies in the movie that the story truly begins.\nThe Boogeyman attaches grief and emotional vulnerability with a monster preying on victims. Despite Sadie and her family getting to a much better place, with Will openly talking about the loss of his wife and The Boogeyman seemingly dying in physical form, the film suggests that grief will continue to be prevalent in one’s life no matter how much time has passed. Discussing it openly and allowing oneself to feel the sadness and loss of a loved one helps, but grief lingers. So regardless of Sadie defeating The Boogeyman and going to therapy with her family, the trauma remains, even if it’s no longer a physical manifestation.\n"}
{"title": "12 Things You Didn't Know About John Wick's Dogs", "date": "2023-10-05 12:10:26", "text": "The John Wick franchise is likely known for 3 things by now; Keanu Reeves being back, Keanu Reeves' Training Regime, and dogs. \nThe John Wick franchise is likely known for two things by now - Keanu Reeves' training regime and the John Wick dogs. It's strange to think a series of action films that have done so well critically and financially are equally popular with fans of high-octane tightly choreographed gun-fu action sequences and lovers of canine companions. Dogs have been so centric to the John Wick films that they've acted as motivation for Wick's revenge, helped him in his recovery, and aided John in fights. The first John Wick movie was all about his dog, as the bad guys killed the pup (Daisy), that was sent to him by his deceased wife.\nThe dog is what sent John Wick on his mission of vengeance to begin with. John got another dog, a pitbull, in the John Wick ending, and he has been his good boy and companion ever since. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum introduces combat dogs, and John Wick: Chapter 4's dog brings the franchise full circle. The dogs have played almost as big a role as any human and are more trustworthy than most. With that in mind, it's no surprise that there are many dog-related facts pertaining to the action series, and there's more to the John Wick dogs than the movies reveal.\nDaisy, the John Wick dog whose death inspired the line \"Yeah, I'm thinking I'm back,\" was played by an animal actor named Andy. It was actually his first role, at eight months old, purchased from a breeder specifically for the film. According to Animal Actors International trainer Kim Krafsky, a beagle was picked because \"There's this thing about them, they're just cute\" (via New York Post). Andy took to the press circuit with the rest of the cast. Following his big-screen debut, Andy took some time off, spending it on the Animal Actors International farm in New Jersey.\nJohn Wick has had two faithful four-legged companions. In the franchise sequels, John is joined by a pitbull named Bubba. Originally though, Wick owned a beagle named Daisy, left to him by his deceased wife who was tragically murdered spurring the events of the first film. Arguably, the death of this John Wick dog was the thing that made his unending revenge kill streak relatable. However, John Wick director Chad Stahelski revealed that they almost didn't go through with the dog's death. The director explained:\n\"We were risking credit cards, a house mortgage, everything. [Producer] Basil Iwanyk put his company up. And then you have that day where you realize we’re doing all this and we’re killing a puppy? I thought we would never come back from it.\"\nUnfortunately, Daisy dies in the first ten minutes of John Wick, but in the film's final scenes, John adopts a pitbull to save it from being put down. This John Wick dog has been played by two different animals in both John Wick: Chapter 2 and John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum. Chapter 2 saw the part played by Burton (who Keanu took to calling Bubba), and then Cha Cha in Parabellum (via Pup Help). John's second sidekick has yet to be given a name, likely because the assassin doesn't want to get too attached. Not even John Wick: Chapter 4 revealed the John Wick dog's name.\nA common saying in Hollywood goes\" \"Never work with children or animals,\" inferring that they will steal every scene they're in, and often make shooting said scenes more difficult. This was definitely the case while filming the third John Wick movie in New York. The animal actor Cha Cha, the second dog who played Wick's pitbull, picked a fight with a horse. Luckily Cha Cha came out of the altercation unharmed. It was likely caused by the onset of chaos due to the stress of shooting in such a loud and high-pressure environment, especially as even the horses were involved in the action sequences.\nIn John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, John Wick calls in a favor from the manager of the Casablanca branch of the Continental Hotel, Sofia Al-Awar (Halle Berry). The character constantly has two Belgian Malinois Shepherds by her side, but these dogs weren't played by only two dogs. They were in fact played by five separate stunt dogs so that different animal actors could be used for different stunts, and so that no individual dog became too stressed or fatigued. The John Wick dogs were named; Santana, Tai, Sam 7, Boyca, and Ikar, and each had a special relationship with their on and off-screen handler, Halle Berry (via The Ringer).\nRELATED: John Wick Chapter 5 - If It's Happening, Possible Story & Everything We Know\nThey might not be John Wick's dogs, but Sofia's Belgian Shepherds steal the show in John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum. They pull off impressive stunts during the Casablanca shootout, but there wasn't an animal handler just off-camera or hiding in the scene. The Belgian Shepherds were basically Halle Berry's dogs. Following her casting as Sofia, Berry had a sit-down chat with the directors, in which they discussed how hands-on the role would be. Not only did she take on combat and weapons training regimes as vigorous as Reaves, but she also spent time training and bonding with the dogs (via The Ringer).\nDuring the filming of their big action set piece in John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, Halle Berry and the filmmakers only really had one problem keeping the dogs well-behaved. The scene was filmed in the North African country Morroco, an area in which stray cats roam in large numbers and care little for Hollywood film sets. According to John Wick 3's Halle Berry, the cats were, \"everywhere, and when my dogs saw cats they went ballistic.\" In an interview included on the film's Blu-ray, Berry goes on to explain that cats would stroll onto the set and the dogs would chase after them mid-scene, disrupting the filmmaking process.\nPractical stunt work is a big part of the John Wick franchise with the vast majority of what's seen achieved by actors and stuntmen. This extends to the John Wick dogs as well. In a podcast, director Chad Stahelski weighed in on the dogs. The director said, \"There's no such thing as a movie dog. It's just a dog doing his thing on set\" (via ReelBlend). As a result, some of the hardest scenes to film involved trained animals. \"When a dog attacks, it's actually trying to injure a person.\" When viewers see a dog attack a character, it's really going for the attack and is not acting.\nIn John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, there is a stunt where one of Sofia's dogs leaps from her back and climbs up a second-story balcony. There was no CGI involved. The film's visual effects supervisor, Rob Nederhorst, pointed out on Twitter that all dog-related stunts were real, including the wall climb (via The Slate). \"The dog climbed up that wall. Our action team was incredible and I am honored to have worked with them.\" It's actually well within the realms of reality for a dog to clear a 5-foot jump with a running start or to scramble up a 15-foot wall, and that's without the added benefit of a Halle Berry leg-up.\nAndy, the animal actor who played the first John Wick dog, Daisy, was only eight months old when he took on the pivotal role in the 2014 movie. In that respect, it's not surprising that he wasn't the most well-trained of animal actors. In the opening scenes of the film, Andy is shown palling around the house with Keanu Reeves, but he often missed his mark. In fact, the only way to entice Andy into jumping onto John's bed and licking his face was to spread bacon grease on the actor's cheeks (via Pup Help).\nWhile the filmmakers loved to praise the stuntwork - humans and dogs alike - and practical effects, there was at least one area with CGI. Trainers point dogs in a direction, and the dogs do what their training calls for, but dogs are not actors. For many reasons, a dog cannot bite an actor in the crotch and do so practically and safely. In the third John Wick movie, the dogs were taught to play-attack the bad guys, but it needed to look real. CGI cones were placed over the stunt performer's crotches, so CGI could make the damage caused by the John Wick dogs look real in the end.\nWhile Mr. Nobody's dog in John Wick: Chapter 4 doesn't have a name and is only referred to in production notes as the \"faithful accomplice,\" Stahelski became extremely close with the dog, or the five dogs, that played the combat-loving canine (via AS). The director revealed, “Not only did I get acquainted with them, I worked to understand their energy and build a believable relationship.” Each of the five trained John Wick dogs had their own specific skill that the faithful accomplice showcases in the fourquel, as Stahelski added, “Each one had a different personality, energy, and skill set. One dog did the tugging, another fetched.”\nKieran has a Bachelor of Arts in Screenwriting and Film Studies, which he mostly uses as a conversation piece and professionally on occasion. In the past, he's written film reviews, short stories, scripts, and has acted as a script consultant.\nCurrently splitting his time between Madrid and Chicago, Stephen Barker has been a staff writer at Screen Rant since 2020. Since graduating from Manchester Metropolitan University with a bachelor's degree in Film, Television, and Cultural Studies in 2014, he has written for numerous movie and music websites.

{"title": "Where Was The Boogeyman Filmed? 2023 Horror Movie's Filming Locations Explained", "date": "2023-10-05 12:20:29", "text": "Though The Boogeyman looks like it could have been filmed in any American suburb, the horror flick actually took place in one specific, spooky city.\nThe Stephen King adaptation The Boogeyman has the look of a movie that could take place just about anywhere, making it all the more scary, however as it turns out, the horror film was actually shot in one particular place. The Boogeyman is a 2023 horror movie following teenager Sadie and her younger sister Sawyer as the grief the sudden death of their mother, and at the same time, begin to contend with a shadowy monster inside their home. The film is adapted from a 1973 short story of the same name by horror legend Stephen King.\nPart of what makes The Boogeyman so creepy is the sense that the events of the film could happen to anyone, anywhere. Though the audience watches the Harper family be terrorized by The Boogeyman monster, the smallness of the film's world makes it seem like the viewers could just as easily be the victims. This ambiance is created by building a narrow and generic world through which the film takes place. Audiences follow Sadie at home, at school, and around town, but the movie goes no further than that. Therefore, Sadie's world could just as easily be ours. However, The Boogeyman was filmed somewhere, so where is it?\nRelated: The Boogeyman 2: Is It Happening? Plot Setup & Everything We Know\nAccording to The Cinemaholic, one generic location that The Boogeyman used during filming was McDonogh 35 Senior High School, located in Louisiana. The school is located on 4000 Cadillac Street in the city of New Orleans. Although The Boogeyman is a horror movie, this school is not abandoned or creepy in any sense. In fact, McDonogh 35 Senior High School is still in use, with actual students in attendance currently. It is unclear how production of The Boogeyman affected the school.\nThe use of McDonogh 35 Senior High School comes into play in The Boogeyman during the scenes when Sadie is at school. This mostly occurs near the start of the film, particularly when Sadie returns to school for the first time after her mother's death. In one scene, Sadie is approached by a group of cruel popular girls, and she gets into an altercation with them. Clearly, The Boogeyman's use of this real-life Louisiana school helped in creating a generic atmosphere. Sadie's school looks entirely real, and like any other high school where this could happen to anybody.\nThe rest of The Boogeyman was filmed in other areas of New Orleans, Louisiana. This is an interesting location because of its history of creepy activity, and also, its recognizable locales. In an interview with NOLA, director Rob Savage said \"We wanted this to feel like Anytown, USA — like every Stephen King movie. You want it to feel like it could be anywhere, like it could be your hometown. But when I first got to New Orleans, the aesthetic qualities were so powerful, I was really pushing to get more and more of that in the movie.\" So, despite the fact that Savage desired a broad look for The Boogeyman, New Orleans' unique tones won out.\nApart from McDonogh 35 Senior High School, the rest of The Boogeyman was filmed in and around New Orleans. Presumably, the filmmakers shot vast amounts of the film in the New Orleans suburbs, including the scenes in the Harpers' home like the fiery final sequence at the end of The Boogeyman. Though Savage was taken by the city's spooky atmosphere, the film still feels encompassing enough to be anywhere. In this way, The Boogeyman strikes a balance between being relatable and atmospheric.\nSources: The Cinemaholic, NOLA\n"}

The series ran for three seasons on Amazon Prime Video and ended just shortly after the Roman invasion of Britain.\nVinland Saga brings the world of the best medieval TV shows into the anime format. There are several anime options when looking at medieval stories, but Vinland Saga sits at the top of the list as the best of the best. Based on the Makoto Yukimura manga series, this follows protagonist Thorfinn, a former warrior of a band of pirates led by Askeladd. He is also the son of one of the world's greatest warriors, Thors. Vinland Saga, which just finished season 2, is set in the world of Vikings, this is a revenge story that sees Thorfinn going after the man who killed his father, and his rise into legend as his journey continues.\nThe Legend of El Cid remains one of the best medieval TV shows on Amazon Prime Video. Set in the 11th century, the Spanish historical drama follows the life of Ruy, a young squire who uncovers a scandal that involves a conspiracy to murder and a plan to commit regicide. However, by bringing this to everyone's attention, Ruy puts himself and his loved ones in danger. Partially inspired by the story of the real-life knight and nobleman, El Cid received praise for the way it manages to build suspense and gripping cliffhangers. The fact that the characters aren't one-dimensional has compelled the viewers to stick with the show.\nAlthough it only ran for two seasons, Knightfall stands as one of the best medieval TV shows ever made. Set in the 14th century, Knightfall was a series that explored the lives of several soldiers in the Knight Templar as they tried to keep their power and influence in the Holy Land. While there were a few who criticized the plot and uneven storytelling, many believed that the directors more than made up for it with the battle sequences and the fight choreography. There are also some dynamic characters as well as some compelling and complex villains (which viewers will love to hate).\nWith three seasons and a star-studded cast under its belt, Medici stands out as one of the best medieval TV shows. Chronicling the rise and fall of the infamous Italian family, Medici is a series that is full of corruption, rivalries, and political strife (which has viewers engaged from the get-go). It's not all full of drama either, as the writers also managed to find a perfect balance between romance and action. While Medici wasn't always historically accurate since they had to dramatize a few events for the sake of some storyline, it does provide an insight into how influential and powerful the Medicis were in 15th-century Florence.\nWhether it's the cool battle sequences, the interesting storylines (that are inspired by the Legend), or because it has some of the best characters, Merlin has managed to captivate the audience for years as one of the best medieval TV shows. Although Merlin isn't historically accurate (especially in terms of costumes and doesn't exactly follow the classic tales), some viewers might not care since the show does focus a lot on fantasy and include a lot of mythological creatures. There's not a lot of blood or gore either, so it's great for those who want something light-hearted and fun.\nHoning in on Polo's years in the court of Kublai Khan of the Mongol Empire, Marco Polo mostly diverges from Western themes, focusing instead on China circa the Yuan Dynasty. Although this Netflix series only lasted 2 seasons, it's rich with character drama containing twists and turns, along with lavish set pieces loosely based on Eastern history. Its robust budget of $200 million can be seen in its rich cinematography and sleek production value, making it one of the best looking of the best medieval TV shows on Netflix.\nBeing based on a historical novel, this miniseries crams a wealth of interesting backstories and authenticity into each of its eight episodes. As viewers would imagine from a show based on an English civil war called \"The Anarchy,\" there are plenty of gripping, dramatic moments to be had in one of the best medieval TV shows. The show keeps a narrow focus on the one hand - revolving around the construction of a cathedral while granting a deep and vast narrative involving several unique characters. Lavish backdrops, along with standout performances by Ian McShane and Hayley Atwell, give The Pillars of the Earth an enriching sense of authenticity.\nThe cutthroat era of Europe 1,000 years ago seems rife with potential when it comes to compelling murder mysteries. This British series from the mid-90s takes advantage of this, crafting engaging crime plots dressed in 12th-century English settings. One of the best medieval TV shows, it takes the premise of Columbo and fuses it with Game of Thrones motifs, making for a distinctly entertaining show. Even with the fun potential of the protagonist's background as a Crusader-turned-Monk, Cadfael focuses on dynamic writing and interesting plots to keep its viewers enticed rather than action.\nWhile Michael Hirst is perhaps most known for his work on Vikings, a similarly dense, compelling historical drama of his found its way on BBC years before. The Tudors takes place several centuries after that show, honing in on England in the period between the Dark Ages and Modernity; the Renaissance. This transitional era sets the stage for a wealth of major events, and Hirst takes advantage of this. While The Tudors runs with some creative liberties, the show uses both fiction and history to round out one of the best medieval TV shows about King Henry VIII.\nIt's true that a cartoon centered around talking mice isn't exactly authentic to history. Yet, this whimsical fantasy uses medieval themes to paint this majestic scene while also appealing to kids. This Canadian animation draws from the popular fantasy novels by Brian Jacques, with each of its three seasons comprising a different book. Focusing on a once-poor mouse named Matthias, the show captures the often gritty nature of medieval living, while balancing it with lighthearted humor. A number of colorful characters and fun fantasy themes round out this charming cartoon.\nRELATED: The Game Of Thrones Jon Snow Spinoff - News, Cast, & Everything We Know\nAnyone who loved Game of Thrones, but wanted to see something that was a bit more on the mark historically should seek out the docudrama Rise of Empires: Ottoman, one of the best medieval TV shows on Netflix. Forget about the fantastical demons and monsters from Game of Thrones. The real-life historical events this series focuses on are just as dramatic and exciting as any supernatural attack. Rise of Empires: Ottoman deals with the fall of the Holy Roman Empire and looks at the successors in Constantinople and the creation of Istanbul after the conquest by Mehmed II.\nBased largely upon the reign of Queen Isabella of Castile, Isabel has proven to be quite an underrated addition to the best medieval TV shows. Like GoT, this series shows the rise to power of various major figures of royal families, along with the inevitable drama, struggles, and clashes that come with them. This short-lived Spanish show features terrific performances by Michelle Jenner as Isabel, Rodolfo Sancho as Ferdinand of Aragon, and Pablo Derqui as Henry of Castile. This is enhanced by some authentic Spanish settings and complex societal/political happenings, including the voyage of Christopher Columbus and the Spanish Inquisition.\nWhile there are a number of the best medieval TV shows loosely based on English history of the Middle Ages, BBC Two's The Hollow Crown portrays this period from a more accurate and authentic angle, honing in on major events like the Wars of the Roses. The show draws from the captivating works of Shakespeare's second tetralogy, which includes plays such as The Life and Death of King Richard II. The authentic set pieces, tremendous acting by Benedict Cumberbatch, Judi Dench, and others, and the rich source material offer a solid foundation for this action-tinged drama.\nWhile there are plenty of the best medieval TV shows that focus on the late Middle Ages, The Last Kingdom revolves around the even more violent and cutthroat era of 9th-century England. As it dates back to a time of instability, where Britain is fractured into various (often warring) kingdoms - drama, strife, and outright conflict are guaranteed. It also shows the further destabilizing factor of the Northmen raiders becoming emboldened and mounting assaults on the island. The Last Kingdom sets the stage for some intense and epic battle scenes rarely seen on television. A plethora of enticing narratives and rich characters help flesh out this epic historical show.\nIt's tough to find a more iconic blend of history and mythology than the legendary Robin Hood; a figure who's seen no shortage of adaptations over the years and decades. One of the lesser-known, but nonetheless stronger examples of this folklore hero come in the form of the British TV series, Robin of Sherwood, by Richard Carpenter. While it now seems like a mere distant blip on the radar, running from 1984 to 1986, this drama quietly developed a cult following thanks to its gripping portrayal which blends realism with imaginative mythology, enhanced by an engrossing atmosphere.\nSome areas of history don't even need to be decorated with many fictional or fantastical elements to be entertaining. Such is the case with Vikings, the epic Michael Hirst portrayal of 9th-century Scandinavian society. That's not to say creative liberties aren't taken, yet the grandiosity and fun plots of this action-drama do largely draw from real Viking events and cultural traits. One of the best medieval TV shows, it distills this tale down to a rather simple premise of raiders and explorers seeking a more prosperous new life with new lands. The popularity of Vikings even spawned a spinoff series.\nWhile there are quite a few glimpses into the wondrous and often dark events of the Middle Ages in Europe, this South Korean epic from 2015 demonstrates that the East is similarly rife with thrilling tales of heroism and political strife. The Korean period drama Six Flying Dragons merges real and fictional characters along with settings and premises loosely based on real events. Specifically, it portrays the founding of the Joseon Dynasty in the 14th century, where Neo-Confucianism began to reside over Buddhism, and a cascade of change elsewhere resided over this society, shown through the eyes of Prince Lee Bang Won.\nDespite its brief seven-episode run and the cinematic limitations as a result of the dated '70s production, this French-German swashbuckling tale is nonetheless a rich and entertaining watch. The show follows a Scottish adventurer by the name of Quentin, who finds himself in the midst of a feud that wipes out his entire clan. The series, part of an unofficial trilogy that included King Arthur movie Knights of the Round Table, sees the downtrodden protagonist must find his way in this hostile environment while he heads to France to rendezvous with his only living relative and reach the French court of Louis XI.\nVikings: Valhalla is the spinoff of the original Vikings series and remains one of the best medieval TV shows on TV as it released its second season in 2023. The series takes place 100 years after the previous series ended and details the Norse quest to conquer England after the St. Brice's Day massacre in 1002 A.D. The three Vikings the show focuses on are Harald Sigurdsson, Leif Erikson, and Freydis Eirsdottir. Like the original series, there are a lot of historical characters and events in the series, mixed judiciously with fictional events and characters to create high drama and a very exciting follow-up to the original series as well as the best medieval TV show.\n"}

The anticipation surrounding the arrival of the newest iteration of the X-Men has started to reach fever pitch, even warranting a tongue-in-cheek mention in She-Hulk as Jennifer Walters asks K.E.V.I.N. when they are due as a favor to the fans. Unfortunately, it got no straight answer - but a recent development in the real world has given a pretty big clue, instead.\nNow that the Writers Guild of America strikes have ended, it is full steam ahead on developing the MCU X-Men movie - something which was confirmed by Marvel's recent call-out for writer pitches for its \"anticipated X-Men movie.\" The decision on who will be picked to write the movie will then be decided \"at the top of 2024,\" and it is this that gives a clue on when thee X-Men as individuals will start making their appearances. Specifically, it will probably be in the next two Avengers movies.\nRelated: All The X-Men Movies In Chronological Order\nWith development now in its earliest stages, it's extremely likely that the MCU's X-Men movie will be a Phase 7 release. Every upcoming Marvel movie release so far includes many anticipated MCU introductions such as Blade and the Fantastic Four, meaning the X-Men can hold off on their grand entrance for another phase. This is a good thing for ensuring the anticipation for their arrival builds - but it doesn't mean that none of the MCU's X-Men will appear in other capacities before then. Nor would that make sense.\nDeadpool 3 is looking poised to have fun with a roster of Fox's X-Men, but will likely be used to draw a line under that franchise before moving on with a new cast. With the likes Spider-Man and Black Panther being introduced ahead of their own solo outing, however, it is still extremely possible that the X-Men will be introduced ahead of theirs. Nowhere would this be more appropriate than in Avengers: Secret Wars - and it would be a wise move.\nIn a sense, the MCU has already been laying the groundwork for the introduction of the X-Men by establishing a number of MCU mutants already. The X-Men specifically, though, comprise a lot of iconic individuals, and introducing them all at once would probably be too much for one solo movie. Instead, establishing someone like Wolverine, Professor X, or Magneto ahead of time will help make the group outing easier to manage. Although it is still possible that an X-Man or two might appear before the new Avengers movie, the multiverse focus of each seems to set them both up to be the place that the MCU X-Men will start to be drip-fed to the audience, which is an incredibly exciting prospect.\nOllie discovered his love for all things nerdy very early on in life and has only gotten nerdier with age after only discovering the magic of Dungeons & Dragons in his 30s. A steady diet of Pokémon, superheroes, Harry Potter, and video games culminated in a career centered around these topics for such publications as MMOGames.com, all in the name of spending as much of his waking life as possible delving into worlds far more whimsical than the real one.  "}
{"title": "10 Horror Movies That Changed The Rules Forever", "date": "2023-10-05 12:30:28", "text": "From Psycho to Saw, these essential spooky movies broke all the rules when they were released, and would ultimately change the horror genre forever.\nThe horror genre is arguably the most inventive genre in movies, and some horror films have been so groundbreaking that they changed the genre's conventions completely. By altering the genre's fundamental aspects and audience expectations, these movies were able to deliver highly effective scares. The result was that they completely changed the horror movie landscape, influencing all that came next.\nHorror is a genre known for pushing the boundaries, but some movies pushed them so far that they broke and were never the same again. From Alfred Hitchcock to Wes Craven, several horror maestros have shaped the genre in very substantial ways. This was only achieved by bucking previous horror movie standards, and completely breaking the previous rules.\nBefore Night of the Living Dead, zombies were voodoo slaves, sometimes (but not always) raised from the dead. Movies like White Zombie popularized the monsters, which while lumbering and mindless, were not the flesh-devourers audiences now know. George A. Romero's first zombie movie, however, changed this forever. Instead, 1968's Night of the Living Dead featured undead zombies hungry for human flesh. While Romero refrained from terming them zombies, a string of imitations were released which were happy to incorporate the designation, and thus, the modern zombie was born.\nThe next major development with zombie movies was Danny Boyle's 2002 movie, 28 Days Later​​​​​. Rather than living dead, these creatures moved very quickly, infected with a rage virus that triggered cannibalistic murder and extreme violence. Like Romero, Boyle was careful not to call his monsters \"zombies,\" and instead opted for the \"infected.\" The result was two-fold: firstly, subsequent zombie movies employed this speedier, more lethal updated zombie; and secondly, zombie movies garnered a connection with infection - leading to a string of contagion movies.\nBefore 1960's Psycho, cinemas would play movies on a loop, and patrons could arrive whenever they desired - staying to watch the beginning of the movie as necessary. Alfred Hitchcock changed this, and not just for horror. Concerned audiences would spoil the ending for themselves, Hitchcock insisted that nobody be allowed entry after the screening commenced. This would ultimately become somewhat standard in all cinema. If this wasn't enough, Hitchcock also made the bold move to kill off the movie's star (Janet Lee) in the opening act. This was later lampooned by Scream, which also used it to undermine the audience's presumption of the upcoming plot.\nIt seems most horror movies these days deploy a last-minute scare, jolting its audience one final time. Typically, these occur after the perceived threat has been defeated - leaving speculation open to the horrors continuing after audiences are safely exiting the cinema. This, however, never existed before the 1976 adaptation of Stephen King's Carrie. Brian De Palma's classic waited until the very end before delivering one final fright, Carrie's hand thrusting its way through the rubble and grasping a survivor. While it may appear like a tiresome trope to modern viewers, this scene startled audiences to their core in 1976. A later famous example comes at the end of Friday the 13th.\nOne of the most enduring images in British horror cinema depicts Edward Woodward (as Howie the police officer) trapped in a giant wicker man, burning to death as the sun sets, during the final scenes of Robin Hardy's The Wicker Man. Audiences in 1976, however, were not used to seeing the protagonist die at the end of the film, and many expected (as would be the case in most other horror movies) an imminent rescue for the hero. This rescue does not arrive though, and Woodward's character perishes in the flames as the pagan islanders sing below. This was highly controversial at the time of release and would be a tactic repeated throughout modern horror movies.\nNow an immensely popular horror subgenre, found footage first appeared in 1980's Cannibal Holocaust, which enjoyed a cult following for years. One movie inspired by this, and that arguably popularized the technique, was 1999's The Blair Witch Project. Alongside the movie, the filmmakers created a swathe of fictional material presented as fact, including websites and documentaries, which explored the movie's themes and purported backstory. Additionally, the actors were marked as missing on their IMDB.com profiles, perpetuating the ruse. This cemented the idea for the public and truly blurred the lines between fact and fiction - a theme that persists in horror to this day.\nJames Whale's classic, The Bride of Frankenstein is a masterpiece in early horror. Released in 1935, the movie was a sequel to Whale's hugely popular Frankenstein, adapting the remainder of Mary Shelley's novel. However, many audiences did not realize, and wouldn't for years to come, that Bride of Frankenstein is a surreptitious spoof of Frankenstein. Packed with campy characters and melodrama, Whale took his own movie and exaggerated the elements he found amusing, contrasting them against Boris Karloff's incredible reprisal as the Monster. This technique would be repeated by Tobe Hooper, who released a sneaky parody of his own horror classic with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2.\nDespite featuring one of the most iconic villains in horror history, Hellraiser made a brilliant, and unconventional, decision to have another antagonist than Pinhead. Though still featured dismembering victims with his trademark chains throughout, Pinhead is a side character in the original 1987 Hellraiser, with the human Frank taking the villainous mantle. Frank appears as a violent degenerate, leching over his brother's wife and child, and orchestrating much of the movie's horrors. Frank is so detestable, that by the movie's conclusion audiences are actually rooting for Pinhead to dispatch the man. In fact, Frank proved such a wretched villain that he would appear in the sequel.\nAnother horror franchise with a secondary character so deplorable viewers root for the villain is Saw, most specifically Saw X. Saw X did such a brilliant job at fleshing out the murderer Jigsaw and his battle with cancer, that when he is duped into fake treatment by the detestable Dr. Cecilia Pederson, audiences feel sorry for him. It is quite an astonishing phenomenon, which transforms the villain fans love to hate, to a villain people just plain love. Saw has always walked the relatable villain tightrope, proffering some justification for the horror committed by Jigsaw, but Saw X reorients him as one of the victims, fully undermining the binary horror convention of good vs. evil.\nAn earlier film that flipped the victim/villain archetypes was Wes Craven's seminal The Last House on the Left. It initially depicts the murder of a young woman by some truly vile characters. Then rather unexpectedly, the movie shifts. The killers seek refuge in a remote house, which, unbeknownst to them, is their victim's home. Deducing what happened, her parents seek their bloody revenge. The movie questions notions of justifiable violence and does so by also placing the audience in the awkward position of cheering for the parents to murder the reprobates. It is a truly disgusting movie that broke several rules in horror, but this one still feels particularly unsettling.\n"}

The first of a massive two-part, sci-fi adventure, Snyder's upcoming Netflix movie, officially now titled Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire, chronicles the exploits of a lone female warrior who gathers the residents of a peaceful farming colony to fight back against an evil, encroaching galactic empire.

{"title": "Every American Pie Movie, Ranked", "date": "2023-10-05 12:41:24", "text": "The American Pie movies weren't exactly cinematic masterpieces, but there were still some good ones in the bunch. \nThe original American Pie was somewhat of a comedic game-changer in the world of cinema, bringing back raunchy comedy to the masses, but when it comes to the best American Pie movie, there have been several highs and lows since that film hit theaters. Breaking ground in a new way, the studios wanted to keep the magic going for as long as possible turning it into a juggernaut franchise, both with and without the original stars. Audiences flocked to theaters to watch the gang engage in debauchery and laugh along at all the jokes.\nAlong the way, the main movies ended, but the studio kept pumping out films connected to the world of the originals, all with diminishing returns thanks to the absence of the beloved original stars. There are nine movies in the American Pie franchise, but there is a new American Pie movie in the works with the original cast returning. The American Pie movies began in 1999 and the franchise is still releasing new movies as recently as 2020. Although the newer movies aren't as beloved as the original films, there are still new stories to be told in the universe and audiences will continue watching the raunchy sex comedies.\nRELATED: The 50 Best Movies of All Time\nAmerican Pie Presents: The Book Of Love follows a group of teens exactly 10 years after the original film took place, finding the infamous \"Bible\" that character Kevin Myers used in the original movie. While it pays homage to the first movie, this is far from the best American Pie movie in the franchise. After destroying \"The Bible\" they must track down every man who has contributed any single move to it over the years to try and put it back together. Along the way, they run into Jim's dad Noah Levenstein (Eugene Levy) who is the sort of through-line from the original cast to the younger kids in the \"Presents\" portion of the films.\nThe Book Of Love ranks at the bottom of the DTV sequels to American Pie because by this time, what made the original movies so charming has been mostly lost. Critics mention that the movie tried to return some of the charm of the originals, but it was still just mostly a copy and paste of the ideas that were at one time original and fresh.\nErik Stifler is the cousin of Steve and Matt Stifler from the main franchise and his girlfriend just gave him a free pass to do whatever he wants in one weekend, so he heads off to a college campus to run in The Naked Mile. Erik is not like the hard-partying members of his family and this is meant to help break him out of his shell and so his other crazy cousin Dwight who is already in college tries to acclimate him to the party scene.\nThis whole frat raunchy scene and the connectivity of having it be a Stifler is another way the studio and writers kept the franchise pushing ahead without main cast members attached to the plot line. The movie was not hated like the latter released Book Of Love which didn't star a \"Stifler\" but was also not beloved by audiences. The movie tries to deliver self-aware humor with college craziness, but critics agreed it fell short in the end.\nBeta House was the only American Pie spin-off film to be a direct sequel to the one that came before it. Audiences responded well to Dwight and Erik Stifler, so they were both brought back for this one. Erik left for college and tried to bounce back from his breakup, but the story then went in the same direction as most American Pie movies. This isn't a bad movie, but it isn't anything that movie fans haven't seen before. It checks off most of the college movie tropes one by one, all the way down to the toga party. There are plenty of better college movies out there, and that holds this down from being one of the best American Pie movies.\nFour friends are about to graduate from high school and finally decide to take charge of their lives and get what they want in their senior year. Whether it's losing their virginity or blackmailing the principal, Annie, Kayla, Michelle, and Stephanie spend the raunchy movie doing whatever it takes to find success. The movie arrived in 2020 and tried new approaches, focusing more on the women characters.\nThe change of focus to the women makes it just different enough to stand out from the rest of the best American Pie movies, as far as the spinoffs go. On a side note, Eugene Levy didn't return for this movie, and his absence is felt as he's appeared in every other movie in the franchise.\nThe first movie following the initial trilogy, American Pie Presents: Band Camp was a bit bigger than every American Pie movie made after it with both Eugene Levy and Chris Owen returning as Noah Levenstein and Sherman respectively. The movie follows Matt Stifler who is ordered to attend band camp following a prank and hijinx ensue. Actor Tad Hilgenbrink actually did a pretty great job mimicking Seann William Scott's mannerisms as Stifler. The cast overall was pretty well-rounded for a direct-to-video release, but it was hard for audiences to move on in just two years' time from the cast that had been there since the start.\nThe third film was meant to be the last American Pie movie in the entire franchise. It showed a lot of character development for Steve Stifler, yet there was a big Oz-sized hole in the gang that fans had come to know and love. Groups that are that tight-knit just don't function as well when they are not whole. Each film gave more screen time and more character development to different characters, and it seemed intentional, until the third when Oz was gone and Kevin was essentially non-existent.\nThis was seen by many fans and critics as the weakest in the best American Pie movies. While it is about Jim's wedding, these events are supposed to be group effort films and this left some key players on the sidelines.\nOf the best American Pie movies, this one is the most laugh-out-loud funny of the entire franchise due to the rapid-fire nature of the raunchy jokes. This film was made at a time when nothing was off-limits, many of the jokes would not be okay in today's climate whatsoever. At the same time, the second movie dealt with a lot of issues that many teens deal with in real life when going off to college. The core of the film, staying connected no matter what changes is actually extremely beautiful and that is why many fans connect so deeply with it to this day.\nThe jokes flowing freely make it feel like it could be any group of friends at any house just holding onto their youth. It also helps that all the friends are still in full force here, something the next movie mistakenly changed. The main story here is Jim and Michelle's romance, and that really helps ground a movie that throws just about everything at the audience for a laugh.\nRegarded by many fans and critics as the closest to the first one in tone as well as humor, the fact that everyone returned to the cast was enough to get fans to head back to theaters for an international box office total of $234 million (via Box Office Mojo). The cast seemed to not miss a beat as they delivered quick-witted lines just like no time had passed as well as those heartfelt group moments the franchise had become known for. The writers also made sure to drop in some moments that were fresh to the franchise as well as acknowledging the age of everyone involved in a comedic way. It even picked up three Teen Choice Award nominations.\nThe best of the American Pie movies was a raunchy comedy that brought back the genre in a viable way as a box office smash as well as a genre in which audiences were ready to receive stories again. Not since Animal House had a raunchy comedy lifted the genre in such a way that it became the talk of all of Hollywood, and that is why this remains timeless movie. The first American Pie movie followed a group of friends and their dating and sexual relationships as they finished high school and prepared for the day they would end up moving apart.\nWhat really carried the movie was the cast, which included Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan as the key romantic couple that carried the franchise, at least through the theatrical American Pie movies. This movie was also the one that received the most accolades, including nominations at the MTV Movie Awards and Teen Choice Awards and several wins at the Young Hollywood Awards.\n\n"}
{"title": "Why Bradley & Laura Broke Up Before The Morning Show Season 3", "date": "2023-10-05 12:50:27", "text": "The Morning Show season 3 had already revealed that Bradley and Laura broke up during the time jump, but episode 5 finally explained what went wrong. \nAfter getting together in The Morning Show season 2, Bradley and Laura broke up before season 3 began, and a flashback episode finally explained why, how, and when. The Morning Show cast grew with the addition of Julianna Margulies in its sophomore season as Laura Peterson, a legendary journalist at UBA and Bradley’s love interest. The Morning Show season 2 set up an interesting dynamic between them as Laura had been out as a lesbian for decades while Bradley wasn’t ready to claim her sexuality publicly. Yet, they’d found a way to make their relationship work, only to break up before The Morning Show season 3.\nThough Bradley and Laura started the season having already broken up, there is plenty of time left for them to get back together, especially after The Morning Show season 3, episode 4 where they admitted they still had feelings for each other. However, they also spoke about how miserable Bradley was in Montana, where she and Laura were during the pandemic. The Morning Show season 3, episode 5 took viewers back in time to Laura's ranch to understand why.\nAt the end of The Morning Show season 2, Laura, who has a heart condition, left New York City for her ranch in Montana as an extra measure of caution against COVID-19. Bradley had agreed to join her, but her brother going missing in the finale delayed her trip. In The Morning Show season 3, episode 5, they started off their time in Montana together on a positive note, using the time in isolation to get to know each other and relax away from all the drama they’d been confronted with throughout the season. However, it also meant moving in together more quickly than they might have otherwise.\nBradley and Laura first met at the 2020 Democratic presidential caucus in early February and were living together in Montana by the end of March. Bradley had admittedly never been in a relationship for more than a few months her entire life, while Laura had a reputation as a “player.” With the added difficulties that isolation can have on one's mental and emotional state, it wasn’t exactly surprising that Bradley and Laura broke up during the pandemic before The Morning Show season 3.\nRelated: The Morning Show Season 3 Is Fixing 8 Problems That Ruined Season 2\nAs if trying to make their relationship survive the pandemic and isolation in Montana wasn’t hard enough, Bradley’s mother passed away from the coronavirus in The Morning Show season 3, episode 5. Laura had attempted to get her help through her connections with certain doctors and clinics, but Bradley knew her mother didn’t really take care of herself even when it came to seeing her own doctor, something that Laura couldn’t fully understand. Bradley’s mom’s death understandably marked a shift in their dynamic as she wasn’t willing or ready to accept the help she needed and that Laura tried to offer.\nIn The Morning Show season 3, episode 5, they eventually had an intense argument that led to both of them saying some pretty awful things to each other. Bradley accused Laura of being \"elitist,\" hating her mother, and judging her family, which contributed to her not being as close with her mother in the months before she died. Laura reminded Bradley that she was the one who’d constantly talked down on her family and said that she must actually be relieved that her mother was dead. While they continued their relationship for a while after this fight, it no doubt was the breaking point.\nEven when they were happy together in Montana, their differences posed problems for Bradley and Laura's relationship in The Morning Show from the beginning. They were in very different stages in their lives and careers, with Laura being a successful veteran at UBA and Bradley still trying to prove herself. While Laura attempted to be supportive of Bradley, it could occasionally come across as condescending, as she couldn’t truly understand how Bradley’s messed up childhood was impacting her present and future in The Morning Show.\nRelated: The Morning Show Season 4: Renewal, Release Date & Everything We Know\nBradley and Laura spoke about this in The Morning Show season 3, episode 5, and Laura promised that she’d work on being less judgmental, but Bradley didn’t give her much of a chance once her mother died. Since their breakup, Bradley has gotten some much-needed therapy and the coveted job on UBA Evening News while Laura is co-anchor at Your Day, America, which has eliminated some of their differences. Still, if Bradley and Laura are going to try and make their relationship work again in The Morning Show season 3, they will have to find some middle ground.\n"}

Jesse Simon, grandson of legendary artist Joe Simon, has launched a string of successful Kickstarter campaigns to bring ShieldMaster, co-created by Joe, to life. Now, Jesse has launched a new campaign for a new book that will resurrect other Simon characters. Furthermore, this project comes with an introduction by the legendary Alan Moore.\nSimon Studios has launched a Kickstarter for the book, entitled ShieldMaster: Blast to the Past. Simon provided a synopsis for the book, along with the variant covers, shared below. Blast to the Past meta-plot involves Jesse and his father Jim attending a comic book convention in the present day. They are hurled back in time to 1963, where John F. Kennedy needs protection. Kennedy asks the Fighting American to provide security. The Fighting American then brings together a group of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby characters, such as Captain 3-D, The Fly, and Private Strong. The book will feature covers by industry legends such as Tom Morgan and Joe Rubenstein.\nJoe Simon is one of the architects of the American comic book field, whose career spans nearly 80 years. Simon, with Jack Kirby, helped create Captain America, among many other legendary characters at a variety of publishers. Talent runs in the family, and both Joe’s son Jim and grandson Jesse are comic book creators as well. ShieldMaster began as a collaboration between Joe and Jim, and earlier this year Jesse formed Simon Studios to bring this legacy creation to life. After running two highly successful crowdfunding campaigns, Jesse is now set to introduce a new generation of fans to these classic Joe Simon and Jack Kirby characters.\nShieldMaster: Blast to the Past is jam-packed not only with many Joe Simon/Jack Kirby characters, but top talent as well. In addition to the aforementioned introduction by Alan Moore, Joe Rubenstein and Tom Morgan are providing variant covers. Rubenstein invokes Neal Adams’ classic cover to Superman vs Muhammad Ali and Morgan captures these great characters in action. ShieldMaster: Blast to the Past will also feature a painted cover, previously unreleased, by Joe Simon himself featuring his iconic characters. The Kickstarter campaign also features rewards allowing fans to be drawn into the comic. ShieldMaster: Blast to the Past is a labor of love, many years in the making.\nRelated: Star Wars' Dark Droids Event Can Bring Back Alan Moore's Vengeful Droid God\nJoe Simon and Jack Kirby are genre-defining creators, whose work continues to electrify new audiences 80+ years after they started their careers. Many of the characters featured in ShieldMaster: Blast to the Past have not appeared in print for many years, making this special one-shot a definite cause for celebration. Jesse and Jim are committed to carrying on Joe’s legacy of creativity, and they are now bringing classic Simon and Kirby characters back to life in ShieldMaster: Blast to the Past, featuring an introduction by icon Alan Moore.\nSource: Kickstarter\nShaun Corley is a freelance writer currently residing in the mountains of Appalachia.

{"title": "&quot;Where Did The Bullet Go?&quot; One Of Walking Dead's Biggest Tragedies Has Real Doctor Very Skeptical", "date": "2023-10-05 12:59:39", "text": "ER Doctor Jordan Wagner expresses some skepticism about what the results would be from one of The Walking Dead's biggest tragic injuries.\nER Doctor Jordan Wagner has analyzed a tragic scene from The Walking Dead, expressing skepticism that the character involved would have survived. The zombie series is filled with plenty of horrific death scenes and major characters being permanently injured within the post-apocalypse. Some of these brutal scenes involve injuries that characters survive, but which change them for the rest of the show.\nIn a video from his Doctor ER YouTube channel, Wagner reveals the chances of survival after Carl gets shot in the eye during The Walking Dead season 6, episode 9.\nWagner's analysis, which starts at 6:36, focuses on how the bullet from Ron's gun entered Carl's eye, making it unclear if he would have survived the incident in real life. Check out Wagner's analysis of the classic yet tragic scene below:\n\nWoah! Where did the bullet go?I'm assuming the bullet went into his eye. We'll never be able to recover that, the eye trauma is done. There's no more globe. Now you just have a hole. But now the issue ends up being, where did the bullet go once it actually passed through the eye? Was it going at an angle that it went out the side, or did it go straight through to the back, going through brain tissue?In this situation, put pressure to the wound. Obviously you can't get to a hospital at this point, so hopefully you're not having brain swelling due to the trauma which can cause you to be altered. And then did it actually go into the balance center of the brain, or into the brain stem?The balance center of the brain is your cerebellum. If it hits the brain stem, there's not a lot of survival, because that's where all your autonomic nervous system type function is.\n\nWoah!

If it hits the brain stem, there's not a lot of survival, because that's where all your autonomic nervous system type function is.\nWhile Wagner highlights the many issues that could arise from Carl getting shot in the eye, Rick's son eventually recovers from his injury. While the bullet easily could have damaged his brain, Carl is shown to be fine in season 6, episode 10 following a two-month time jump. While Carl eventually died in The Walking Dead season 8, he was bit by a zombie, which had nothing to do with his eye injury.\nBased on Wagner's statements, it seems unlikely Carl would have survived getting shot in the eye in real life. His analysis indicates the bullet would have been lodged deep in Carl's skull, meaning he would have received brain damage that may not have been treatable in the post-apocalypse. The likelihood the bullet hit Carl's brain stem also indicates a low chance of survival if he'd been shot in real life.\nHowever, just like in The Walking Dead, Carl losing his eye could have resulted in a miraculous survival if the bullet didn't lodge deep enough to pierce his brain. While in real life this may not have been as possible, the event can still be considered realistic despite the low chances of it ever happening. Even so, as Wagner indicates, Carl's survival would still depend on how good his treatment would be.\nSource: Doctor ER/YouTube\n"}
{"title": "Masters Of The Air Release Date & Images: First New WW2 Miniseries From Band Of Brothers Team In 13 Years", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "Masters of the Air, a new World War II miniseries from the team behind Band of Brothers, has received a release date, alongside images from the show.\nMasters of the Air, a new World War II miniseries developed by the team behind Band of Brothers, has been given a release date, alongside images offering a first look at the show. The upcoming Apple TV+ series will see the Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Gary Goetzman reunite to produce another World War II series. The trio previously collaborated for 2001's Band of Brothers and its 2010 companion series, The Pacific.\nNow, Apple TV+ has revealed that Masters of the Air will be premiering on the streaming platform beginning Friday, January 26, 2024. The series will begin with two episodes before airing one new episode every week, ending on March 15. In addition, the first images from the series were released, which can be viewed below:\nProducer Goetzman also released a statement about what to expect from the series, which can be read below:\n'Masters of the Air' is a salute to the brave men of the 8th Air Force, who, through their courage and brotherhood, helped defeat Nazi Germany in World War II. Tom [Hanks] and Steven [Spielberg] have always wanted to visualize cinematically what our author Don Miller has called, this ‘singular event in the history of warfare.’ We’re thrilled that Apple TV+ has given us the opportunity to combine the efforts of so many talented people, on-screen and behind the camera, to tell this important story.\nMasters of the Air is based on Donald L. Miller's book of the same name, documenting the real-life actions of the US Air Force's 100th Bombardment Group - also known as the Bloody Hundredth. As Goetzman indicated, the miniseries will follow the real-life events the 8th Air Force was involved in during World War II. The miniseries will recount the history of the Bloody Hundredth in the form of a war drama.\nThe cast for Masters of the Air underscores how emotionally potent the performances in the series will be. Major cast members include Austin Butler (Elvis), Barry Keoghan (The Banshees of Inisherin), Callum Turner (Queen and Country), Anthony Boyle (Tetris), and Sam Hazeldine (Slow Horses). However, the ensemble cast of the show will feature dozens of actors portraying the many young men that were part of the Bloody Hundredth.\nWhile Masters of the Air has broken a Band of Brothers tradition by airing on Apple TV+ instead of HBO, Spielberg, Hanks, and Goetzman's involvement indicates the series will be just as memorable. With plenty of talented actors taking on the roles of World War II Air Force soldiers, the series is promising an emotional retelling of the Bloody Hundredth's history. The extent of the series' intensity will be revealed once it premieres next year.\nSource: Apple TV+\n"}
{"title": "Ahsoka's Replacement For Her Broken Lightsaber Was Set Up By Star Wars 5 Years Ago", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "Ahsoka Tano may have lost her shorter shoto-style lightsaber in the Ahsoka finale, but Star Wars Rebels already set up its eventual replacement.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nAhsoka Tano may have lost one of her lightsabers in the Ahsoka finale, but Star Wars has already set up its replacement. The Ahsoka finale saw one of the show’s toughest lightsaber duels yet. In a last-ditch attempt to stop Grand Admiral Thrawn from returning to Star Wars’ prime galaxy, Ahsoka, Sabine Wren, and Ezra Bridger stormed the Nightsisters’ fortress on Peridea. There, they encountered many obstacles, including a new-and-improved version of Morgan Elsbeth. As a reward for all of Morgan’s efforts in the race to get home, the Great Mothers bestowed a gift upon her, including an additional helping of dark magick, as well as a powerful sword known as the Blade of Talzin.\nReprising their fight from The Mandalorian season 2, Ahsoka and Morgan went head-to-head in a duel that proved to be one of Ahsoka’s most exciting yet. What made it so thrilling is that it's clear that even for someone as skilled as Ahsoka, Morgan was not an enemy easily overcome. Morgan even managed to destroy one of Ahsoka’s two lightsaber hilts – the shorter, shoto-style one – by cutting it in half, forcing Ahsoka to fight with just one lightsaber. Yet, despite Morgan’s best efforts, Ahsoka prevails and kills her adversary – but what will she do now after losing one of her weapons?\nThough the Ahsoka finale makes it clear that Ahsoka could potentially rebuild her lost lightsaber with all the equipment that Huyang has stored aboard their ship – Ezra manages to quickly construct a brand-new lightsaber, too – there’s a chance she may decide not to. In the now partially retconned Star Wars Rebels epilogue, Ahsoka meets Sabine on Lothal in a resplendent white robe while carrying a simple, yet elegant white staff. The Ahsoka show has canonically depicted Ahsoka’s transformation into Ahsoka the White after her ordeal in the World Between Worlds, but the staff has yet to make an appearance. Now that one of Ahsoka’s lightsabers has been destroyed and she and Sabine are stranded on Peridea, she may end up creating that new staff after all, using it as a replacement for her second lightsaber.\nRelated: When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline\nAhsoka has changed as a result of her journey in the Ahsoka show. In the World Between Worlds, she chose life, reconciled with her past, and embraced her future. Stranded on Peridea, a place with a deep and mysterious connection to the Force – as demonstrated by the Great Mothers’ powers, the statues of the Mortis gods, and the appearance of the owl-like creature, a convor known as Morai – Ahsoka may yet change even more. It’s possible that, by connecting to the Force in a new way on Peridea, Ahsoka may decide to become something beyond being a Ronin or a Jedi. She may choose to forego her lightsabers altogether, fully embracing the Force as her closest ally.\nRELATED: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nIn the Star Wars Rebels epilogue, there’s nothing to suggest that Ahsoka still carries her lightsabers with her. Her transformation into Ahsoka the White is meant to symbolize her new-found wisdom, strength, authority, and compassion, mirroring Gandalf’s journey in The Lord of the Rings. To be a leader, and to protect the galaxy, Ahsoka doesn’t necessarily need her lightsabers. Those are weapons used for close combat, and Ahsoka could be more and mean more. Ahsoka’s transformation was foreshadowed when the Daughter – essentially a living conduit for the light side of the Force – gave her life so that Ahsoka may live in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Now, after the Ahsoka finale, Ahsoka has all the tools she needs to become who she was always meant to be.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Gen V's Main Character Powers Have 1 Big Thing In Common (That The Boys & The Seven Don't)", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "Gen V may be a spinoff of Amazon Prime Video’s superhero series The Boys, but this new show has something that its predecessors did not.\nWarning: This article contains mentions of self-harm, eating disorders, drug abuse, and suicide.\nThe latest installment in The Boys franchise, Gen V, is already proving that it isn't like its predecessors by creating a major connection between its main characters' powers. Gen V is the third series in The Boys franchise, which is based on a series of comics of the same name, written by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. While The Boys explores the corruption of the world's top superheroes and the vigilante group intent on taking them down, Gen V focuses on a group of young supes training at the Vought-run Godolkin University.\nThough Gen V is firmly rooted in The Boys timeline, the series is already much different than those that came before it. The show has an entirely new cast with completely new priorities and aims. However, one especially significant difference between The Boys and Gen V is the connections between the series' supes. While The Boys introduced a set of heroes that were all unique from each other, the characters in Gen V all have one thing in common that links their powers together. This commonality has never been seen before in The Boys or The Seven, which means Gen V could exemplify how the franchise is evolving.\nRelated: Gen V Season 2: Renewal Chances, Release Date Prediction & Everything We Know\nWhat makes Gen V stand out is the fact that all the main characters' powers stem from their mental health conditions. While these supes are powerful, their abilities are all inextricably linked to the personal problems they are facing. This often leaves the characters feeling drained or hurt after using their powers. The connections are as follows: Marie must self-harm to use her blood magic, Emma purges and binges food to shrink or grow, Jordan's powers parallel the identity struggles of a transgender individual, Luke's powers lead him to take his own life, and Cate's abilities are referred to as \"pushing,\" a term often used in relation to drug abuse.\nOne character that doesn't quite fit the mold of this theory is Andre. Andre Anderson is a popular kid at Godolkin University with powers of magnetic manipulation. In his personal life, he is under intense pressure to succeed due to his father's incredible reputation and power. Though it is a stretch, Andre's powers could correlate to his need to charm others, thereby pulling them toward him. His magnetism could also feel like a sort of physical pressure that aligns with the mental one he faces. Either way, Andre's connection to this theory still has time to make itself known later in the series.\nOverall, Gen V's power connection is a hint at what the series is really aiming to say. While The Boys is a superhero and action series through and through, Gen V seems to be less about the superhero side of things, and more about the struggles young people face within the setting of a superhero world. The focus is not necessarily on what these characters can do, but how they do them, and what the cost is to their personhood. This is a topic that is not as prevalent in The Boys, and so is a great area for Gen V to explore, especially through the lens of a younger cast.\nAnother aspect of Gen V that fits with this idea is the dean of Godolkin University. Indira Shetty is the dean of Godolkin, but she isn't a superhero at all. She is actually a behavorial therapist. This fact makes her all the more important when considering the problems each main character is dealing with. These characters don't need help with their powers, but with their mental health conditions, and ironically, Shetty is more equipped to handle such issues. Overall, Gen V seems to be setting up a situation in which these young supes have to handle their personal problems before they can become true heroes.\nThe fact that Gen V's characters are connected via their mental health conditions and related powers makes the series stand out from The Boys. The series' focus on mental health makes the tone entirely different to The Boys, which leans much more into violence and chaos. Overall, these differences are good because they set the shows apart from each other and prove that the franchise can be dynamic. Gen V may be a spinoff of The Boys, but it doesn't have to be a carbon copy, and in fact, its differences are what make it better.\n"}
{"title": "Strange New Worlds Season 3 Should Go Gangster Like TOS & TNG", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds should follow in the footsteps of TOS and TNG, and let its characters take on the gangster genre.\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds should take on the gangster genre, following in the footsteps of Star Trek: The Original Series and Star Trek: The Next Generation. Both previous Trek series made excellent use of the gangster genre in the classic episodes TOS season 2, episode 17, \"A Piece of the Action\" and TNG season 1, episode 12, \"The Big Goodbye.\" \"A Piece of the Action\" sees Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) visit a planet with a culture based on 1920s-era Chicago. Kirk and Spock dress the part as mobsters and have fun interacting with the eccentric locals.\nIn Star Trek: The Next Generation's \"The Big Goodbye,\" Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) takes on the persona of fictional hard-boiled detective Dixon Hill in the first Star Trek holodeck episode. Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) and Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) also get in on the fun, dressing in period wear and embracing the fictional story they find themselves in. The characters of Strange New Worlds have had their fair share of wacky adventures, and they would have a blast taking on a story of mobsters and murder mysteries.\nRelated: Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Cast - Every New & Returning Character In Season 2\nWith the gangster episodes of TOS and TNG, Star Trek proved that it can do that particular genre really well. Not only does the concept give the actors a chance to wear fun period costumes, but it also allows them to portray a different version of their characters. Gangster or hard-boiled detective stories may not seem to have a lot in common with Star Trek, but something about the combination really works. The detective genre is an easy genre to reference, with plenty of recognizable tropes and cliches. It would be so much fun to see Anson Mount's Captain Christopher Pike and the rest of the crew of his Enterprise dress up in period costumes and embrace their inner mobster.\nAlthough the Enterprise of Strange New Worlds does not have a holodeck, there are many ways they could justify a mobster storyline. The most obvious solution would be for Captain Pike and the Enterprise to visit Sigma Iotia II, the same planet Captain Kirk and Spock visit in \"A Piece of the Action.\" When the Federation made first contact with Sigma Iotia II 100 years before Kirk visited there, they left behind a book entitled Chicago Mobs of the Twenties. The inhabitants of the planet then formed their entire society based on this book. With a behind-the-scenes team as creative as those behind Strange New Worlds, they could undoubtedly come up with a fun and interesting way to incorporate a mobster story into the show.\nOver the course of its two seasons so far, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds has done a fairytale-inspired episode, a space pirates episode, an alternate future episode, two comedy episodes, a courtroom episode, a time travel episode, an amnesia episode, a crossover episode, and Star Trek's first ever musical episode. That is a lot of different genres to cover in 20 episodes, and yet, Strange New Worlds has done a wonderful job of making all of these premises work. The main reason these episodes work so well comes down largely to the incredible cast.\nOf course, the writing has to be solid for these various stories to work, and it undoubtedly has been. But the actors take the writing to another level with their performances, never failing to put their whole heart into every outlandish premise. The writers and actors of Strange New Worlds understand the characters well, and even the most gimmicky episodes move the plot forward and offer insight into the characters. Star Trek: Strange New Worlds has proven that it can do many different genres well, and the wonderful cast should get the chance to go full gangster like the casts of TOS and TNG before them.\n"}

Gengar, on the other hand is a Ghost- and Poison-type, which counters Slowking, Gallade, and Dusknoir.\nWhile battling Leader Cliff with this setup is somewhat a matter of getting the right matchups, when the stars do align, you'll easily walk through his team of shadow Pokémon in Pokémon GO.\nSource: PokemonGOHub/Zeroghan\nRiley grew up in the golden era of Xbox vs PlayStation and has fallen in love with RPGs and action-adventure games as a result.

The Starz drama has already delivered two critically acclaimed seasons and deserves another installment.\nFollowing the success of its first two critically acclaimed seasons, anticipation is incredibly high for P-Valley season 3. Based on the play Pu**y Valley, P-Valley is a drama Starz series that explores the lives of the dancers and employees who work at a Mississippi strip club called The Pynk and the struggles they face day-to-day both at and outside their profession. P-Valley features a talented cast of actors such as Brandee Evans, Nicco Annan, and Shannon Thornton who all consistently give fantastic performances.\nAt the end of season 2, the main protagonist Mercedes Woodbine (Evans) officially retires from The Pynk and starts a new journey in her life. Additionally, Lil' Murda (J. Alphonse Nicholson) and Uncle Clifford Sayles (Nicco Annan) officially decide to reveal their secret romance to their friends and loved ones. The season 2 finale has left a lot of storylines open-ended, but how the show plans on exploring these character arcs is still left up to speculation as not much about P-Valley season 3 has been confirmed.\nRelated: 10 Underrated Series On Starz (That Are Secretly Great), Ranked\nIn May 2023, it was announced that P-Valley season 3 would completely halt production due to the WGA (Writers Guild of America) strike. Series creator Katori Hall stated that she supports and provides solidarity for the picketing writers, stating \"We will not be filming until a fair deal is reached\" (via Deadline). While the writer's strike recently officially ended on September 27. 2023, production on P-Valley season 3 will remain halted until the SAG-AFTRA strike comes to an end as well (via NPR).\nIn October 2022, two months after the season 2 finale, it was confirmed that P-Valley would be returning to Starz for a third season. Hall said in a statement, \"I am blessed beyond measure for this opportunity to write the next chapter of P-Valley. With its complex, dynamic and beautifully flawed characters, this show is a love letter to marginalized communities in the American South who rarely see themselves reflected on screen, and it brings me immense joy to know that it has been embraced by folx worldwide.\" (via TV Line)\nWhile P-Valley season 3 has been greenlit, it is difficult to speculate when the next entry of the show will be released due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike keeping production of the series shut down. However, should the strike end in 2023, it is possible that P-Valley will be released sometime in mid-to-late 2024.\nWhile P-Valley has yet to make any major confirmation regarding its season 3 cast, it is very likely that most of the main characters from seasons 1 and 2 will be returning. The only actor confirmed not to appear in P-Valley season 3 is Elarica Johnson, who played Autumn Knight, because her character decided to move away at the end of season 2. According to Katori Hall, Autumn has reached the natural end of her character arc, saying \"She was a woman who came in on the wind and her leaving on the wind.\" (via EW)\nIt has yet to be revealed what P-Valley season 3's exact story will be. However, it is very likely that the show's third outing will focus on both Mercedes and her personal journey after retiring and the romance between Lil'Murda and Uncle Clifford. Hall has stated that she has particularly detailed plans for Mercedes, stating \"I want her to have everything. I want her to have a wonderful relationship with her daughter. I want her to have a wonderful relationship with her mother.

Most of these gigs offer just as much depth of morality and philosophy in their choices, except possibly the gig \"Waiting For Dodger,\" and provide valuable insights into the lore of Dogtown. Below are a few of the best examples of gigs that V can take on in Phantom Liberty.\nRelated: \"Electrifying, Emotional, And Full Of Twists\" - Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review\n\"Dogtown Saints\" is a gig in Phantom Liberty where players have to rescue Dr. Anthony Anderson, and gives players the first real opportunity to work with Mr. Hands in this expansion. Mr. Hands was previously a large part of Cyberpunk 2077 and continues his role as a fixer in Dogtown, and also becomes a bit more important to the overall plot than he was previously. In \"Dogtown Saints,\" Dr. Anderson is a ripperdoc who works pro bono to help the downtrodden people of Dogtown who don't have anywhere else to turn. His life is in danger, and Mr. Hands and Odell Blanco want V's help to save him. This is a gig that can be done early on in the DLC, as soon as V leaves the Dogtown hideout.\nTo get the result that makes Mr. Hands the happiest, it's best to try to keep everyone alive. The quest has a lot of moral ambiguity, however, which can lead to some thoughtful and philosophical pondering. Naturally, helping save the doctor to be able to reopen the clinic for the citizens of Dogtown is a good thing, but it's also interesting to think about who has the right to make certain choices. The immediate rewards are nothing extra special: 8,000 eddies, 1,300 EXP, and 167 street cred, but players should be sure to loot the clinic as some of the containers and fallen enemies in the area can drop worthwhile loot.\nRelated: There's One Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Side Quest You Should Do ASAP\n\"Prototype in the Scraper\" is a gig that V receives from Mr. Hands in Phantom Liberty, which has some moral and ethical decisions for players to make. Essentially, it sounds like a fetch quest at first, being asked to retrieve a prototype implant and the schematics for it. Unfortunately, that prototype is already implanted in someone named Hasan.\nHasan is a thief who V has to track down from a scav den in a Dogtown scraper jail cell. After breaking Hasan out, V has a decision to make about whether to give Hasan and the schematics to Mr. Hands, who will turn them all over to Zetatech, and likely torture and kill Hasan, or V can free Hasan and send the schematics to Mr. Hands. Rewards for either choice are the same, although if V lets Hasan go, then they will get a future side job from him that can lead to an Iconic Tech Pistol reward.\nPhantom Liberty's gig \"Waiting for Dodger\" adds a lot of humor to an otherwise very emotionally-heavy game. Any fan of Cyberpunk Edgerunners will also be interested to see that the main NPC that V works with in this gig is a new Phantom Liberty character, Stella Ramos, who is the sister of Sasha Yakovleva from Edgerunners. Stella's fiancée is an officer who looks to be in trouble at first. The entire situation is filled with sarcasm and humor, which is a fun contrast to the fact that it is involving drug dealing. Particularly if players choose to tell Dodger that the two cops are lying, its consequences are surprisingly light-hearted. The best reward, however, will come from killing Dodger, which provides a Tier 4 Iconic revolver named Rosco.\n\"Treating Symptoms\" is a gig in Phantom Liberty where players get to infiltrate the Voodoo Boys hideout, fight killer robots from NetWatch, and deal with a strange problem of someone threatening to hack into a woman's lungs. It is an incredible story to play through, with options for either stealth or heavy combat, and V gets to deal with some unique characters who epitomize the feeling of cyberpunk.\nUltimately, the choice becomes even more complicated when V runs into another undercover agent who is also in the process of completing a mission. The \"Treating Symptoms\" gig provides a lot of opportunities to have some fun roleplay and will pay out 8,000 eddies as a reward, with possibly an extra 8,000 much later on if V chose to help Alan.\nThe gig \"Talent Academy\" is one of the most deep and thought-provoking quests that are offered as an optional side gig, as the consequences for any possible solution can not only be difficult but for some may even hit close to home in real life. It can be emotional, but is also a very interesting commentary on the real world. In \"Talent Academy,\" Mr. Hands asks V to check out a strange Biotechnica sports facility in Dogtown and steal their data. Eventually coming to the computer of a woman named Fiona, V is caught by Fiona and offered a deal. Either Fiona will give them specific, controlled information to bring back to Mr. Hands in a way that won't hurt her company, or refuse, take all the data, and V can fight their way out. The rewards are the same for either option.\nThe tricky part is that this isn't just a normal company. In Phantom Liberty, Fiona is in charge of a sports academy which is taking advantage of children. Sports teams come there to scout out future star athletes, but the Biotechnica sports facility is not simply training kids but is putting cyberware in the children to improve their performance. The entire gig is written very well with dialogue that can make a person think, and the options presented can affect many lives, including a lot of the children in Cyberpunk 2077.\n"}
{"title": "&quot;Abracadabra&quot;: Superman's Weakness to Magic Unlocked His Most Powerful Form", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "Superman is incredibly powerful, but he does have a few specific weaknesses, including magic — but magic once somehow made him even stronger.\nIt's almost entirely impossible to harm Superman without using one of his very specific weaknesses. Aside from simply hitting him hard enough to bypass his invulnerability, the only way to deal any real damage to the Man of Steel is with either Kryptonite or magic. But when the sun became infused with magic in a strange future, Superman didn't get weaker — he got stronger.\nSince most people don't have the absolutely absurd strength levels it takes to defeat the Man of Steel, the only other options are using Kryptonite or magic. Kryptonite is famously the easiest way to defeat Superman; depending on the story it's either a mild annoyance or will instantly take him out of the fight. The same is true of magic: while Superman is borderline invulnerable, Superman has no defense against magic. This makes it one of the \"easier\" ways to damage him. The other much more complicated solution is to simply remove the sun, as Superman gains his powers from Earth's yellow sun — if he's without it, he's nothing more than a human. So when a group of villains infuses the sun with magic, one might think that would be Superman's worst nightmare, but things don't go exactly as expected.\nRelated: 1 Classic Superman Power Has a Deadly Upper Limit He Refuses to Use\nSuperman's surprising affinity for magic is featured in a dark future from Superman/Batman #82 by Cullen Bunn, ChrisCross, Marc Deering, Brad Anderson, and Steve Wands. After a group of magical villains sacrifice the sun for ultimate power, the magical heroes of DC try to infuse the sun with new life. While this does technically work, the sun begins giving off magical radiation instead of yellow sunlight. This not only shuts down all technology but apparently empowers Superman with magical energy. Instead of Clark being weakened as he usually is, he simply becomes magically adept. It seems that he not only keeps all of his normal powers but even gains a few new ones, as seen when he simply banishes a group of enemies from existence with a single thought.\nWhile most people think Superman's powers are from yellow sunlight, this isn't entirely true. Superman's powers come from radiation, not sunlight specifically. So when this new sun starts giving off magical radiation, instead of weakening Superman, he becomes significantly stronger than usual, just with a different source and outcome. He maintains most of his strength and the ability to fly but also gains new powers such as banishment and a form of \"magic vision\" akin to heat vision. Because of these new powers, Superman can save this dark future and prevent it from ever coming to pass.\nKryptonians have unique biology, and there are many different ways to mess with them. If a Kryptonian is under a yellow sun, they gain significant powers; under a blue sun, they gain even more. If they're under a red sun, they lose all of their powers. But if they're under a Kryptonite sun, it's agonizing pain for them and they lose their powers. If they gain too much yellow sunlight, their powers go out of control, and. apparently, if they're under a magical sun, then Superman becomes one of DC's strongest magical heroes.\nCheck out Superman/Batman #82, available now from DC Comics!\n"}
{"title": "10 Least Likable Characters in One Piece", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "From sniveling brats to oppressive tyrants, One Piece has its fair share of unlikable and despicable but characters but these ones take the cake!\nOne Piece has given fans innumerable beloved characters over the years, each having a unique character design and a signature gag, trait, or laugh that sets them apart from the rest. Regardless, with the series being as vast as it is and with so many characters to choose from there's bound to be some characters that simply aren't all that likable.\nIt is entirely possible to like a character for being an excellent antagonist, as seen with Katakuri, who despite being a major antagonist of his arc, is generally well-loved and respected for wanting a fair fight with Luffy. However, most of the least likable characters in One Piece are simply too despicable to look past despite their narrative role in the series. \nRelated: 10 Strongest Non-Devil Fruit Users In One Piece\nCharlotte Flampe is Big Mom's 77th daughter who was introduced in the midst of Luffy's battle against Katakuri in the mirror dimension during the Whole Cake Island Arc. Flampe is known mainly for her infatuation with Katakuri which borders on obsession as it pushes her to interfere in the battle out of wanting her brother to win. While wanting to help a sibling is far from despicable, Flampe is disliked mostly for her obnoxious, vain personality. What's worse is her infatuation quickly turns into disgust when she learns about Katakuri's mouth. Faced with the reality that Katakuri isn't as perfect as she believed him to be, Flampe turns her nose on him, going as far as to disown him and threaten to gossip about him to the rest of the family.\nSafe to say, Flampe might've been less unlikable if not for her shifty, petty behavior towards her own brother whom she once idolized. It also doesn't help her case that she comes off as quite the nosy brat.\nStelly is Sabo's adopted brother who went on to become the king of the Goa Kingdom. Much like the rest of the nobles there, Stelly looks down on everyone else as inferior to him. Stelly is particularly condescending to Merfolk and Fishmen and holds racist, stereotypical views about them. Not only is Stelly arrogant but also snotty and extremely spoiled as a result of which he often looked down on and insulted even his half-brother Sabo from a young age. Even as an adult, Stelly's attitude towards Sabo remains highly contemptuous, though he did seem shocked when he learned the latter was alive and part of the revolutionaries.\nTo top it off, Stelly also shows signs of being power hungry, evidenced when he saw the empty throne at Mariejois and even though his actions aren't all that atrocious he is still among the least-liked characters in the series.\nAbsalom was a member of the Thriller Bark Pirates with the power of the Clear-Clear Fruit and a penchant for being quite the misogynistic pervert. Even nicknamed 'Erosalam' by the zombies at Thriller Bark, he not only used his fruit to peek at Nami while she was bathing but also abducted her and forced her to marry him all within the little time the Straw Hats spent there. More importantly, Absalom has also expressed how he liked docile women who couldn't fight back like Nami.\nWhile Absalom's behavior is not much different from Sanji's who also used his Germa powers to try and spy on women at a bathhouse, Absalom doesn't have an inkling of respect for women, unlike Sanji. In fact, Absalom's obsession with wanting a bride stems not from romance but from the desire for more of a trophy than a partner which explains his unpopularity in the fandom.\nRelated: 10 Best One Piece Episodes Ranked\nNow the owner of a massive conglomerate, Wapol is the former ruler of Drum Island and the epitome of the word inexorable. During his time on Drum Island, Wapol was a terrible ruler. Besides being incredibly selfish, he is also a huge coward who abandoned his people to fend for themselves when the island was attacked by pirates. More importantly, he destroyed the rich tradition of doctors on the island by keeping twenty of the best ones for himself and hunting down the rest. Wapol's self-centeredness also makes him very petty and arrogant to the point where he did not hesitate to hit a young Vivi simply because her father Cobra had admonished him.\nIn all, there doesn't seem to be any hope for Wapol to redeem himself. Even after losing everything he had after being defeated by Luffy, Wapol went right back to his old, arrogant self after his rise back to money and power.\nSpandam was the ruthless yet cowardly chief of CP9 and the man in charge of capturing Nico Robin. The dislike for Spandam mostly stems from his sadistic treatment of Nico Robin at Enies Lobby where he not only broke his promise not to harm her but also shoved her down the stairs and physically assaulted her. Spandam was ruthless in the sense that he was willing to sacrifice anything to achieve his goal—that is, except himself. When the Straw Hats attacked Enies Lobby he sent the CP9 agents and several subordinates to deal with them instead, proving to be quite the coward despite his arrogance.\nInterestingly, Spandam is one of the earliest examples of the World Government's brand of absolute justice and highlights the worst problems with the Government, as well as its moral grayness. Together with his horrible personality and hypocritical tendencies, this makes Spandam very easy to dislike.\nA simple look at Coco Village and what the Arlong Pirates did to its people is enough to justify why Arlong may not be a fan favorite. Despite Arlong's sentiments towards humans making sense considering the tragic history of the Fishmen, it hardly justifies his actions toward the innocent people of Coco Village as well as the countless other places he ravaged. Arlong not only took all their money but also killed Bellemere and forced a young Nami into working for him. Moreover, he held the village hostage to ensure Nami's loyalty.\nArlong was easily one of the most ruthless, despicable antagonists of the East Blue Saga who wouldn't hesitate to kill even an innocent child. Considering that the Fishmen's past and their strained relationship with humans weren't explored until much later in the series, it does make sense why Arlong may be among the handful of unlikable characters in the series.\nRelated: What Arlong Is In One Piece: Netflix's Live-Action Fishmen Explained\n While nobles are infamously snobbish as proven by Stelly, the Celestial Dragons are a whole different breed among which Saint Charlos stands out most for his arrogance, pretentiousness, and condescending attitude toward everyone around him. However, what strikes viewers the most is his general disregard for life and his poor treatment of his slaves whom he takes pleasure in abusing and tormenting. Saint Charlos represents the worst of the Celestial Dragons, their perceived superiority over every other being on the planet, and everything that's wrong with the World Government as well as the world of One Piece as a whole.\nThe dislike for Akainu stems mostly from his skewed sense of justice. Akainu's belief in absolute justice often causes him to disregard the lives of several marines and innocent civilians. To him, any means are justified as long as he achieves his goal of terminating what he and the World Government deem 'evil'. Akainu's cruelty stands out most during the Ohara Incident where he decimated an entire ship full of civilians off the chance that one of them may be a researcher. In that sense, Akainu's idea of justice is biased towards the Celestial Dragons he serves.\nAdmittedly, Akainu makes for an excellent antagonist and hardly anyone can blame him for killing Ace at Marineford as he was only doing his job. That being said, Akainu's blind obedience to the Celestial Dragons and his ignorance and disregard towards any other life paint him as quite the unlikable character.\nWhile most of One Piece's least likable characters are unlikable because of their actions or beliefs, Trebol is unlikable by virtue of how obnoxious he is. Though Trebol's constant interruptions during Luffy's battle against Doflamingo weren't quite as noticeable in the manga, they could not be any more infuriating in the anime. That being said, Trebol's obnoxious laugh and laid-back persona hide his true, insidious nature, seen when he took advantage of a young embittered and disillusioned Doflamingo and instigated him to a life of crime.\n​​​​\nRegardless of the role Trebol played in Doflamingo's childhood, the fact remains that he's unlikable because he's annoying, meddlesome, and possibly the most repulsive character in the series.\nRelated: 10 Important One Piece Characters Netflix's Remake Will Probably Never Show\nOrochi is easily the most unlikable character in One Piece. In fact, if being a terrible ruler were a competition, Orochi might even give Doflamingo a run for his money. Not only did Orochi underhandedly grab the title of the shogun, but he also sold his people into slavery to a vicious pirate all while starving them by keeping all the resources untouched by pollution to himself. Moreover, Orochi turned on the only man who took him in all out of resentment and his thirst for vengeance. Yet, despite his anger, Orochi could not bring himself to face the Akazaya Nine and Oden, choosing instead to hide behind Kaido like the coward he is.\nOverall, Wano's story is incredibly tragic, and it's hard to believe a man as pathetic as Orochi almost managed to destroy the entire nation which makes it all the more satisfying when Orochi finally meets his fate for his actions.\nAll in all, only time will tell whether any of these characters will get the chance to redeem themselves. Considering Oda's ability to turn characters on their head and the fact that he has surprised readers before with once unlikable characters like Franky even joining the Straw Hats, it's safe to say nothing is entirely impossible. Unlikely as it seems, there may even be a sliver of hope for One Piece characters like Wapol and Akainu.\nMerlyn De Souza is a freelance writer and anime enthusiast with a Bachelor's degree in English Literature.

{"title": "Wheel Of Time: Why The Season 1 Finale Faked Loial's Death", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:34", "text": "Wheel of Time made a surprising choice in the season 1 finale when it pretended to kill off Loial. Here's why that moment was included.\nAmazon’s The Wheel of Time show made a surprising choice when it faked Loial’s death in the season 1 finale, but how did Loial survive? During the episode, the fan-favorite Ogier from Robert Jordan’s novels was seemingly murdered by Padan Fain in a gruesome scene. However, it’s now known that Loial hasn’t been removed from the series after all. Loial’s apparent demise sparked shock from the fans, especially since the character is such an important part of Jordan’s Wheel of Time story. Not only that, but his early “death” felt rather pointless, given that he had hardly been around long for it to matter.\nSince he barely knew Rand and the others, the emotional impact of his death on The Wheel of Time characters in season 2 would have been severely limited. The confusion caused by this decision was cleared up after the finale’s release when Wheel of Time showrunner Rafe Judkins addressed the incident. Though the episode provided no hints that Loial survived the stab wounds he sustained in his encounter with Padan Fain, Judkins confirmed that the character was in fact alive. So, this brings up the question of how did Loial survive.\nIn the season 1 finale, Padan Fain (Johann Myers) appeared to deliver the fatal stab wound to Loial, killing the fan-favorite character. However, shortly after this happened, Wheel of Time showrunner Rafe Judkins confirmed the Ogier didn't actually die. Wheel of Time faking Loial's death in the finale and then confirming his survival immediately afterward was an odd creative choice, but not one that was done without a reason. Judkins’ comments on the matter have shed light on why this moment was included.\nAccording to the showrunner, he wanted to use its Loial fakeout to get fans ready for real character deaths. He explained that while he didn’t truly kill off Loial, some book characters will eventually have to die (even if they live in the source material). His thinking was that if viewers thought Loial was dead (albeit only briefly), they would be “emotionally prepared” for that inevitable scenario [via EW].\n\"I wanted people to be a little on their toes, because real deaths are coming for characters that don't die in the books. We have to, because we can't hold 2,000 series regulars through multiple seasons. It's coming, and I want people to emotionally prepare themselves. The thought that Loial might be gone will hopefully start to get people emotionally prepared, but I couldn't. He's my favorite.\"\nThis reasoning makes sense, especially when considering the size of the series’ cast and how long most of the characters stick around. As the Wheel of Time book series went on, Jordan continuously built on to its cast with new characters and expanded the roles of minor ones. Rarely did the books ever kill off or altogether remove a key character. Instead, dozens of Wheel of Time characters popped in and out and lingered on throughout the series. This was true for not only the biggest players in the story, but also recurring allies such as Juilin Sandar, Galad Damodred, Leanne Sharif, Alanna Mosvani, and Logain Ablar.\nAs Judkins has pointed out, the show just “can't hold 2,000 series regulars through multiple seasons.” A few Wheel of Time characters will have to be written out, which is a book change that Judkins has promised will happen at some point or another. And since keeping every main character around just isn’t a sustainable model for a TV show, it’s understandable that some favorites will eventually meet untimely ends before The Wheel of Time ends. But whether faking out Loial’s death has succeeded in preparing audiences for these unexpected deaths remains to be seen.\nRELATED: The 50 Best TV Shows of All Time\nSadly, Wheel of Time never bothered to even explain how Loial survived the apparent death in the first season. In that season 1 finale, Padan stabbed Loial in the chest and it looked like that was enough to kill him. However, when Loial showed back up in season 2, he looked just fine, as if nothing happened. He doesn't even mention getting stabbed in the chest in the first season, and he just shops up looking happy and fit, as he did before this seemingly life-threatening incident. There was a six-month time jump before he showed back up in Wheel of Time, but it seems strange to think that the show has just ignored his near death.\n\n"}

Serving as a spin-off to Amazon's adaptation of The Boys' comics, Gen V drifts away from the source material by adding new characters and storylines to the mix. Despite this deviation, the show stays true to the franchise's essence by not portraying super-powered individuals in a typical light and, instead, satirizing all the moral dilemmas and ethical conflicts they face. To reinstate these ideas and themes, Gen V also drops several easter eggs and references to the story arcs set by The Boys.\nFor instance, the spin-off series not only briefly hints that Homelander is facing legal charges for his public act of violence from The Boys season 3's ending moments but also reveals how The Seven has two empty spots following Queen Maeve and Starlight's season 3 departure. In all of these references, Gen V also surprisingly makes a subtle nod to a character from one of Stephen King's books, which adds more narrative significance to the powers of one of its supes. This clever allusion to Stephen King's work highlights how Gen V offers a rich tapestry of storytelling, making its character beats more impactful.\nRELATED: Gen V's First Major Death Was Already Teased In The Boys Season 3\nGiven how many fantastical characters have telepathic powers that allow them to manipulate others, it is not surprising that Gen V's Cate and Firestarter's Andy have similar mind-control abilities. However, Cate is similar to the Stephen King character because, like Andy, she calls her power \"the push.\" Like Andy's \"push\" powers in Firestarter were \"manufactured\" through unethical experiments performed by a government agency called \"The Shop\" that injected him with a compound named \"Lot Six,\" Cate also acquired her powers through Vought International's evil Compound V experiments.\nBoth characters also experience severe symptoms when they use their powers beyond a limit. While Firstarter's Andy gets nosebleeds, Cate's eyes turn red with blood clots. As Gen V establishes towards the end of episode 2, Cate suffers from brain damage if she does not use her abilities carefully. Although the Stephen King character does not wear gloves like Cate, his \"pushing\" power works best when he uses it on unsuspecting targets. As fascinating as these similarities between Cate and Andy's powers may seem, they make Cate's \"push\" powers in Gen V much darker.\nGen V's references to Stephen King's Firestarter prove that, like Andy, Cate will always carry the heavy burden of internal conflict concerning the ethics of controlling and manipulating others. Like Andy often regrets harming others with his \"push\" powers despite being well-intentioned, Cate will struggle to forgive herself for planting destructive thoughts in other people's heads. And, similar to Andy, even if she tries using her powers for the betterment of society in Gen V, Vought International, like The Shop, will always try to weaponize her and misuse her \"push\" for their personal benefit.\n"}

Here's what we know about the sequel's development status, potential release date, story details, and more.\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley will finally bring Eddie Murphy’s titular ultra-cool law enforcer back for Beverly Hills Cop 4, and after years in development progress on the movie is moving at full steam. The Beverly Hills Cop franchise helped write the formula for buddy-cop action comedies, with Eddie Murphy playing the lead from the very beginning in 1984. Beverly Hills Cop has spawned two sequels so far, with the most recent arriving in 1994. Now, over three decades later, the fourth movie Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley is on the way.\nOnce again starring Eddie Murphy with Mark Malloy in the director's chair, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley is due to arrive on Netflix, as the streamer is teaming up with Paramount to ensure Beverly Hills Cop 4 reaches patient franchise fans. With a cast that includes returning cast members like John Aston and Paul Reiser alongside newcomers like Kevin Bacon and Joseph Gordon Levitt, there are plenty of reasons Axel Foley’s first cast in over three decades is so highly anticipated.\nThe most recent Beverly Hills Cop 4 news came in July 2023, although there was nothing official confirmed by Netflix on what could be a significant move for the Eddie Murphy franchise sequel. According to a report by World of Reel, insider sources claim that Netflix has been test-screening Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley with a view to potentially releasing it earlier than 2024. According to the report, this is to fill a sudden scheduling gap left by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.\nBeverly Hills Cop 4 is currently believed to be in post-production, meaning that a late 2023 release could be possible since - in theory - no further work would be required from the actors, who are still on strike at the time of writing. While the report suggested that Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley has tested incredibly well with audiences there’s been nothing official from Netflix, Paramount, or Eddie Murphy to verify them. If they are accurate, however, it’s possible that the release date of the new Beverly Hills Cop movie could arrive much sooner than expected.\nBeverly Hills Cop 4 was first confirmed back in the 1990s. However, this version wasn’t Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley. There have been multiple failed attempts to bring a fourth Beverly Hills Cop movie to screens, including a version from Paramount that had been slated for a 2016 release, only to be pulled from the studio's schedule a year later. At one point directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah were also attached to a 2020 version of the project, but the original Beverly Hills 4 directors left to work on the now-canceled Batgirl movie.\nThe version of Beverly Hills Cop 4 that’s due to arrive on Netflix was confirmed in 2019 (via Deadline). The final creative team of Mark Molloy directing with Will Beall, Tom Gormican, and Kevin Etten on the scripts wasn’t fully revealed until March 2023, however, despite the new Beverly Hills Cop movie filming in November 2022. The full title of Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley, as well as the addition of Joseph Gordon Levitt and Taylour Paige to the cast, was revealed earlier the same year, in August (via Deadline).\nThere is no Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley release date yet. However, the movie is reportedly currently in post-production, with test screenings possibly even taking place. While a 2024 release date is widely believed to be the earliest Beverly Hills Cop 4 could arrive, a surprise late-2023 arrival on Netflix is still possible.\nThe cast of Beverly Hills Cop 4 features a mix of new faces and returning names from the existing trilogy of Beverly Hills Cop trilogy of movies. Grammy winner and Academy Award-nominated comedy and action legend Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Coming to America) is of course back again as Axel Foley, although this is unsurprising given that the hero of the franchise is a titular one for the fourth entry. Joining Eddie Murphy in the cast of Beverly Hills Cop 4 are:\nJoining the returning franchise cast members for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley are Kevin Bacon, Mark Pellegrino, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Taylour Paige, and Patricia Belcher in undisclosed roles.\nWhile the specifics of the story are being kept under wraps by Netflix and Paramount, there is reportedly a plot synopsis for Beverly Hills Cop 4. A report shared by Moviehole suggests that the story of Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley will see Foley return to LA to investigate a corrupt Beverly Hills police force and a murder connected to them. It’s also been reported that Eddie Murphy’s Axel Foley will have an adult daughter.\nThis has yet to be confirmed by Netflix or Paramount, but many outlets appear to be running with this premise as the plot for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley. It would certainly track with previous entries in the Beverly Hills Cop franchise. It’s also known that Beverly Hills Cop 4 will be yet another buddy cop movie, so Foley won’t be on his own, and his possible partner could be one of his former franchise compatriots or, quite possibly, the rumored cop boyfriend of his estranged daughter.\nZoreb has a passion for cinema and music.

We discussed his Emmy-nominated work on Picard's Borg Queen (Alice Krige/Jane Edwina Seymour), Worf (Michael Dorn), Data (Brent Spiner), and his overall career creating makeup and prosthetics for Star Trek.\nScreen Rant: Congratulations on your Emmy nominations for Picard. I think every other department, especially the actors, the writers, the directors, got robbed this year, but it's great your department got recognized.\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, they did. They did. They did a great job. I was a little disappointed myself.\nYou have a little cameo in the turbo-lift with Seven of Nine in one of the episodes of Picard. Terry Matalas called you out in the commentary.\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, what's funny is most of the Star Treks that I've worked on in the last 27 years, I've played a little part in each one of them. So I always try to put my face on.\nDo you prefer to be Starfleet? Or is there like an alien love to play?\nJames MacKinnon: Well, I was a Borg in season 2. Sorry, season 1, I was a Borg. And then season 2... what was I? I was something else in season 2. But this one, you actually saw my face. Usually I'm completely under makeup.\nI read that you got to do three aliens from your bucket list in Picard season 3. What were the three?\nJames MacKinnon: Well, to do Worf again, to do Data again, and then to do a Ferengi for the second time. It's kind of fun in this world that I'm in that I actually, as an artist, I get to do them one time, and then products and materials change, and years change, and my artistry changes as well. And I get another opportunity to excel make them bigger, better, but still keep the core look about 'em. And that's obviously with Neville Page and Vincent Van Dyke with VVD effects. So it's a good combination of how to keep the fans happy, how to keep the original looks, but elevate the makeups to current day.\nLet's talk about that a little bit. I know you've worked on DS9. I'm a massive Ferengi fan. I love DS9. It's my favorite of the Star Treks. Tell me about upgrading Sneed from Quark in the 90s.\nJames MacKinnon: Well, that's all foam latex back then. And we're obviously shooting on 35 millimeter film. So you have a little bit of play on the paint jobs, on the materials. And now with 8K, 10K, 12K, all the Ks that they have... And now we're doing silicone. We have to, as artists, step up our game because that sees every little nook and cranny of either a mistake in a paint job, a mistake in an application, anything. A mouth opens too big, a crack happens. And I never liked Jason Zimmerman, our visual effects supervisor, to touch any of my work. But if he has to he will. But my goal is for them not to touch anything so that it's all original and not manipulated. So it's just an opportunity. I always say that 8K is made for NASCAR and Animal Planet, not for women of a certain age and older men. It's too much detail. But as an artist, like I say, we have to step up and make sure that these things look amazing because our fans are so, so passionate that they go, \"Oh, in episode 3, two minutes in, that makeup was crappy, and I saw this...\" So that's my goal: For that not to happen.\nLet's talk about the Borg Queen a little bit. Absolutely incredible incarnation of the Borg Queen. What went into creating literally the gnarliest-looking version of the Queen ever?\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, she's a little [H.R.] Giger. She's got a little... she's been screwed up for the last few years because we haven't seen her for 20-some-odd years, right? Since she disappeared in [Star Trek: Voyager's finale]. And I was on set for that kind of stuff, too. I worked on First Contact as well. So it was kind of cool to watch all that happen - we'll go to a little side story about that with Brent - but just to be able to recreate that, and recreate that cool character again and again, you get that next option. But it's a five-hour makeup. There's 13 prosthetics on her face and her body to create that. As well, Dave Blass is creating that set that she's inside, and then she's attached to that, and we have to glue her into that. That actress [Jane Edwina Seymour] did an amazing job sitting there all day for 18 hours, plus five hours in the makeup chair.\nYeah, what a trooper she was. She does such a great performance.\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, she did. She was amazing. A treat to work with.\nThere's a lot of joking around in the commentary for the finale about how Jack [Crusher] was basically the first Borg with hair. And how jealous Jeri Ryan was.\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, that's true. Yeah, yeah.\nWhat was the decision-making for keeping Jack's hair? As opposed to making him bald as a Borg?\nJames MacKinnon: I think that was a Terry decision. I mean, it works. It's the same as on Discovery when our Klingons didn't have hair, and then all of a sudden, in season 2, they have hair. So there are reasons and changes and all that kind of stuff. The reason why we go certain directions. But I think that was a Terry decision. But [Jack] looked... I actually have some photos where I had him as Locutus in the position and the Borg Queen from First Contact. So I got a couple of great photos of them in that same position.\nAnd you worked with Amanda Plummer to create Vadic as well?\nJames MacKinnon: One of my assistants, Hugo Villasenor, actually did that makeup. What a process! That was fun, too, because Amanda is passionate as a great actress, and [for] what she is going to bring on camera. And did she ever pull that off. I mean, as a makeup artist and an actor sitting together, it takes both of us. Neither of us can do it until we come together, and that [makeup] starts to come on. And it's fun to watch as those makeups start applying, and you take away eyebrows, and you put the scars on, they become that actor in the middle of the makeup session too, as well. And they change as a character, and they start becoming it, and they start talking [as the character]. And Amanda's verbiage changed, and her personality changed because she's similar to that, but not really. She's a little more quiet and stuff. But that was a fun process. I mean, it's a process that I can't talk about, but it changed dramatically from what we were originally going to do to what was on script and to what you saw. But it was a great process as an artist to create that method.\nWe talked about Worf. Of course, how great he looks as an older Klingon. He really just never looked better. How did Michael Dorn like that whole transformation to turning him into the samurai Worf?\nJames MacKinnon: Oof. He had some PTSD from DS9 and Voyager and from the past. And it took a minute to get him ready to do this. And I think with the new products and the new silicone... I mean, we did his makeup in hair and 42 minutes. And usually, he was in the chair for two and some odd hours in the past. So we sped up the process [and] he was happier that he didn't have to sit in the chair that much longer. But again, Brent and Jonathan are in the trailer at the same time. So they're laughing and making jokes. So it's that legacy cast being there. And I've worked with them for [years]. I'm almost part of the makeup legacy cast with them as well, which is kind of fun, with so much past and present together.\nBut we used some techniques from the original shows to make him comfortable. Again, he has to leave that trailer, be happy with what he has on, be happy with his character. So our job is to make sure that he walks out feeling that character. So we manipulated some stuff underneath the prosthetics. Because silicone is not porous. So when he sweats, we made little routes for where the sweat was going to come down. But on the original show, he had a sweatband underneath his prosthetic, which on this prosthetic was so super thin, we couldn't. So I cut a sleeve off of a T-shirt and put it around his head. So underneath there, he's got a white T-shirt wrapped around his head. Prosthetic goes over [it]. I painted a little bit of darkness around here because some of it peeked out, but you can't see because the hair covers it. And then that soaked up all of his sweat during the day. It's those kinds of things that, as an artist, you're manipulating and learning as the process happens. And he's happy, and he walks out happy too.\nAnd Brent also looks so good as an older Data. Tell me about like how that was crafted to make Data human but still an android. Just a perfect fusion of both.\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, because on season 1, he was obviously what you call it. And I actually was able to assist Mike Westmore on First Contact. There's a scene where he flips open his hand and there's some wires and stuff. I did that while Mike was doing his face. So I did watch that process. And I talked to Mike before we started shooting and asked what the products were, and they don't exist anymore. It's not the same method and techniques. So I had to recreate those colors with the materials we have today, which sped things up much, much faster. And on this point with Brent, I put a shine. It's like a tattoo color that I swept over across his face. So it gave him a little plastic feeling, a little robotic type feeling, but still wasn't that Data color shimmer shine. And then Maxine Morris, our Department of Hairstyles, did this amazing front lace wig on him that blended with his real hair. So 99% of that is his hair with a lace piece on the front. So you have that realism of his hair, that beautiful white hair, but gives that sharp front edge.\nYeah, he really looked amazing. In your long career with Star Trek, going back to the 90s, where does Picard season 3 rank?\nJames MacKinnon: It's like a combination of all of them. Because like I say, that cast is now there, and to have all those friends for all these years and to be able to do their makeup again. And I'm doing little side gigs with Jonathan now on his little side project. So we still get to keep that relationship. And it's just yeah, it's just all a combination of having them back again. And hopefully, we'll see them again, if everything works out. And I don't know if I get to do it, but we'll see. They always complain that they're poor, so we never know. They never have any money.\nWhat are you proudest of in terms of Picard season 3, and the work you were able to do? This amazing work to bring all these prosthetics and makeup and everything to life.\nJames MacKinnon: I just think for me when I watch it, and we got to watch it on IMAX, if you can create a makeup that the audience and fans don't see the makeup, I have done my job. So with that massive screen, and I'm scared when I go to those because if I go, oof! I make some weird faces sometimes. But I didn't. I didn't. Everything looked fantastic. And it's almost like we're shooting a feature each week. Yeah, every week we're shooting a feature. So there, you have to step up your game as an artist to keep up with it. And the technology is only going to get better, and you're going to see more pores next year with the bigger TVs. Like, I have a 95-inch TV in front of me. It's almost the size of a theater, and you can see everything. So when I know that I can trick the eye of the viewer for it not to be a makeup and immerse yourself into that, I've done my job.\nThe third and final season of Star Trek: Picard features Jean-Luc Picard during the 25th century as he reunites with the former command crew of the USS Enterprise while facing a mysterious new enemy who is hunting Picard's son.\nCheck out our other Star Trek: Picard season 3 interviews here:\nStar Trek: Picard – The Final Season is available now on DVD, Blu-ray™, and a limited-edition Blu-ray SteelBook from Paramount Home Entertainment.

{"title": "10 Most Ridiculous Final Destination Deaths", "date": "2023-10-05 18:10:28", "text": "The Final Destination franchise features plenty of ridiculous kills, but there's a sense of palpable horror inherent to event the most absurd deaths.\nThe Final Destination series is known for its creative and gruesome deaths, with some of its most ridiculous still remembered as the best. The film series began in 2000 with the original Final Destination, wherein a teenager’s premonition saves several members of his high school class from an air disaster, only for death to come for the survivors in a series unexpected and violent accidents. Originally, Final Destination was written as an X-Files spec script before its author, Jeffrey Reddick, expanded the concept into a full movie.\nThe concept of death coming to the survivors through apparent accidents only materialized in a rewrite from filmmaking team Glen Morgan and James Wong, but it quickly became a core part of the franchise’s identity. While most teen-oriented horror films feature a malignant slasher killer, the notion of an omnipotent force of death motivating the accidents makes the kills all the more harrowing, even at their most absurd. As the franchise goes on, it embraces more and more absurd comedy in its gruesome death traps that have become a staple of the series.\nRELATED: Final Destination: Every Death Rule (& Exception) Explained\nRory Peters' death in Final Destination 2 displays the franchise’s knack for understanding the intrusive fear wrapped up in common objects, as well as a characteristic disrespect for the laws of physics. As an exploding van propels a length of barbed wire fencing through the air, poor Rory Peters is run clean through while still standing. The uneven cut, which also takes off one arm at the elbow, is unsettling in its specificity. Other details, like Rory’s still-moving expression of surprise and the wet, textured sound design, make the absurd death stick in the viewer’s memory.\nThe Final Destination franchise thrives off its wry balance of existential horror and pitch-black humor. One moment that successfully leverages its horror into laughs is the barbecue explosion that caps off Final Destination 2. As young Brian Gibbons goes to tend to the barbecue, his family reveals that Brian was also one of the survivors of the movie’s opening disaster, making him another target of death's design. The ensuing explosion which annihilates Brian and sends his dismembered arm flying onto the picnic table before his screeching mother is paced like a punchline, buttoning up the movie with a sick laugh.\nThe Final Destination breaks new ground for the series by featuring two mass-death premonitions rather than one. The second, a catastrophe set off by a shopping mall explosion, sees Nick’s girlfriend Lori sucked up into the exposed mechanism of an escalator. It’s quite contrived as Final Destination deaths go, since Lori had plenty of time to get away from it, and the mechanism reaching her foot somehow causes her to begin spitting up blood. Nevertheless, Lori being slowly crushed like a tube of toothpaste is just the kind of grisly image the series does well.\nOne of the most infamous deaths in the Final Destination series comes in the third installment with the egregious tanning beds scene. As Ashley and Ashlyn manage to trap themselves in malfunctioning tanning beds, the rapidly increasing heat proceeds to microwave the two alive. The absurd concept and gruesome execution finds the perfect balance between horror and comedy. The scene also gives way to one of the best match cuts in cinema history, as the two flaming tanning beds cut to Ashley and Ashlyn’s twin coffins.\nAs the Final Destination franchise progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult for the filmmakers to stay ahead of the audience’s expectations. One smart act of subversion comes in Final Destination 3, when the two main characters narrowly avoid death by escaping their car moments before it gets demolished by an out-of-control truck. However, death still gets its satisfaction, as the engine block of their car goes flying into the vehicle in front of them, which happened to be occupied by another death-cheating survivor, Frankie. Once again, the series makes the death disturbingly textured by having the engine’s fan blend the back of Frankie’s head into soup.\nIn Final Destination 2, the series ratchets up the suspense on doomed Evan by exposing him to a near-comic gauntlet of potential death traps, from fire, to a malfunctioning garbage disposal, to a sparking microwave. The punchline comes when Evan meets his end thanks to a forgotten pile of discarded spaghetti. As he slips and falls directly under the fire escape ladder, it gives way and punctures his skull. While a ladder malfunction is one of the more likely Final Destination deaths, the absurd gauntlet of death traps that precedes it makes the sequence farcical.\nFinal Destination proves itself one of the most consistent horror franchises thanks to its enduring capacity to conjure gruesome deaths out of the most banal situations. In The Final Destination, the swimming pool goes to show the series still has its edge, four movies in. As Hunt Wynorski takes a dip in the pool, a malfunctioning filter seizes him and sucks his innards out (presumably through his anus). Again, it’s a death that plays fast and loose with the laws of engineering and of physics in general, but the film’s exploitation of a fear of pool filters is affecting nonetheless.\nOne of the franchise’s best fakeouts gives way to one of its most memorable deaths in Final Destination 2. After a tense trip to the dentist, packed with ominous implements and a near miss with an airway-blocking plastic fish, Tim seems to be out of danger, but he isn’t exempt from the rules of Final Destination. His penchant for chasing pigeons causes the birds to send a pane of glass crashing on top of him. The franchise has shown characters being crushed before, but the utter pancaking that occurs with Tim's giant pane of glass is novel and macabre.\nFinal Destination 5 stepped away from the franchise’s increasingly comedic tone with a more serious fifth outing, defined by its tension powerhouse gymnastic scene. Since the films have trained their audience to understand the catastrophic chain reaction that can be set off by a single mishap, a falling air conditioner screw landing on a gymnastics beam fills the scene with creeping dread. When it finally pays off, the ensuing calamity launches gymnast Candice to her death from a parallel bar. However, the series still delivers the absurdity with the over-the-top gruesomeness of her death, as Candice’s spine explodes from her back on impact, folding her body like an ironing board.\nDespite the horror movie's unfairly low Rotten Tomatoes score, the original Final Destination is still the best in the franchise. The film delivers a series of unique and shocking deaths that each boast their own gruesome charms. Arguably the best death in the film is its most excessive, as a series of home mishaps at Mrs Lewton’s house all come to a head, inflicting an overkill death on the teacher. Shards of glass from an exploding computer slash her throat, a kitchen knife is pushed into her chest, and, to cap things off, her house explodes. It’s a display of absurd excess that the Final Destination franchise never tops.\n"}
{"title": "Robert De Niro Berates Leonardo DiCaprio’s Murder Tactics in Killers of the Flower Moon Clip", "date": "2023-10-05 18:18:10", "text": "New Killers of the Flower Moon clip shows Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro in dire straits as they face the consequences of their botched murder.\nRobert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio face the chaotic consequences of their murder in a new Killers of the Flower Moon clip. From director Martin Scorsese, Killers of the Flower Moon tackles the story of a series of mysterious murders of members of the Osage tribe in the 1920s United States. In addition to De Niro and DiCaprio, Killers of the Flower Moon stars Lily Gladstone, Jesse Plemons, Tantoo Cardinal, and John Lithgow.\nAhead of the release of Killers of the Flower Moon, a new clip from Entertainment Weekly shows De Niro and DiCaprio’s characters in dire straits. In the clip, De Niro’s character chastises DiCaprio’s character for how he went about a planned murder, that was supposed to look like a suicide. DiCaprio’s character asserts that he told a presumably hired assassin to shoot the victim in the front of the head and leave the gun behind, while De Niro yells at him for being “foolish.”\nDiCaprio plays Ernest Burkhart opposite De Niro’s William K Hale, both of whom were real-life figures who played a part in the Osage murders. This new Killers of the Flower Moon clip hints at the relationship between the two characters, both of which have their own moral corruptions. Hale is a mastermind behind the murder plot, while Burkhart is willing to go to extreme lengths to please Hale.\nKillers of the Flower Moon is significant for the actors in that it unites the two of them in a Scorsese-directed feature for the first time. Despite this milestone, De Niro and DiCaprio’s working relationship goes 30 years back, when the two co-starred in 1993’s This Boy’s Life. According to an interview with Scorsese, it was De Niro who helped convince the director to cast DiCaprio in one of his films, after being so impressed with the emergent actor’s work on This Boy’s Life.\nSince first teaming up with Scorsese in Gangs of New York, DiCaprio has become a Scorsese regular. De Niro has maintained this relationship too, which originated in Scorsese’s Mean Streets and has continued through renowned films like Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and The Irishman. De Niro and DiCaprio did appear together in one other Scorsese-directed, co-starring in Scorsese’s 2015 short film The Audition. Killers of the Flower Moon is DiCaprio and De Niro’s shot for a feature-length unfolding of their working relationship, and if this newest clip is any indication, this effort will not disappoint.\nSource: EW\n"}

Among these books is Morte's Planar Parade, a new companion book to the standard Monster Manual that adds many mighty monsters to the multiversal menagerie. Using similar presentations of stat blocks, Morte's Planar Parade has more than 60 enemies included for adventuring parties to vanquish, or at least attempt to.\nThe set of books in Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse includes lots of new content for DnD, including everything from new magic items to unique and incredible fantasy adventures for DMs to use to warp realities. For truly adventurous dungeon masters, the bestiary in Morte's Planar Parade could also be used to add fantastical creatures to other campaigns or homebrew games as well. Among the numerous additions in the set, here are a few of the most powerful and strongest monsters for players to watch out for.\nRelated: D&D Planescape Preview: A High-Level Adventure With A Catch\nAn Eater of Knowledge is a disgusting-looking mass of muscles and brain matter categorized in DnD as a large aberration that is typically neutral evil. Likely it doesn't smell very good either, while it uses its strength to hold its victims as tentacles crack open their brains for it to eat. The Eater of Knowledge becomes more powerful with every brain it eats, learning stronger spells for it to use in its attacks on its future meal. With an AC of 15 and only an average of 102 HP, it isn't impossible to defeat, but if it gets the chance to take its turn, adventurers will want to be prepared.\nThe Avoral Guardinal is one of several guardinals added in Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse and with good rolls could potentially be swayed to being an ally as they are typically neutral good. These eagle-like humanoids are avian Celestials, and are known to dive at enemies from high above and rip them apart with their talons. It does have darkvision of 120 ft and has a passive perception of 21, making it difficult to hide from, and has an AC of 16 and an average of 172 Hit Points.\nBaernaloths are bad enough on their own, but if a hapless adventurer comes across one in its lair, this fiend becomes even more powerful. These monsters enjoy the despair and suffering of others and will use their power to keep victims alive simply to prolong the misery. They are yugoloths who can sometimes summon another yugoloth to fight by their side and have resistance to magic, as well as many nonmagical attacks. When inside a baernaloth's lair, any creature that is not at full hit points must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw and take necrotic damage while they are in the area.\nDnD's Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse adds stat blocks for three demodands, which are Fiends from the Tarterian Depths of Carceri. They are wicked and bitter creatures who were thrown into prison long ago and know they are doomed to return. The Shator demodand is generally the commander of the others and is covered in fungal growths. It has a chance to summon another demodand and has a passive Perception of 23. Its many spells and attacks, combined with an AC of 19 and an average of 195 Hit Points, make it a truly powerful foe to run across.\nRelated: D&D's Planescape Character Options: The New Backgrounds & Feats Explained\nShemeshka is another yugoloth, who happens to be the notorious crime boss at her multiplanar casino Fortune's Wheel, which is a focus of the new DnD adventures in Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse. Even without her lackeys around her, she is strong and has many resistances, immunities, and powerful spells at her disposal - along with an AC of 17, an average of 162 Hit Points, and very high stats.\nOne of the five modrons added to DnD for the Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse books is the Hexton Modron. These huge constructs are the leaders of the modrons when outside of Mechanus. When damaged, they can retaliate with an arc of lightning, and during their turn, they can dispel magic at will. They have an AC of 17 and an average of 209 Hit Points.\nThe Aurumach Rilmani is a large Celestial and is one of the leaders of the rilmani people. They have gold skin and typically do not leave the Outlands, only doing so when they feel they need to destroy any who pose a threat to the stability of the multiverse. They are very skilled in magic and psychic powers and have an Armor Class of 18 in addition to 285 Hit Points.\nPlanar Incarnates are the literal manifestations of good and evil, either Celestial or Fiend, and are of gargantuan size. They look like roiling masses of energies, distinct for each type, and are broken off to protect their plane from threats and then will merge back to their original plane again once the danger is gone. They can take on majestic shapes or are even said to \"appear as unique manifestations of the philosophies they embody\" according to Morte's Planar Parade in the Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse. These powerful beings are immune to most conditions and damages, know all languages, and have very high stats to go with their average 333 Hit Points.\nKolyarut is a construct created by the leader of the modrons which is designed to forge binding contracts and agreements that should never be broken. They have four arms that are made through a combination of magic and machine and are classified as Inevitables. A kolyarut will forcefully destroy anything that stands in the way of what it considers to be the truth or who needs to be punished for breaking any contract.\nRelated: D&D: Planescape Reveals Cool New Styles From The Streets of Sigil [EXCLUSIVE TRAILER]\nDnD's time dragons are able to harness and manipulate any point in time: past, present, or future. There are time dragons of different ages, each with their own powers, but the Ancient Time Dragons are the deadliest of creatures. They have the power to create temporal gates connecting times and places throughout the overarching multiverse in Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse and can banish threats. They are beautiful, majestic-looking dragons, with an average of 536 Hit Points and an AC of 22.\nThey are rated as a challenge of 26 in DnD, for they have very high stats and skills plus the ability to manipulate time around it. If an Ancient Time Dragon dies, it will be reborn with all knowledge and memory of its previous life, including who killed it. This makes them a formidable new foe for Dungeons & Dragons.\nSource: D&DBeyond\n"}
{"title": "Big Brother Live Feed Viewers Want Cameron Hardin Evicted (He's A Threat)", "date": "2023-10-05 18:22:27", "text": "Big Brother 25 viewers enjoy Cameron Hardin on the weekly episodes, but those watching the live feeds are seeing a different side of the houseguest.\nBig Brother 25 viewers have been enjoying watching Cameron Hardin take on the competition, but those who are watching him on the BB live feeds have a different take on the competitor's sometimes inappropriate behavior. Cameron, who has been in the Big Brother house for over 60 days and spent the majority of his time on the nomination block, has faced challenges during his time on the series. A stay-at-home dad, Cameron has been away from his daughter for over 2 months and fought hard to stay in the BB house, even being brought back after a unanimous eviction. Cameron's gameplay has been impressive, but it isn't always clean.\nOn the weekly episodes, Cameron is being edited to seem like a game player who doesn't let things get too personal, but for viewers who are indulging in the Big Brother 24-hour live feeds, Cameron takes on an entirely different personality. Cameron, who presents as a care-free, fun guy that just wants to play Big Brother, has been saying some alarming things to his fellow houseguests, which have confounded live feed viewers. Though he appears as a master manipulator on Big Brother's TV aired episodes, Cameron has made it clear that he's more of a villain than most viewers imagined.\nWhile Big Brother is a game that requires manipulation the majority of the time, Cameron is taking his emotionally manipulative tactics to another level. During his second Head Of Household reign, Cameron's targets included Survivor legend Cirie Fields' closest allies, Izzy Gleicher and Felicia Cannon. He felt that he could take Cirie's power away from her in the game by getting rid of one of her closest allies, targeting Izzy over Felicia, though he didn't much care who went home. Cameron's targets were clear for him, but the emotionally manipulative tactics he used throughout his HOH reign to get Izzy out of the house were exhausting to watch.\nPrior to the nomination ceremony, Cameron decided to pull fellow BB 25 houseguests Blue Kim and Jag Bains up to the HOH room and lie, explaining he'd be nominating them. He was choosing to scare the houseguests in order to get as much information out of them as possible, knowing they were closer to the epicenter of the Cirie/Izzy/Felicia alliance than he was. After intimidating his potential nominees, he seemed almost gleeful in his reaction, loving the fact that he was able to twist them around emotionally as much as he had. This isn't the only instance of Cameron's troubling manipulation tactics, which leave his fellow houseguests feeling wronged.\nAfter BB 25 houseguest Luke Valentine was ejected early in the game for breaking the show's code of conduct, the houseguests have been tremendously careful about what they've said in the BB house. Cameron, who has spent the majority of the season on his own, has made some close-call remarks during the game that many feel could've been pushing the code of conduct. Though his alliance with BB 25 evicted houseguest Red Utley deteriorated after they were put on the nomination block together, both made some ugly remarks about the female houseguests during their time together in the game. After Red's eviction, some wondered if Cameron would calm down.\nDuring his time in the BB house, Cameron has been overtly sexual about several of his younger female houseguests, including BB 25's Reilly Smedley and America Lopez. Reilly was evicted during the second week of the summer and was friendly with Cameron during her time in the house. Though he's mentioned that he felt akin to her because she reminded him of her daughter, Cameron has made remarks about Reilly that are uncomfortable knowing he views her in that light. His comments about America have been explicit and overtly sexual, to the point that some houseguests choose not to leave the pair alone in a room together for America's safety.\nWhile the majority of the houseguests left in the Big Brother 25 house have tried to make themselves as comfortable with Cameron as possible, the houseguests who have been evicted from the game have spoken out about his behavior. Kirsten Elwin, the first evicted houseguest of the season, has been able to watch the entirety of the season and comment on the houseguests behavior as she's followed along. Having never been a fan of Cameron due to his abrasive personality, Kirsten hasn't been kind about his inappropriate comments and has even found herself calling him out on social media for the things he's said in the Big Brother house.\nKirsten has spoken out about the way Cameron speaks to America, unhappy with the fact that he continues to make explicitly sexual remarks to her even though she's both unresponsive and in a showmance with another houseguest. She's also called out the way that Cameron has acted towards the houseguests of color, as his behavior is riddled with microaggressions and his vernacular leaves much to be desired. In a recent post, Kirsten called Cameron out for calling her \"cotton\", appalled at the connotation of the word being used about a woman of color. Kirsten rightfully put Cameron on blast, calling for BB to do something about the racially insensitive behavior.\nCameron has been making remarks to America throughout Big Brother 25, despite the fact that she's been in a showmance with Cory Wurtenberger for weeks. Though it wasn't clear where America and Cory stood to some of the other houseguests early on in their relationship, it has become obvious. Cameron, who says he feels like Cory is his brother, was clearly put-off by the fact that America was interested in Cory rather than him, as Cameron and America had been playfully flirty early in the game. While America has engaged in the behavior, Cameron has taken it further than expected, making overtly sexual comments that America is openly uncomfortable with.\nCameron's jealousy has been obvious as he continually stared the pair down any time they were in communal areas or interrupted them when they were spending time one-on-one. He's told both Cory and America to distance from one another, angry when they refuse to do so, and has even targeted Cory in the game in jealousy. Though Cory has always supported Cameron in the house, he's chosen to take a path of destruction against Cory while talking poorly about America behind her back. The aggression in his gameplay is new towards the pair, and only happened after America stopped openly flirting with Cameron to make herself and Cory's relationship obvious.\nCameron was evicted unanimously during Big Brother 25 week 7, but his eviction was overturned by a twist in the game that allowed him to come back into the house and compete for his BB life. Cameron, who is a competitive threat in the game, won the competition against Jared Fields and got to come back into the house, but in the time between his eviction and re-entry to the game, it was clear that Cameron was angling for his spot. During his pitch to his fellow Big Brother houseguests to keep him around, Cameron used a bargaining tool that seemed off-putting to houseguests, and irked live feed viewers.\nCameron was hoping for just one more week of safety so he could make it to the jury house. The competitors who make it to the jury phase of the competition are paid handsomely for their time. Cameron, who left his daughter to come on Big Brother, explained to anyone who would listen that he didn't need to win the game, he simply wanted to make it to jury in order to make the most money he could. While it's understandable, Cameron rubbed his fellow houseguests the wrong way saying he didn't need to win the game, as the people left in the house are interested in playing to win.\nBig Brother 25 airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT, Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EDT, and Thursdays at 9 p.m. EDT on CBS.\n"}

Are the couple engaged now and is she in America?\n90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days couple Christian Allgood and Cleo surprisingly stayed together after the finale and revealed plans of getting engaged in the Tell All. Cleo, a 32-year-old trans woman living in England, is originally from Italy. Cleo and Christian, 28, met on social media and were good friends for a year before they started dating. Christian had no experience in dating a transgender partner before. While he seemed ready to meet Cleo in person, his family raised concerns about their relationship.\nChristian decided he would not show his affection for Cleo in public. He also acted quite friendly with other women while Cleo was right next to him, which made it look like Christian wasn’t serious about being with Cleo. He even refused to acknowledge to the cameras that they’d had sex. These ups and downs, however, didn’t affect the positive outcome of the relationship. Cleo and Christian revealed they were together at the Tell All. Cleo even came to America to stay with him for a month. But has she moved to the U.S. for good after Christian revealed he wanted to get engaged?\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nOut of all the shocking revelations during the Tell All, the most jaw-dropping one was Christian asking Cleo to marry him. The couple had seen each other just a few days before they filmed the reunion. Cleo had spent time with the women in Christian’s family, and they liked her. Christian said Cleo wanted to see him again in London. He wanted Cleo should come to the States. “And I don't mean to just visit,” he added. “Would you be willing to marry me?\" Christian asked Cleo out of the blue.\nCleo was not expecting a proposal from Christian at all. She couldn’t contain her shock when she mumbled, “Oh my God.” Christian assured Cleo that this wasn’t an official proposal as he wanted it to happen in person. He asked Cleo, after everything they’d been through, if this was something she could consider. Cleo was at a loss for words but proclaimed her love for Christian. “I think there should be a better place for that though,” she said. Christian promised host Shaun Robinson that there was an engagement on the horizon and a K-1 visa process was getting started.\n“It’s something that we’ve talked about,” Christian said about Cleo moving to the U.S. to marry him. Christian finally posted about Cleo on his Instagram page on September 25, 2023. He wrote he wanted to do it without “spoiling it” for the fans. “Here’s just a photo of us together in Minnesota enjoying some cocktails and dinner with good friends,” said Christian about the picture.

A look at all the spoilers revealed about the couple online.\n90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way couple Brandan DeNuccio and Mary Demasu-ay have reportedly been fired from the franchise. Brandan met Mary on a dating app after getting over a bad breakup. Mary had been cheated on multiple times by an ex-boyfriend herself when she decided to match with Brandan, who she thought looked like a mix of Justin Bieber and Harry Potter. However, Brandan and Mary became too possessive of each other.\nBrandan gave in to Mary’s demands when she insisted they be on video calls 24/7. Her demands made Brandan lose multiple jobs. He eventually flew to the Philippines to spend a lifetime with her. While the couple is yet to marry on the show, a cast member from a different 90 Day Fiancé spin-off, Statler Riley, has made an alarming claim about Mary and Brandan being fired. Statler revealed that Brandan and Mary overshared personal information online, spoiling their season. The pair has yet to address the rumors, but it’s likely that they might have broken some rules from their contract.\nBrandan and Mary’s wedding photos were posted online before their 90 Day Fiancé debut. Brandan spilled the secret on his social media. He then gave away a major spoiler about his relationship with Mary on Instagram. He had written, “Happily Married” in his Instagram bio. According to Starcasm, Mary also changed her last name to DeNuccio to match her husband’s on Facebook.\nBrandan’s mother Angela may have been against him moving to the Philippines during her appearances on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way, but it was she who revealed Brandan and Mary got married on her Facebook in April 2023. InTouch confirmed that Angela posted several photos from Brandan and Mary’s wedding reception on her social media on April 28, 2023. It's assumed that this is the date Brandan and Mary tied the knot. Angela also told someone in the comments that the wedding was filmed and would be shown in a future episode of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way.​​​​​​​\nInstagram page @mac.and.chisme shared evidence of Mary confirming her pregnancy in DM with a fan. A “close source” to the Instagram page was talking to Mary, and she admitted that she doesn’t watch the show because she’s “scared of judgements of the people.” She told them she hated that they were the “toxic couple,” of the season even if they aren't anymore. “It’s just I can’t watch it rn you know I’m pregnant hehe,” was one of the messages Mary sent the source.\n90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on TLC.\nSources: Starcasm, InTouch, @mac.and.chisme/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "It's A Wonderful Knife Trailer: Justin Long Stars In Holiday Slasher Movie", "date": "2023-10-05 18:28:23", "text": "It's a Wonderful Knife trailer shows Justin Long in a horror twist of the classic James Stewart Christmas-centered film It's a Wonderful Life.\nA new trailer has been released for the upcoming holiday slasher film It’s a Wonderful Knife. Starring Justin Long, It’s a Wonderful Knife is a comedy-horror with a twist on the classic film It’s a Wonderful Life. It’s a Wonderful Knife will be released on November 10.\nDropped by RLJE Films, the It’s a Wonderful Knife trailer gives the first look at the holiday slasher.\nIn the trailer, It’s a Wonderful Life shows Winnie Carruthers, who wishes that she had never been born. Set to the tune of “Jingle Bells,” the It’s a Wonderful Knife trailer follows Winnie as she discovers a series of murders in her hometown and attempts to stop the killer in his tracks.\nAs mentioned in the trailer, It’s a Wonderful Knife has the same producers as the 2020 Vince Vaughn film Freaky. Taking on a similar twisted approach, Freaky retells the classic body-swap film Freaky Friday and turns it into a horror narrative wherein high school student Millie swaps bodies with a middle-aged serial killer. The film gained a decent following, and Freaky 2 has since been announced. Freaky and It’s a Wonderful Knife are two of several recent horror films that take a similar approach. Freaky director Christopher Landon previously made a Groundhog Day inspired horror movie in 2017 titled Happy Death Day.\nIt’s a Wonderful Knife sees director Tyler MacIntyre at the helm. It’s a Wonderful Knife seems to push and pull with the source material in similar ways as did Happy Death Day and Freaky. The wish-one-had-never-been-born framework remains, and elements such as the presence of angels are borrowed from It’s a Wonderful Life, while original horror elements are also introduced.\nWhile it can partially rely on the cult success of its predecessors, It’s a Wonderful Knife is also being released at a good moment for horror parody. 2023 brought the infamous Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey, which posited the likes of Pooh Bear and Piglet in more grotesque scenarios. While based on starkly different material, It’s a Wonderful Knife could do well riding the recent tidal wave of both horror parody and its predecessors.\nSource: RLJE Films\n"}
{"title": "11 Shows That Set The Gold Standard For Modern TV", "date": "2023-10-05 18:30:29", "text": "From The Sopranos to Breaking Bad, there are a ton of groundbreaking TV shows that set the gold standard for the modern television landscape.\nFrom The Sopranos to Breaking Bad, there are plenty of great shows that set the gold standard for modern television. While cinema has gone downhill in the 21st century, with the rise of CG-riddled I.P.-based blockbusters, TV has only gotten better. For decades, television rigidly stuck to established formulas with its stories and characters. But, when those formulaic TV shows inevitably grew stale, writers like David Chase and Vince Gilligan came along to shake up those formulas with morally gray antiheroes, long-running serialized storylines, and a truly cinematic sensibility.\nFor a long time, television was considered to be a lesser medium to the more grandiose forms of media like movies and the theater. But in the past couple of decades, trailblazing shows like Mad Men and Band of Brothers have turned TV into a respected art form. Those shows, combined with others like The Wire and True Detective, have contributed to the so-called “Golden Age of Television” that audiences are currently enjoying.\nRELATED: 10 Best TV Shows About Making TV Shows\nWith their HBO miniseries Band of Brothers, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg proved that a TV show about the Second World War can be just as big and grand and eventful as a movie about the Second World War, like their own Saving Private Ryan. Dramatizing the history of the “Easy” Company, Band of Brothers explores the conflict from a ground-level soldier’s perspective. Band of Brothers is as visceral and intense a portrayal of the horrors of warfare as any war movie ever made.\nVery few TV comedies have a joke-per-minute rate to rival that of Arrested Development. Most sitcoms get laughs purely from the situations and the dialogue, but Arrested Development proved that it’s possible to get laughs with cinematography, music, and editing, too. Arrested Development is filled with so many jokes and sight gags that every episode holds up to countless rewatches to spot them all. Every great single-camera comedy series from 30 Rock to Community was influenced by Arrested Development.\nJesse Armstrong pioneered a whole new kind of satire with Succession. His Shakespearean study of the spoilt brats fighting over their dying father’s media empire is both endlessly hilarious and deeply heartbreaking. The show gives the audience plenty of room to both laugh at the excesses of these absurdly wealthy characters and care intimately about their personal problems. The Roys are oddly endearing, and Succession strikes a unique balance between sympathy and mockery.\nAfter the game-changing arcs of Tony Soprano and Vic Mackey, Mad Men came along to prove that TV antiheroes don’t need to kill people to be compelling. Ad executive Don Draper is a captivating character whose highest-stakes conflict is whether or not he can land the Lucky Strike account. Matthew Weiner and his writers’ room used Don’s ad agency as a backdrop to explore all the social, political, and economic revolutions that American society underwent in the 1960s.\nFormer crime reporter David Simon captures the inner workings of the city of Baltimore with the depth and realism of a documentary in The Wire. Covering everything from the illegal drug trade to the underfunded public schools, The Wire is a razor-sharp study of crime and corruption in the American city. The series encapsulates the impact that institutions have on individuals, and the sociopolitical systems that prevent real change and perpetuate the cycles of violence and poverty. The Wire reinvented what a TV show could do.\nWhile the subsequent seasons have been kind of hit-and-miss, the first season of True Detective is top-tier television. A lot of modern TV shows style themselves as really long movies cut up into episodes, but True Detective season 1 really achieves that ambition with cinematic visuals, big-screen star power, and a single cohesive narrative that doesn’t get bogged down in unnecessary subplots. True Detective season 1 is a mesmerizing Southern Gothic detective noir told on two parallel timelines through the strained “buddy cop” pairing of a perfectly matched Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey.\nCraig Mazin brought the 1986 Chernobyl disaster to life in his HBO miniseries about the subject. Everything in Chernobyl is perfect: the atmospheric cinematography, the disturbing musical score, the grave seriousness of the actors’ performances. Chernobyl is a rare triumph of both the technical aspects of filmmaking and the specifics of historical accuracy. Some liberties were taken for dramatic purposes, but Chernobyl’s attention to detail is truly impressive.\nLarry David’s second sitcom deconstructed and revolutionized the entire genre. Curb Your Enthusiasm takes Seinfeld’s satirical exploration of the minutiae of everyday life and blurs the line between reality and fiction. Rather than shooting on a stage with a live audience and a laugh track, Curb Your Enthusiasm removes all the artifice of the sitcom with improvised dialogue, handheld documentary-like camerawork, and actors playing themselves. Curb Your Enthusiasm opened up the TV comedy to new possibilities, and continues to influence the genre to this day.\nDavid Chase singlehandedly kicked off the “Golden Age of Television” with his revolutionary work on The Sopranos. The Sopranos realized the cinematic potential of television with surreal dream sequences, pitch-black humor, and a wide variety of filming locations. It completely deconstructs the gangster genre with a typically stoic mob boss who starts opening up and feeling his feelings when he enters therapy. James Gandolfini and Chase’s team of writers combined forces to give audiences a more complex and rounded portrait of Tony Soprano than any previous TV show had done with its protagonist.\nVince Gilligan reimagined the purpose of a TV series with Breaking Bad. Most shows are designed to maintain the status quo, so the series can go on indefinitely. But Breaking Bad was defined by change as Gilligan famously envisioned turning Mr. Chips into Scarface. Breaking Bad is an intimate character study of a mild-mannered chemistry teacher who gradually embraces his dark side as he rises through the criminal underworld to become a meth kingpin. Breaking Bad also introduced the notion that TV directors can get creative with their cinematography and don’t have to feel confined by standard methods of coverage.\nWith his surprisingly harrowing series BoJack Horseman, Raphael Bob-Waksberg proved that dark character studies like Breaking Bad and wacky animated comedies like Family Guy aren’t mutually exclusive. BoJack Horseman started as a lighthearted Hollywood satire about a washed-up sitcom actor who happens to be a talking horse. But it quickly turned darker than most TV dramas as it dug into BoJack’s problems with addiction and mental health. It’s not an easy watch (particularly in its later seasons), but BoJack Horseman is a profound and groundbreaking series.\n"}
{"title": "Foe Director Garth Davis On The Narrative Complexities Of The Sci-Fi Thriller", "date": "2023-10-05 18:30:29", "text": "Garth Davis, the director and co-writer of Foe, discusses the intricacies and overarching environmental themes of the new sci-fi thriller.\nFoe is a sci-fi thriller that explores the idea of AI replacement and what it means to be human. Based on the book of the same name by Iain Reid - who previously wrote I'm Thinking of Ending Things - the story centers on a married couple whose life is thrown into turmoil after the arrival of a mysterious stranger. The film has an incredibly small cast, with just three main members: Little Women's Saoirse Ronan, Normal People's Paul Mescal, and Brother's Aaron Pierre.\nThe movie's Black Mirror-esque plot centers around Ronan and Mescal's characters Hen and Junior, a married couple who live on a generations-old farm in the year 2065. One night, Pierre's character Terrance arrives and informs them that Junior has been chosen to be a part of a special space program that will necessitate him leaving Earth for two years. As part of preparations for his departure, Terrance begins conducting a series of interviews and observations in order to design a sentient replacement to replace Junior in his absence, putting a huge existential strain on the couple's marriage.\nRelated: Foe: Release Date, Trailer & Everything We Know About The Prime Video Sci-Fi Thriller\nScreen Rant sat down with Foe's co-writer and director Garth Davis to discuss what it was like working with such a small cast, layered storytelling, and the biggest challenges in making the film.\nScreen Rant: First, I would just love to know what elements of the novel were the ones you wanted to be sure came through in the film the most.\nGarth Davis: I guess for me, what I really wanted to come through was Hen's story, how she is really fighting for this marriage and fighting for agency and her own destiny and her own life. I really wanted that to come through, that was the main - that's the heart and soul of the film for me.\nAnd what was it like working with Saoirse and Paul, were there any moments that stick out to you from set especially?\nGarth Davis: I guess all of them. I mean, every day going to set was a joy; they're wonderful human beings, and very collaborative and brilliant with their choices, and just so easy to work with, and so there's just such a great sense of play and craft and professionalism. So it was a joy going to set every day working with these actors, with this material, because it was so complex and exciting to explore. And also Aaron Pierre was also just wonderful to work with as well.\nAnd this movie has an incredibly small cast compared to projects that you've done in the past. I'm curious what that adjustment was like, was it weird at all to go down to so few people for the most part?\nGarth Davis: I was desperate for it. I mean, in a way I can do these big sweeping things, but ultimately the stuff that really puts a fire in the belly is when I'm just on the actor's face doing something beautiful. So I guess I was just trying to find some material that would have a lot of complexity and potential to give the actors a lot of stuff to explore. And there's so many layers and complexity to the story, and it was just like a delicious experiment which was all about acting, it was all about the human condition. So that was super exciting.\nWere there any things that stick out to you that were incredibly challenging to get just right?\nGarth Davis: I mean, they're all challenging, but probably the one that was the most challenging and we went through rehearsals quite a bit was the opening scene when Terrance comes into the house and they sit in the lounge room, because there's so many things going on at that moment. There's so many secret rivers - the story you think you're watching, the story that's really happening. So all of the actors are doing a multitude of things, and there's a lot of, \"How much do we reveal? How much do we conceal?\" So I think trying to find the reality of that conceit was the greatest challenge. It was very complex, so that was probably - for all of us - the greatest challenge was that scene.\nAnd there's a strong relationship in this film between Junior and Hen's relationship and the environmental climate around them. How would you compare those two things in the film?\nGarth Davis: Well, Saoirse I think said at one point,\"The way you behave, the way you treat someone, is the same way you treat the planet,\" like there's a direct parallel. But I love the idea that this decaying marriage kind of echoes and mirrors the decaying planet. And I guess the conversation in that connection is they're one and the same thing. So if the planet is dying, it's only saying that we're also dying inside of us as well, and I guess I found that a really fascinating metaphor and theme to bring through.\nAcademy Award nominees Saoirse Ronan and Paul Mescal star in Foe, a haunting exploration of marriage and identity set in an uncertain world. Hen and Junior farm a secluded piece of land that has been in Junior’s family for generations, but their quiet life is thrown into turmoil when an uninvited stranger (Aaron Pierre) shows up at their door with a startling proposal. Based on best-selling author Iain Reid’s novel, directed by Garth Davis, and co-written by Davis and Reid, Foe’s mesmerizing imagery and persistent questions about the nature of humanity (and artificial humanity) bring the not-too-distant future to luminous life.\nCheck back soon for our other Foe interviews here:\nFoe releases in theaters on October 6.\nSource: Screen Rant Plus\n"}
{"title": "&quot;Define An Era&quot;: How Dave Filoni's Star Wars Movie Will Change The Franchise", "date": "2023-10-05 18:36:01", "text": "Dave Filoni has shared about the importance of a film defining an era, hinting towards how his Mandalorian movie will change the Star Wars franchise.\nThe anticipation for Dave Filoni's Star Wars movie set in The Mandalorian-era has only grown since the conclusion of the Ahsoka series, and the director has already provided a hint as to how it will impact the franchise. Filoni's The Mandalorian movie is expected to be a culmination of the events that take place in Star Wars Disney+ TV shows such as The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, and soon-to-arrive Skeleton Crew. The story has already been compared to an Avengers-esque team-up of heroes like Din Djarin and Ahsoka Tano to face off against Grand Admiral Thrawn, and now, Filoni may be hinting towards another important detail.\nIn speaking with Empire, Filoni describes the importance of a movie having a moment that can \"define an era,\" likening it to Luke Skywalker blowing up the Death Star in A New Hope. He ties it into the idea of \"characters coming together\" as well, something that's inevitable for his upcoming Star Wars movie.\nTo me, a theatrical experience has to have a big idea – a monumental moment in the time period that changes what’s happening. What Tony [Gilroy] has done [in Andor] and what we did in Rebels, everything then changes when Luke blows up the Death Star. You’re looking for those moments that define an era, and that’s what the films really should be about – whether it’s characters coming together, or a defining moment.\nFiloni, then, is pointing towards what viewers can start to expect from his movie. If the idea of the characters coming together for a defining moment in a movie is so important to him, then there's some idea of what that defining moment might be.\nBy the time of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Coruscant is no longer the capital of the New Republic. At some point, it moves to Hosnian Prime, and Filoni's Star Wars movie could be the moment where this change is finally seen - and it may be because of the fall of Coruscant. The Mandalorian season 3 spent quite some time on Coruscant, with episode 3 having spent nearly its entire duration there, and now Ahsoka has also done the work of tying in the New Republic and Coruscant. All of this could be leading to the fall of the infamous capital, especially now that Thrawn has returned.\nRelated: New Star Wars Movies: Every Upcoming Movie & Release Date\nWhatever this moment may turn out to be in Filoni's Star Wars movie, one thing is for certain: the movie will define The Mandalorian-era. The inevitable team-up of the heroes already promised to start that effort, but Filoni's commitment to create a memorable moment only emphasizes it. The fall of Coruscant would be a perfect moment for Filoni to show in his movie, but no matter what he puts on the big screen, his film will change Star Wars and The Mandalorian-era - and likely for the better.\nSource: Empire\n"}
{"title": "Star Wars Admits Lightsabers Are Useless Against a Central Canon Race", "date": "2023-10-05 18:38:19", "text": "Lightsabers in the Star Wars universe are the ultimate weapon, but a new villain proves they're more useless than fans thought.\nThe Jedi and Sith of the Star Wars universe wield one of the most powerful weapons in the galaxy - but even lightsabers can be useless against certain beings and objects. The iconic symbol of the Star Wars mythos, these \"elegant weapons from a more civilized age\" can stop almost every form of weapon the Empire can create. But in one Star Wars story, the franchise reveals lightsabers fail to work on one key race...and fail to stop a key villain from amassing an army.\nIntroduced in Episode IV: A New Hope in 1977, lightsabers were immediately iconic, with only Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader seen using them. The prequels only expanded what lightsabers could do, showing them deflect blaster bolts back at foes, cut through nearly any solid objects, and prove impossible to stop by anything but another lightsaber. But fans may not realize that one historically significant droid proved too powerful for even a lightsaber to stop.\nIn Star Wars: Revelations #1 the mysterious Eye of Webbish Bog reveals to Darth Vader a vision of a single droid: Ajax Sigma, a being who inspired a revolution among his people. Centuries ago, the Jedi of the High Republic cut down Ajax Sigma's rebellion and his followers in a pitched conflict... but his core processor was preserved, passed down from person to person, and eventually installed the core into a new, more powerful droid body.\nSo given all their power, why were the Jedi unable to kill a simple droid? Star Wars: Revelations #1 revealed this tale of droid survival thanks to Marc Guggenheim, Salvador Larroca, Paul Fry, Emma Kubert, and Justin Mason. But proving it wasn't a one-off bit of luck, a villainous droid's miraculous survival against a lightsaber-wielding foe has happened before.In Star Wars: Darth Vader #1, Darth Vader engages the droid ZED-6-7 in battle, but fails to permanently destroy it - and the same exact situation plays out in Star Wars: Darth Vader #13 against the famous IG-88.\nA lightsaber can take an organic opponent out of the fight with a single stroke to a non-vital organ, but the same cannot be said for droids. The destruction of a droid's limb simply does not matter when it can be repaired in minutes (or after years, or centuries). Unless the core processor sustains a direct hit, the individual droid will continue to function, possessed of all its character traits and motivations. Making them harder to kill, as demonstrated in Revenge of the Sith against General Grievous' Magnaguards, who continued to fight even when headless and limbless. But when rising to a height of individual threat and menace, it means an immortality that will survive even a flawless, elegant Jedi weapon.\nSimply put, a lightsaber is too precise a weapon to efficiently cut down droids for good. Even if a Jedi or a Sith slices off all their limbs and stabs them multiple times in the center mass, the droid's \"brain\" can still be recovered and placed in a new body; the same cannot be said for a human opponent. This is why Ajax Sigma is a genuine threat against lightsaber-wielders: a single stroke isn't enough to defeat him (or his many followers).\nSince a droid's core processor can theoretically be located anywhere (the head, the body, or even miles away in another ship), Jedi and Sith must either waste their time cutting each robotic opponent to ribbons, or lose the lightsaber in exchange for a conventional blaster - devices that these Star Wars organizations, steeped in tradition, would rarely use on principle.\nNext: Star Wars Addresses Fan Concerns About Ruining Yoda's Backstory\nJoshua Isaak is a Comics Staff Writer for Screenrant and attended New York University.

{"title": "Loki Season 2 EP Shares New Insight Into Miss Minutes' Connection To He Who Remains", "date": "2023-10-05 18:41:26", "text": "Exclusive: Loki executive producer Kevin Wright discusses the connection between Miss Minutes and He Who Remains as well as her journey in season 2.\nLoki season 2 executive producer Kevin Wright discusses the relationship between Miss Minutes and He Who Remains. He Who Remains was revealed as the mastermind of the TVA in the first season's finale. He warned Loki and Sylvie that his death and the destruction of the TVA would lead to another multiverse war with his own variants as their enemies. However, Sylvie still decided to kill him, potentially plunging the multiverse into chaos, in order to give herself and everyone else the free will He Who Remains deprived them of.\nIn an exclusive interview with Screen Rant for Loki season 2, Wright discusses Miss Minutes and He Who Remains. He explains how many of the characters are searching for identities this season. He also teases how Miss Minutes dynamic with He Who Remains is unique in how he allowed her to evolve. Check out Wright's full quote below:\nKevin Wright: I think like all of our characters and their search for identity, but also that all of our characters being caught in a bit of a cyclical time loop, keep making the same mistakes. There's another interesting question about Miss Minutes that I think has been really fun to explore, which is the nature of ... She says this season something along the lines of He Who Remains gave her the ability to write her own programming, to create her own personality, to grow, to have wants, to have needs.\nI think that's exciting if that's true, knowing what we know about He Who Remains, he doesn't give a lot of people a lot of choices up until his death. And I'd be interested to see how much of her programming is her own, how much of this is just further path that He Who Remains maybe paved for all of our characters to walk down for some bigger reasoning.\nMiss Minutes has always been an intriguing character in Loki. She knows all and has a sweet southern drawl, but there seems to be a darker side as well. This could be exemplified by her connection to He Who Remains, who introduced himself to Loki and Sylvie as non-threatening but had done terrible things in the name of, according to him, protecting the \"sacred\" timeline. Stripping the universe of free will to keep the timeline on track and separate from the rest of the multiverse.\nRelated: He Who Remains Is Actually More Powerful Than Kang (In 1 Way)\nWith He Who Remains as her creator, it seems likely that Miss Minutes would be influenced by his mentality as well. However, if He Who Remains gave her the ability to alter and evolve her own programming, that is more free will than he seemed to have offered to anyone else. Miss Minutes foundation would still be the base programming that he gave her, which could be a way to keep his story alive in the second season of Loki even with He Who Remains dying in the first.\nThis could also set Miss Minutes up as a potential villain in the second season, especially if she wants to stay true to his mission. Miss Minutes likely wants to keep the \"sacred\" timeline as it is not allowing people to have free will, which could put her at odds with the people of the TVA, who were revealed to be variants plucked from timelines and brainwashed. Miss Minutes has always had a bit of a dark streak because of her connection to He Who Remains, but that could grow more insidious in the second season of Loki, especially after his death.\n"}

Nikki is a part of the several new faces making their way into the franchise with the milestone season. While Gino Palazzolo and Jasmine Pineda is the only returning couple for 90 Day Fiance season 10, 2023 has a total of six new couples in store for viewers. 90 Day Fiancé is the show where engaged couples have applied for or have received a K-1 visa, so they can bring their international partners to America and get married to them within a span of three months.\nEngaged couple Nikki and Justin have a shocking history together. According to a preview of the 90 Day Fiancé season 10 premiere, courtesy of ET, Nikki reveals she was engaged to Justin 17 years ago and what led to their first breakup.\nNikki tells a friend that Justin was being lazy, wasn’t helping her with the housework, and expected her to cook and clean for him. They got into a lot of heated arguments. During one such argument, Nikki told Justin, “I used to be a man.” It had been two years since Nikki and Justin started their relationship. “I traumatized him,” admitted Nikki.\nNikki was about 20 years old when she underwent her gender affirmation operation. She had tears in her eyes after the surgery and felt like she was reborn again. After the surgery, she started living in “stealth,” which meant that she didn’t tell people what sex she was assigned at birth. As a result, Nikki was in the closet. She never made any gay or trans friends; she only wanted to have female friends. This was all part of Nikki’s journey to find herself. Justin was “in shock” when Nikki blurted out that she's trans. Justin went back home and was “depressed for a very long time.”\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nThis was back in 2007. Nikki and Justin had met on a dating site in Moldova 17 years ago. Justin proposed to Nikki and had come to the United States on a K-1 visa. Clearly, they did not get married then, but Nikki and Justin took another chance when they both realized they were single almost two decades later. Nikki is in a much better place now. She thought it was a good idea for them to give their relationship a second chance. Three months after they first started speaking again, Nikki and Justin met in Mexico to connect “physically, mentally, emotionally.”\nJustin has proposed to Nikki again, and then she applied for the K-1 visa a second time. Justin wasn’t comfortable with Nikki’s gender identity the first time around. Nikki now knows what exactly she’s looking for in her future partner. But at this time, it's unclear if Justin will prove that he’s indeed mature enough to accept Nikki for who she is all these years later.\n90 Day Fiancé season 10 premieres October 8 at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.\nSource: ET/YouTube\n"}
{"title": "Spider-Man's MCU Future Can Finally Revive Black Panther's Original Villain Plan", "date": "2023-10-05 18:50:28", "text": "Kraven the Hunter was originally set to appear in Black Panther, but with his solo movie coming up, it's not too late for him to jump into the MCU.\nSpider-Man 4 is one of the MCU's most anticipated movies, and it could potentially bring Kraven the Hunter into its story after his initial planned debut did not happen. Spider-Man has had a complex history with the MCU due to Sony Pictures holding his film rights, but Sony and Marvel Studios's eventual deal to share the Web-Slinger has blown the doors off the Spider-Verse like never before for both studios. In Sony's case, it also is helping to expand the possibilities of their universe of Spider-Man villains, including its next new series, Kraven the Hunter.\nDespite Kraven being a long-time Spidey villain, Spider-Man will likely not appear in Kraven the Hunter, but that does not mean they will not eventually meet. With the multiverse heavily in play in the MCU and Sony's Marvel films, there are already multiple avenues for Kraven to finally embark on his hunt for the Wall-Crawler after the release of Kraven the Hunter. Here is how Kraven the Hunter was almost introduced in the MCU and how Spider-Man 4 could bring him into the fold.\nJust prior to the release of Black Panther in 2018, director Ryan Coogler revealed in an interview that Kraven the Hunter was originally set to appear in the film. It's not fully clear exactly what Kraven's role in Black Panther would have been, in terms of whether he would have been the main protagonist, a secondary villain teaming up with Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger, or simply appearing in a minor cameo. However, Kraven's backstory and animal-like powers make it easy to see how he could have potentially fit into Black Panther's story.\nRELATED: Kraven the Hunter Cast & Marvel Character Guide\nIn theory, Kraven might have been featured in a scene or two showing him hunting African wildlife and encroaching on Wakanda's territory. Given Wakanda's secretive nature in the film, it would make sense for Kraven to be expelled from the nation in such a scenario, and this could have potentially set up his subsequent meeting with Spider-Man. On the other hand, Kraven's eventual debut in Sony's universe of Marvel villains seems likely to serve him better as a character.\nAs a Spider-Man villain and member of the Sinister Six, Kraven is in good company already in Sony's Spider-Man universe with Tom Hardy's Venom, Jared Leto's Morbius, and Dakota Johnson's forthcoming Madam Web. With the Rhino (Alessandro Nivola) also to appear in Kraven the Hunter, Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Kraven is in a setting much more directly geared towards an eventual Spider-Man showdown than his Black Panther role likely would have been. While Spidey has yet to arrive in Sony's universe of Marvel villains, that status quo will surely not last forever.\nRELATED: Everything We Know About Sony's Kraven The Hunter Movie\nThe fact of the matter is that, in a universe headlined by Spider-Man villains, it is a virtual certainty that Spidey himself will eventually appear. Venom: Let There Be Carnage and Spider-Man: No Way Home's end credits scenes laid the groundwork for exactly that with Eddie Brock being transported to the MCU and seeing Tom Holland's Spider-Man on television, so that expectation has clearly been primed by Sony. The infinite doorways of the multiverse make it possible for anyone from Andrew Garfield's Peter #3 to Miles Morales of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse to be that very Web-Slinger, while Kraven the Hunter is undoubtedly as prepped as Venom to battle Spidey.\nWhile Kraven the Hunter is set within Sony's universe of Spider-Man villains, there is also the potential that he could cross over into the MCU and meet Tom Holland's Web-Head. Venom's aforementioned journey to the MCU - brief though it may have been - already shows the door is open for Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Kraven to do the same. With Peter Parker in a difficult situation with the world's memory of him erased in No Way Home's ending, one particular Spider-Man comic story could even be perfect for where he picks up next. Namely, Kraven's Last Hunt, which is already serving as the partial basis for the Kraven the Hunter film.\nIn Kraven's Last Hunt, Kraven seemingly kills Spider-Man and assumes his identity in New York City, with the surviving Peter returning to stop him. With Peter forgotten by the entire world, someone else taking on Spider-Man's identity would be much easier to pull off if they were to get Peter out of the way, even temporarily. If Kraven is teleported into the MCU after his own movie, Spider-Man 4 could also easily adapt Kraven's Last Hunt as its story, with Tom Holland's Spidey battling his most vicious enemy yet in a battle where the stakes are higher than ever for him.\nBrad Curran is a Features Writer and Interviewer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "“No One Wanted This”: iCarly Cancellation After Cliffhanger Ending Addressed By Freddie Actor", "date": "2023-10-05 18:59:04", "text": "Freddie Benson actor Nathan Kress addresses iCarly's unexpected cancellation, revealing his disappointment and the show's cliffhanger ending.\niCarly’s Nathan Kress reacts to the show’s cancellation after three seasons. As one of the most popular Nickelodeon shows during its six-season run from 2007 to 2012, iCarly received a Paramount+ revival in 2021. The revival allowed Kress to reprise his role as Freddie Benson, alongside co-stars Miranda Cosgrove (Carly Shay) and Jerry Trainor (Spencer Shay). However, it was announced that the iCarly revival would be cancelled after just three seasons.\nIn a tweet, Kress reacts to iCarly’s cancellation, taking the time to thank the show’s production team as well as the iCarly fans who made the show possible. The actor also mentioned that “no one wanted this to end on a cliffhanger.” Read his tweet below:\nKress elaborated that the iCarly team “had a lot of story left to tell.” While wishing that he and the team could have given audiences “the ending [they] deserved],” Kress ended his statement with some hope. He wrote: “Maybe somehow, someday, we'll find out how to story ends\" after iCarly season 3.\nKress expresses a similar sentiment that many iCarly fans are undoubtedly feeling in the wake of the show’s cancellation. As the Freddie actor alludes to, the show ends on a major cliffhanger when Carly and Spencer’s mom appears right before Carly and Freddie’s wedding despite being absent from the original series and revival up to that point. Additionally, audiences never saw a long-awaited wedding between Carly and Freddie.\nIn their cancellation announcement, Paramount+ attempted to paint a positive spin on the ending, mentioning that the show “delivered on what fans really wanted to see with Carly and Freddie finally getting together.” While the streaming platform did not state a reason for the show’s cancellation, it is possible that low ratings (though the numbers are unavailable on the streaming platform) played a factor. The WGA strikes may have also factored into the decision, as writers' room pauses halted shows across Hollywood.\nRelated: 10 Best Shows Like iCarly\niCarly’s cancellation is frustrating not only to viewers but to the cast as well. Although not every cast member returned to the show (the reboot was notably missing Jeanette McCurdy), those that did re-committed to the show after nearly a decade off the air. It is understandable that Kress would grieve for the loss of iCarly and still hope that he can finally finish Freddie’s story one day.\nSource: Nathan Kress/Twitter\n"}
{"title": "The Rick And Morty Movie: Confirmation Chances, Release Date Prediction & Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-05 19:00:32", "text": "A Rick and Morty movie has been discussed ever since the show first arrived in 2013, and over a decade later it may actually be happening.\nA Rick and Morty movie has been discussed almost since the shows debut back in 2013, both as a spinoff of the show and a live-action reimaging. While none of these ideas have reached the stage of development yet, there’s still be discussions about the possibility of a feature-length Rick and Morty adventure. With seven seasons behind it the show is entering a new era thanks to the departure of co-creator and voice actor Justin Roiland. Given that the future could see radical changes for Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith, there’s increased speculation that now could finally be the time for the Rick and Morty movie.\nThere have been several ideas for a Rick and Morty movie floated in the past by Dan Harmon, who created the show with Roiland but has been its main driving force for several years. The possibility of Rick and Morty getting a film adventure, be it on the big screen or as a double-length episode, hasn’t been ruled out by any of the Rick and Morty creative team, either. For the Rick and Morty movie it may be a case of not if it happens, but when, despite nothing official being confirmed yet.\nThe most recent news surrounding a possible Rick and Morty movie came on September 27, 2023. Dan Harmon gave an update on the Rick and Morty movie’s prospects. Surprisingly, Harmon revealed that conversations about a Rick and Morty movie were happening with studios prior to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes commenting earlier in the year. \nThe Rick and Morty co-creator revealed that a movie would be like a “super episode” akin to the likes of South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut. Now that the WGA strike has ended and SAG-AFTRA are expected to resolve their dispute with the AMPTP soon it’s possible that a Rick and Morty movie confirmation may actually arrive in the future after nearly a decade.\nThe Rick and Morty movie isn’t confirmed, although comments from Dan Harmon do indicate serious discussions have happened with studios behind the scenes. The prospects of a feature-length adventure for Rick, Morty, Beth, Summer, and Jerry has been discussed multiple times over the years, but seemingly not in any official capacity.\nThere’s no release date for the Rick and Morty movie yet, and until it’s picked up by a studio and enters development it’s impossible to predict one. However, it’s likely not a project that will arrive soon after being confirmed. Dan Harmon and the Rick and Morty team have famously never compromised the show’s quality by rushing to meet a release window. Given how important for the franchise a Rick and Morty movie would be, it’s a given they’d take their time ensuring it was the right story. A release date of 2027-2028 for the first Rick and Morty film isn’t at all unrealistic, and it could arrive even later.\nThe cast of the Rick and Morty movie would likely feature the same voice actors from the show. The Simpsons, Bob’s Burgers, South Park, and Futurama all kept the same cast for their feature length outings, and Rick and Morty is all but guaranteed to do the same. Comments from Harmon suggest that the movie would be like a “super episode” — what one would expect from Rick and Morty, but much more of it than the standard 20 minute-or-so-runtime allows.\nThis means the central cast of Sarah Chalke as Beth, Chris Parnell as Jerry, Spencer Grammer as Summer, and regular supporting voice actors like Kari Wahlgren, Phil Hendrie, and Cassie Steele would all be present. While they haven’t yet been revealed, the actors behind the re-casted Rick and Morty replacing Justin Roiland would also of course be part of the Rick and Morty movie cast.\nAnother option that has been floated is a live-action Rick and Morty movie. In this case the cast would be totally unknown, though there have been many suggestions for who could play Rick and Morty in live-action. Christopher Lloyd remains perhaps the most popular choice, and even appeared as Rick in a series of live-action shorts. \nThere are no hints as to what the story of the Rick and Morty movie would be. It’s likely Dan Harmon hasn’t fully concocted an idea yet, although he’s doubtless got several potential ones in mind. One possibility is that a feature-length Rick and Morty adventure could be a vehicle for resolving the meta-narrative of the show involving Rick Prime, Evil Morty, or maybe even Doofus Jerry from the Rick and Morty comic books. Until the movie is officially confirmed, however, it’s unclear what the plot could entail — and with a show like Rick and Morty the possibilities are limitless.\n"}
{"title": "'Thor-Knowledge': Thor's New Power Would Completely Change His Role in The MCU", "date": "2023-10-05 19:00:32", "text": "Thor has unlocked a new power in Marvel Comics, giving him abilities that would've drastically changed his movie journey through the MCU.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Immortal Thor #2 Thor wields a power few other characters in the Marvel Universe can even understand, let alone match, and his all-new abilities only reinforces that assertion, as Thor debuts powers that would have assuredly redefined his MCU journey.\nThor Odinson is currently the All-Father and the King of Asgard in Marvel Comics continuity, though he’s made it clear on many occasions that he considers Midgard - or, Earth - to be just as much a home to him as Asgard, with Thor's Avengers membership being a key reason as to why. The same is true for Thor in the MCU. Though with every effort to defend the Earth in the films, Thor always creates an impressive amount of damage. From the destruction caused during the Battle of New York in The Avengers to the decimation of Sokovia in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor has regularly been at the center of chaos in the MCU. However, with this new ability that was just introduced in Immortal Thor, Thor could have fixed all that damage in a flash (and eliminated any of his enemies even faster) by tapping into a power known as his ‘Thor-Knowledge’.\nIn Immortal Thor #2 by Al Ewing and Martín Cóccolo, Thor is in New York City facing-off against an elder god who exists outside the Ten Realms, one of immense power and fury: Toranos. It was clear since the battle began that Thor was no match for Toranos, even with the Odin-Power. However, after Thor recognized that he, not Odin, was in control of the abilities he now wields, the power and knowledge passed down by Odin were now wholly his own. Therefore, what was once the power of Odin became officially recognized as the power of Thor, and what was once the Odin-Knowledge was now Thor-Knowledge. With this reframing of his mind and realignment of his cosmic energies, Thor was able to use the Thor-Knowledge to its fullest extent. Thor tore a hole in the fabric of reality, and threw Toranus through it to the edge of known existence. Then, he used this power to repair the damage that was done to New York City in an instant, with his only shortcoming being his inability to reverse the deaths of those who perished.\nThis ability would have been perfect for dealing with the Chitauri in The Avengers, or Ultron in Age of Ultron, or even Thanos in Infinity War (indeed, Thor faced Thanos before any other Avenger in that film). Not only would Thor have been able to launch these villains to the other side of the universe instantaneously, but he’d also be able to clean up any and all damage caused by the villains immediately after they were gone. Toranos is one of the most powerful entities Thor has ever faced, as he was an elder god who claimed the title of God of Thunder when the first lightning bolt cracked across the sky, long before Thor was even born. Yet even still, Toranos wasn’t strong enough to withstand Thor when he utilized the Thor-Knowledge, meaning every villain Thor faced in the MCU would have easily crumbled before his newfound might.\nIf the God of Thunder had access to the Thor-Knowledge in the MCU, then his entire journey would have been altered, as every villain he faced would have been vanquished incredibly quickly. Or, if he wasn’t strong enough to consistently banish bad guys across the universe, then he’d at least be able to repair any damage that was done during any given battle, which alone might have been enough to prevent the Avengers splitting up in Captain America: Civil War. Any way one looks at it, it’s clear that the new powers Thor just debuted would have definitely come in handy in the MCU.\nImmortal Thor #2 by Marvel Comics is available now.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "10 Best Godlike Anime Healers", "date": "2023-10-05 19:00:32", "text": "Though they are often underappreciated, healers play the important role of allowing wounded anime heroes to recover from even the gravest injuries.\nAnime healers are rarely the center of attention, with all the glory usually going to heroes and warriors who boast impressive offensive capabilities, defeating their foes in a flashy manner and taking the spotlight for themselves. However, were it not for supporting characters who keep them afloat, these fighters may not even live to achieve the triumphs that make them popular.\nDepending on the setting and world, the power source and method of healers can vary greatly, from elite doctors who can treat even the rarest of conditions, to those who use magic to perform miraculous feats such as undoing the effects of death itself. But only the ones who can make a significant difference in their world can count themselves among the most remarkable, godlike healers.\nWhile Bleach's cast includes multiple accomplished healers, such as Retsu Unohana, no one is quite on the same level as Orihime Inoue. Thanks to her naturally high spiritual power, she is talented in detecting and controlling spiritual energy. Her spirit energy is harbored in the six-petal flower-shaped hairpins she received from her brother, where six different spirits lie. Using her spirits, Orihime can cast incredible techniques such as Sōten Kisshun, which doesn't technically \"heal\", but rather allows her to deny and undo certain events, even going as far as to restore missing limbs and resurrect people. Nothing says \"godlike\" like bringing back people from the dead.\nAs the Armed Detective Agency's personal physician, Akiko Yosano is a true expert in her field, possessing rich knowledge in terms of human anatomy and physiology. As Bungo Stray Dogs revolves around special abilities though, it's her rare ability that allows her to differentiate herself from other physicians. Using \"Thou Shalt Not Die\", Akiko can instantly heal any and all external wounds, both in and outside of combat, provided the target is nearly dead. The condition may seem limiting, but she has no qualms about injuring others to bring them closer to the necessary stage of being barely alive. Unfortunately, this ability has no effect on internal injuries and illnesses.\nAs Konohagakure's Fifth Hokage, Naruto's Tsunade is not only one of the world's strongest kunoichi, but also a legendary medical-nin, or ninja specialized in healing techniques. Her abilities as a medical-nin are truly unrivaled, as she has been noted to instantly identify any illness, and also easily treat conditions that most would consider impossible to recover from. She can heal anything from physical to psychological damage, and even solve cases of severe chakra depletion. Tsunade's strongest technique is her Creation Rebirth, which instantly heals any wounds, making her nearly immortal, but it comes at the cost of shortening her lifespan, which is why she only uses it as a last resort.\nRelated: A Forgotten Boruto Mystery Could Make A Comeback In Two Blue Vortex\nJoJo's Bizarre Adventure is all about iconic Stand abilities, which vary significantly in terms of both form and power. Diamond is Unbreakable's main protagonist, Josuke Higashikata, wields the Stand known as Crazy Diamond, which doesn't strictly heal, but rather restores objects and organisms to a previous state. This way, Josuke can not only repair anything but also heal virtually any injury, as long as it's not lethal. Thanks to his intelligence and mastery over his Stand, he always finds ways to use this ability creatively, adapting to any situation and making use of his environment. The only downside is that he cannot heal himself, which would require him to be more cautious, but that's not in Josuke's personality at all, so he will rush into any dangerous situation without regrets.\nWhile music is not uncommon in the anime world, thanks to the popularity of idol anime series, there is nothing quite like Healer Girl, wherein the musical moments are more akin to stage plays or Disney scenes. Its story takes place in a world wherein music is a valid, scientifically proven form of healing, and Ria Karasuma is at the top of the voice medicine world. Not only is she a renowned healer who runs her own clinic and teaches apprentice girls who hope to become like her, but she also conducts research on music healing, actively working towards advancing the field.\nHunter x Hunter's Alluka Zoldyck is not only a great example of trans representation, but also one of the anime world's most powerful characters. Truthfully though, despite being born into a family of infamous deadly assassins, Alluka has no exceptional strengths, either physical or Nen-related. Instead, the source of her power is Nanika, a mysterious creature from the Dark Continent who possessed her body. Nanika can grant any wishes, presumably to an infinite extent, after three of Alluka's requests are fulfilled. In terms of healing, a notable example would be when she healed Gon, whose body was in a critical state, almost dying as a result of a Nen contract.\nFairy Tail's Wendy Marvell uses Sky Dragon Slayer Magic, whose potential is multifaceted. Not only does it allow her to cast surprisingly powerful offensive and versatile support spells, but it also makes her a fantastic healer, able to cure even the gravest of injuries. Prior to her using this magic, it was believed to be long-lost, which indicates just how rare and significant it is. As one would expect, she can heal various wounds and negate the effects of potent poison, but that's not the full extent of her power, as she has even been noted to revive people who were in a near-death state.\nAs the Straw Hat Pirates' resident doctor, Tony Tony Chopper's medical skills aren't owed to one of One Piece's many Devil Fruits, but rather to his adoptive parental figures, Hiriluk and Kureha, two doctors who took care of him and taught him everything they knew about medicine. After learning the foundations of the field, he further increased his knowledge in the Torino Kingdom, where he studied books on drugs and herbs that the rest of the world was unfamiliar with. He has continued to learn and evolve as a doctor ever since, proving himself through extraordinary feats such as quickly developing new cures and treating brutal injuries.\nParallel World Pharmacy follows a world-class medical researcher who overworked himself to death and was reincarnated as Falma de Médicis, the heir of an esteemed family of pharmacologists, in an alternate, less developed world. Combining the knowledge from his previous life with the unique powers he obtained thanks to a deity's divine blessing, Falma can perform miraculous feats such as creating and destroying any substance whose molecular structure he's familiar with. Additionally, he also has divine sight, which lets him identify the medical issues of any person he's looking at. Lastly, unlike other people in his world, there seems to be no limit to his magic powers, making his potential unrivaled.\nWhile Elizabeth Liones may not be one of the titular sins, she is still one of The Seven Deadly Sins' most likable characters, as well as a surprisingly powerful one. As the current queen of the Kingdom of Liones and the current incarnation of the Goddess Elizabeth, she possesses immense light-based powers, being able to heal everyone in the kingdom at once in an instant. After learning to control her abilities, she proves herself to be incredibly talented, even more skillful than the best druids, easily healing multiple people who suffered lethal damage, as well as dispelling powerful curses placed by the Demon King's magic.\nWhile these characters may not be the most memorable of their series, as viewers tend to instead admire the ones defined by their seemingly endless strength, they may very well be the ones who played the most important role. Thanks to their healing powers, they allowed others to shine, often without expecting anything in turn. Some are even powerful enough to resurrect those who underestimated the threats they were facing, allowing fan-favorite characters to keep driving the action. Truly, anime healers deserve far more recognition than they usually receive.\nRemus Badescu is a writer for ScreenRant's anime section.

Created by Vince Gilligan, the acclaimed crime drama first aired in 2008, chronicling the journey of Bryan Cranston's Walter White from mild-mannered chemistry teacher to the biggest drug kingpin in New Mexico. Aaron Paul costars in the show as Jesse, Walt's former student and eventual business partner, with the two have a major falling out in Breaking Bad season 5, the show's last.\nNow, in a recent interview with SlashFilm, Schnauz and Mastras reveal that there was originally a very different direction planned for Jesse's character arc in Breaking Bad season 5. What ultimately changed things, however, was the decision to have Jesse Plemons' Todd kill Drew Sharp in \"Dead Freight\" the show's train heist episode. Check out Schnauz and Mastras full comments about the change below:\nSchnauz: \"We had all these ideas of Walt's going to retire, and Jesse's going to be the big meth guy in Albuquerque. And once the kid got shot, that all got wiped off the table. \n“When we write, we flowchart a lot. And we say, 'What if this happened? What if that happens?' And one of the logical things is that Jesse is in the meth business and he's proud of what he does and he's good at it, and they're making the big bucks. And so the logical thing would be that Jesse would continue and Walt would get too sick to continue or pull away and let Jesse take over the operation.\n\"Walt, [unlike Jesse], can compartmentalize. They've done so many terrible things [...] So many things that he's pressed down that he tries to convince Jesse that yes, it was a horrible, terrible thing, but be strong and move on, and come with me on the successful journey that we're on because Mike's leaving so Walt doesn't want to be on his own.\"\nMastras: \"[Drew Sharp's death] really turned into the catalyst for the end really, spinning, turning Jesse against Walt. And that gave us that tool, I think unknowingly at the time, to really have that be the central conflict between the two characters that led to the overall ending.\"\nJesse, with Walt, is one of the most important characters in Breaking Bad, playing a central role in Walt's rise to power and subsequent fall. The two characters don't see eye to eye on most things, but they also need each other, with Walt memorably saying in season 1, \"You know the business, and I know the chemistry.\" While Walt's arc is what the show is essentially built around, Jesse's is just as crucial.\nWhere Walt is ambitious, driven, and ruthless to a fault, Jesse is, for parts of the show at least, basically the opposite. Jesse is, ostensibly, a loser, but he's also the heart of the series. Audiences care about Jesse because he's more empathetic, because he falls in love and cares about people, and because the horrible things he witnesses and participates in gnaw at his soul.\nThe decision to lean into this aspect of the character in Breaking Bad season 5 was for the best, as it speaks to Jesse's humanity. Jesse can't bear what happened to Drew, but Drew's death is really the last straw in a series of crushing deaths, betrayals, and hardships. While Breaking Bad's final season may still have worked if Jesse followed in Walt's footsteps and became a drug kingpin himself, exploring the softer and more human side of the character ultimately resulted in a powerful, cathartic, and more emotional ending.\nSource: SlashFilm\n"}

The 48-year-old Pennsylvania native recently completed his journey in Before the 90 Days season 6. On the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off, he dated Vietnamese single mom Violet Tuyet, hoping to marry her. Unfortunately, things didn’t work out between the two, leading to their split. Riley and Violet had no romantic chemistry at all. But at the Tell-All, Violet accused Riley of getting her pregnant. However, Riley surprised her by revealing he wasn’t fertile.\nWhile Riley’s connection with Violet didn’t go as intended, his new friendship with Kimberly may become fruitful. Recently, viewers spotted Riley getting flirty with Usman “Sojaboy” Umar’s ex. The duo interacted on a live video call on Instagram and planned to meet up. 90 Day Fiancé fan account 90 Day The Melanated Way posted the proof of Riley and Kimberly’s interaction and shared the gossip.\nThe fan account wrote, “Riley is heading down to visit Kimberly in SD later this month and let’s just say ‘date night’ is planned.” The admin of the fan account added fire to the rumors by stating that Riley’s dad already refers to Kimberly as his “daughter-in-law.”\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nAs expected, many 90 Day Fiance viewers took to the comments section to express their surprise and excitement about the news as they thought Riley and Kimberly made sense. Even co-stars such as Sumit Singh and Jenny Slatten were shocked about the sudden turn of events. Kimberly’s son Jamal Menzies also fueled the fire by stating he’ll “stop by” during the date. Unfortunately, the duo in question shut down the romance rumors by addressing their relationship. Kimberly commented, “No no no no. We are friends ONLY. D*** we can’t be friends?” Riley jumped into the conversation and told the 90 Day Fiancé fan account, “You never cease to amaze me lol.”\nFans aren’t wrong to get excited about Kimberly and Riley’s potential relationship. Both cast members were in bad relationships and would suit each other well. Kimberly dated Usman, who seemed to only care about making his name and didn’t respect her. Riley dated Violet, who called him “ugly” and didn’t care for his romantic gestures. Kimberly and Riley had similar heartbreaks, which would help them relate to each other. They are also both Americans and won’t have a cultural difference. Kimberly and Riley could be well-suited for 90 Day: The Single Life season 4.\nRiley seems like a much better fit for Kimberly as well. Usman cared for the San Diego woman but didn’t respect her enough. He made comments about her looks and didn’t love her sufficiently. In comparison, Riley cared for Violet and bought her many gifts. He wanted to make the relationship work and didn’t worry about her past for the longest time. Riley is a much better potential partner for Kimberly because the two don’t have a significant age gap or cultural differences. Unlike Kimberly’s last boyfriend, the new 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star also doesn’t want a child.\nSource: 90 Day The Melanated Way/Instagram\n"}

Tumi finally made it to the yacht Mustique in Italy after having visa issues in customs. She and Kyle were both stuck there and had to sit out the first charter. When Tumi met Natalya for the first time, it was clear there was some tension, and Natalya believed it had to do with Kyle.\nReddit user emergencyelk95, took a screengrab from Bravo's Below Deck Instagram account. In the screengrab, Natalya's going off in the comment section about Tumi and Kyle. Natalya's first comment was, \"My biggest pet peeve is when someone lets a certain person influence their opinion on someone before even meeting them.\" Natalya is clearly talking about Tumi and how Kyle likely said some not-so-nice things about her after their charter season together on Below Deck Med season 7.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nIn her next comment, she wrote, \"My other pet peeve would be ungrateful people who can’t even say thank you for holding do the fort for 4 days, while being crew down, while setting up a boat, while running on no sleep.\" ﻿During the most recent Below Deck Med season 8 episode, Tumi revealed in one of her confessionals that Kyle had warned her about Natalya. He told her how he and Natalya had their ups and downs last season, so Tumi was simply trying to make Natalya know that she was the boss. However, Natalya didn't appreciate how Tumi didn't give her the props for holding down the fort while she was gone.\nKyle clearly gave Tumi the rundown from last season and poisoned the relationship between Tumi and Natalya before it could even begin. It was clear when Natalya was showing Tumi the boat that Tumi had preconceived notions of Natalya. While Kyle and Natalya seemingly left the boat on good terms, it seems Kyle still had some issues with Natalya, some of which were shown in the Below Deck Med season 8 trailer.\nJudging by the trailer, the interior crew is going to have some issues going forward. Even though Kyle still had some underlying issues with Natalya, he should have let Tumi have an opinion of her on her own. Kyle giving Tumi the rundown on Natalya before the start of the season could potentially ruin their season.\nBelow Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.\nSources: emergencyelk95/Reddit, Below Deck/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "Who The “Reptile” Is In Netflix’s 2023 Movie – Title Explained", "date": "2023-10-05 19:10:27", "text": "Reptile is an intriguing name for the new thriller starring Benicio Del Toro. Here's who the \"reptile\" in Netflix's 2023 movie really is. \nWarning: This article contains spoilers for Reptile!\nWith so many mercurial characters and ambiguous situations in Netflix's 2023 film Reptile, the meaning behind the title points to the heart of the mystery Detective Nichols (Benicio Del Toro) is trying to solve. Nichols has transferred police departments and operates in the small community of Scarborough under the avuncular eye of Captain Allen, his wife's uncle. When a young real estate agent named Summer is killed, several suspects emerge from the darkness that enshrouds her idyllic life; Sam, an ex-husband, Will Grady (Justin Timberlake) a new boyfriend and fellow realtor born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and Eli Phillips, a neighbor with a personal vendetta.\nAs the investigation into Summer's death goes deeper, Nichols discovers that what he thinks he knows about all the characters in Reptile isn't what it appears to be. Shifting allegiances, ulterior motives, and all the hallmarks of a first-rate thriller and film-noir are on display, and at the heart of it stands a detective trying to make sense of it while keeping his integrity intact. By the end of Reptile, the explosive finale drives home why the dissonant title has so much bearing on the plot, and why the natural stages of a reptile's life cycle fits the way that the characters operate within it.\nReptile's title points to the titular entity's \"shedding of skin,\" which can be seen as a metaphor for the way the characters reveal themselves to be corrupt after previously presenting as benign. The director explained to Netflix; \"In the movie, characters are introduced as one thing and revealed to be something else,” Singer continues. “There’s a shedding of skin that occurs, and it felt like an appropriate metaphor for the film. Some of the most unethical people in the film can be very likable in moments.” Not only is this true of Nichols' boss Captain Allen, or Will Grady, Summer's grieving boyfriend with a sinister side, but of Nichols himself.\nAs Nichols' investigation peels away the layers of different characters' facades, and likable people in his life emerge as literal snakes in the grass, Nichols also goes through a shedding of skin, but for the languorous detective, the process works in reverse. He's trying to get rid of a reputation for taking bribes and keeping contraband that he acquired at his previous department, so while other characters become more corrupt, Nichols' true nature emerges as more altruistic. By the end of the film, he cannot in good conscience allow the illegal actions of those closest to him, and even his superiors, to continue.\nUnfortunately for Nichols, the final shedding of skin occurs in his own department, where even his closest friends are caught up in a scheme involving Grady's shell real estate company White Fish. When Nichols finds out that certain officers have been placing contraband in houses, seizing them, and then allowing White Fish to buy them for dirt cheap to flip at incredible profits, he has to confront the people he trusts the most, including the chief of police. It's only after Nichols has made it clear he won't be part of their plan that his transformation is complete, and he can honestly say to himself that he's a good cop.\nReptile explores themes of transformation, perspective, and survival in the natural world. Whereas some characters seem destined to remain the same and make the same mistakes, some can surmount fate and oppose what seems like an inevitable degradation of the human spirit. It's natural for snakes and reptiles to shed their skin as they outgrow it, and Reptile explores how that can be both the sign of a new beginning and a further indictment of character depending on perspective, and with Nichols providing the film's point of view, he presents a realistic arbiter the audience can relate to.\nSource: Netflix\n"}
{"title": "Terminator Already Confirmed Its Grossest Fan Theory Is 100% Correct", "date": "2023-10-05 19:11:19", "text": "Terminator's time travel has hard set rules, with a gross fan theory about how technology can be brought to the past already confirmed in comics!\nThe Terminator franchise has been around for decades, with fan interest keeping the series going despite its up-and-down quality in the movie space. But leave it up to comic books to give fans what they want because, in a Terminator issue from the early '90s, one of the grossest fan theories out there has already been confirmed to be true.\nThe Terminator: One Shot by James Robinson and Matt Wagner was released the same year as Terminator 2: Judgment Day and focuses on another “wrong Sarah Connor” that Skynet has targeted for destruction. Hunted down by a T-800 Terminatrix, Sarah is protected by a future Resistance member named Ellis Ruggles (who has been kicking around since 1955).\nEllis saves Sarah by using a large “Electro-Mech Fazer” against the Terminatrix, revealed later to have been built by hiding pieces of it in his body during his time travel trip.\nRelated: The First Terminator Had 1 Weapon That Could Destroy Arnie's T-800\nThe franchise's time travel is unable to send anything synthetic through time without a layer of organic material wrapped around it to help make the transition (the reason Terminators look like fleshy humans when sent on missions and arrive naked). Because of this, both the Terminators and the rebels sent back to stop them usually have to fend for themselves for clothing and weapons when they arrive at their temporal destination, leading fans to speculate that John Connors’ agents should be able to bring back advanced technology inside their bodies to help mitigate this disadvantage - something this comic issue directly addresses.\nObviously an uncomfortable choice, since rebels would have to either surgically implant pieces of weapons into their bodies or use more of a discomfiting approach to smuggling everything, this tactic nevertheless gives humans a major advantage in stopping the machines by giving them access to technology that won’t exist for decades. Furthermore, sending more than one person through time, each stocked up internally with contraband, would allow John Connor to essentially build whatever he wanted in the past to help his future self. It's a gross tactic, but one worth exploring if it can help save all of humanity.\nEssentially evening the odds between a human-sized flesh-covered weapon and an actual human with \"hidden\" weapons, this fan theory, though never technically seen in the films, is proven in this issue to work as something that the Resistance forces need to utilize more often.\nJohn Connor’s struggle to save humanity seems to be a never-ending one, so if he could find a way to send even more internally weaponized rebels to fight past Terminators, there at least will always be a fighting chance to take down these evil machines once and for all!\nBrian is first and foremost a nerd in every way shape and form. He likes to compare himself to a black hole, consuming any and every form of entertainment unlucky enough to get caught in his gravitational pull.

{"title": "MCU Phase 5's Avengers Replacements Prove Marvel Fixed A Long-Standing Phase 2 Critique", "date": "2023-10-05 19:20:27", "text": "The MCU's origin story formula has become repetitive, but the Multiverse Saga's new characters prove that Marvel is working to subvert expectations.\nWith the Marvel Cinematic Universe moving into a new era with the Multiverse Saga, the franchise’s latest new characters prove that the studio has acknowledged early criticism. Every iconic character that has debuted in the MCU timeline comes with their own origin story, and the formula for these origin stories has been relatively straightforward since the MCU Phase 1. A character will be introduced as an underdog of sorts, with their first film usually showing them getting used to their unique powers while sometimes teasing another MCU character alongside them.\nWhile it is the classic superhero origin story, the repetitiveness of it started to wear on audiences as the MCU progressed. By the time of films like Ant-Man and Doctor Strange, the origin story formula had already been done with numerous heroes beforehand. Most of the origins followed the same story beats and even included the same kind of villain that mirrored the hero. The end of the Infinity Saga was the perfect time for the studio to act on the criticism, and the Multiverse Saga’s new characters have already proven that the Phase 5 and 6 movies will start branching out from the origin story formula.\nThe Multiverse Saga has most notably seen the introduction of several younger heroes to the MCU. These younger heroes have often debuted alongside more established MCU characters, and their ties to their mentors contribute to part of their origin story. Yelena Belova and America Chavez were only supporting characters in their respective films, but their origin stories were effectively fleshed out without needing a solo film. Even characters who debuted in a Disney+ series, like Kate Bishop, have shown off the MCU’s new take on origin stories in a more condensed setting.\nRelated: Marvel’s MCU Young Avengers Cast (As We Know It)\nKamala Khan’s origin story can be considered the most akin to the standard formula since she has a solo series that explores her powers. However, Ms. Marvel still manages to subvert from the Phase 1 origin story tradition by not having her save the world from some big bad or uprooting her whole life because of her newfound hero identity. Phase 5 and 6’s new take on character introductions suggest that the MCU has developed enough that they don’t need to stick to a traditional trend or formula and that the studio can take more liberties with origin stories with so much lore already developed.\nThe MCU’s Phase 1 origin story formula may have been the most effective way to translate a comic story to the big screen at the time, but the franchise has evolved past that. There is such a huge range of origin stories in the comics that the MCU subverting from tradition will be the best way to mirror its unique source material. With over 30 films in the MCU already, the superhero origin stories were starting to get too predictable. Marvel changing things up will help keep the franchise feeling fresh and creative going into a new era of the Phase 6 projects.\nPhases 1 and 2 of the MCU are undoubtedly iconic, but the standard storytelling format introduced in these phases could only work for so long. Going into the Multiverse Saga, Marvel had to do something to address the criticism of their redundant origin story formula. Whether it be alongside their mentor or in the grounded setting of teenage life, Phase 5 has already introduced new characters in ways that differ from before. With a shift in focus towards younger heroes and Disney+ being a whole new platform for the MCU to play with, Phase 6 should only continue to subvert expectations.\n"}
{"title": "Gen V Drops An Explosive Track By Christopher Lennertz & Matt Bowen [EXCLUSIVE]", "date": "2023-10-05 19:22:19", "text": "Exclusive: Screen Rant offers a first listen to “Flashpoint” from the upcoming Gen V soundtrack album by Christopher Lennertz & Matt Bowen.\nGen V proves that there is plenty of room for expansion in the world of The Boys. The spinoff series has managed to capture the violence, humor, and social commentary The Boys is known for, even as it introduces a slew of new Supes for whom powers may be as much of a curse as they are a blessing. Though Gen V boasts an exciting new cast led by Chilling Adventures of Sabrina alums Jaz Sinclair as Marie Moreau and Chance Perdomo as Andre Anderson, it was created by Eric Kripke, Craig Rosenberg, and Evan Goldberg, who all helped bring The Boys to life.\nAlso jumping from The Boys to Gen V are composers Christopher Lennertz and Matt Bowen. The pair have written music for The Boys since season 1, and Matt Bowen has spoken with Screen Rant about how they approached scoring that series. Now, Screen Rant is excited to share a piece of music Bowen and Lennertz have composed for Gen V. Check out “Flashpoint” below:\nAs can be heard above, “Flashpoint” is an exciting track full of dramatic twists and turns. It’s clear Bowen and Lennertz have taken plenty of inspiration from their work on The Boys, using many of the same techniques in Gen V. Still, with Gen V’s main characters bringing something new to the world, Lennertz and Bowen have incorporated new elements into their music as well. Both composers touched on their difference in approach to Gen V and their excitement in scoring the series:\nMatt Bowen: The writers and actors did such a great job setting this up as a spinoff. Chris and I just followed their lead when looking for our own inspiration. The music is still rooted in the world of The Boys, but it has fresh flavors and themes just like the show has fresh characters and storylines.\nChristopher Lennertz: From the beginning, the idea of expanding the sonic world of The Boys for a new group of Supes and a whole new setting and set of powers was an exciting opportunity. We had a chance to take all the violent dissonance and warped chaos of our Vought universe, but filter it through a new lens: the excitement of students at the very beginning of their journeys, as heroes in training. We hope that we created a sound that feels familiar, yet even more eclectic and powerful.\nWith so much crossover potential between The Boys and Gen V, it makes sense Lennertz and Bowen would keep the musical identity of each show relatively similar. With the story of Gen V so tied to the events of The Boys, a meeting of characters from both shows feels inevitable. If and when that does happen, the inclusion of new instruments to the spinoff’s musical palette, such as 808 drums and featured vocalists, will make for a fun blending of The Boys’ themes with those from Gen V.\nNew episodes of Gen V release on Fridays on Prime Video. The Gen V (Prime Original Series Soundtrack) will be released on digital platforms on October 6th.\n"}
{"title": "1 Evil Dead Rise Line Finally Explains Why Deadites Are So Unpredictable", "date": "2023-10-05 19:30:32", "text": "The vicious and lethal Deadites of the Evil Dead franchise could probably kill their victims immediately, but instead they torment and disturb.\nAfter several movies displayed just how unpredictable the vicious Deadites can be when torturing their victims, one Evil Dead Rise line finally revealed what their motivation is. With few exceptions, the living victims of Deadites eventually die in gruesome fashion, and it's fairly clear that they have the ability to kill their victims whenever they want. But the defining characteristic of a Deadite possession is not the eventual outcome, it's the insane behavior of the possessed individuals while under the influence of the Deadites.\nAs the Evil Dead franchise has evolved, the Deadite behavior has ranged from almost silly to extremely disturbing, but the common thread is their completely unpredictable nature. There is no textbook Deadite possession, and each instance reveals new and twisted ways that the Deadites can morph flesh, spread their infection and torment the people closest to the victim. The true intention of the Deadites' behavior was finally revealed in Evil Dead Rise, and it explains all the madness sown by the Deadites throughout history.\nThe recordings of the priest found with the Naturom Demonto in the vault at the outset of Evil Dead Rise revealed the true intention of the Deadites chaos. As the priest, voiced by Evil Dead franchise star Bruce Campbell, describes, a Deadite \"takes its pleasure in creating terror through total chaos.\" The aim of the parasitic demons is not to kill their victims - it is to enjoy the fear created by their unpredictable behavior.\nThis explains most of the actions of the Deadites, and why they even go so far as to possess already-dead individuals. Rotting their victims from the inside out, appearing uninfected to deceive others, and the group-merging seen at the climax of Evil Dead Rise are all tricks that Deadites use to sow fear and chaos in whatever environment they happen to invade. The deceptions they use and the confusion they create also make it far easier for them to infect others, as observed when the Ellie Deadite appears to return to her uninfected state to trick her youngest daughter into opening the apartment door.\nRelated: Evil Dead: How Deadite Possession Really Works\nThe Deadites' desire for chaos explains why their possessed victims are so different in their appearance and abilities. While they are sometimes played almost as jokes (as was the case with Cougie the half-human, half-mascot Deadite in season 3 of Ash vs. Evil Dead) the various versions of the Deadites are totally unpredictable in their actions, making them that much harder to defeat. The Deadites find new ways to terrify with every interaction, resulting in some truly bizarre creatures.\nOne of the best examples occurs in Evil Dead Rise itself. The Ellie, Danny, and Bridget Deadites literally melt their bodies together to create a monstrous entity known as The Marauder, which is unlike anything ever seen in the Evil Dead movies or TV show. That merging makes very little sense - as three separate people, the Deadites would likely have an easier time pursuing and infecting Beth and Kassie. However, as The Marauder, they create something far scarier and more disturbing, which elevates the fear and chaos they crave.\n"}

Although the franchise has had its ups and downs, it's continued to push boundaries, taking players into increasingly enveloping and engaging scenarios.\nRecent entries have taken players further into the past than ever before, and while opinions differ on its recent direction, the series has never strayed too long from providing fun and engaging titles. Assassin's Creed has never shied away from exploring new ideas and epochs, constantly evolving along with the industry and always offering something new that keeps critics satisfied and audiences in anticipation. Although the upcoming live-service hub Assassin's Creed Infinity presents worries for some series fans regarding the future direction of the franchise, no matter where the franchise heads in the future, it will have a strong legacy behind it.\nRelated: How To Play Every Assassin's Creed Game In Chronological Order\nWith awkward controls on the Nintendo DS and more emphasis on stealth that makes it feel more akin to Prince Of Persia than Assassin's Creed, Altaïr's Chronicles was a poor first attempt at a handheld that landed a measly 58 on Metacritic. While it is impressive that Ubisoft was able to put an open world into a DS cartridge, it is clearly a rushed product.\nThe biggest issue it faced with players was its length; it can be beaten completely in four to five hours. Even for an early Assassin's Creed, that is way too short. Sadly, it also suffered from a flaw that the very first Assassin's Creed had: the overrated protagonist Altaïr is not that interesting of a character.\nThe spin-off series of Assassin's Creed was never beloved, but Chronicles did provide a unique 2.5D side-scrolling experience. However, fans were displeased with the copy-paste style of many Assassin's Creed subseries entries.\nThe highlight of Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia came in the form of its 1918 Russian setting, an era more technologically advanced than the franchise has ever explored. The World War I setting was refreshing and the main character was interesting, but with a 61 on Metacritic, it still amounted to little more than an average clone of the first Chronicles game.\nRelated: Every Assassin's Creed Setting So Far (Spin-offs Included)\nAltair made his return to the series with Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines on the PlayStation Portable, one of only a few AC games made for handheld consoles. The gameplay was a step backward for the series - particularly since Assassin's Creed 2 had recently released as a superior sequel to the original game and set a new standard for the franchise. While it was praised for giving Altaïr a proper return in a better story than Altaïr's Chronicles, it only achieved a 63 on Metacritic.\nDespite the impressively large map for a handheld title, the comparably unpolished and choppy gameplay made Bloodlines an unappealing alternative to the console games. A lot of this was due to the limitations of the PSP, a common problem with the system's games.\nContinuing from the first Chronicles, Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India continues to explore more exotic settings, this time showcasing the beauty of India. Many praised the visuals of India, but, like Chronicles: Russia, the sequel just does not do anything to innovate the spin-off series.\nDespite its lack of innovation, those who enjoyed the inaugural Chronicles game will likely enjoy its follow-up despite its mediocre 64 on Metacritic. Although it may not be an Assassin's Creed spinoff worth playing for everyone, fans interested in a more challenging experience can find one in Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed & Other Games That Are Wonderful History Lessons\nEzio Auditore da Firenze finally got his chance to shine in a handheld title with Assassin's Creed 2: Discovery. As such, the game received praise for continuing the legacy of one of the most beloved main characters of the whole franchise and managing to improve upon the formula.\nUnfortunately, Discovery doesn't quite manage to be anything beyond solid, showcased by the 69 it received on Metacritic. Like Altaïr's Chronicles, the game is far too short and largely comes across as a watered-down clone of Prince Of Persia, albeit with a decent story that takes place after the events of Assassin's Creed 2's DLC.\nThe first of the Chronicles spin-offs is definitely the best, taking players to one of the most perfect Assassin's Creed settings for the first time. The main protagonist, Shao Jun, has the credit of being one of the franchise's first playable female Assassins. The character was also praised due to her more grounded story and respectable portrayal of an Asian character.\nA more straightforward side-scrolling action/stealth game, Chronicles: China is a refreshing break from the open-world vastness of the main titles. The game's average score of a 69 on Metacritic showcases its limitations, but the title could have been a lot worse. There's no reason for hardcore Assassin's Creed fans to not give Chronicles: China a chance.\nRelated: How Assassin's Creed Jade Is Changing AC Combat & Gameplay\nDespite its title making it sound like DLC for Assassin's Creed 3, Liberation is actually a spin-off developed exclusively for the new - at the time - PlayStation Vita. When it comes to the Vita, Assassin's Creed 3: Liberation is often considered a must-have game for Sony's most recent handheld.\nIt keeps the typical open-world gameplay that Assassin's Creedis known for and, despite some slowdown, manages to hold up reasonably against its console counterparts. It is praised for replicating the Assassin's Creed 3 gameplay while introducing the first female Assassin and a unique new location. Liberation was so beloved - relative to the other side games, at least - that it even got an HD remake for two different generations of consoles.\n2014 was not a good year for Assassin's Creed. Both releases received the lowest scores of any console games in the entire franchise, with Assassin's Creed: Unity achieving a score of 71 on Metacritic. The plot is set during the French Revolution and centers on Arno Victor Dorian's efforts to expose the true powers behind the revolution. It's a setup AC fans had been hoping to see for some time, but it was marred with shortcomings.\nOften considered the worst Assassin's Creed, Unitydrew criticism centered on the game's small scope and numerous technical issues which included bugs and glitches, poor graphics, and performance and connectivity issues. Although patches improved the game and its parkour system was exciting, it never reached the heights of prior titles.\nRelated: Ubisoft Learned The Wrong Lessons From Assassin's Creed Unity\nThe first of two games released in 2014, Assassin's Creed: Rogue's final mission actually serves as the prologue for Unity. Set during the Seven Years' War, Rogue follows Shay Patrick Cormac, an Assassin turned Templar, in his efforts to hunt down and kill members of the Brotherhood who betrayed him.\nWith a weighted average of 72, Rogue holds a \"mixed or average reviews\" grade on Metacritic. Praise went to the primary twist of playing as an Assassin's Creed Templar instead of an Assassin, as well as the complexity of the titular character. The game, however, failed to innovate or deliver a sailing experience as strong as Black Flag and featured a generally predictable plot.\nThings improved somewhat in 2015, though the franchise remained at a low point with Assassin's Creed: Syndicate. With a Metacritic score of 76, firmly set on the \"mixed or average reviews\" camp, Syndicate follows twin Assassins Jacob and Evie Frye's attempts to take back their city from Templar control.\nSet in Victorian-era London, Syndicate offered an improvement on Unity and Rogue, with particular praise going to the plot, graphics, and missions. Many considered it a return to form for the franchise, although the repetitiveness of the gameplay acted as a strong downside.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed Syndicate: Evie Deserved To Be The Main Character\nThe game that started it all, the first Assassin's Creed showed the promise of the series from the beginning. It takes place during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land and introduces Desmond Miles, the franchise's modern-day lead - at least, during the first few games. The central conflict between Assassins and Templars is also introduced.\nPraised for its innovative premise, engaging storytelling and visuals, and overall originality, Assassin's Creed received a weighted average of 80 on Metacritic. Although its innovations are still interesting today, the characters and gameplay of later entries have improved in variety and entertainment.\nThe fourth game in the main series, Revelations continues the story of Desmond Miles, still voiced by Nolan North, as he tries to avert the 2012 apocalypse. It is mainly set during the 12th and 13th-century in Masyaf, Cappadocia, and Constantinople.\nFollowing up the acclaim offered to Assassin's Creed 2 and Brotherhood, Revelations took a slight downturn by adding only superficial additions and covering a less compelling part of Ezio's complete Assassin's Creed story. It still brought a solid experience to the table and also stands as the first and so far only game where all its versions received the same grade on Metacritic, with PC, Xbox 360, and PS3 all getting an 80 \"generally favorable\" review.\nRelated: Dawn Of Ragnarok's Trailer Has A Hidden Nod To AC Revelations\nPremiering in 2018, Assassin's Creed: Odyssey brought the franchise into full RPG mode. Odyssey took players further into the past than ever before, taking place between the years 431-422 BC. Set against the backdrop of the Peloponnesian War, the player controls a mercenary who fights for both sides as they attempt to find their family.\nOdyssey received critical acclaim for its characters (particularly when choosing the strong Assassin's Creed protagonist Kassandra), scope, setting, plot, gameplay, and story, gaining an 85 on Metacritic. However, the game's reach sometimes exceeded its grasp, and a focus on having an enormous amount of content led to some of the missions feeling repetitive or trite. With a focus on making players explore and grind for achievement, Odyssey's best features could only sometimes overcome its weaknesses.\nThe sequel to Revelations and the fifth game overall, Assassin's Creed 3 continues the apocalypse storyline and is set during the American Revolution. It received generally positive reviews, with an average weighted score of 83 on Metacritic.\nThe game courted some controversy when it was accused of anti-British sentiment while promoting American nationalism, particularly in its marketing. Once released, critics agreed that the depiction of both sides was balanced, with reviewers concurring with the developers claim that the game did not portray or endorse jingoism. Assassin's Creed 3's excellent opening gives way to uneven story pacing, which coincided with a buggy release to make Assassin's Creed 3 compare unfavorably against the high points of the Ezio games. Highlights like naval combat and tomahawk action, however, go a long way in counterbalancing flaws.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed 3 Gave Connor The Series' Coolest Weapon\nThe latest entry into the Assassin's Creed RPG venture, Valhalla serves as a successor to Odyssey. Set during the Viking Invasion of Britain circa 872 CE, the player assumes control of the Viking Eivor, who becomes involved in the ancient conflict between Templars and Assassins.\nHighly anticipated since its announcement, Valhalla received praise for its narrative and world design. Some side content can feel repetitive, but a less grindy approach to equipment marks an improvement from Odyssey. An average score of 83 on Metacritic shows that Valhalla's familiar approach doesn't hold it back from being a good overall experience.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage is a prequel to Valhalla, taking place 11 years before in ancient Baghdad, with its story centering on a street thief turned Hidden One, Basim Ibn Ishaq. Basim plays a key role in Valhalla, but Mirage is perfectly playable as a standalone experience, using its predecessor's foundation to deliver a game closer to the classic stealth action the series was known for originally. The overarching story of Mirage falters in some key places, but its gameplay is a delightful throwback, and the majority of its immediate narrative within Baghdad more than makes up for any low points.\nMirage feels like a return to the series' roots through-and-through, recentering the conflict between the Hidden Ones and the Order of the Ancients, organizations that would go on to become the Assassin Brotherhood and Templar Order respectively. This focus makes assassination Basim's main objective in numerous missions, peeling back the facade of Baghdad's high society to find the Order's rot within. This focus on investiagation makes it heavily reminiscent of the original Assassin's Creed, but Mirage doesn't suffer from the same repetitiveness.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nBlack Flag represented substantially different gameplay from prior Assassin's Creed games. Set in the 18th-century Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, the game features a great deal of ship-based action, with particular emphasis on strategy and exploration. Black Flag follows Welsh pirate Edward Kenway, voiced by Matt Ryan, who stumbles upon the Assassin/Templar conflict.\nCritically acclaimed upon release, Black Flag made an interesting and successful change-up to the traditional formula. Although Black Flag's open world tends to ping-pong players from mission to mission, its large scope marked an exciting change for the series, and its expansion of Assassin's Creed 3's naval gameplay resonated with fans. With an 85 Metacritic score, it received high notes in all its iterations, with its PS3 version as the highest-rated.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed: Edward Kenway Deserved His Own Ezio Trilogy\nEntering into the golden age of Assassin's Creed, Brotherhood marks the second installment of the Assassin's Creed trilogy headlined by protagonist Ezio Auditore da Firenze. His quest to restore the Assassin order continues, as well as his goal of bringing down his enemies, the powerful Borgia family.\nSet in 16th-century Italy, mainly Rome, Brotherhood earned critical acclaim. The PS3 version achieved a 90 on Metacritic, although its weighted average is 89 when counting the Xbox 360 and PC versions. Although the story doesn't always operate at the heights of Assassin's Creed 2, an excellent setting, improved gameplay, and interesting side content made it a more than worthy follow-up to a legendary predecessor.\nAssassin's Creed: Origins is set in Egypt at the end of the Ptolemaic Period circa 49 BCE. It explores the conflict between the Hidden Ones, ancestors of the Assassins, and The Order of the Ancients, who were forerunners of the Templars. It emphasizes role-playing elements but retains the open-world and stealth elements typical of the franchise.\nThe enormous Assassin's Creed Origins mapleads to a slower pace than prior games in the series, but the game excels in many other regards. The engaging protagonist Bayek has a compelling and personal story, and clearing enemy camps proves more engaging than prior games thanks to interesting combat and design. With an average of 83 on Metacritic, indicating \"generally positive reviews,\" Origins successfully took Assassin's Creed into new and exciting territory.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed Origins Bayek Cosplay Is Worthy Of The Gods\nAssassin's Creed 2 turned the franchise into a true force with which to be reckoned in the gaming world. Taking place at the height of the Italian Renaissance, the plot follows Ezio as he seeks vengeance against those who betrayed his family, discovering mysteries left behind by an ancient race known as the First Civilization.\nCritically acclaimed at the time of its release, Assassin's Creed 2's realistic open world, in which the player can explore Florence, Venice, Monteriggioni, and Forli, received universal praise. This perspective holds up today, as limited combat options and a smaller scope fail to drag down a tight, focused story and gameplay experience.Plenty of great Assassin's Creedgames have released since Ezio's first adventure, but the rooftops of Venice still stand tall above the rest.\nSource: Ubisoft/YouTube\nDavid is a twenty-nine-year-old Mexican writer and reader.

A spinoff of NBC’s classic sitcom Cheers, Frasier follows Dr. Frasier Crane, a successful Boston therapist who moves back to his hometown Seattle following his divorce from his wife. After landing a job as host of a radio call-in show in hopes of getting a fresh start, he begins to reconnect with his estranged family members. Airing from September 1993 to May 2004, Frasier earned a whooping thirty-seven Primetime Emmy Awards.\nSpeaking to The Guardian ahead of the release of the Frasier reboot, the 82-year-old legendary sitcom director explains that he came on board for the show because Kelsey Grammer, the award-winning actor who played the titular character in the original show, requested for him to come in. He also adds that he was not involved in the writing process of the pilot episode, he simply handed in a script. Read his full comment below:\nI had nothing to do with the writing of the pilot, or determining what it should be. I was just handed a script. Was it an easy decision to take it on?

He was originally responsible for first bringing the Dr. Frasier Crane character to screens, back in 1984, when he created Cheers alongside Glen and Les Charles. Running the show 11 seasons, Cheers was widely lauded, receiving 28 Primetime Emmy Awards from a record of 117 nominations.\nFollowing the success of Cheers, Burrows went on to direct other notable shows like Wings, Friends, Will & Grace, Two and A Half Men, The Big Bang Theory, as well as Frasier. With Burrows confirmed to return to once again work on Frasier, with reports stating that the 82-year-old directed the first two episodes of the reboot, his inclusion in the show will come as good news to viewers of the original classic sitcom.\nRelated: Frasier Reboot Answers A Big Cheers Question 30 Years Later\nSeeing as there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the Frasier reboot, especially because the show is coming back nearly 20 years after it originally ended and a number of the key cast — David Hyde Pierce and Jane Leeves, who played Niles and Daphne, as well as the now deceased John Mahoney will not be returning.

{"title": "Miranda’s Victim Review: Important Drama Is Elevated By Outstanding Performances", "date": "2023-10-05 19:35:26", "text": "Not a single performance was wasted in Miranda’s Victim, which is exactly the kind of production you need from such a heavy story.\n“You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used against you in a court of law…” Under the fifth amendment of the US Constitution, Miranda Rights protect people from self-incrimination. We hear them often in crime shows and films, but the story behind their creation is a shocking one. Director Michelle Danner brings to life this true story based on the 1966 Supreme Court decision that changed America forever. In Miranda’s Victim, Abigail Breslin stars as a victim of one of the most heinous crimes imaginable. George Kolber and Richard Lasser developed the story and J. Craig Stiles penned the screenplay of this well-acted, shocking story of events that would change crime reporting and our justice system forever.\nTrish Weir (Breslin) is a kindhearted and shy eighteen-year-old. After getting off at her bus stop from a long night at work and beginning her walk home, Trish is kidnapped and raped. Through countless recalls with the local police officers, Trish finally identifies her assailant, Ernesto Miranda (Sebastian Quinn). Miranda confesses without legal representation and serves a two-year sentence, which is later overturned. Trish wants to put her trauma behind her, but Lawrence Turoff (Luke Wilson), the prosecutor overseeing the case, is determined to hold Ernesto accountable for his crimes. But with Ernesto’s defense attorney, John Flynn (Ryan Phillippe), standing in his way, that proves to be more challenging.\nThroughout Danner’s film, there is one thing that is vastly clear: Rape reporting and convictions have been a trouble spot in our legal system for a very long time. Though Miranda Rights serve their purpose and belong in the constitution, their origin can very well leave a bad taste in your mouth. Through Weir, we see how little support there is when it comes to reporting such crimes, whether that be from your own mother, husband, or the courts. But something that Miranda’s Victim does well is show Trish’s bravery in dealing with her trauma while pushing through and using her voice to get her rapist convicted. We don’t often see this depicted on the big screen, so it’s a breath of fresh air to be reminded that women are multifaceted and able to take on the very same things that bring them trauma.\nThe script appropriately demonstrates just how difficult standing up to one’s rapist can be. Though the screenplay, written by J. Craig Styles, takes us through Trish’s trauma and fight for justice in equal doses, it is Danner’s direction that pushes the visuals a bit far in the storytelling. We're well aware of what a rape scene looks like, and the visual impact it brings. But we’ve also moved past the point of needing them to prove a point. And in Miranda’s Victim, the graphic visuals serve very little service to the story other than reminder flashbacks and ways to emphasize Trish’s ongoing nightmares. Subtlety would have been the best approach here and a redirection to the film’s style and personality would’ve been better suited.\nDespite these minor hiccups, it is clear Danner understands the sensitive content of the story. Visually, the other parts of the story work in and out of the courtroom when it comes to shaping Trish’s feelings throughout the years. Crucially, Danner gives her actors the space to excel in every moment, giving us a compelling final product that is worth the watch. Abigail Breslin certifies her talent with every tear shed while giving an equally amazing physical performance. Ryan Phillippe also returns to form with his cutthroat approach to his character John Flynn. Not a single performance is wasted in Miranda’s Victim, which is exactly the kind of production you need from such a heavy story.\nUltimately, this story, likely unfamiliar to the masses, conveys the hidden history behind Miranda Rights with conviction and great storytelling. Breslin leads this ensemble cast with confidence, reminding us that her Oscar nomination for Little Miss Sunshine was no fluke. Though Danner could have taken a more subtle approach in her visual cues, there’s no denying the lasting impact her feature will have given the origin of Miranda Rights. Even with the film’s simple style, this story is about one woman’s courage to tell her truth and get justice for herself, even if she had to face the Supreme Court to do so.\nMiranda's Victim will release in limited theaters and streaming on October 6. The film is 127 minutes and not rated.\nPatrice is a film/TV critic and editor based in southern California.

{"title": "New Period Drama Will Be Perfect For Those Looking For The Next Bridgerton Fix", "date": "2023-10-05 19:51:27", "text": "For those eagerly awaiting the next Bridgerton season, Apple TV+ will soon provide an enticing period piece drama entitled, The Buccaneers. \nBridgerton fans itching for another period drama will soon be able to satiate their regency romance cravings with a new Apple TV+ series. Netflix's critically acclaimed Bridgerton took the world by storm, bringing Julia Quinn's book series to life and serializing the loves, scandals, and adventures of the children of the late Viscount Bridgerton. The deep dive into the personal lives of Bridgerton's high society made the series a breakout hit. It quickly brought about the development of a second season, as well as the prequel limited series Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.\nAs of now, the Bridgerton universe's production company Shondaland has yet to confirm Queen Charlotte season 2. And although Bridgerton season 3 and 4 have been confirmed, solid release dates have yet to be established, leaving fans burning for more addictive narratives and historical romances of the 19th century. Fortunately, Bridgerton fans don't have to wait until those pesky, undisclosed release dates to enjoy another period piece. Apple TV+ will soon release its own historical drama, and it has the potential to win them over.\nApple recently released a trailer for its upcoming eight-episode drama The Buccaneers, and it promises to become one of several suitable replacements for Bridgerton to watch in the wait for season 3. The British series is set to premiere on the streaming platform on Wednesday, November 8. The Buccaneers will follow similar storylines and feature familiar themes from Shondaland's acclaimed Netflix series. The Buccaneers centers on a lively group of American girls who, despite rejecting the gender roles of high society in 1870s London, are shipped off to attend a debutante ball and secure suitors.\nLeading The Buccaneers' cast of characters is Sierra Burgess Is a Loser star Kristine Froseth as Nan St. George, 13 Reasons Why's Alisha Boe as Conchita Closson, and the Saved by the Bell reboot's Josie Totah as Mabel. The cast will also include Christina Hendricks (Mad Men), Imogen Waterhouse (The Irregulars), Josh Dylan (Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again), and Kate Winslet's daughter Mia Threapleton (I Am Ruth). Katherine Jakeways, writer of the British TV series Tracey Ullman's Show, serves as The Buccaneers' writer and creator, while Doctor Who alum Beth Willis serves as executive producer alongside Jakeways, George Faber, and Susanna White.\nHints from the trailer suggest fans of Bridgerton may find The Buccaneers a suitable replacement for several reasons. The Buccaneers will follow a group of young women as they balance their love/hate relationship to romance during the particularly confining period of the 1870s — so not long after Bridgerton's Regency era setting. The Buccaneers will tell its story quite similarly to Bridgerton, underlining the overall narrative with whirlwind romances, pushback against societal constructs, and exquisite fashions.\nThe Buccaneers' trailer might not reveal enough to convince fans to watch it in Bridgerton's stead, but period piece aficionados will be intrigued to know that Apple TV's new series is based on the unfinished, same-titled novel by Edith Wharton. Like Bridgerton and other successful period films and series — including Pride and Prejudice, Becoming Jane, and Outlander — The Buccaneers will be adapted from a source novel. The Buccaneers may not be the end-all, be-all for Shondaland fans. However, it holds promise and enough likeness to Bridgerton to pacify audiences until the highly anticipated season 3 releases.\n"}
{"title": "Breaking Bad Co-Creator Finally Reveals Details About New Show With Better Call Saul Star", "date": "2023-10-05 19:54:52", "text": "Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan is finally offering details on his highly-anticipated new series with Better Call Saul star Rhea Seehorn.\nBreaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan is finally shedding light on his new series with Better Call Saul star Rhea Seehorn. First announced in September of last year, the Apple TV+ Original reunites Gilligan with Seehorn, as the two worked together on Better Call Saul. The project has been described as a \"blended, grounded genre drama' and it has already nabbed a two-season straight-to-series order from the streamer. Gilligan will serve as executive producer and showrunner on Seehorn's first major television role since she ended her run as Kim Wexler, though plot details have been kept under wraps.\nIn a new interview with Variety, Gilligan pulls back the curtain on what to expect from his upcoming collaboration with Seehorn. The four-time Emmy winner was asked to shed some light on the Apple TV+ drama and mentioned that the story has a sci-fi component. Gilligan, who co-created Better Call Saul with Peter Gould, also stresses the new show is not connected to the Breaking Bad universe. He adds: \"The world changes very abruptly in the first episode, and then it is quite different.\" The full exchange is below:\nYeah! I wouldn’t call this heavy science fiction, I would call it mild science fiction. But it does have a sci-fi element to it, at its core. And there’s no crime, and no methamphetamine. It’s going to be fun and different. I have no prediction as to how folks to react to it — whether they’ll love it or hate it, or somewhere in the vast in-between. But I know it’s a story that interests me, and Rhea will be playing a very different character than she played on “Saul.” The weird thing is that it takes place in Albuquerque, except it’s a whole different world. There’s no overlap that I can see. She’s playing a character who is not Kim Wexler, but hopefully people will roll with that. I’m nervous. It’ll be interesting to see how folks react to it.\nThe world changes very abruptly in the first episode, and then it is quite different. It’s the modern world — the world we live in — but it changes very abruptly. And the consequences that that reaps hopefully provide drama for many, many episodes after that.\nPerhaps more than any other streaming service, Apple TV+ has gained the reputation of wanting to work with A-list talent on big and buzzy projects. But this is arguably the first time that the platform has put its resources behind a proven duo. Gilligan is one of the most popular writers in television, going back to his time on The X-Files. Seehorn, meanwhile, emerged as the beating heart of Better Call Saul and a phenomenal performer, with hopes that she will receive an overdue Emmy win for her performance as Kim Wexler.\nThe combination of the platform and the talent, both in front of and behind the camera, makes the upcoming show one to watch for. It'll be filmed in Albuquerque, the famous setting of the Breaking Bad world, and Gilligan mentions in the same interview that work on the project is set to ramp up again soon. It could be even more exciting when more details and castings are eventually shared.\nRelated: Better Call Saul Has 46 Nominations, But Hasn't Won A Single Emmy - That's Absurd\nSeehorn is Emmy-nominated for the second half of Better Call Saul. In comments before the actors' strike, the actor made no secret that she hopes to play Kim again someday. For now, her next endeavor with Breaking Bad creator has all the right components to capture attention once it finally debuts.\nSource: Variety\nAbdullah Al-Ghamdi joined Screen Rant in 2019.

Loki grapples with the warning He Who Remains gave him about his death, leading to a second multiverse war as he deals with the ever-expanding branches of the \"sacred timeline.\" With the help of new and familiar faces at the TVA, he will face questions about free will and the multiverse while also searching for Sylvie, Renslayer, and Miss Minutes.\nMichael Waldron created Loki, but Eric Martin stepped into the role of head writer for season 2. Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead join the series as the lead directing team for the second season, following Kate Herron's departure after the first. Loki features a star-studded cast led by Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson, Sophia Di Martino, Jonathan Majors, Wunmi Mosaku, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Tara Strong, and Eugene Cordero. Ke Huy Quan also joined the cast for the second season.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Breaks 2 MCU Trends That Have Defined The Last 10 Years\nScreen Rant spoke with Christine Wada, the costume designer for Loki season 2, about the new looks for the characters. She shared the inspiration for Victor Timely's look, OB's coveralls, and how both Loki and Sylvie have changed to reflect their journeys. Wada also revealed that the space suit worn by Mobius was a practical suit and a hilarious detail about Majors' Victor Timely costume.\nScreen Rant: You guys jump around from different genres and different eras. What was one of your favorite eras to explore in season 2?\nChristine Wada: 1970s. So fun. So fun and such a great way to transition us out of the TVA and then jump into that glamour world. Go from uniform to glamour was really fun. And I think it's a fun journey for characters like B-15 and to see her out of the armor and the uniform. It's great.\nWe do end up in a McDonald's there. How much research did you do with those old-school McDonald's outfits?\nChristine Wada: A lot. They're spot on. They are spot on. It comes from a catalog. Well, not a catalog. It actually comes from the handbook. So we really tried to stay as true and honest to that as possible. Yeah.\nYeah. One of the other ones that really jumped out to me was the World's Fair. Everything looks so incredibly detailed. Even the way it was shot was beautiful. Talk to me about designing the costumes for that sequence because there are a lot of folks wearing costumes from that era.\nChristine Wada: Yeah. That was, first of all, it was just interesting to try to make it feel like America in that era because of course we filmed in London, so a lot of the costumes are from Europe. And it's just American, adds some of that little Western vibe to it and a little less fitted because in Europe, everybody was really more, the collar was tight and everything was a little more trim. When you look at old American research, there's just a little more cowboy to it. So it's fun to do that and just designing it to sort of in a weird way, almost be a little bit like the TVA because it's still a uniform.\nWhen you go back to the 1890s, you realize that it's still kind of a uniform. There just wasn't as much choice, which I think is interesting when the season is somewhat about choice. We're going to this era where there really wasn't a lot of choice. So it's fun to play with that a little bit. So I really restricted the palette as much as I could and to try to think about how we see those past actual centuries. We see them sort of in black and white or as colorized photography. I thought it would be nice to sort of feed that into that episode.\nNow, Christine, Loki has evolved as a character from season 1 to season 2. I don't even think Thor would recognize this version of Loki at this point, but talk to me about what went into Loki's design this season evolving from last season.\nChristine Wada: He still, I think he needed to be tied to the TVA and all his relationships in the TVA. It's basically kind of assembling what would Loki do if he still wanted to have an attachment visually to the TVA, but Loki, the God, could create his own TVA uniform? So he still has the pants from season 1, but I think the jacket is definitely something that Loki would conjure up.\nHow much input does Tom Hiddleston have in the look of Loki?\nChristine Wada: Quite a bit. He's definitely... but input that is maybe not even verbal because I just think that there is a physicality to Tom that if you're paying attention, it dictates how you're going to design those costumes because his presence just brings a lot to the table. The way he performs brings a lot to the table. So, as a designer, like I said, I think if you're doing your homework, you can really take from a much more nuanced directive.\nI want to talk about Sylvie's look for a second because she's in a different point in season 2, but it's blending her Asgardian armor along with being more casual. What went into developing that for her?\nChristine Wada: There's so many different elements because you wanted her to feel like she picked up something from the 80s because she's really just trying to live a more real life, right? And I felt like her palette had to stay somewhat subdued because I just think she's just trying to blend in, but it also had to give her a swagger.\nAnd just from a really technical level of six episodes, it was also how do we keep Sylvie looking, how do we not make it campy or goofy for her to arrive in the 1890s in this 80s getup? Because I think the season is such an internal exploration of these characters that you want the costumes to be more vulnerable, and you don't want them to just stand out when they're going into these different environments in a way that's at all campy or jolting.\nIn Quantumania, we got introduced to Victor Timely, and we get his story expanded here in Loki season 2. Can you talk to me about designing Victor Timely's look and having that stand out from other variations of Kang the Conqueror?\nChristine Wada: Well, it was really inspired by Frederick Douglass. I think it's on the page. I think we're in the 1890s World Fair and I think if we stay true to what Loki is very successful at and really what makes it so fun to design is it always takes elements from real life. Even the TVA being grounded in the 60s and having some of the analog of the 60s. I just think it makes the show special and exciting and I think that with Victor Timely's character to have a real person be sort of our base role model just allowed us to design something that, he can only, he's just, yeah.\nThe subtleties of that character are phenomenal, even the small things he does.\nChristine Wada: Small things! Just the rise of the pant where the pant is and just the posture and even his handkerchief I embroidered with his initials. I actually made him real period underwear, so he could really feel like he was getting into the whole time period.\nKe Huy Quan might be my favorite new MCU character. OB is phenomenal. What went into designing his look and staying true to still with the TVA kind of aesthetic?\nChristine Wada: Well, it started, and I'd say production design has always been just so collaborative and something to cue off of. I remember Kasra [Farahani] talking about we were going to see these new areas of the TVA and having OB and his world feeling a little bit more like it's from the 40s or early 50s, right? And so that jumpsuit is, I pulled period jumpsuits from that era.\nThere's even that buckle, the high buckle in the back that is just very much a nod to those older periods and just doing all that work wear herringbone from that period. It was just trying to keep him a little more backdated and of course there were so many different iterations of that costume and so it really became this, well what are we trying to say that fits into this entire cohesive vision? So staying a little more period, a little more mechanical felt right.\nWhich character went through the most evolution from season 1 to season 2 and was the most challenging for you?\nChristine Wada: Wow, I would say that it really does have to be Sylvie even though Sylvie is oddly still wearing her armor from season 1. I just think it had to feel more vulnerable and more real and just taking the whole thing down a little bit. So, I think finding that sweet spot was hard, but then again working with the acting of Sophia is not hard so.\nOut of what we've seen in the first four episodes, can you tease anything that we would see visually that's coming up without giving a spoiler away? It's hard to tiptoe around that I feel like, right?\nChristine Wada: I don't think that I can. I don't know how to, and I would never want to spoil it because I think that it's so impactful what happens through this season that I would... I don't think I could say anything.\nI do have a question for you actually about the space suit. Is that a physical space suit or is that all a CG type of?\nChristine Wada: I love it. No, it's all practical and I have to say that's another thing that I think is really fun and special about Loki in particular is that we try very hard to do as much in camera as possible. Justin and Aaron were really great about that and so no, that's almost all practical. So we made a destructed version and we made so many different versions of it. So, it's all practical which wasn't easy, but it's modular, so it gave the actors some breathing room.\nOut of these costumes, which one is your favorite? I know it's like picking your favorite child.\nChristine Wada: I mean, right now I'm really, well I love the collar of Tom's. Come on. This is mean. This is mean. I love his collar. I love Sylvie's coat and I really love Renslayer so I'm sorry I can't keep it to one. I broke the rules.\nAlong with Mobius, Hunter B-15 and a team of new and returning characters, Loki navigates an ever-expanding and increasingly dangerous multiverse in search of Sylvie, Judge Renslayer, Miss Minutes and the truth of what it means to possess free will and glorious purpose.\nBe sure to also check out our interview with Loki season 2 executive producer Kevin Wright\nLoki season 2 debuts on Disney+ on October 5.\n"}
{"title": "What The Nightsisters Did To Morgan Elsbeth & Why She Didn't Look Like Them", "date": "2023-10-05 20:00:28", "text": "Morgan Elsbeth was transformed by the Great Mothers in Ahsoka’s season finale—but what exactly did they do to her, and did it lead to her death?\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nAhsoka’s season 1 finale was jam-packed with lore details and action sequences, but one of the more puzzling aspects of Ahsoka episode 8 was what happened to Nightsister Morgan Elsbeth. Elsbeth had proven to be a worthy foe for Ahsoka Tano and her apprentice Sabine Wren, and the more audiences saw of Lady Morgan, the more questions arose. The eventual appearance of the three Nightsister Great Mothers—Klothow, Aktropaw, and Lakesis—made Morgan’s story and background even more intriguing, as she answered their call across galaxies.\nThe Nightsisters of Dathomir were a race of witches who used magick to tap into the Force. However, their power resided in the dark side, though their magick remained unattainable for figures like Emperor Palpatine. The majority of the Nightsisters would be massacred in the final year of the Clone Wars, with General Grievous leading the attack on Dathomir that would decimate the Nightsister’s population. It’s known that Morgan Elsbeth was one of the survivors, and she aligned herself with Grand Admiral Thrawn and the Empire after the fall of the Republic in the pursuit of greater power.\nAhsoka episode 8 showed the Great Mothers reward Morgan Elsbeth with the “gift of shadows.” Morgan’s face was altered during the ceremony, with her eyes becoming all black. The Great Mothers essentially infused Morgan with ichor, which is also known as the power of the dark side. Morgan Elsbeth was already a formidable foe, but with this extra power and the Blade of Talzin, she was instantly more dangerous. Nightsister magick generally taps into the dark side of the Force, but this ritual to physically transform Morgan focuses that energy into a living being.\nIt's known from Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels that the Nightsisters of Dathomir, even after death, can affect the living world. Not only can the dead be resurrected—which was seen with the Night Troopers in Ahsoka episode 8—but the deceased Nightsisters can also possess living beings. This was seen in Rebels season 3 when Darth Maul lures Sabine Wren and Kanan Jarrus to Dathomir. Elsbeth’s transformation makes her not only look more like other Nightsisters audiences have seen in Star Wars canon, but also infuses her with a similar kind of communal magick she couldn’t access beforehand.\nRelated: When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline\nAfter Morgan Elsbeth was given the gift of the shadows, her power significantly increased. When Morgan first appeared in The Mandalorian season 2, it was a challenge for Ahsoka Tano to beat her, but the former Jedi would eventually come out victorious. However, when the two dueled again in the Ahsoka season 1 finale, the combatants were far more evenly matched. In fact, the duel was seemingly decided when the reincarnated Night Troopers appeared to help Elsbeth finish off Ahsoka. The only reason Morgan lost to Ahsoka was because Sabine Wren chose not to join Ezra Bridger aboard Grand Admiral Thrawn’s ship.\nThe Blade of Talzin also contributed to Morgan Elsbeth’s growth of power. With the sword being a relic of the Nightsisters, she was able to quickly master the weapon that appeared with green flames on the metal blade. While the Blade of Talzin is not a lightsaber, it could deflect the Jedi weapon like beskar and even cut through one of Ahsoka's hilts. If the sword is a kind of Force-infused weapon, then for the Nightsisters, the Blade of Talzin may be their own version of a lightsaber, though it is only bestowed on a certain few.\nOne of the most important parts of Morgan Elsbeth’s transformation at the beginning of Ahsoka episode 8 was the oath she swore before the Great Mothers gifted her. Audiences familiar with the Nightsisters from The Clone Wars may have noticed that the oath Morgan swore was the same that Mother Talzin had Asajj Ventress recite when she was welcomed back into the coven on Dathomir. This shows that Morgan was likely already familiar with the oath, and that it demanded a commitment to her sisters and to the Nightsister community as a whole.\nThere could be a good reason why Thrawn was quick to have Morgan be the one left behind, and that is because of the oath she took. Part of the oath was swearing to abandon her old life, and that likely included loyalty to Thrawn. If Morgan had pledged herself to the Nightsisters, Thrawn easily could’ve seen this as her no longer being fully on his side. For someone who inspires such loyalty from his troops—so much so that Night Troopers volunteered to die and become zombies—it’s not hard to see why Thrawn would be wary of an oath like this.\nRelated: Why Grand Admiral Thrawn Goes To Dathomir In Ahsoka Episode 8\nIt's likely that when Morgan Elsbeth took this oath, she knew she was entering into a deeper level of commitment to the communal magick of the Nightsisters. By taking the oath, Morgan was essentially getting baptized as a stronger member of the Nightsister clan. Not only did she swear her allegiance to the Nightsisters, but she vowed to put the needs of the whole community above all else. She was no longer seen as an individual survivor, but part of a sisterhood. For someone like Grand Admiral Thrawn, who had instilled such a sense of loyalty throughout his ranks, he could’ve viewed this oath and subsequent transformation as problematic for his goals.\nWhile the loss of a villain like Morgan Elsbeth is a blow for Thrawn's cause, the three Great Mothers will certainly reveal more about their larger plan and how their magick works in Ahsoka season 2. With Thrawn willing to sacrifice a loyal servant like Morgan, a potential change in dynamic with the Great Mothers could be in store with the antagonists all back in the main Star Wars galaxy. Ahsoka scratched the surface of what the Great Mothers are capable of, and future stories can allow them to demonstrate their power in ways Morgan Elsbeth never could.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "'All of Manhattan Became Mutants': TMNT's Original Plan for Mutant Town Was Much Darker", "date": "2023-10-05 20:00:28", "text": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles writer/artist Sophie Campbell reveals the Mutant Town was supposed to be so much darker ahead of her upcoming TMNT #150. \nMutant Town is a relatively new addition to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles lore, but one that has become integral to the wider story, as it makes the established universe feel so much fuller while also creating nearly limitless future story potential. While Mutant Town is unarguably a good thing within TMNT canon, it was originally supposed to be way darker, and the creative mind behind Mutant Town, Sophie Campbell, said so herself ahead of the conclusion to her run on TMNT.\nMutant Town was created after the events of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #98 when the TMNT's mutant extremist group called the Mighty Mutanimals led by the anthropomorphic cat-mutant and prominent TMNT villain Old Hob set off a mutagen bomb in the middle of a crowd in New York City, mutating every human in that general vicinity. While there were some outlying mutants who popped up in later stories who weren’t in the immediate area - given that the mutagen was airborne - it was only a relatively small number of mutants that were created that day, though more than enough to give the City of New York cause for alarm. In response, the newly-elected Mayor Baxter Stockman decided to wall-off a portion of the city where the mutants could live separate from humanity. This happened in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #101, which was Sophie Campbell’s debut issue. And now, Campbell reflects on the choices she made with the development of TMNT's Mutant Town, including the original scale of the walled-off portion of New York City.\nIn an interview with CBR, Sophie Campbell discussed the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #150, as that issue will mark the end of her run on IDW Publishing’s TMNT comic book series. While talking about what fans can expect, Campbell touched on how her storyline began, most notably Mutant Town. She spoke about what aspects of Mutant Town she was proud of, while also revealing what could have been.\nCampbell: Originally, I had wanted to expand the mutagen bomb effects and have the entirety of Manhattan become mutants and have the city walled off like Escape from New York, but we ended up scaling it back, which I think was the right way to go.\nSophie Campbell also explained how Mutant Town impacted the Ninja Turtles personally, not just in terms of the wider universe.\nCampbell: It was an opportunity to do a whole brave new world for the Turtles – a situation they’d never been in. They could finally mingle with other people without having to hide. They could finally have real lives in a real community.\nThese quotes outline two very different versions of Mutant Town. Given the reference to Escape from New York, it seems the original idea for it was something more akin to a controlled post-apocalyptic wasteland behind tall, unbreachable walls. That gives one an image of the Ninja Turtles filling the narrative role of Snake Plissken, carefully traversing the dangerous area, taking down mutant crime lords and kicking butt along the way. It’s a cool thought based on an ambitious idea, but definitely a dark flip for the Turtles that would have ultimately only served to separate them further from humanity, which is the opposite of what the canonical Mutant Town actually did. The Mutant Town TMNT fans got was the culmination of everything the Turtles had ever wanted up until that point. Sure, they hated that so many people were displaced and mutated, but in the end, everyone came together to form a tight-knit community where everyone belonged and no one was judged based on their physical appearance.\nNo longer did the Turtles have to hide in the shadows and live in the streets. In Mutant Town, they were respected community leaders, law enforcement officers, and even a reliable new source. Sophie Campbell created a home for the Turtles with Mutant Town, which - based on this interview - is a far cry from the ‘Escape from New York’-esque prison they almost got, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ Mutant Town was reportedly supposed to be way darker.\nSource: CBR\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

The idea of an adult movie about the iconic purple dinosaur is intriguing, especially to those who fondly look back on the character's role in their childhoods. Additionally, Barbie's remarkable performance demonstrates how Barney could make just as strong an impact. Still, the early word on this upcoming film gives some cause for concern.\nBarney is still in the very early stages of production, so Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz was reluctant to provide much information about the plot or angle of the film (via Screen Rant). He did confirm that this adaptation of the popular Barney & Friends franchise would be aimed at adults but wouldn't come with an R rating. This indicates it will be more like Barbie (rated PG-13) than a graphic reimagining like Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey. Overall, this is good news. However, Kreiz followed this up by stating that Barney \"will not be an odd movie,\" which, considering Barbie's oddness, is a somewhat concerning revelation.\nRELATED: Barney: Confirmation, Release Date Prediction & Everything We Know About Daniel Kaluuya's Adult-Focused Movie\nMattel's Barbie was undoubtedly full of wholesome, heartwarming, and societally impactful moments, but it was, at its core, an odd movie. The story was charming, but the film was absolutely absurd between Ryan Gosling's \"I'm Just Ken\" musical number and Kate McKinnon's Weird Barbie character. Considering Barbie was such a success, it seems Mattel would want to stick with a similar formula with Barney, and that means making things a little weird.\nAs a story about a purple dinosaur toy that comes to life and plays with school children all day, there is virtually no way to create an adult-aimed film that adequately pays homage to Barney while remaining serious. Of course, this also comes down to Kreiz's idea of what is or is not \"odd.\" It's possible the Mattel CEO was trying to say that audiences shouldn't expect a version of Barney that is dark or obscene. Regardless, the choice of words here, combined with the company's upcoming content plan, seems to imply that Mattel completely misunderstood what made Barbie so popular with audiences to begin with.\nBarbie was a massive box office success, with a worldwide gross of about $1.4 billion, making it the top movie of 2023. This has led Mattel to buckle down on the toy angle by announcing several similar movies in the works. Along with Barney, we can expect projects featuring American Girl Dolls, Hot Wheels, Thomas the Tank Engine, and much more. Though this is great for nostalgia, it reveals just how much Mattel has missed the point, and this is only furthered by the CEO's comments about Barney.\nRELATED: Barbie's Success Redeems Margot Robbie's 3-Movie Long Box Office Losing Streak\nThough Barbie certainly resonated with audiences who enjoyed playing with the various dolls back in the day, it was the impactful themes relating to society and the wacky comedy that made the film a success. There are countless ways that Greta Gerwig could have gone wrong with this movie, but by keeping things fun but layered with important concepts, Barbie was elevated to a new level. An adult-aimed, not \"odd\" Barney adaptation would prove that this went right over Mattel's head and would be a significant disappointment to audiences who genuinely want to see more projects like Barbie.\n"}
{"title": "Crunchyroll's Newest Hit Exposes Anime's Flawed Relationship to Videogames", "date": "2023-10-05 20:00:28", "text": "As fun as Shangri La Frontier is, its written game mechanics once more are used to inflate the protagonist's powers, rather than build a world.\nShangri La Frontier's first episode, released on Crunchyroll, is fun and visually dynamic, yet it also sets itself up for making the same blunders every video game-based anime setting does. Despite having a better sense of how a player interacts with a game, it's wasted on bolstering its protagonist's \"specialness\". In the low-stakes world of an MMO, it feels like an unnecessary and, therefore, tired piece of storytelling.\nRakuro \"Sunraku\" Hizutome speaks and acts like a gamer; that isn't in question. However, many of his banal stunts feel too self-congratulatory, making the anime give in to the all too onerous clichés of the overpowered fantasy hero. This is a shame since Shangri La Frontier otherwise has deserved moments of levity, and of course, beautifully drawn action scenes.\nRelated: 10 Best Anime Inspired By Video Games\nMany anime protagonists these days are now reliant on some quirk - optionally one leading to ostracization - becoming the core ability that lifts them up to godlike power by the end of the story. In Hizutome's case, his hobby of playing shovelware games is so mundane it's ludicrous writers want to convince fan this is a talent, yet Shangri La Frontier insists it is. Besides skills finely honed from playing glitchy entertainment, Sunraku's Shangri La avatar - a man wearing only underwear and a bird mask - is treated as an outside-the-box strategy that only he, the \"Trash Game King\", could have envisioned.\nUnfortunately, in 2023 this is all standard gamer tradition to the point of banality. A gamer subjecting themselves to \"trash games\" is likely to be livestreaming their antics. Meanwhile, wearing inappropriate outfits, or any at all, is just a way to raise hell or a self-appointed challenge to kill a boss while at the risk of dying in one hit. Even Sunraku's \"genius\" tactic of dumping his allotted skill points into Luck is nothing groundbreaking. Yet because Shangri La tries so earnestly to pretend its protagonist is some unparalleled genius, it only makes his skills come across as artificial.\nShangri La Frontier can be genuinely amusing when it actually talks about gaming itself. When someone complains about useless AI-controlled characters or skips a game's introductory cutscene, it's funny because it's true to life. While the hero's misadventures briefly mention them, ultimately the game exists just to glorify him, not video gaming itself. While Shangri La Frontier gained a lot of attention for these gestures to actual gamer habits, if the anime is going to continue congratulating its hero for acting like a typical player, it's ultimately not going to set a higher standard in much else beyond animation quality.\nBorn and raised in Canada, Kevin Chu lived internationally throughout his childhood, spending the majority of his schooling in Hong Kong before returning to Canada, first to study at the University of British Columbia, and then to find work.

{"title": "Severance Season 2: Release Date Prediction, Delays & Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-05 20:00:29", "text": "Here's what we know about Apple TV+'s Severance season 2, including returning cast, release info, and plot threads from the season 1 finale.\nSeverance season 2 is on the way to Apple TV+, although despite being confirmed for a while the future of the show is still uncertain. Created by Dan Erickson and produced by Ben Stiller, the first season of Severance ended on a dramatic cliffhanger, which more than set up season 2. Severance gradually revealed its dystopian science fiction world, in which the cult-like Lumon Corporation uses a technology called Severance to separate an employee's memories and personalities into two: an innie for the workplace, and an outie for the outside world, with both having no access to the other's experiences.\nSeverance was a breakout success for Apple TV+, thanks in no small part to the intriguing and mysterious premise spawning a number of Severance fan theories. Severance saw the four severed innies of the Macro-Data Refinement department grow more curious and resentful of the system they are a part of. However, the first chapter of the story was clearly just the beginning as nothing was close to being resolved where the show left off, meaning anticipation for the delayed Severance season 2 remains incredibly high.\nNews on Severance season 2 has been quiet throughout most of 2023. However, this is largely due to production shutting down in May due to the commencement of the WGA screenwriters going on strike (via Deadline). Since no work has been carried out on the show since — and with the cast themselves going on strike when the still-ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike began — it's unsurprising there have not been any updates from Apple or Severance producer Ben Stiller.\nThe WGA strikes were resolved on September 27, 2023. While SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP have yet to reach an agreement talks are ongoing, and the dispute is expected to be resolved by the end of 2023 (though this isn't a guarantee). It's possible that production on the show could resume once the strikes are completely resolved, which means the long-awaited Severance season 2 release date could be announced, or at least given a speculative window by Apple TV+, shortly after.\nSeverance season 2 is confirmed, with Apple announcing the renewal in August 2022 (via Variety).  Reports came in April 2023 of behind-the-scenes delays due to drama between Severance showrunners Dan Erickson and Mark Friedman were addressed by Ben Stiller who assured fans the second season was still going ahead.\nUnfortunately, Apple has yet to announce a release date for Severance season 2. Production began in October 2022 but was delayed indefinitely when production on the second season of Severance shut down due to the WGA and then SAG-AFTRA strikes in May 2023. While the WGA has since resolved its dispute with the AMPTP, and SAG-AFTRA is expected to within a few weeks, Apple has yet to offer an updated release date for Severance season 2. It's likely that, until the SAG-AFTRA strikes are officially resolved, production cannot continue. A 2024 or even 2025 release date seems like the most probable outcome for Severance as of October 2023.\nThe cast of Severance season 2 will mostly be made up of returning faces from the first chapter of the quirky Apple TV+ sci-fi. Adam Scott (Step Brothers) will once more lead the cast as Mark, with Patricia Arquette (Medium) returning as Harmony. Provided there are no unexpected exits between now and when the release date for Severance season 2 arrives, the cast will include:\nThere have also been eight new cast members added for Severance season 2 in undisclosed roles (via Variety). The new Severance cast members in the third season will include Gwendoline Christie (The Sandman), Alia Shawkat (Arrested Development), Bob Balaban (The French Dispatch), Merrit Wever (Godless), Robby Benson (Beauty and the Beast), Stefano Carannante (Mirabilia), John Noble (The Lord of the Rings), and Ólafur Darri Ólafsson (The Tourist). There's been no hints or teases when it comes to the characters these cast members are playing, however.\nThere haven't been any concrete reveals regarding the Severance season 2 story, but the first season left some teases to set it up. The final episode of Severance season 1 sees the innies gain control of themselves outside the office using the Overtime Contingency built into their Lumon Severance Chips. Their actions in the world will be hard to undo, including Mark telling his sister Devon about the abuse going on at Lumon, Helly — who's apparently an Eagan — publicly denouncing Severance at a Lumon gala, and Irving trying to meet up with Burt. Cobel promised Helly punishment for her actions, and Severance season 2 is likely to see Lumon trying to respond to MDR's rebellion without compromising their outies.\nThere are also a number of mysteries surrounding Lumon that Severance season 2 could shed more light on. These include what happened to Mark's wife Gemma, who reappeared in the Lumon workspace as Ms. Casey, why Lumon has a room of baby goats in Severance, and the company's larger ambitions with the Severance Chips, hinted at in Helly's conversation with her father.\nSeverance season 2 could also explore more of its outies' lives, including the bizarre clues regarding Irving's outside life. Moreover, in Severance creator Dan Erickson's Reddit AMA on April 2022, while fielding viewer questions, Erickson implied that Helena Eagan would be the villain of Severance season 2, and that there might be levels to the Severance procedure.\n\nRob Hutton is a feature writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "8 MCU Heroes We Think Will Get A Happy Ending", "date": "2023-10-05 20:10:31", "text": "The MCU has had its fair share of tragic deaths so far, but a lucky few characters seem like they may actually find some kind of happy ending.\nEvery MCU hero will eventually have to have their stories come to a close, and there are several who seem like prime candidates for a happy ending. By its very nature as an action movie franchise, the Marvel Cinematic Universe involves a great deal of death and destruction. Furthermore, as the stories being told focus on those able and willing to stand up and fight, many have already found their end in a tragic manner. Assuredly, many more will follow suit in the MCU Phases 5 and 6 films.\nHowever, though several heroes have died tragically, involvement as a hero in the MCU doesn't cement one's fate or guarantee one won't be able to find happiness. Already, several iconic characters have ended their stories without tragedy, retiring or dying a good death after a life well lived. Of all the characters currently living in the MCU, these seem most likely to find a similarly happy ending.\nClint Barton, aka Hawkeye, has undergone his fair share of pain and suffering, losing his family in The Blip and later having to witness the sacrifice of Natasha Romanoff, perhaps his closest friend, on Vormir for the Soul Stone. He also spent dark time as the violent vigilant Ronin, which is still, in ways, haunting him. However, things actually look fairly bright for Hawkeye's future MCU timeline. Things seem in perfect position for the Avenger's sharp-shooter to finally retire - his family is back and safe, and Kate Bishop is ready to carry on the Hawkeye mantle. Hopefully, Clint can retire and enjoy some much-earned peace.\nIn many ways, Steve Rogers already got the perfect MCU ending. After an incredibly tumultuous life split in half by his suspended animation in the Arctic, it seemed difficult to imagine how Steve could ever relax and step back from superheroics. Endgame's time travel presented such an opportunity, allowing him to live the life with Peggy Carter he always wanted. However, despite his absence from the MCU, Steve Rogers is still alive - somewhere. It's possible that he could be revisited despite being quite an old man, but it seems most likely that the MCU will let his Endgame closure ride.\nHulk may seem like the last MCU character destined for a happy ending, but his current station in the franchise at least presents the opportunity. While Bruce Banner and the Hulk originally had a combative relationship as they vied for control of one body, the two have somehow come to an agreement and have merged. Hulk also has several MCU replacements at the ready, including his niece, She-Hulk, and his son, Skaar. Something could easily go wrong, and Hulk could devolve back into something more savage, but it's equally likely that Bruce steps out of the spotlight and lets other Hulks do the smashing.\nA year ago, Ant-Man seemed high on the list of heroes most likely to die in the MCU Phase 5 or 6. Not only did Quantumania close his trilogy, but it also introduced the Multiverse Saga's big bad - Kang the Conqueror. It seemed to make sense that Scott might die to assert Kang as a threat, especially with Hope and his daughter, Cassie, able to carry on his role as a Pym-powered Avenger. However, that didn't come to pass, and if the MCU spared what was a perfectly set-up death, it may be possible that it's because they want him to survive the franchise.\nPeter Parker is famous for never finding lasting happiness in the pages of Marvel Comics, but the MCU can finally give him a happy life with loved ones. Tom Holland's upcoming Spider-Man trilogy is likely his last, and it's starting Peter Parker out on an incredibly low note. It seems unlikely the new trilogy will start low and drop even lower, but there's another reason Peter may live on after his time as Spider-Man. The wonderful Spider-Verse movies have famously covered the death of Peter Parker, and if Miles comes to live action, the MCU may not want to repeat a story people have seen so recently.\nWhile Tony Stark was still alive, Rhodey seemed more at risk, as it's a classic superhero trope to use the death of a friend to motivate another hero. How, though, there doesn't seem to be anyone close enough with Rhodey to warrant his death as a narrative device. After Secret Invasion's ending revealed that Rhodey had been a Skrull for an indeterminate amount of time, the Avenger may commit himself even more to politics, trying to instigate change through more traditional means. Especially if Thunderbolt Ross continues to butt heads with The Avengers, the team may want a powerful ally on the political inside.\nSince his apparent death in Captain America: The First Avenger, Bucky Barnes has had nothing but struggle in his life. Brainwashed by Hyrdra and used as a mindless assassin, the now-free Bucky has to deal with both his own guilt and the fallout of actions that weren't in any way his fault or choice. At this point, giving Bucky a tragic death would simply be one more piece of pain on an already tall stack. Letting him finally find true peace is by far the most exciting way to end his story, though he'll have to survive Thunderbolts first.\nGiven that Loki started out as a villain and would-be dictator of Earth, it's impressive that he's seemingly earned himself a happy ending. Time will tell what the MCU has in store for the God of Mischief in Loki season 2, but having him meet a tragic end would feel disappointingly repetitively. Loki's death at the hands of Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War was tragic and narratively effective, and the same thing can't happen again.

With the popularity of this genre soaring, Netflix has consistently delivered engaging and thought-provoking detective series. Whether it's in a big city or a small town, a crime or investigation can go anywhere, and more often than not, no character is safe.\nFor crime drama enthusiasts, it may feel that all available storylines have been exhausted. However, 2023 has seen a wave of new releases for Netflix, including new episodes of viewer favorites Luther and season 5 of Top Boy. Netflix also saw a huge audience response to the release of Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story in 2022, and the streaming giant is clearly keen to grow its impact within the genre by producing more riveting detective series.\nFeaturing eccentric American star James Spader, The Blacklist is a crime thriller series that follows a wanted fugitive as he assists the FBI in catching deadly criminals. This fast-paced mystery was praised for its overall entertainment, and Spader's incredible performance added an extra layer of tension to the screen. Despite some elements that require a suspension of disbelief and comedic moments that feel out of place, The Blacklist was generally positively received and well-worth watching.\nThe psychological drama Mindhunter follows two FBI agents in a unique take on the 1955 non-fiction book Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit. The show ran for three seasons, but Mindhunter was canceled in 2023. The one silver lining of Mindhunter's cancellation is it means that viewers can now binge every episode on Netflix. Unlike other shows that revolve around the FBI, Mindhunter follows a research project trying to understand the in-depth psyche of serial killers, rather than being out in the field, offering a unique perspective on real-world practices.\nIn The Sinner, Bill Pullman plays Detective Harry Ambrose, who focuses on crimes committed by surprising and typically unlikely culprits, trying to work out the motivation that led to their crimes. The show started as an eight-part miniseries, but due to an overwhelmingly positive response, the series was commissioned for a further three seasons. The Sinner also received multiple nominations for several awards while it was airing, including a Golden Globe nomination for Best Miniseries or Television Film.\nRelated: 10 Best Crime Movies On Netflix\nLupin is a retelling of the story of fictional French thief Arsène Lupin, created by author Maurice Leblanc. Lupin follows Assane Diop, a young thief who models himself after Arsène Lupin. The French language drama was watched by seventy-six million people in its first month, making it the most popular non-English language show on Netflix at that time (per The Hollywood Reporter). The show was then renewed for two further installments, the latest airing in October 2023, with no announcements for further episodes at this time.\nStarring David Tennant and Stanley Tucci, Inside Man tells the intense story of two very different people whose lives end up intercrossing: a prisoner in the United States, currently on death row, and a woman trapped in the cellar of an old, English vicarage. Tennant's performance is laced with anticipation and drama, and the dark themes throughout have the occasional comedic moment, although the ending of Inside Man proves somewhat confusing.\nStarring EGOT winner Viola Davis, How to Get Away with Murder made an incredible impact upon its initial release in 2014. The show ran for six years and finished in 2020. It follows Davis' character Annalise Keating, a defense attorney based in Philadelphia who, alongside five of her students, manages to get caught up in a murder plot. Davis' performance earned her a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, making her the first black woman to ever win the award (per NPR).\nRelated: How To Get Away With Murder: 15 Shows To Watch If You Love This Series\nWhen the stories of a suburban mother, a photographer, and a detective overlap, the mystery of missing father Stewart Green begins to rear its head once again, seventeen years after his disappearance in Stay Close. The Netflix detective series is based on the novel of the same name by author Harlan Coben. Coben has adapted more of his crime novels for Netflix, including Safe and The Stranger which also rank highly among the best detective series on Netflix.\nFour-part criminal thriller Collateral stars The Great Gatsby's Carey Mulligan as DI Kip Glaspie, who is thrown into the murder investigation of a delivery driver in South West London. Set across four days, the gripping British drama interweaves the lives of several seemingly unconnected characters. Collateral does a great job of making a comment on societal structures, while still focusing on the mystery at its core.\nAnother international detective series from Netflix, Deadwind is a Finnish crime drama that follows Detective Sofia Karppi who returns to work following the very sudden and accidental death of her husband. Upon her immediate return, Sofia is thrown into a murder investigation of a woman with suspicious connections to a construction company, while still having to raise her two children by herself. Deadwind has a gripping story that elevates it to one of Netflix's strongest outings.\nThe comedy-mystery Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency is based on the book of the same name, which was inspired by two episodes of Doctor Who written by the author Douglas Adams. It was then adapted for television in 2010, but only lasted for two years before it was adapted once again by BBC America and Netflix in 2016. However, the show was canceled again less than a year on the air. Despite this, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency is light and funny, laced with darker elements throughout, but it is generally more of a feel good watch compared to other detective series.\nSatirical crime mockumentary American Vandal ran for two seasons, with each one covering a ridiculous crime in full seriousness, as two high schoolers try and find the culprit. American Vandal was highly praised for its commitment to replicating the tension found in real crime documentaries but still layered in dry humor. Unfortunately, Netflix canceled American Vandal season 3, but the producers announced their hopes to move the show to elsewhere in the future.\nThe German miniseries Dear Child arrived on Netflix in September 2023 and was immediately praised for how it tackles the topic of child abduction. The show follows Lena, who manages to escape thirteen years of captivity, having birthed a son and a daughter in this time. At the same time as these events, other decades-old disappearances start to be dusted off by authorities who suspect a connection. Intense and distressing, Dear Child is a gripping and fast-paced thriller ideal for audiences who enjoyed Broadchurch.\nAnother French drama, The Forest follows the arrest of a teacher after her student disappears in the same forest that she has a suspicious history with. The series aired in France and Belgium in 2017, before being broadcast internationally on Netflix in 2018, running as a mini-series spanning six fifty-seven-minute episodes. The series was generally well-received, with criticisms leveled at some outlandish moments in the plot. While season 1 is solid overall, the show was not renewed for another season.\nRelated: 15 Famous TV Detectives, Ranked By Intelligence\nSet in a small, Midwestern town in the United States, Dare Me follows the story of competitive high school cheerleading, as the squad gets caught up in a mess of anxious secrets and panic when they meet their new coach, Colette French. Dare Me, based on the 2012 novel of the same name by Megan Abbott (who is also co-developer of the show), lasted only one season before being canceled by Netflix less than one month after it finished airing. Despite its cancelation, the show was generally well-received by critics, earning an 85% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\nBased on a real-life news article from 2015, Unbelievable follows the arrest of a young girl accused of lying about being assaulted and the two detectives who discovered the very complicated truth. The series received huge critical acclaim, and has an incredible 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and just thirty-four days after its release, Netflix announced the miniseries had been watched by over thirty-two million viewers (via X). Unbelievable was praised for its grittiness and realism, as well as the gripping performances from the cast.\nSources: The Hollywood Reporter, NPR, Rotten Tomatoes, @netflix/X\nRebecca is an experienced freelance writer from the UK, with two degrees focussing on narrative design and characterisation, as well as being a doctoral candidate on the discussion of the wider public's understanding of minority groups and the issues they live with, through mainstream television, film, and video games. \n\nIn her spare time, you'll find her with her cats, a cup of coffee, and gaming."}
{"title": "10 Tiny Decisions In Baldur's Gate 3 That Have Huge Story Implications", "date": "2023-10-05 20:31:26", "text": "Baldur's Gate 3 is filled with choices big and small, but some of the tiniest decisions can lead to story-changing outcomes, both good and bad.\nBaldur’s Gate 3 has impressed everyone with its complex and interweaving story, where even the tiniest of decisions can have an impact on the plot. In a world with so many places to explore and characters to meet, it’s little wonder that sometimes the smallest things can lead to unforeseen consequences. From unexpected quests to surprising allies for the final battle, Baldur’s Gate 3 really does deliver on the promise that choices matter.\n[Warning: This article contains spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3.]\nBaldur’s Gate 3 hurtles straight into the action, with the player character immediately fending off an apparent mind flayer plot. Throughout their journey, right the way through to the end of Baldur’s Gate 3, it is up to the party to navigate the complex world and save Faerûn. Whether it be speaking to a particular NPC, handing over an item to the wrong person or exploring secret areas in Baldur’s Gate 3, there is always something new to uncover.\nRelated: \"An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas\": Baldur's Gate 3 Review\nUsually, poking around someone’s home or private space isn’t a good idea, but there are some interesting things to be learned about Kagha for those to happen to be a little more inquisitive. Sneaking around the library just off the main area with Kagha and Rath will reveal that tucked behind a bookcase is Kagha’s secret personal chest. Unlocking it will reveal a note and a book that starts a new quest to investigate the Grove’s latest leader. This new question puts Kagha’s actions into context and opens up new dialogue not just when she is confronted but also when Halsin returns.\nA simple act of kindness can lead to something much more beneficial, especially where the tiefling children are concerned. Helping any of the kids while in the Druid Grove, such as saving Arabella from Kagha or Mirkon from the harpies, will get the party an invitation to meet Mol. Mol has taken the rest of the orphaned children under her wing and will offer her thanks for helping them as well as make herself available as a vendor. Even better though, helping the kids will mean that Mol likes you, which comes in handy at the start of Act 2, where she will speak up for the party to Jaheira when first arriving at the Last Light Inn.\nSpeak with animals is an amazing spell taken to brilliant new levels in Baldur’s Gate 3. Every animal has something to say and all wonderfully voice acted. While speaking with the various animals found along the Sword Coast will often provide extra insight into the world, the strange ox in the Druid Grove is something else entirely. This peculiar beast is clearly not what it seems, but speaking to it at first will yield no answers.\nRelated: How To Talk To Animals in Baldur's Gate 3\nIt is only after running into this particular ox again in Act Two that more knowledge is gained, with the ox giving the party terrible flashbacks to its crimes. However, the real twist comes in Act 3 when the ox requests passage into Baldur’s Gate in apple form. Doing this will gain the party not only Shapeshifter's Boon Ring, which pairs well with the Mask of the Shapeshifter to give +1d4 bonus to all ability checks, but the ox will also appear just before the final battle with the Netherbrain as an unexpected ally.\nWhen first entering the Druid Grove in Act 1, the party will come across three siblings having an argument about whether or not to stay. The sister, Lia, wants to stay and help fight, while Rolan wants to leave. Here, the party can intervene and take a side; however, if Lia is sided with, more quests will be available further into Baldur’s Gate 3.\nIn Act Two, Rolan can be met again, where it is revealed that he helped save the tiefling children from the cultists of the Absolute. His siblings have been taken, though, and if they are rescued, and Rolan survives the Shadow-Cursed Lands, he can be met again in Act Three. This time, Rolan will be working in Lorrokan’s shop and can be persuaded to turn on his new master if his siblings were saved in Act 2. Strangely, in the simple act of settling an argument between siblings, children are saved, and a new ally can be gained.\nVenturing into an owlbear cave might not seem like the best of ideas, but any party determined to explore every inch of the map in Act 1 will no doubt have stumbled across this area. Inside a mother owlbear will fiercely protect her young, and the sensible thing to do might be to leave before a fight starts. However, if the mother is killed, then her baby can be found again at the Goblin Camp, where he can be coaxed into joining the team and following the party to camp. Doing so not only gives the group one of the cutest characters that can join the camp but also a great boost in the final battle in Act 3.\nRomances play a significant part in Baldur's Gate 3, with there even being options for polyamory. However, two characters who are most definitely not willing to share with each other are Lae'zel and Shadowheart. One decision to be careful with for those planning to romance the cleric of Shar is that any 'evenings' with Lae'zel could complicate this. Lae'zel will be very forward with her intentions toward the player character, and it is possible to sleep with her before forming a deeper relationship. However, doing so will lock out Shadowheart from being romanced if the relationship is not ended before the camp celebration in Act 1.\nWhen arriving in the Last Light Inn at the very beginning of Act 2, the party will almost immediately be sent to speak with Isobel, a cleric of Selune, by Jaheira. This seems like a simple matter of getting her blessing before venturing out into the Shadow-Cursed Land. However, speaking to Isobel will trigger an attack by the Absolute’s forces, led by former Flaming Fist Marcus.\nAs the Inn itself will be the focus of the attack, there are many NPCs crammed in there who can die during the fight, such as Rolan, Art Cullagh, and even Halsin, and this can lead to some quests ending prematurely. There is also the issue of Isobel herself; if she is killed or knocked out during the battle, it will doom everyone in the area as the shield keeping the curse at bay will fall. So, while chatting with Isobel might seem like the obvious choice, it is best to avoid her room to keep everyone safe in the long run.\nWhen venturing into the Mountain Pass area, the party will meet Lady Esther, a member of the Society of Brilliance, who will ask the party to retrieve a githyanki egg for her. There are a few ways to complete this quest by either giving her what she wants or giving her an owlbear egg. However, if either egg is handed over, the Society of Brilliance in Baldur’s Gate is doomed as both the hatched githyanki or the owlbear will kill everyone in their lodge.\nThere is a chance to visit a Zhentarim hideout during Act 1 and meet a captured artist named Oskar. He will thank the party for their assistance if freed and promise a reward when they finally reach Baldur’s Gate. This seems to be the end of it; however, when Oskar is met again in Act 3, things have gone terribly wrong.\nRescuing Oskar can snowball into a much longer questline, which will lead the party to cross paths with the Mystic Carrion, a mummy lord living in Baldur’s Gate. This, in turn, will lead to its own quest as some of the Mystic’s servants have run away. There is some great loot and lore from both of these questlines that all start with one chat in Act 1.\nOne of the smallest decisions in Baldur’s Gate 3 that can lead to massive implications is Raphael’s deal in Act 3. While the choice to free Prince Orpheus or help the Emperor might seem like a big decision, on the grand cosmic scale, it isn’t that important. Both will aid the party in much the same way when facing the Netherbrain.\nHowever, it is what Raphael wants that makes this decision’s consequences matter. In exchange for the Orphic Hammer, Raphael wants the Crown of Karsus and he makes it very clear that he wishes to rule the Nine Hells. An after-credits cutscene with Raphael further drives home the true implications of this decision as it becomes obvious that Raphael has no intention of stopping with the Nine Hells, meaning that the hero of Baldur’s Gate 3 has doomed millions with the stroke of a pen.\n"}
{"title": "13 Jokers: DC Just Doubled-Down On Controversial THREE JOKERS Comic with a Dark Twist", "date": "2023-10-05 20:31:26", "text": "Talk about Jokers running wild! One cackling villain ups the ante and creates even more copies of himself during his final showdown with his copycat.\nWarning! Spoilers ahead for The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #11!Fans who thought three Jokers were enough might want to prepare themselves. As two Clown Princes of Crime wage war, one goes all out by making an entire army of grinning doppelgangers with a devious purpose.\nIn The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #11 by Matthew Rosenberg, Carmine Di Giandomenico, and Romulo Fajardo Jr., Gotham is going to hell in a handbasket as the Gotham and LA Jokers continue their epic war against each other. Gotham's Joker and his crew roll up on a poor custodian and kidnap him, adding him to the collection of other victims that the Joker has snatched.\nAs chaos reigns throughout the city, Ravager and Manhunter run into each other, stumbling upon the van the Joker's gang was driving, now empty. They track the Joker down to his lair and attempt to take him out. Though Joker gets the better of Manhunter, Ravager shoots the villain in the shoulder. With no other option, Joker retreats and pulls out an unexpected surprise. He reveals his kidnapping victims have all been surgically altered to resemble the Joker. Even worse, they've also become living bombs that Joker detonates in his getaway.\nThe DC Universe has been haunted by dual Jokers for the past few months. One Joker moved out to Los Angeles, intent on expanding his criminal endeavors across the entire nation. But another remained in Gotham, trying to recover after being shot in the head and suffering gaps in his memory as a result. Both Harlequins of Hate were certain that they were the original, but Gotham's Joker finally regained his memory and remembered the impostor Joker was actually a former henchman that had been poisoned by Joker venom and surgically altered to resemble the Joker.\nEver since the publication of the Black Label miniseries Three Jokers, copies of the iconic villain have become an increasingly common sight. DC has even introduced a new villain known as Red Mask who can create Jokers on a whim. However, the latest batch of clowns doesn't seem to be intended as anything more than a trump card for Gotham's Joker. He used one doppelganger to attack LA's Joker and experienced a reluctance to use his victims on Ravager and Manhunter. Gotham's Joker likely wanted to take his copycat out in the most ironic way possible by killing him with other false Jokers.\nWhether he's the real one or not, Gotham's Joker has taken umbrage at another Joker existing in the DCU. Gotham's Joker swore he'd win in the end, and it looks like his final move was intended to put an end to the entire copycat Joker movement. It's a pretty creative manner of killing: It's violent, attention-grabbing, and essentially says LA's Joker was a fake like all the rest. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like Gotham's Joker will get the chance to use this creative method of execution. Seeing more than one Joker might be wearing thin for some, but this is a hell of a closing act for the multiple Joker shtick. The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #11 is on sale now.\n"}
{"title": "16 Biggest Changes Twilight's Movies Made To The Books", "date": "2023-10-05 20:31:27", "text": "The Twilight Saga brought Edward and Bella's story to life, but for that, it made a lot of changes to the books – some good and others not so much.\nThe Twilight Saga brought Stephenie Meyer's novel series to life, but turning a book into a movie is always hard work, and the movies made many changes to the books. With the series spanning four lengthy books, there's a lot of ground to cover in the world of Twilight, so it's not surprising that the writers and directors of the Twilight Saga had to change some things from the novels or completely leave plot points out.\nAlthough the Twilight movies were mostly loyal to the source material, which was key to their success with fans of the books, it also made some changes that weren’t well-received. The Twilight Saga either changed how some key scenes happened, left important information and context out, or completely skipped some scenes due to time constraints. Because of this, there are a couple of moments in the Twilight Saga that are better explained or developed in the Twilight books and which could have improved the movies, while others are exclusive to the movies and actually benefited them.\nRelated: Twilight Movies In Order: What Is The Second & Third Movie To Watch\nWhen it comes to book adaptations, many directors work closely with costume designers to create accessories that will distinguish one character from another or give the character personality. That was the case for the Cullen Crest, which even though is never mentioned in the books, features prominently throughout the films. Each Cullen family member wore their own version of it – for example, Edward's cuff, Rosalie's necklace, and Alice's thin choker all feature the family symbol.\nWhile this may seem like a small addition to the Twilight franchise, it's an important and symbolic one. With the Cullen family constantly being apart for different reasons, the Cullen Crest is the one thing that unifies them as a family, as they always have a piece of each other with them.\nOne of the most interesting things about the Cullens is that they're \"vegetarians\", which in the Twilight universe means that they don't drink human blood, and instead feed from the blood of animals – however, not every Cullen family member has led a vegetarian lifestyle. In his early years as a vampire, Edward rejected Carlisle's way of life by turning to human blood. In the books, Edward tells Bella about how he used to seek out criminals and kill them early on, but in the movies, this happens the night before their wedding.\nWhile viewers are consistently treated to the same tune by Carter Burwell throughout the Twilight movies, it's never blatantly stated that this is Bella's song, known as \"Bella's Lullaby\". It's only when Edward and Bella are seen sitting at the piano in Twilight that it's assumed Edward is playing \"Bella's Lullaby\" to her. In the books, Edward hums the song to Bella multiple times throughout the series, which doesn't happen in the movies.\nThroughout the Twilight Saga, viewers are treated to the backstories of Carlisle, Rosalie, and Jasper, but there's one crucial story that was left out completely: Alice's. In the books, readers find out the tragic backstory of Alice Cullen, from the early development of her powers to her time in a mental institution and her transformation into a vampire. Alice's backstory does have an impact on Twilight, as she was hunted by James years before.\nRelated: Twilight: How (And Why) All Of The Cullens Were Turned Into Vampires\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part Two is based around the Cullen Clan's impending fight with the Volturi in defense of Renesmee. In the books, the fight ends up being a peaceful encounter, but the movie did something different and controversial. Breaking Dawn 2 saw an all-out brawl between the Cullens and their allies against the Volturi that resulted in the deaths of some favorite characters like Carlisle, Leah, and Seth – but before viewers can process the massacre, it's revealed that all that was nothing more than Alice's premonition, so none of it actually happened.\nOne of the major plot points of New Moon is Bella engaging in reckless behavior in order to hear Edward's voice following their breakup. In the movie, Bella takes a joyride with a stranger on his motorcycle after a night at the movies with Jessica, but in the books, Bella spots the group of men who had ill intentions during her night in Port Angeles in Twilight, and as she approaches them, she hears Edward's voice for the first time.\nEclipse is widely regarded as the best book and movie in the Twilight series, in large part due to the introduction of the newborn army and the battle against these vampires led by Victoria. However, in the books, readers learn very little of the strategy of the newborn army, while in the movie, viewers get a behind-the-scenes look at Victoria's master plan.\nThose on Edward's side got a lot of joy out of Bella punching Jacob in the face after he kissed her in Eclipse, and while this scene stayed relatively true to the book, Bella and Jacob's second kiss didn't. Instead of Bella catching up to Jacob after he runs away, Edward is the one who brings Jacob back after he finds out that Edward and Bella are engaged. In addition to that, Edward and Bella are in the tent when they discuss their upcoming nuptials, and not outside.\nEdward's official proposal went great, but the first one wasn't exactly a romantic dream. In the movie, Edward proposes to Bella after he, Jacob, and Bella get into an argument in the woods, but in the book, Edward's proposal takes place in Edward's room, and Bella initially thinks he is joking.\nOne of the most iconic scenes in the whole Twilight series is when Bella tells Edward that she knows he's a vampire, but the movie version of this moment is completely different from the book one. Rather than taking to the ominous woodsy area of Forks, Bella finds out Edward is a vampire before her Port Angeles attack and reveals her knowledge in Edward's car.\nThe Twilight Saga depicted Bella as a loner, and though she had some human friends, like Jessica, Angela, Mike, and Eric, she didn’t spend much time with them. This is completely different in the books, where Bella’s friends have a bigger presence as she actually spends time with them rather than just being focused on Edward. This was a harmful change to the Twilight books, as the movies made it seem like Edward was isolating Bella from her friends, which is a huge red flag in their relationship.\nThroughout the Twilight Saga, Charlie and Bella are seen eating at a diner, but in the books, Bella actually cooked for Charlie. While this might seem like an unimportant detail, it’s actually key to Bella and Charlie’s dynamic, as well as to understanding Bella. When Bella learns Charlie can’t cook, she decides to cook for him, informing the reader that, as her mother often required care, she took on some of the responsibilities of an adult, such as cooking for others. It shows how protective Bella is of her loved ones, and adds some sweetness to her relationship with her father.\nBella and Edward’s first kiss in the Twilight movie was a lot steamier than in the book. In the source material, Edward and Bella kiss for the first time when they return to her truck after hiking to the meadow, with Bella reacting enthusiastically to it. The movie turned up the intensity and instead set Bella and Edward’s kiss in Bella’s room, with Bella only wearing a t-shirt and underwear. Bella escalates the kiss to make it more passionate, with Edward pulling back to control himself.\nTwilight ends on a cliffhanger as Victoria is revealed to be watching Bella and Edward at their prom, setting her up as a big villain in the sequels. This scene is exclusive to the movie, as in the book, Victoria never shows up at the prom – and had she done so, any of the Cullens in attendance would have immediately sensed her presence, which would have put everyone else in great danger.\nRelated: What Happened To The Original Victoria From Twilight?\nAs mentioned above, the Twilight Saga made it look as if Edward was isolating Bella, adding to complaints about the toxic relationship between Edward and Bella, but in the books, she actually focused on other areas of her life, too. In the books, Bella actually made plans to attend college, and Edward was very supportive of this. In Eclipse, Bella got accepted into the University of Alaska, and in Breaking Dawn, Bella decided to attend for a year after getting married and remain human – however, these plans changed when she got pregnant. Still, it shows that Bella wanted a lot more than to become a vampire, and Edward was supportive of her plans to have more human experiences.\nImprinting in the Twilight universe has caused a lot of controversy, mostly because Jacob imprinted on Bella’s child, Renesmee. While this is disturbing in both the books and the movie, in the source material it’s less creepy thanks to the explanation of what imprinting really is about. This, arguably, made the “Jacob imprinted on Renesmee” situation endearing, while in the movie, it became not just one of the most disturbing moments in the Twilight Saga but also one of the most mocked ones thanks to Bella’s over-the-top (but understandable) reaction.\n\n"}
{"title": "“Choose Nepotism”: Trainspotting Parody Video Retargets Opening Satire To Perfection", "date": "2023-10-05 20:34:39", "text": "UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak chooses nepotism in a Trainspotting parody that targets the iconic opening satire of the government's scandals.\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and other politicians appear in a Trainspotting parody that retargets the movie's iconic opening satire to perfection. Danny Boyle's 1996 adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel followed a group of misfits in Edinburgh played by Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremmer, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, Peter McKullan, and Robert Carlyle. Trainspotting is celebrated for its glimpse at substance addiction in the youth subculture, with the movie also launching McGregor and Boyle into widespread recognition.\nFollowing recent policy announcements made during the UK Conservative Party Conference that included the scrapping of the high-speed railway construction project HS2, PoliticsJOE has taken inspiration from the controversial decision and reimagined Trainspotting's recognizable opening sequences with Sunak and former Conservative Prime Ministers Liz Truss, Boris Johnson, Theresa May, and David Cameron in \"Trainstopping.\"\nIn Sunak's new monologue, the current Prime Minister looks back on his own tenure full of inconsistent policies and lobbying accusations, alongside other recent controversies, including Truss's short tenure, Johnson's neglectful mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic, May's handling of the Windrush Scandal, and Cameron's Black Mirror-Esque Pig scandal. Other key UK political figures, including RMT Union Leader Mick Lynch and former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, are also imposed into the opening, having to endure the group's antics.\nPoliticsJOE's history of biting political pop culture mashups extends far beyond their recent Trainspotting parody. The channel has approached major political events with many parodies of iconic songs and television shows. From imagining Johnson's chaotic resignation as Goodfellas' \"Meet the Crew\" monologue, placing Sunak's rise to Prime Minister into the opening of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and current Labour leader Keir Starmer's ever-changing stances as The Jungle Book's \"I Want To Be Like You,\" the YouTube channel has provided humorous videos that capture ongoing issues affecting both the UK and the world.\nHowever, what makes PoliticsJOE's newest parody stand out is how \"Trainstopping\" looks compared to the original Trainspotting monologue. The fast-paced nature perfectly encapsulates the chaotic changes brought through the current Conservative government since 2010. Sunak's reimagined dialogue lists what the UK political landscape has become, similar to how Renton's (McGregor) original monologue is about how he views ordinary life. Furthermore, it concludes with Renton (McGregor) stating he chooses to take heroin, as Sunak's dialogue states how the Prime Minister framed himself as cleaning up his party's many controversies but instead chose to let them persist.\nPoliticsJOE's Trainspotting parody is a darkly comedic encapsulation of the UK's current state. Not only is the title a fun play on the Conservative Party's derided HS2 choice, but Sunak's monologue features a wide range of biting jabs at the government's tenure dating back to Cameron's election. As such, \"Trainstopping\" is a quick, memorable remix of Boyle's iconic sequence that entertains and informs viewers.\nSource: PoliticsJOE\n"}
{"title": "Kody Proves He’s Moving On From Plural Marriage By Making Major Change", "date": "2023-10-05 20:41:05", "text": "Kody Brown is moving on from his polygamous past. The Sister Wives star embraces his new monogamous life with Robyn Brown by taking a huge step.\nKody Brown from Sister Wives replaced his Claddagh ring with a new one, showing he’s confident about moving away from polygamy. The 54-year-old Brown family patriarch married four women in the last three decades, hoping to build one big family. However, he couldn’t sustain them forever and eventually fell into a monogamous relationship with his youngest wife, Robyn Brown. During Sister Wives season 18, Kody split up from Janelle Brown a year after losing Christine Brown. Kody also ended things with Meri Brown, for whom he felt no love over the last few years.\nET recently shared a preview clip from Sister Wives season 18, which shows Kody confidently flashing his new symbol of monogamy. The reality star is sitting across from his former wife Meri and his current (and only) wife Robyn. As Meri speaks to them about her plans to move away, she spots a new ring on her former husband’s hand and points it out.\nShe says, “Sorry, I am distracted by your ring. That’s a different ring.” While Kody laughs it off and says it was just a “ring,” Meri reminds the cameras that he used to wear another one. She notes, “I did notice that it was replacing the Claddagh ring we all used to wear together.”\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\n\nMeri is shocked to see the change but isn't bothered about it. She is confused about why Kody was smirking about the ring and making things awkward at the table. The 52-year-old Sister Wives star tells the cameras, “It’s weird that he is being so awkward about it. Like, if he doesn’t want me to see the ring, don’t wear it to my house.” Kody simply chuckles during the clip, like a kid who gets caught stealing cookies. However, Meri isn't impressed by his behavior. She adds, “I have no idea what this ring is or where it came from.” Meri claims she doesn't care where the ring came from.\nIt’s clear why Meri was surprised to see Kody’s new ring. The Sister Wives cast member was Kody’s first wife and had been with him for years. She assumed he would never change the Claddagh ring representing their polygamous relationship. However, Kody did the unthinkable by replacing the symbol of plural marriage. One possible reason for this change could be his newfound monogamous relationship with Robyn. Kody is no longer with Christine, Janelle, or Meri. Therefore, he has no reason to wear the Claddagh ring, as it doesn’t represent anything meaningful to him.\nWhile Meri claimed she wasn’t jealous or cared about Kody’s new piece of jewelry, she certainly seemed bothered by it. It’s clear that she was shocked by the change, but she shouldn’t have pointed it out. She should have known that her relationship with Kody wasn’t the same as it was years ago. Meri and Kody’s relationship went downhill after Meri fell for a catfish online. She stepped out of the marriage by committing emotional infidelity. If the Sister Wives star had been faithful to the rules of her marriage, Kody might still be with her as her husband.\nSister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT on TLC.\nSource: ET/YouTube\n"}
{"title": "Pet Sematary: Bloodlines Review - A Bland Prequel Despite An Intriguing Premise", "date": "2023-10-05 20:41:17", "text": "The film will resonate with the people eager to devour more Stephen King-inspired projects; sadly, there is nothing genuinely inspired to enjoy.\nIn 2019, the Pet Sematary remake was released. Directed by Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer and written by Jeff Buhler, the remake revisited the Creed family with a few minor tweaks that ultimately did not stray too far away from the original plot of the 1989 film. The consensus was that while the film had an updated look, the resurrected story offered very little. Pet Sematary: Bloodlines, a direct prequel to the novel and the 2019 film, follows young Jud Crandall as he discovers the cemetery where the dead don’t stay dead 50 years before meeting the Creeds.\nThe one aspect that seems to indicate the underlying intentions of Pet Sematary: Bloodlines' existence is the attempt to rectify the simplistic explanation of the burial ground that reanimates dead people and animals. There is an attempt to flesh out the history of the damned burial site, but the film doesn’t fully reckon with the reality that Stephen King and plenty of other horror writers rely on the audience's willful ignorance to explain away any spooky thing as being a byproduct of Indigenous peoples' history and culture.\nThere is a point where a case could be made for a Prey-esque prequel that solely revolves around the perspectives of the Mi’kmaq tribe, whose lands were invaded by the Europeans who would build Ludlow. There is a story to be told of how this burial ground came to be a source of terror for the town's residents. Instead, the film splits its attention, giving focus to the story of Jud Crandall, a character who didn't need to be explained or understood. At the same time, the general explanation of the “pet sematary” history is a protracted flashback.\nPrequels are a reality we cannot overcome. Still, there is a sad expectation that we are somehow incapable of inferring a character's past without being explicitly told in detail all that happened before the start of a story. Somehow, filmmakers (and audiences, as a result) can't accept that a story may have many other beginnings. It is one thing to have a prequel that expands our knowledge of the dynamics and world that made the story we enjoyed so intriguing, but it's an entirely different thing to focus on an inconsequential character. Jud Crandall was an interesting character with a history connected to the supernatural burial ground that predates Louis Creed and his family. But what exactly is there to learn or experience that makes Crandall’s story worth exploring in the first place? That question often goes unanswered with many unwarranted prequels, and Pet Sematary: Bloodlines fails to raise any compelling points.\nScreenwriters Jeff Buhler and Lindsey Anderson Beer, who also directed, do their best with what they have, but Buhler’s previous writing efforts on Pet Sematary didn’t manage to elevate the source material impressively, and there is nothing much to speak of for Bloodlines, either. The scares are palpable; Beer does a good job crafting an unsettling horror that has the right amount of gore and creepy ambiance. The cast is effective in their respective roles, but Forrest Goodluck and Isabella Star LaBlanc are underserved as they could easily have carried the entire film. Pam Grier is always a delight to see, but her talents are not utilized as well as they could have been. The story never manages to be as lively as it needs to be to justify its existence, but the cast attempts to make up for that with committed performances. Sadly, the film is rather dull, lacking in genuine suspense or intrigue.\nDespite some good instincts from Beer, the material is too constricting, denying the director the chance to expand her ideas or take turns that might alienate fans expecting a movie that answers questions no one was really asking. Mythology is certainly fascinating to explore when it comes to established horror that begins with an inexplicable idea, but there is hardly anything worth digging up here. In addition to the bland story, the film isn’t all too impressive to watch. There is a flatness to the cinematography, which is unfortunate considering Benjamin Kirk Nielsen has recently done great work. Tonally, the film is a tad bit gratifying for fans of King and his atmospheric horror. The darkness permeating over these characters and town is effectively realized, and the frights are effective.\nPet Sematary: Bloodlines is mercifully shorter than the 2019 film, but it still needed trimming. There have been worse straight-to-streaming horror films, and Pet Sematary: Bloodlines is hardly the worst among them. Memorable? Hardly. Entertaining? Somewhat. Ultimately, the film will resonate with the people eager to devour more Stephen King-inspired projects; sadly, there is nothing genuinely inspired to enjoy.\nPet Sematary: Bloodlines begins streaming on Paramount+ Friday, October 6. The film is 84 minutes long and rated R for horror violence, gore and language.\nFerdosa (she/her) is a lifelong student of cinema. She dreams of being a film festival programmer and is working her way towards that goal by consuming a concerning number of films every week."}
{"title": "Walking Dead Writer Admits One Sexist Moment Is Still 'Cringe-Worthy'", "date": "2023-10-05 20:45:12", "text": "Creator and writer of The Walking Dead Robert Kirkman acknowledges a sexist scene in the original series, and one he would change if written today.\nRobert Kirkman's The Walking Dead is a landmark series in the apocalypse genre, as a story not only about zombies, but human survival in the face of impossible odds. It's also a story that's been criticized for its depiction of women--and even Kirkman admits that there is one particular moment in the series he still finds \"cringe-worthy.\"\nThe Walking Dead Deluxe is a re-release of the original Walking Dead series, first published in 2004, with never before seen content and valuable creator commentary providing insight into a few of author Robert Kirkman's character decisions. This glimpse into Kirkman's creative process, specifically his decision-making when it comes to writing female characters, highlights one scene in need of revisiting.\nThe scene in question arrives in The Walked Dead #3, in which two of the three women excitedly discuss laundry detergent on their way to washing the survivors' clothes. Donna angrily points out the disparity in the men hunting and women cleaning, with Lori Grimes dismissing the sexism, and excusing it as \"being realistic.\" \nRelated: Walking Dead: Carl Losing His Eye Foreshadows His Tragic Future\nIn Walking Dead Deluxe #3, Kirkman notes this scene as \"cringe-worthy,\" explaining he would make different decisions today (intending to give the women the maximum amount of space to grow as the story progressed). These interpersonal interactions do indeed evolve some of these people into hardened and lethal survivors, eventually joining Michonne's level. Regardless of Kirkman's authorial intent the scene in both the comic series and the TV show caused backlash.\n\"Did I need a full page of the female characters talking about doing laundry while the men hunted? Probably not....I was going to take the female characters in some interesting directions as the series progressed. So starting them here would give me a lot of room to grow and evolve along the way. Anyway I was 23 when I started writing this comic so this is definitely not the last cringe-worthy thing (for me at least) that I wrote into this book. I'd have handled things a little differently had I written it today. I'd have maybe had Allen or Jim help with the laundry.\"\nBecause Walking Dead has so much exposure in the cultural zeitgeist, it means the more questionable scenes are open to critiques from the fans, a fact Kirkman acknowledges. To many fans the scene demonstrates that even in a zombie apocalypse the patriarchal structure endures. Kirkman has said in the past that he's not a political writer and doesn't want his work to be read as such, but he also understands that because of the platform he's been given with Walking Dead, people are going to read what they want into it. Understandably, some fans might find this scene hard to enjoy due to its parallels to the non-zombified reality, where, with a few exceptions, men are in charge of almost every group, faction, colony or community and women get few moments to shine in grisly combat.\nIt's clear that the scene in question was meant to be a commentary on the state of society, both in the world of The Walking Dead and our own. Whether or not it was in good taste has typically been up to the fans to decide. It wasn't until Robert Kirkman's creative commentary in the Walking Dead Deluxe #3 that there was a confirmation on his own gendered bias, calling the scene \"cringe-worthy.\" This isn't the only instance of Kirkman's personal feelings featured in the series, but it is one of the first times he's acknowledged the faults of an early creative decision.\nThe Walking Dead Deluxe is available now from Skybound wherever comic books are sold.\nNext: Walking Dead's 'Don't Dead Open Inside' Originally Had a Different Purpose\nEmily Stachelczyk is a Comics News writer for Screen Rant. Ever since she accidentally read Joss Wheddon's Astonishing X-Men in middle school she's loved dissecting comic books ever since. Although her career is in SEO project management, Emily loves to write about all things comics and Marvel.

{"title": "Does The Exorcist: Believer Have A Post-Credits Scene?", "date": "2023-10-05 21:00:27", "text": "The Exorcist: Believer is the start of a new trilogy of movies, so is there a post-credits scene teasing the sequels and future of the franchise?\nThe Exorcist franchise is at the start of a new potential trilogy, but does The Exorcist: Believer have a post-credits scene teasing future installments? The 2023 horror movie is a direct sequel to the original 1973 movie that does not connect to any of the previous sequels or prequels. The Exorcist: Believer continues the story nearly 50 years after Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) and her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) encountered a demon. The sequel sees Chris recruited by Victor Fielding (Leslie Odom Jr.) to help free two young girls from demonic possession.\nIn addition to being a sequel to The Exorcist, the new entry is planned to be the first installment of a new trilogy of movies. This means that by the time that The Exorcist: Believer's ending comes to a close, some clues about where the franchise is going next have been revealed. One of the most common tactics studios use to set up future movies that have already been announced is to include mid-credits or after-credits scenes. So with multiple other movies already planned, here's if audiences should expect to see a The Exorcist: Believer post-credits scene.\nRelated: How Much Exorcist: Believer Cost To Make & What Box Office It Needs\nIt is confirmed that The Exorcist: Believer does not have a post-credits scene. The movie does not include any additional scenes or teases at any point during the credits, meaning audiences will not see a mid-credits scene or end-credits scene in tehaters or when The Exorcist: Believer releases on streaming. Not including the tag is surprising considering The Exorcist: Deceiver has already been announced. While audiences do not need to wait for an after-credits scene now, sitting through the credits still is a great way to show respect for the writers, actors, and other people who made The Exorcist: Believer.\nBy not including an after-credits scene with The Exorcist: Believer, Universal and director David Gordon Green have taken the safer approach to building out the franchise. There have already been announcements for two more movies, but details on The Exorcist: Deceiver and the untitled third installment are still largely under wraps. The 2023 horror movie not having a post-credits scene means that the franchise can evolve naturally and make corrections based on The Exorcist: Believer's reception from critics and audiences. This also prevents the franchise from being written into a corner or potentially ignoring the tease altogether.\nJust because there is no post-credits scene after The Exorcist: Believer, that does not mean audiences will leave the movie without any indication on where the franchise is going. The final moments of the movie does help provide some insight into what could come next for the main characters. It is through this ending that a rough blueprint for how the trilogy will unfold comes to light. An end-credits scene after The Exorcist: Believer could have been redundant in this case, so it works better that the movie does not have one.\n"}
{"title": "Peanuts: 10 Best Peppermint Patty and Marcie Moments", "date": "2023-10-05 21:00:27", "text": "These best buds could not be more opposite, but Peppermint Patty and Marcie have some hilarious best-friend moments in these Peanuts strips.\nMarcie and Peppermint Patty became a dynamic duo in 1971, as Marcie made her Peanuts debut when the pair were seen at camp together. However, Marcie did not originally have a name, and she didn't receive one until some time later. The two didn't form the warmest bond right away, with Peppermint Patty calling Marcie a dork shortly after meeting. Regardless, they end up sharing a close friendship that configures Marcie as Peppermint Patty's sidekick and best friend.\nPeppermint Patty and Marcie offer very different personalties, making them an example of the tried and true comic trope of the big personality and the straight man, respectively. Positioning Peppermint Patty, who is outgoing, sporty, and extroverted, as a foil to the bookish and sweet Marcie provides endless funny situations for the girls to share — and for their fans to experience. They may be very different people, but one thing they have in common is their loyalty and devoted friendship. Here are 10 moments that celebrate their iconic friendship.\nRelated: 10 Funniest Peanuts Comics Starring Lucy\nMarcie is not the best at sports, as this strip clearly points out. She stands in stark contrast to the athletic, sports-loving Peppermint Patty. Marcie is very smart about a number of subjects, but sports is not one of them. Peppermint Patty, being the helpful pal that she is, tries to teach Marcie how to kick a ball. Things don't go as Patty planned and Marcie finds her own way of playing.\nFinding the humor in everything thanks to her good nature, Marcie finds her clumsy attempt at sports funny. Based on Patty's unsettled expression, the audience can guess that she does feel the same.\nMarcie loves school. On the other hand, Peppermint Patty does not. In fact, she hates school, and she is exceptionally lazy when it comes to her education. In Peanuts, it's been established that Patty frequently sleeps during class, which has been attributed to her dad coming home late from work and Patty waiting up for him. Regardless, Patty's attitude towards school is the polar opposite to Marcie's; Marcie is high achieving and loves to learn.\nWhen Marcie has to go to the principal's office, she claims innocence, only for Patty to reply that sleeping during class ensures not getting in trouble. It often annoys Marcie that Patty doesn't try very hard at school, so it seems unlikely that Marcie will take her friend's words seriously.\nA sports fanatic Marcie is not. Although, there is one sports superstar that Marcie is well aware of and is an active fan of: tennis player Billie Jean King. The former worldwide number-one tennis player, King is often referred to as one of the best tennis players of all time. She is also an advocate for women in sports and LGBTQ+ rights.\nA major tennis star in the '60s and '70s, King's popularity in the era's zeitgeist was immense, making her way into the Peanuts comics strip. Marcie and Peppermint Patty are huge fans of King, with Patty even threatening to never introduce her to the tennis star if she doesn't help Patty with women in sports. Too bad for Patty, Marcie pokes holes in her threats, leaving Patty desperate for a change of topic — even if from the teacher.\nAll best friends look out for each other, including by giving some much-needed style advice. As readers of the Peanuts strip know, Marcie's eyes are almost always obscured by her glasses. In this strip, Peppermint Patty thinks Marcie's eyes deserve to be seen and that putting her glasses on her head will make her look sophisticated.\nUnfortunately for Marcie, she needs those glasses on her eyes to see, sophisticated or not. What ensues is unsurprising; Marcie takes her glasses off and moments later walks directly into a tree. As helpful as Patty tries to be, she's better off sticking to sports tips than fashion advice.\nSports-challenged Marcie may not be a jock like Peppermint Patty, but there is one major exception: hockey. Marcie's grandfather plays in a hockey league, and, as noted in the strip, she and her father go to hockey games. While hockey is one of the very few sports Marcie is somewhat familiar with, she is still pretty clueless about some basic parts of the game. For instance, she thinks a hockey rink is called a hockey court.\nCorrecting her friend, Patty tells her it's a rink only for Marcie to get mixed up even further and call a basketball court a basketball rink. Marcie may excel at many subjects and even different languages, but she cannot seem to get a grasp on sports — something that is endlessly frustrating to Patty.\nMarcie and Peppermint Patty have one of the best friendships in the entirety of the Peanuts strip. They are endlessly loyal to each other and are always each other's first pick for everything. As tight-knit as the pair are, they are complete inverses to each other when it comes to sports. There is the all around athletic, competitive Patty who differs greatly from Marcy, whose vast knowledge does not extend to sports.\nWhen asked by Patty to fetch her a driver and ball, Marcy gives her a driver with no hesitation or issue. However, when it comes to which ball to give her friend, Marcie stumbles hard and hands her a soccer ball instead of a golf ball.\nA bookworm of the highest order, Marcie loves to read and learn, which could not be in more opposition to Peppermint Patty. Marcie can speak French fluently and is well-read on many subjects... except for sports. Apparently, the little intellectual is also knowledgeable about the Book of Proverbs, reciting one to a perplexed Patty.\nThe ancient writing of the Book of Proverbs would be hard for most adults to grasp, let alone a child. As a result, it's not hard to blame Peppermint Patty for having no clue what she's repeating. Patty is lucky to have a best bud like Marcie who can always help her out when she's in some academic jam.\nMarcie may be sweet and unassuming, but that doesn't mean that she isn't immune to fighting with her best friend. With two pals who spend as much time together as these, it's only natural for them to clash from time to time, as evident in this strip. When Marcie questions if Patty didn't do her homework yet again, Peppermint Patty gets defensive and complains about being called \"sir.\"\nNot one to back down, Marcie intentionally calls her \"sir\" over and over until Peppermint Patty can take no more and hits her friend on the head with a book. Some hair pulling ensues and the two girls are sent to the principal's office. Marcie, instead of acting like any normal kid would in the situation, feels elated after the fight and shows no trepidation about seeing the principal, much to Peppermint Patty's annoyance and confusion.\nPeppermint Patty is ready for a sports game or a scrimmage at any time. Patty is also one to stand up for herself and others. When a peer makes fun of Patty by making a cruel joke about graduating from dog obedience school, which she was told to attend by Snoopy, Patty does not take kindly to it.\nShe delivers a line that would be just as fitting in an Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie and bops the kid right on the nose. Marcie is very impressed and voices her admiration. Although, she should be careful to not call Patty \"sir\" at the moment in case she gets a bonk on the head, too.\nPeppermint Patty is very particular about her appearance and what she likes to wear. In one show of activism, Patty fights against the school board and hires Snoopy as her attorney after her school requires her to wear a dress for the new dress code. Therefore, Patty will stick to her guns about what is right and fair, including when it regards clothing.\nPatty is not immune to mixing things up, though. When she is competing in a skating competition, she is prepared to dress the part, hairstyle included. For the competition, she wants a new hairdo and asks Marcie for help. She should've kept looking, because Marcie comes up with a style that is not the most flattering, requiring the iconic Peanuts duo to go back to the drawing board.\n"}
{"title": "Bridgerton Season 3: Release Date Prediction, Cast Changes & Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-05 21:00:28", "text": "Bridgerton season 3 is coming to Netflix. Here are the latest updates, its story details, who it'll focus on and how Queen Charlotte sets it up.\nBridgerton season 3 was confirmed several years ago, but the release date could finally be on the horizon for the Bridgerton sibling's return to Netflix. Season 1 adapted Julia Quinn's novel The Duke and I, telling the tale of Daphne Bridgerton and Simon Basset's romance. Despite being such a success with audiences, that was put on the back burner in season 2 — which doesn't feature Simon at all, although he is name-dropped occasionally — and adapts the second Bridgerton novel The Viscount Who Loved Me, focusing on Anthony Bridgerton and Kate Sharma's enemies-to-lovers storyline.\nInstead of adapting Benedict Bridgerton's story, An Offer From A Gentleman, for Bridgerton season 3, the Netflix show is making a huge switch-up and changing the order. Bridgerton season 3 will cover the fourth Bridgerton novel, Romancing Mister Bridgerton, and even then is making several alterations (as it did for seasons 1 and 2). Production on Bridgerton season 3 is already underway, and a release date announcement feels closer every day, with the added bonus of Bridgerton spin-off Queen Charlotte setting up the third mainline series in a surprising way.\nThere has been surprisingly little news on Bridgerton season 3 outside the occasional tease from cast members since filming wrapped in March 2023. However, this is likely due to both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. While production is reportedly more-or-less complete on the next season, the strike conditions also prohibit the cast from promoting their work in all but a very limited capacity.\nHowever, Bridgerton was expected to arrive in 2023 by many, so the lack of promotion for the show from Netflix by September is worrying. There's increasing concern that, due to the strikes and Netflix wanting to be able to promote it properly, the next season of Bridgerton could be delayed until 2024. However, a leaked report in August suggested the Bridgerton season 3 release date could be as soon as December 14, 2023 (via CBR). \nIt should be noted though that this date was only rumored, and since it's only a few months away the lack of promotion from Netflix doesn't seem to correlate — especially given both the popularity of the show and how long it's been since the next season of Bridgerton was confirmed in 2021.\nBridgerton season 3 is officially happening on Netflix, with the show's renewal confirmed in 2021 (via Deadline). What's more, the streamer confirmed a fourth season would also follow. Author Julia Quinn wrote eight Bridgerton books in total, one focusing on each sibling, and the hope is that each book will be adapted into a different season for TV. It's likely that Netflix will continue with the show long into the future should interest remain high.\nAt the time of writing, Bridgerton season 3's release date has not been confirmed. Bridgerton season 1 was released in December 2020, and season 2 was released in March 2022 following multiple delays due to COVID-19. The WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes assured that any production and development remaining which required an actor or writer couldn't continue throughout most of 2023, too — although filming was wrapped in March. The Bridgerton season 3 release date will likely arrive in 2024, although until Netflix confirms anything it's impossible to say with certainty.\nBridgerton season 3's cast will include most of the Bridgerton family: Jonathan Bailey as Anthony; Ruth Gemmell as Violet; Claudia Jessie as Eloise; Luke Thompson as Benedict; Luke Newton as Colin; Will Tilston as Gregory; and Florence Hunt as Hyacinth. Nicola Coughlan will, of course, be back as Penelope Featherington as the focal character of the season. The Bridgerton season 3 cast is likely to feature many other returning faces, including:\nPhoebe Dynevor's Daphne Bridgerton will not return. Dynevor did keep the door open to return in later seasons, but she will not be around in Bridgerton season 3. Some of Bridgerton's second-season cast additions, including Rupert Young as Jack Featherington and Calam Young as Theo Sharpe, are perhaps less likely to return since their stories are seemingly wrapped up.\nThere is one major casting change for Bridgerton season 3. Ruby Stokes is no longer playing younger sister Francesca Bridgerton. Stokes landed a starring role on Netflix’s Lockwood & Company, which conflicted with her recurring status in Bridgerton. Replacing her as Francesca is Hannah Dodd who recently appeared in Enola Holmes 2, also for Netflix, as Sarah Chapman. Black Sails actress Hannah New joins the series as Lady Tilley Arnold, a young widow. Daniel Francis, James Phoon, and Sam Phillips have also all joined the show for season 3.\nRelated: Bridgerton: 14 Movies & TV Shows That Feature The Cast\nMany expected the Bridgerton Netflix series to follow the order of the books, as the Bridgerton novels also begin with Daphne and Anthony’s stories. There’s been a change to the lineup, however. Instead of focusing on Benedict for Bridgerton season 3, the Netflix show will focus on Colin and Penelope. Colin and Penelope’s story makes up the fourth book in the series, Romancing Mister Bridgerton — albeit with some differences in the plot for Bridgerton season 3.\nFollowing the surprising events of Bridgerton season 2, Penelope decides that she needs to look for a husband that will allow her to get out of her mother’s house and still live her double life as Penelope and Lady Whistledown, but she doesn’t have the same level of confidence that other debutantes do. Colin, who misses Penelope’s company when she starts to ignore him at social events, offers to help her land a husband. According to Netflix’s official summary, Colin’s plan to help Penelope gain confidence might “work a little too well.”\nIn addition to Colin and Penelope’s love story unfolding, Eloise will also share some of the spotlight in the Bridgerton season 3 story. After discovering that Penelope is Lady Whistledown, Eloise wants nothing to do with her former best friend. That leaves her forging new relationships while still being present for the parties of the season.\nNicola Coughlan, who plays Penelope Featherington, teased that season 3 will be \"extremely spicy.\" (via Collider). Coughlan explained \"I mean Lady Whistledown is right at the center having to deal with all her little secrets and it gets harder and harder for those to come out and then scandalous love affairs popping up all over the place. [It's] the most scandalous one yet, I would say.\"\nBeyond the established Bridgerton sibling storylines from Bridgerton season 2, spin-off Queen Charlotte throws in the seed of a substantial storyline for Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell). She plays an important role in Queen Charlotte, playing part of the triptych of \"widows\" (including Charlotte herself who awaits King George's death), each representing different types of grief. She loved her husband dearly, and still mourns him, but begins to realize in Queen Charlotte that she may be ready to enjoy herself once more — to \"allow her garden to bloom\" again, as the show delightfully puts it.\nWhile it feels unlikely that Violet will remarry in Bridgerton season 3, there is the possibility of courtship and perhaps some liberated sexual activity to throw further scandal under the belly of the ton. And the unexpected source of that scandal, Violet, would make for a wonderfully entertaining new dynamic.\n\n"}
{"title": "Dark Side Ahsoka: Will Thrawn's Big Threat Come To Pass?", "date": "2023-10-05 21:01:38", "text": "In Ahsoka's finale, Grand Admiral Thrawn tries to use Ahsoka's relationship with Anakin against her – but he doesn't know just how much she's grown.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nGrand Admiral Thrawn implied Ahsoka could one day turn to the dark side in the Ahsoka finale, but could that ever really come to pass? Though Ahsoka never dealt with Grand Admiral Thrawn in Star Wars Rebels, she’s been chasing after him since The Mandalorian season 2, hoping to prevent him returning to Star Wars’ prime galaxy and leading the Imperial Remnant’s resurgence. She knows why Thrawn is such a fearsome adversary, just as he understands how far she’s willing to go to stop him and how powerful she truly is. He knows all this because he used to know Ahsoka’s Jedi Master, Anakin Skywalker.\nThough Thrawn confirmed he knew Anakin in Ahsoka episode 8, “Part Eight: The Jedi, the Witch, and the Warlord,” the circumstances of their meeting happened off-screen in Timothy Zahn’s canon Star Wars novel Thrawn: Alliances. Near the tail end of the Clone Wars, Thrawn and Anakin met on the planet Batuu while both were on unsanctioned missions. Thrawn was seeking information about potential allies and new technologies as a Captain of the Chiss Ascendancy, and Anakin was there to rescue his wife, Padmé Amidala. They agreed to help one another, and during their time together, Thrawn witnessed Anakin’s power and unconventional methods first-hand. Later, he was also one of the few to know of Darth Vader’s real identity, a fact which he has now weaponized to taunt Ahsoka.\nAs Ahsoka and Sabine race to catch up to Thrawn’s Star Destroyer in the Ahsoka finale, Thrawn decides to revel in his victory and opens a channel with their ship just before making the jump to hyperspace. It is during this conversation that Thrawn reveals he knew Anakin Skywalker and was aware of Darth Vader’s true identity. He says: “I know you because I knew your master. I concluded your strategies would be similar. One wonders… just how similar you might become.” The underlying threat of Thrawn’s implication is clear – he believes Ahsoka could still follow in her master’s footsteps and fall to the dark side, and that had always been one of Ahsoka’s greatest fears.\nRelated: When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline\nShe believed she abandoned Anakin when she left the Jedi Order at the end of Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 5, forcing him on a path to darkness. Ever since, she’s lamented her time with the Order, reflecting on how, instead of being taught to become a peacekeeper, she’d only ever fought in a war, being made responsible for battles and bloodshed when she was just a teenager. How could she not fear becoming someone as terrifying as Vader, when Anakin Skywalker, one of the bravest and most powerful Jedi the Order had ever known, fell victim to the temptations of the dark side as well? How could she not be afraid to fall to the dark side herself, when all she’d ever experienced as a child was violence during the Clone Wars, betrayal by those she trusted the most, and grief for her friends?\nDespite the Ahsoka show’s focus on Thrawn’s return to Star Wars’ main galaxy, it also explores Ahsoka’s growth as a character. Ahsoka episode 5, “Shadow Warrior,” sees Ahsoka confronted with her past, her relationship with Anakin, and her greatest fears whilst in the World Between Worlds. Ahsoka has long been held back by her past and her legacy – since learning of Vader’s true identity in Star Wars Rebels season 2, she’s been running from her past, abandoning meaningful connections like the one with her own Padawan Sabine Wren in favor of hunting the galaxy for threats in a misguided attempt to atone for her imagined sins.\nIn the World Between Worlds, however, Ahsoka is given the opportunity to examine how her past has affected her. She sees the battles she was forced to fight as a child, the way she grew and learned under Anakin’s tutelage, and learns that she is capable of being more than what she was trained for. Anakin, and the Order by extension, trained her to be a warrior, yes – but Ahsoka discovered her capacity for empathy and kindness on her own. Her final lesson with Anakin taught her that while her past is an important part of who she is, she has the power to change her future.\nAhsoka now knows that she is more than just Anakin’s Padawan. Instead of choosing to kill him in the World Between Worlds, she chose to live and honor his teachings instead. Her experiences in Ahsoka episode 5 changed her forever. Now, she’s “Ahsoka the White,” no longer burdened by her past but rather accepting of it. She understands that Anakin’s fall to the dark side was a consequence of his own choices, just as much as it was Palpatine’s will. She is not her master, and as such, can make her own choices as she embraces becoming a beacon of light in the galaxy rather than being self-destructive.\nOne of the reasons Thrawn is such a threatening adversary is because he is willing to take the time to get under his enemies’ skin. He learns about their history and their relationships, using that knowledge to knock them down and shake their confidence. He’s done this time and time again – for instance, in Star Wars Rebels, he meticulously studied Twi’lek culture to rip apart their rebellion on the planet Ryloth. Thrawn is an Imperial Officer who uses more than just the Empire’s brute force to overcome his enemies; he messes with their minds as well, playing games and using their biggest fears against them.\nRelated: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nThis is exactly what he hopes to achieve by taunting Ahsoka with Anakin’s tragic fate. He wants to shake her confidence because he knows that, should she make it back to Star Wars’ primary galaxy alive, she’ll be one of his most difficult opponents. Thrawn doesn’t like to take chances; any advantage he can find, he’ll utilize, and knowing about Anakin’s fate is certainly an important piece of information to have in his arsenal. Despite Anakin having been redeemed by Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi, Thrawn could still do a lot of damage with the knowledge of Vader’s true identity as the Imperial Remnant tries to expand its foothold in the galaxy. After the Ahsoka finale, Thrawn has proven himself to be as cunning and terrifying as ever.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "7 Times Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny Changes History", "date": "2023-10-05 21:11:25", "text": "Indiana Jones has always played with real history, but the changes that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny makes could have huge ramifications.\nThe Indiana Jones franchise has always grappled with history, but Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’s changes to real events take this to a new level. Set in 1969, the most recent and final addition to the Indiana Jones series sees the aging archaeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) going up against the Nazis once more, this time in pursuit of Archimedes’ antikythera. Dr. Jones and his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) go on a globe-trotting adventure to save the antikythera from the clutches of the Nazis — though they travel a little further than they intended.\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny's ending takes the characters to Syracuse in 212 BC, where Indy and Helena not only end up encountering the history they study face-to-face, but manage to change it as well. While some of Dial of Destiny’s historical changes are relatively benign, other alterations would have major ramifications on the course of history. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changes history seven times during its runtime, and each of these instances would affect real-world events in one way or another.\nEven before the time travel begins in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the titular archaeologist alters the course of history during a celebration of the 1969 moon landing. After a scuffle with the Nazis and Indy’s morally gray goddaughter Helena Shaw, Indy ends up getting framed for the murder of two of his colleagues at Hunter College. This forces him to flee the university to escape his adversaries and the police. Unfortunately for Indy, New York City’s moon landing parade is in full swing, so the chase sequence between him and the Nazis interrupts the event.\nWhile this chase resembles the usual Indiana Jones antics, this is a real event that Indiana Jones and the Nazis change through their presence. The parade that Indy upends is an actual parade that took place in August 1969, which honored the astronauts of the Apollo 11 moon landing. In real life, however, the Apollo 11 moon day parade was decidedly devoid of an aging archaeologist bursting through on horseback or a car full of Nazis chasing him. This makes the Moon Day parade an early example of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changing history.\nAfter Indy and the Nazis’ unintended involvement in the Moon Day parade, their changes to history get even more drastic. Toward the end of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Dr. Voller reveals that his plan for the antikythera is to go back in time to 1939 and kill Adolf Hitler to prevent him from losing World War II. However, his miscalculation results in the time fissure delivering their plane to the Siege of Syracuse, and the plane is soon shot down. Since the airplane wouldn’t be invented until 1903, a Nazi plane certainly wouldn’t have appeared in 212 BC, making this a big change to history.\nOne of the biggest ways that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changes history is by introducing Ancient Greek inventor Archimedes to the movie’s main characters, who hail from the modern era. After the Nazi plane crashes — with Indy and Helena escaping via parachute — the two archeologists encounter Archimedes. Getting the chance to meet a major historical figure like Archimedes is a huge moment for Indy personally, but it also alters history quite a bit.\nRELATED: Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny: 31 Easter Eggs & Hidden References\nArchimedes getting to meet the time-traveling Indy and Helena changes history in several ways during the Indiana Jones movie. Obviously, it’s highly unlikely that the real-life Archimedes ever encountered time travelers, which is a big alteration. Through meeting these time travelers, Archimedes is also introduced to several modern items and inventions he never would have encountered otherwise. Additionally, Indy and Helena both speak to Archimedes with a level of reverence that hints at his modern reputation, something Archimedes wouldn’t have known about. By meeting Indy and Helena, Archimedes would have gained an awareness of modern times he never would have in real life.\nOne interesting way that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changes history is in its depiction of the antikythera. In the fifth and final Indiana Jones movie, the antikythera is able to detect fissures in time. This allows the users to travel in time, although the Indiana Jones characters later discover that the antikythera only takes them to 212 BC. While this is an interesting function for the artifact to have, the real-life antikythera had a different function.\nRelated: How The Dial Of Destiny Works In Indiana Jones 5 (Explained With Real Science & Math)\nWhen the real-life antikythera was created, its intended use was not time travel. Rather, it was capable of performing complex astronomical calculations, making the antikythera the earliest known example of an analogue computer. This is an impressive feat in its own right, but it is a far cry from the time fissure-detection that the antikythera can do in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\nMeeting time travelers isn’t the only way that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changes the life of Archimedes. In real life, Archimedes died during the Siege of Syracuse in 212 BC, where he was killed by a Roman soldier. However, the end of The Dial of Destiny shows that Archimedes is still in the process of creating the antikythera, and since Indy has a completed version of the invention, that means Archimedes has to live long enough to finish his version. Therefore, whether it was intentional or an unintended plot hole, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny extended Archimedes’ natural lifetime, thus changing history considerably.\nOne of the biggest historical changes that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny makes occurs when Indy and the Nazis interrupt the 212 BC Siege of Syracuse. When the modern characters arrive in Syracuse, the two opposing armies assume that their plane is a dragon, leading them to shift focus and shoot it down. Although it’s impossible to know everything that really happened at the Siege of Syracuse, it’s unlikely that this took place, so it’s a pretty significant divergence from the real battle. It’s also possible that Indy and the Nazis’ interruption is what prevented the Romans from killing Archimedes, which is another alteration.\nRELATED: How To Watch The Indiana Jones Movies In Order (Chronologically & By Release)\nThe appearance of time travelers during the Siege of Syracuse begets several historical changes in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, particularly when it comes to Archimedes encountering examples of modernity. When Archimedes finds the completed antikythera from the future, he also discovers a wristwatch that Dr. Voller was wearing when he died in the plane crash. Though Archimedes gives Indiana and Helena the completed antikythera back, he keeps the wristwatch.\nHaving modern technology in different time periods is always significant in time travel movies, as it marks a major deviation that could change real-life events. After all, Archimedes wouldn't have access to such technology without the time travel ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. The character getting a modern wristwatch could have huge ramifications for the course of history, especially since he's an inventor. It could mean other pieces of modern technology being created earlier, and it could also give certain nations advantages that weren't present in the prior timeline.\n"}
{"title": "10 Best Thriller Movies On Amazon Prime Video", "date": "2023-10-05 21:20:17", "text": "For Amazon Prime Video subscribers, there are a number of excellent thriller movies to watch for a night of suspenseful and nail-biting viewing.\nFor Amazon Prime Video subscribers looking for a thriller movie, there are plenty of options on the platform. Thriller films can spread across different genres, from superhero films to horror to intense action movies. The primary purpose of the genre is to evoke heightened feelings of tension, anxiety, and anticipation while the film quickly builds toward its conclusion. Thriller movies are often filled with shocking plot twists that help the fast-paced narrative escalate toward a dramatic climax.\nPrime Video has a section for thriller films on the site, though there are a number of low-budget and mediocre offerings to weed through. The best thrillers to watch tend to include all-star casts and directors. However, a thriller film's script is often what makes or breaks it, as such stories tend to explore darker ideas about humanity that are meant to linger with the audience after the film's conclusion.\nBurning is a psychological thriller from South Korean writer and director Lee Chang-dong. The film follows a young man, Jong-su, who runs into his childhood friend, Hae-mi. Hae-mi introduces Jong-su to a mysterious man she's met named Ben, who Jong-su is suspicious of. This leads him to believe that his friend is in danger. Burning is engrossing and suspenseful, and it's filled with thematic depth for viewers to explore.\nDirected by Denis Villeneuve and written by Taylor Sheridan, Sicario is an excellent action/thriller film. The movie follows Emily Blunt as Kate Mercy, an FBI agent who's recruited to a team tasked with taking out a powerful cartel boss. The film is beautifully shot and well-written, as one would expect from the writer/director duo that made it happen. Sicario is a nerve-racking, action packed, and gritty thriller that builds its tension perfectly.\nSouth Korean cinema gained a ton of popularity from the 2019 film Parasite. There are a number of other great psychological thrillers to explore from South Korean directors, including Bong Joon-ho's other movies. Bong Joon-ho's Mother is the best example currently available to stream on Prime Video. The film tells the story of a widow who must clear her intellectually disabled adult son of a murder he's been accused of following a messy police investigation. Mother offers a tense murder mystery that fans of Parasite or Memories of Murder will surely enjoy.\nThe 2018 film Suspiria is a supernatural horror thriller inspired by the 1977 Italian film of the same name, directed by Luca Guadagnino (Call Me by Your Name). The film follows a young dancer from America who arrives in Berlin in the 1970s to audition for a renowned dance studio. As the narrative progresses, the young woman unearths sinister witchcraft activity. The film isn't as strong as the original, but it's still one of the best original horror movies on Prime Video. Suspiria is filled with suspense, and it also contains body horror that will freak its audience out.\nJoker is a comic book movie that's received acclaim for its dark, gritty character study. Inspired by Martin Scorsese films like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, Joker chronicles the deterioration of Arthur Fleck, an isolated man who feels rejected by society. As the film builds toward its climax, Fleck transitions further and further into becoming the Joker. Most of the praise for the film comes from the performance from Joaquin Phoenix, who captures the comic book character in a way that feels more realistic than previous variations.\nMost modern moviegoers know of Christopher Nolan and that he's capable of turning any genre or story into a sensory overloading, fast-paced, thrilling experience. His 2000 film Memento is perhaps the best bare-bones example of his style, crafting a simple story that is made complex by its scenes being displaced in time. The main character has short term memory loss, requiring him to utilize a system of notes and photographs to keep track of information as he seeks out revenge toward the men who murdered his wife. The film is complicated due to its narrative style, adding to the anticipation and its plot twists.\nRELATED: Memento Timeline & Ending Explained\nDirected by the great Sidney Lumet, Serpico is one of the earliest and best movies starring Al Pacino. While Pacino is known for playing mobsters, Serpico sees him on the other side of the law, playing a good cop in a New York City precinct full of bribery and corruption. The film depicts the true story of Frank Serpico, who was a whistleblower on police corruption in the '60s and '70s. The film is tense and gripping as obstacles build up in front of Serpico, who goes against the status quo and tries to oust the dirty cops.\nAnother comic book adaptation, The Batman is the first version of the character on the big screen to primarily focus on detective work, allowing the film to lean heavily into thriller elements. Directed by Matt Reeves, the movie sees Batman pursuing the Riddler, who's portrayed as a serial killer leaving behind clues. The film takes heavy inspiration from the mystery thrillers of David Fincher, such as Zodiac and Se7en, laying out clues and misdirection as Batman tracks down the Riddler and the motivations of the film's villains.\nChinatown is one of the greatest mystery movies ever made, and one of the best examples of the neo-noir genre. While the film isn't as fast-paced as many modern thrillers, its slower, contemplative burn allows for its script to fully take effect, maximizing the film's foreshadowing and plot twists. The conflict of Chinatown is relentless, constantly evolving as it transitions from a murder mystery to a grander story about politics and corruption. This is a film that will fill its audience with a sense of tension and dread, both as it develops and long after it ends.\nRELATED: Chinatown: 10 Reasons It's The Best Film Noir Movie Ever Made\nJordan Peele's latest film, Nope, was one of the best new releases of 2022, celebrated for Peele's usual mix of genres. Nope contains elements of sci-fi, comedy, and horror. The film follows a pair of siblings, played exceptionally by Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer, who discover what they believe to be a UFO above their horse ranch. Peele commonly subverts horror tropes, allowing his films to play out and build anticipation in ways that are unexpected, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats throughout. Nope is a must-watch thriller on Amazon Prime Video, especially for fans of thrilling narratives.\n"}

Prior to the Blumhouse slasher comedy, Khan had scored acclaim for her work as creator and showrunner of ABC's Fresh off the Boat and American Dad!, followed by her feature directorial debut with the Randall Park and Ali Wong-led Always Be My Maybe.\nKhan has assembled a star-studded roster for Totally Killer, including The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina alum Kiernan Shipka, Olivia Holt, Julie Bowen, Liana Liberato, Charlie Gillespie, and Randall Park. Khan's debut in the horror genre brings all of the sharp humor that has defined her work in the past while also delivering the shocking thrills expected of an entertaining slasher.\nRelated: New On Amazon Prime Video: All 138 Movies & TV Shows Arriving In October\nAhead of the movie's release, Screen Rant spoke exclusively with director Nahnatchka Khan to discuss making the jump from comedy to horror, her biggest goals for her on-set environment, and thoughts on a potential sequel.\nScreen Rant: I'm so excited to talk about Totally Killer. I've been a fan of your work since Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, and I loved what you did on Always Be My Maybe, which makes your transition towards horror with this film really intriguing. What about the script really sparked your interest to want to do that, even if it still has some comedy elements?\nNahnatchka Khan: Yeah, I'm a horror fan, just as a viewer and audience, I love the genre. So, after I did Always Be My Maybe, I kind of just sat down generally with Jason Blum and the team at Blumhouse, and I just was fanning out to them. I was like, \"I love what you guys do, and I'm a fan,\" and they were like, \"Let's figure something out. Let's do some sort of mash-up.\" So, we've been talking about it, and then they sent me Totally Killer, and usually when you get a script, it has the synopsis or whatever. But this had nothing, it was just a script, so I truly didn't know. I was like, \"It's coming from Blumhouse, so I know there's got to be some sort of horror thing,\" and so then, when I got locked into the premise, I was like, \"Oh my god, this is so much fun, I could have a ton of fun with this.\" It just made a lot of sense, and it was an exciting challenge.\nBlumhouse always has a horror edge to their stuff with Freaky with Happy Death Day, and this feels like it fits nicely in there. I said it before, but this is also a very funny movie, which is obviously in your wheelhouse. What was it like finding the right balance between the humor and some of the genuine slasher thrills?\nNahnatchka Khan: I think it was wanting to kind of lull you into this world, and not starting from too dark of a place, and then surprising you when it sort of takes a hard turn with that first kill sequence and being like, \"Oh, okay, we're going for it, we're not checking our swing here, there's a slasher on the loose, there's gonna be some gory kills and some gruesome moments.\" It's really just understanding that those two things can live together and can coexist, so always leading with comedy, I think, allows for the horror to shine. Like, those are not the comedy set pieces, right? It's around that, and then of course, the time travel element has to come into play as well, and get that in there.\nKiernan obviously has a history in horror, and you and Randall have a history together, but the rest of this ensemble around them is just incredible to watch. What was it like building this cast to really embody these characters?\nNahnatchka Khan: It was so fun. I mean, it was a challenge, because we obviously had people playing one role 35 years apart. So, starting with like Olivia Holt, who plays Kiernan's peer/young mother, she's amazing. The two of them together are just so much fun, and then getting Julie Bowen to play the older Olivia, they look like [each other], it feels like, \"Okay, that tracks.\" Then, building out the rest of the world and having these kids who were young adults now living and embodying these 1980s tropes, going back to the John Hughes era that they didn't live through, and kind of talking them through [it].\nThey have all the reference points, that was the thing that was really cool, too, about working with the cast is I came in armed with all these movies that I was going to have them watch to be prepared. Not only had they seen them, but they threw it back at me, and they were like, \"Have you seen this, this, that?\" I was like, \"No.\" So I left being like, \"Alright, let me go watch some of this stuff,\" because they are so aware, and so ready for the challenge, it was really fun.\nThat's awesome. Did you have a favorite of the movies that they gave you?\nNahnatchka Khan: There was some obscure '90s [movie], I gotta find the name of it, but it was something I'd never heard of before. It was like some, like, Brazilian movie — I'll find it, and I'll make sure it gets sent to you, because it was really amazing.\nDid you have the time to allow the actors to form a rapport with one another, especially with the adult and younger counterparts, to get the chance to join together and find the characters together?\nNahnatchka Khan: Definitely, as much as possible. When we were all on set together, we would have just actor meetings with the actors that were playing the same role, just so they can kind of get to know each other. So, Charlie Gillespie and Lochlyn Munro were together, Julie and Olivia. It was just a fun way to hang out, and kind of not mirror each other, but sort of see what the other one is doing. We had table reads, so everybody could get on the same page. Just wanted to keep it loose, so they can feel comfortable to bring their talent to it, and elevate it, and they really all stepped up. It was just such a fun challenge, and so great to watch them work.\nThis is a movie that, much like Happy Death Day, ends on a mostly conclusive note with maybe a hint or two that it could continue. Do you have any ideas about a possible sequel, or would you want to come back and continue this story?\nNahnatchka Khan: You know, it's funny, I think from like, day two of shooting, our DP, Judd Overton, kept saying every day, at the end of this movie, there's still a time travel device left in 1987, and we were like, \"That's true. That's true.\" So he's banging the drum that there could be a sequel where somebody from the '80s now comes to the present day, if they find that time machine, so you know, anything is possible.\n35 years after the shocking murder of three teens, the infamous “Sweet Sixteen Killer“ returns on Halloween night to claim a fourth victim. 17-year-old Jamie (Kiernan Shipka) ignores her overprotective mom’s (Julie Bowen) warning and comes face to face with the masked maniac and on the run for her life, accidentally time travels back to 1987, the year of the original killings. Forced to navigate the unfamiliar and outrageous culture of the 1980s, Jamie teams up with her teen mom (Olivia Holt) to take down the killer once and for all before she’s stuck in the past forever.\nCheck out our other interviews with:\nTotally Killer begins streaming on Prime Video on October 6.\nSource: Screen Rant Plus\n"}
{"title": "Godzilla's Name for King Kong Explains Why Their Battle Was Inevitable", "date": "2023-10-05 21:30:25", "text": "Godzilla vs Kong is an epic film with one of the best monster battles in history, & the reason why they fought was due to Godzilla's name for Kong. \nIt’s no secret that Godzilla and King Kong are rivals, as these Titans have faced off in not one, but two separate continuities, including and especially the most recent MonsterVerse film Godzilla vs Kong. While the visual spectacle of having these two behemoths battle it out on the big screen is reason enough to pit them against each other, there’s a far less meta purpose for their fight as well, and Godzilla’s name for King Kong explains exactly why their MonsterVerse battle was inevitable.\nIn the original 1962 film King Kong vs Godzilla, Kong was taken from his home and brought to Godzilla’s territory in order to fight the kaiju on behalf of humanity, despite the fact that the two monsters had never heard of each other before and had no reason to fight beyond proving which one was the strongest. There wasn’t much background or motivation for either Kong or Godzilla, but then again, there didn’t really need to be. Two iconic monsters (one more recognizable in Japan, the other an American classic) in a movie together, fighting to see who would win, is fun enough as it is. In the newly-established MonsterVerse films, however, Godzilla and Kong have a deep-seated rivalry that stretches back generations for both their species. That’s why Godzilla and Kong fought in 2021’s Godzilla vs Kong, and that’s why Godzilla had his own special name for Kong before the events of that movie even took place: the Rival.\nIn Godzilla: Dominion by Greg Keyes and Drew Johnson, readers are shown what Godzilla was doing before the events of Godzilla vs Kong following his narrow victory over King Ghidorah in Godzilla: King of the Monsters. The book gave fans a bit more insight into Godzilla’s thought process, as well as revealing another interesting ability movie fans didn’t know he had. Godzilla has the power to tap into the entire world, and feel things happening on the planet the same way one can feel something on their skin. This is how Godzilla knows when there is conflict, or when someone or something is overstepping their boundaries and needs to be put in place. More than that, though, Godzilla can constantly feel Kong’s challenging presence on his world, with every moment Kong continues to exist without recognizing his supremacy being like an itch Godzilla just can’t scratch.\nGodzilla’s species and Kong’s species used to live together in the Hollow Earth, where remnants of a great battle between them were discovered in Godzilla vs Kong (and where Kong got that sweet Godzilla-killing ax). It’s for this reason that Godzilla immediately recognizes Kong’s presence on Earth as that of his ultimate, instinctual rival, and why it was inevitable that the two would fight. Again, the issue here isn’t that Kong didn’t bow before Godzilla like the other Titans did in King of the Monsters, it’s that Kong is inherently a threat to Godzilla’s kingship. Add that to the fact that Godzilla can feel Kong’s every move with his planet-scoping power, and the ultimate battle between the two was completely unavoidable.\nThankfully, by the end of Godzilla vs Kong, the two were able to work out some sort of unspoken agreement that would allow both of them to exist on the same planet at the same time without further conflict. However, that initial conflict was necessary either way, regardless of the outcome, and Godzilla’s names for King Kong explains why.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "Hulk Vs She-Hulk: Who Is The Stronger Gamma-Powered Superhero?", "date": "2023-10-05 21:40:25", "text": "Hulk and She-Hulk's MCU power level is extremely high, but there's one key difference that makes one Gamma monster stronger than the other.\nAlthough the MCU's Hulk and She-Hulk draw their power from the same source, one of them has a clear advantage over the other. Gamma monsters are especially powerful MCU characters due to their sheer strength and durability. Even when they give up power in exchange for intelligence, they're still stronger than most Marvel superheroes. And to top it off, they can also become exponentially stronger according to their rage level.\nHulk's MCU origin story is inherently tied to Captain America, as the experiment that resulted in Bruce Banner's first transformation aimed to replicate the original Super Soldier serum. With the addition of Gamma radiation and Bruce Banner's pent-up rage, the experiment resulted in the birth of a monster with seemingly endless energy and strength: Hulk. Hulk then inspired the creation of other Gamma monsters, either voluntarily or accidentally — namely, the Abomination, the Leader, and She-Hulk, all of which have more natural control over their consciousness but less power and endurance.\nHulk's MCU power level has varied a lot throughout the years. First, The Incredible Hulk showed that Hulk is capable of mowing down whole military squads with ease, though he might struggle against certain weapons like Stark Industries' sonar cannons and against a similar Gamma monster, like the original no-holds-barred Abomination. Hulk's return in The Avengers increased his power to the point of being able to stop a Chitauri Leviathan on its tracks with a single punch, as well as brush off a hit from Thor's Mjolnir and survive a swarm attack from the Chitauri army. This same Hulk accomplishes a similar feat with Ultron's army in Avengers: Age of Ultron, but gets knocked out by Iron Man's Hulkbuster machine after an intense battle between the two Avengers.\nHulk's pinnacle of power in the MCU came in Thor: Ragnarok, where a smarter Hulk had already become a champion gladiator after defeating a variety of intergalactic warriors on the Grandmaster's arena. Thor: Ragnarok's Hulk is strong enough to defeat Fenrir single-handedly and land some blows on a giant-sized Surtur, though the only reason he can defeat Thor in gladiatorial combat is that the Grandmaster intervenes. After Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War showed that Hulk's strength is no match for Thanos' fighting skills, and Smart Hulk's introduction in Avengers: Endgame put an end to the Hulk's immense feats of power — but not before he proved that his body is still durable enough to withstand the power of all six Infinity Stones.\nJennifer Walters' first transformation into She-Hulk came with the reveal that she doesn't need to lose her calm in order to tap into her Gamma power. She-Hulk can take advantage of all of her abilities at any time, including super strength, super speed, a fast healing factor, and the Hulk's emblematic thunderclap. During her training with Smart Hulk, She-Hulk demonstrates her immense base-level strength by throwing Smart Hulk around and putting up a decent fight, yet it's obvious that Smart Hulk is holding back. However, this fight scene is only She-Hulk's first time getting to know her powers.\nRelated: She-Hulk Ending Explained (In Detail)\nShe-Hulk's following fights in She-Hulk: Attorney At Law don't require her to use her full strength. In fact, she walks right through most of them unharmed and mostly unbothered, with opponents like the Wrecking Crew, Leap-Frog's henchmen, and Marvel Studios' employees failing to land a single blow on her. As She-Hulk still lacks experience, she struggles to match Daredevil's agility, which leads her to resort to a thunderclap to stop him. However, more training and more demanding fights against stronger opponents could force She-Hulk to reach her full potential in a future Marvel Cinematic Universe movie or show.\nHulk, more specifically Bruce Banner's Savage Hulk persona, is undeniably the most powerful Hulk in the MCU, at least up until Phase 5. Not only is the original Hulk bigger, stronger, and more brutal, but he also has the advantage of being fueled by pure rage. Hulk feeds from Bruce Banner's repressed anger to power himself and recover from any injury, growing stronger in the process. Although clever opponents like Iron Man and Thanos have found ways to neutralize Hulk, Hulk still stands out as a highly adaptable character. Hulk's main weakness, if anything, is his will to fight, as his losses in Avengers: Age of Ultron and Avengers: Infinity War are influenced by his state of mind.\nRelated: Every Way The Original Hulk Can Return To The MCU\nShe-Hulk is also powerful, but apart from her lack of experience, she isn't interested in fighting. If she were, it's possible that all of her abilities would increase proportionally to her rage and energy. Given that Bruce Banner found a way to merge his human self with Hulk's persona, there could also be a way to unleash She-Hulk's full potential, possibly turning her into a monster as big and unstoppable as the original Savage Hulk. But while there's a precedent of such a transformation in Marvel Comics, the MCU's She-Hulk is highly unlikely to risk her human consciousness in order to pursue Hulk's full power.\n"}

In season 5, the pair are dealing with so much stress, thanks to Olivia's feuds with Kim, Barry and Moriah Plath. Ethan thinks he's caught in the middle, and that kind of drama generally doesn't help a person to keep their marriage afloat. Over the years, the Plath family's made Olivia's life a living hell.

They were reportedly holding hands while they danced. The woman was described as a brunette who definitely wasn't redhead Olivia. Ethan doesn't really seem like the type to step out on his marriage, so possibly the divorce rumors, which have been running rampant, are one hundred percent accurate. If they are, reality TV show star Ethan's branching out following a separation, rather than actually cheating.\nIf Ethan and Olivia are still together, he might have been caught red-handed with a woman who isn't his wife. In that case, it would be very shocking. Based on what's unfolded onscreen over the years, Ethan's a loyal guy. He's stuck with Olivia, who may be the new Kim, through some very hard times, and was totally crushed when she wanted a break. He appeared to be very depressed.\nPeople change, so maybe he's not in the same state of mind now. He may feel differently about his wife, and be ready to live his life without her. It wouldn't be a surprise if Ethan and Olivia imploded, because the type of pressure they've been under through five Welcome to Plathville seasons has been significant. Most couples would have folded long ago, throwing in the towel just to avoid the mother-in-law drama and other feuds.

They went to Europe, traveling around to escape from the realities of being members of the Plath family.\nWhen they returned, they learned that Moriah had fled the Tampa home she shared with them without telling them first.

However, the rift with Moriah, with whom Olivia was once so close, seemed like quite a hurdle to overcome.

Of course, their reluctance to address the rumors at IG, where they both have sizable followings, seems very relevant. It's possible that fans will see one of those polite but sad divorce announcements soon. If so, what does that mean for the future of the show? Will it end after Welcome to Plathville season 5?\nSource: Without A Crystal Ball/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "Was Halloween Ends Really That Bad? Re-Examining The $105M Disappointment, 1 Year Later", "date": "2023-10-05 21:50:25", "text": "Halloween Ends is one of the most controversial entries in the beloved horror franchise, but looking back on the film, is it really that bad?\nHalloween Ends is one of the most controversial films in the iconic horror franchise, and while the $105 million box office disappointment was initially met with poor reception, was it really that bad? Halloween Ends came out one year ago in October 2022, with the film wrapping up David Gordon Green's Halloween reboot trilogy. The third entry in the trilogy was definitely a risky move, with it putting a new spin on the Halloween franchise that hadn't been seen before. However, this spin didn't resonate with many Halloween fans, leading to Halloween Ends becoming a critical and commercial failure - but did it deserve this reception?\nHalloween Ends is the final entry in the Halloween reboot trilogy, which itself retconned all of the Halloween sequels and directly followed up on John Carpenter's 1978 original. Halloween Ends is set four years after the events of Halloween Kills, with Michael Myers having been missing for the previous few Halloweens. In his absence, the town of Haddonfield has grown increasingly paranoid and violent, almost as if Myers had put a curse on the town. Unbeknownst to Haddonfield's residents, Michael Myers has been living in the sewers, healing himself as he prepares to reign terror once again. However, this time the masked killer has some help.\nThe Halloween reboot trilogy had a pretty poor time in the critical marketplace, with none of the films being met with overwhelming positive reviews. Reviews for Halloween 2018 were ok, but the same can't be said for Halloween Kills or the subject of this analysis, 2022's Halloween Ends. As of the writing of this article, Halloween Ends sits at a 40% critical rating and a 57% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes, showing that the film didn't really gel with either fans or critics. Upon its release, Halloween Ends was torn to shreds, with a movement to reassess the movie only starting up recently.\nFans and critics had many problems with Halloween Ends, but they mostly are due to Michael Myers' connection to Corey Cunningham. In the film, Corey begins making a name for himself as a masked killer in Haddonfield, with him even acting as Michael Myers' sidekick at some points. Corey was arguably the main character in the film, which was a point of contention with fans. According to these fans, the scary part of Michael Myers is his mystery, something that doesn't work with Corey due to his prominence in the film. Some have even called Halloween Ends the worst entry in the franchise, showing how disappointing it was to some.\nHalloween Ends' critical reception wasn't the only thing that was disappointing, as the box office was pretty underwhelming as well. Halloween Ends made only $105.4 million on a $33 million budget, which is a huge step-down from Halloween 2018 making $259.9 million on a $10 million budget. While Halloween Ends was probably profitable, it most likely didn't meet the expectations of the studio. This financial failure is mostly due to Halloween Ends having a simultaneous release in theaters and on Peacock, with this streaming strategy undoubtedly kneecapping the film's box office returns. Thus, Halloween Ends failed on both critical and commercial fronts.\nRelated: Halloween Ends Cast & Character Guide\nAlthough Halloween Ends was received poorly, it is not nearly as bad as initially thought. The themes that are pulled in due to Corey Cunningham's story are truly unique to Halloween Ends, with them not having been seen in the franchise before. Halloween Ends also features some moments that are truly surprising, such as the opening scene. Halloween Ends' never lets the audience in on where it's going, so while every idea may not work out, it is at least trying something new. Corey Cunningham is the breath of fresh air that Halloween needed, which is why it's so odd that the film has been looked down upon.\nHalloween Ends may not live up to the original, but it is definitely more interesting than its two predecessors. Halloween 2018 and Halloween Kills are just lazy rehashes of the original film, with them not taking any risks. Because of this, both movies just feel like watered down versions of John Carpenter's original. Halloween Ends, on the other hand, isn't afraid to take risks, which is why it's so good. The only flaw with the film is its ending, with Michael's fight with Laurie Strode feeling completely detached from the rest of the story. Notably, this is the film's most similar scene to previous Halloween movies.\nThe Halloween franchise will continue into the future, causing many to wonder how this will affect the reception and canon status of Halloween Ends. Halloween Ends makes some wild choices near its end, including killing off Michael Myers. Due to the nature of Michael's death in Halloween Ends, it is impossible to say that he somehow lived (unless he is a supernatural entity). Because of this, future Halloween projects either have to be a prequel or they have to retcon Halloween Ends. With the rights to Halloween currently being sold, it seems as some studios have a plan for the franchise's future.\nInterestingly, Halloween Ends not truly being the end could be the best thing for the film's reception in the long-run. Many of the criticisms of Halloween Ends have to do with the film concluding the franchise by focusing on an original character rather than Laurie or Michael Myers. If more Halloween movies and TV shows are made, then Halloween Ends won't have ended the franchise on this note, fixing this problem. Halloween Ends may start seeing more positive reception as future Halloween projects get made, with this critical turnaround already being seen online.\nHalloween III: Season of the Witch was initially received poorly due to it not featuring Michael Myers, but it has become a cult classic in recent years. This same trend may repeat itself with Halloween Ends, with the film eventually being held in high regard for being so different. No other Halloween movie is like Halloween III: Season of the Witch, and the same can be said for Halloween Ends. Thus, it can be expected that fans and critics alike will have a more positive outlook on Halloween Ends in the future, redeeming the film that was already great from the start.\nRobert Pitman is a Movies/TV features writer for ScreenRant and loves all things nerdy.

Contains spoilers for Catwoman #57!There's one hero in Gotham that Red Hood respects more than others. While facing off against his former mentor, Jason Todd informs Batman of a hero that the vigilante is starting to hold in high regard.\nIn Catwoman #57 by Tini Howard and Nico Leon, Batman is still in shock from losing his Batcave to Vandal Savage. As Bruce makes his next plans to stop Catwoman's newest criminal enterprise, Selina is one step ahead. She comes up with a plan to train her underlings to become car thieves and puts Red Hood in charge of the operation.\nAs Red Hood and a group of thieves pose as valets, Batman comes to stop him. Jason leads Bruce on a chase to distract him while Selina and several of her trainees rob a gala blind. Batman doesn't hold back from his former sidekick and yanks Red Hood off of his motorcycle with a grapple gun. As Bruce begs Jason to stop his alliance with Catwoman, Jason makes the point that he has a lot more in common with Selina than Bruce. Red Hood makes it blunt that he believes in Selina and her plan to make Gotham better.\nThe \"Gotham War\" crossover has made some major cracks in the Bat-Family. While Batman was recovering from Knight Terrors, Catwoman began training low-level criminals to break out on their own and target Gotham's wealthiest. As a result, Gotham's supervillains are floundering from a lack of henchmen and street crime has gone considerably down. All Selina asked was for the Bat-Family to not interrupt her operation, but Batman starkly refused. With no one but Damian on his side, Batman has begun pushing himself to end Catwoman's plans by any means necessary.\nBatman has lost nearly all his allies due to them seeing the validity of Catwoman's plans but it's surprising to see Jason on board with her. After all, just a few years before this, he spent his days terrorizing those who broke the law, killing an untold number of criminals. Now he's wholeheartedly endorsing Selina's plan. Admittedly, his line of logic makes sense. Both Jason and Selina didn't have the privileged upbringing that Bruce had and understand how desperation drives people to crime. For better or worse, Catwoman is actively changing Gotham for the better, and her work is doing what Batman never could: Inspire Red Hood.\nIt's not a stretch to say that Batman and Red Hood have a combative relationship. Jason has tried over and over again to get Bruce's approval but has had a tough time earning it. Selina, on the other hand, acknowledges the skills Jason has and has rewarded his efforts by making him a huge part of her plans. Red Hood is getting something from Catwoman that he hasn't gotten from Batman in a while: Respect and appreciation. In turn, Jason is confirming that he respects what Selina is doing and admits that he truly thinks she can make the city better.

However, she soon must solve a twisted mystery as ghosts haunt her new abode. With primarily positive reviews from critics and several award wins in the horror genre, Crimson Peak is a brilliantly spooky movie to watch on Netflix this Halloween.\nThe third installment in Netflix’s Fear Street movie trilogy, Fear Street Part Three: 1666 brings the tale back to the titular year while revealing the truth behind Sarah Fier and the “cursed” nature of Shadyside. The twists in the flashbacks lead to a thrilling reckoning in the “present” timeline of 1994, which continues the gory nature of the first two installments. Fear Street Part Three: 1666 received the highest critical acclaim of the three movies, marking a satisfying conclusion to the scary R.L. Stine-inspired Netflix trilogy.\nThe 2022 horror film The Invitation, inspired by the classic story Dracula, depicts the horrifying tale of a young woman who meets her long-lost family members after her mother’s death, leading to her discovery of their dangerous and dark secrets. While a modest success at the box office, The Invitation provides a chilling vampire story with a mesmerizing performance by former Game of Thrones actor Nathalie Emmanuele. Of the modern horror hits available to watch on Netflix this October, The Invitation will satisfy vampire subgenre Halloween viewing.\nThe 2019 supernatural horror movie The Wretched is another relatively recent outing available to steam on Netflix’s Halloween catalog. The creepy horror film follows a teenage boy who vies against an evil witch posing as his next-door neighbor, which satisfies many of the expected supernatural witch-in-the-woods movie tropes. The Wretched also boasts critical acclaim and a significant box office return, as the movie earned back over $4 million against a small budget under $100 thousand. With a teenage ensemble taking it upon themselves to battle a witch, The Wretched also drew frequent comparisons to Netflix’s own Stranger Things.\nCreep stands out as one of the most critically acclaimed horror movies within Netflix’s available Halloween content, as the 2014 found footage film received substantial praise from critics upon release. With plenty of thrills and captivating performances by its cast, Creep’s creepy tale follows a videographer who is tasked with filming an eccentric client at a remote cabin. The success of the Blumhouse-produced horror movie even spawned a critically acclaimed sequel in 2018, which is expected to be followed by the sequel Creep 3.\nNetflix has several Stephen King-inspired movies in its library, with 2019’s In the Tall Grass being based on the same-titled novella by King and his son Joe Hill. The Netflix original horror movie follows a brother and sister who are unable to escape a dangerous field of tall grass after entering in the hopes of saving a boy, providing plenty of scares expected of a Stephen King movie adaptation. In the Tall Grass also stars horror veteran Patrick Wilson, who is best known for his roles in The Conjuring and Insidious franchises.\nAnother Netflix original horror movie to stream this Halloween is The Babysitter, the streaming service’s 2017 black comedy horror film directed by McG. The Babysitter stars Scream Queen Samara Weaving, Judah Lewis, and Bella Thorne, with the film centering on a 12-year-old who learns that his babysitter is involved in a satanic cult that plans to kill him. The positively-reviewed Netflix original even launched a sequel in 2020, which stars Scream and Wednesday actress Jenna Ortega.\nAmong the most recent horror movies that is available to stream on Netflix for Halloween is The Pope’s Exorcist, which debuted in theaters in April 2023 to mixed reviews from critics, but proved successful at the box office. Starring Russell Crowe as the real demon-fighting exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth, The Pope’s Exorcist is inspired by the priest’s real claims, adding another creepy layer to the movie’s scares.

{"title": "Star Wars Is Setting Up A Villain Bigger Than The  Force Itself", "date": "2023-10-05 22:30:23", "text": "Ahsoka's finale episode sets up a massively powerful villain for Star Wars' future and will likely require the entirety of the Force to defeat.\nWarning! This post contains SPOILERS for Ahsoka episode 8\nAhsoka has set up the canonical return of one of Star Wars' most powerful villains who's bigger than the Force itself. With a powerful presence calling to the Dark Jedi Baylan Skoll (Ray Stevenson), Ahsoka's finale episode gave a major tease as to who Baylan is searching for on the extragalactic world of Peridea. As such, it's quite possible that a huge new threat is coming in Star Wars' future that would be far worse than Grand Admiral Thrawn's return to the known galaxy.\nIn search of power referenced only in myth and fairytales, Baylan Skoll is driven by his desire to break the galaxy's never-ending cycle of light and dark. Rather than wanting to restore the Empire via Thrawn's return, Baylan has his own agenda as soon as he makes it to Peridea, the fabled homeworld of the Nightsisters located in another galaxy. To that end, a major hint in Ahsoka's finale suggests Baylan is being called by Abeloth, a major cosmic entity from Legends connected to the Ones of Mortis, the trio of Force gods first seen in The Clone Wars who have now returned in this new Star Wars show.\nKnown as the Queen of Stars and Bringer of Chaos, Abeloth was first introduced in Legends' Fate of the Jedi novels by Aaron Allston, Christie Golden, and Troy Denning. Set during the New Republic era, Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order faced Abeloth, a threat far more powerful than the Sith and the dark side. However, the books and Abeloth were removed from the official canon following Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm and the Star Wars IP back in 2012. Nevertheless, the provided backstory and origins for Abeloth are directly tied to the Ones who remained part of the canon given their appearances in The Clone Wars season 3.\nAbeloth was once a mortal woman who began serving the Ones as the Father strove to keep his children in balance, the Son embodying the dark side of the Force while the Daughter represented the light. Eventually, she became part of their family as the Mother, helping the Father keep the children in balance. However, the woman continued to age unlike her family of immortals, motivating her decision to drink and swim in the forbidden Font of Power and Pool of Knowledge.\nThe Mother transformed into the Force being known as Abeloth, gaining extreme power while also being corrupted and twisted to madness. As such, the Father and his children abandoned Abeloth for Mortis as the world quickly became corrupted and darkened. The Ones also created a prison to contain Abeloth, though she would break out anytime there was a major disruption in the balance of the Force, requiring the Son and Daughter to work together to imprison her once more. Once the Mortis gods died as seen in The Clone Wars season 3, Abeloth was unleashed for good during the New Republic era.\nRelated: Thrawn's Zombie Stormtroopers Explained: Magick, Power & Star Wars Future\nKeeping Abeloth and her Legends' history in mind, it does look as though Ahsoka is setting up her return to the official Star Wars canon very soon. Believing that even the Nightsisters' Great Mothers feared the hidden power calling to him, Baylan may be searching for Abeloth herself. Considering the power and magicks at the disposal of the Great Mothers, this mysterious being has to be something incredibly dangerous to get them so scared, and Abeloth definitely fits the bill. It would certainly explain why the Mothers are so subservient to Grand Admiral Thrawn seeing as how he's their only way to escape Peridea.\nAdditionally, Abeloth's imprisonment could also be why the witch kingdom fell in the first place and why the planet is largely a wasteland. Perhaps it was corrupted over time by Abeloth's influence and containment. Abeloth on Peridea could also explain why the purrgil star whales changed their migration routes in the ancient past, seeing as how they now only come to Peridea to die, hence the planet's rings being comprised solely of the whales' bones.\nIt's not hard to see how Abeloth and Baylan's goals could align. Wanting to create a new era for the galaxy that's no longer burdened by the constant conflict of light and dark, Abeloth could certainly manipulate Baylan into releasing her (if she hasn't broken free already). Following her corruption and descent into madness, Abeloth sought to bring about a galactic apocalypse, allowing her to create a brand-new galaxy in its place where she would be loved and adored (despite being an entity of pure chaos and entropy). As such, Abeloth calling out to Baylan is more than plausible.\nRelated: 15 Star Wars Easter Eggs In Episode 8\nAbeloth was already being theorized as the one calling Baylan Skoll before Ahsoka's finale. Now, Baylan finding massive statues of the Mortis gods hugely supports those ideas for Star Wars' future. Clearly, the Ones had an influence on Peridea which could very well be Abeloth's prison and/or her original world before the Force gods abandoned her for Mortis. To that end, this unnamed world was indeed described in the novels as a \"mountainous forest world\" just like the valley Baylan discovers at the end of Ahsoka. Perhaps it's one of the last regions that hasn't been turned into a wasteland from Abeloth's own influence on Peridea.\nAs seen in the final shots of Ahsoka's finale episode, the statue of the Father points across the valley to the mountains on the other side. Likewise, one of the peaks features some sort of shining beacon or glint, clearly representing the endpoint for Baylan's quest before he discovers who or what has been calling to him ever since he came to Peridea, having fully abandoned not only Morgan Elsbeth's efforts to bring back Thrawn but also Baylan's own apprentice Shin Hati. As such, the odds are very strong that Baylan will discover far more than he bargained for, especially if it's Abeloth.\nThere's some solid evidence that Abeloth will soon make her Star Wars comeback either in a possible Ahsoka season 2 or some other Star Wars project in the works. To that end, it will likely require both the light and dark sides of the Force joining together to even have a hope of containing Abeloth (let alone destroying her for good). Thanks to Baylan Skoll's discovery in Ahsoka's finale, the future of Star Wars just got incredibly exciting and even more dangerous all at the same time.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}

Debuting nine years after Band of Brothers originally aired, The Pacific acted as a companion to the widely acclaimed miniseries. Although it didn't quite measure up to the bar set by Band of Brothers, The Pacific was renowned for its visual and technical execution and overlapping individual stories as opposed to the broader focus of Band of Brothers.\nHowever, The Pacific never achieved the same level of popularity as Band of Brothers for a litany of reasons. Part of it was certainly its coverage of the Pacific War, widely considered a much more brutal and horrifying conflict than its European counterpart in WWII, which was viscerally depicted on screen. Another key element that The Pacific was missing was the massive, star-studded cast of Band of Brothers. In that regard, Masters of the Air is already improving upon the first companion series.\nThe cast of Band of Brothers was largely made up of small-time or unknown actors, some of whom went on to become major film stars. However, it also included a long list of already-established stars like David Schwimmer, Scott Grimes, Donnie Wahlberg and Ron Livingston. The Pacific was missing the excitement of those existing stars for people to look out for. While some of the members of the cast did go on to become major stars (including Rami Malek, Jon Bernthal and James Badge Dale), they were all relative unknowns at the time the show aired.\nRelated: Masters of the Air Has Broken a Major Band of Brothers Tradition (& It's Worrying)\nMasters of the Air will not have the same issue, as its cast will be led by two of cinema's more recognizable faces--Austin Butler and Barry Keoghan. Academy Award nominee Austin Butler is fresh off playing Elvis Presley in the acclaimed biopic Elvis, and has featured roles in the highly-anticipated upcoming movies The Bikeriders and Dune: Part II. One of his primary co-stars in Masters of the Air is the also-Academy Award-nominated Barry Keoghan, who has had significant roles in cinematic juggernauts like Marvels The Eternals and Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk. Both actors are supremely talented, which is an exciting prospect for how emotionally impactful Masters of the Air will be.\nThe first images from Masters of the Air provided a glimpse of the aesthetic that will dominate the companion series, as well as the first look at Butler and Keoghan's characters. Butler is set to portray Major Gale Cleven, and Keoghan will play Lt. Curtis Biddick, both of whom were real-life members of the 100th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces. Nicknamed \"The Bloody Hundredth\" due to how few of their pilots returned from their raids in 1943, the 100th Bombardment Group attacked German forces and industrial targets across Western Europe.\nButler and Keoghan's real-life counterparts were both B-17 Flying Fortress bomber pilots, which will certainly be reflected in the show given that it is accurately based upon the book Masters of the Air from historian Donald L. Miller. Early images from Masters of the Air seem to indicate that while Butler and Keoghan may be the primary leads for the show, emphasis and screen time will be dispersed among the entire ensemble cast, much as it was for Band of Brothers. The return to that format is exciting in itself, but the fact that it will be led by two legitimate stars gives Masters of the Air and early leg up on its predecessor The Pacific.\n"}
{"title": "Totally Killer Producers Talk Blumhouse's Time Travel Slasher Thriller & Challenge Of Modest Budgets", "date": "2023-10-05 22:30:23", "text": "Totally Killer producers Greg Gilreath and Adam Hendricks talk Blumhouse's time-traveling slasher and the challenge of trimming modest budget scripts.\nFrom the studio behind hit horror-comedy mashups Freaky and Happy Death Day comes another fresh take on the slasher genre with Totally Killer. The Blumhouse-produced title centers on a teenager whose mother is killed by a serial killer who terrorized her small town almost 30 years before and finds a way to time travel back to the original killing spree, leading her to team up with the younger version of her mom and her friends to stop the killer and get back to the present before it's too late.\nThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina alum Kiernan Shipka leads the star-studded Totally Killer cast alongside Olivia Holt, Julie Bowen, Randall Park, Lochlyn Munro, Charlie Gillespie, Liana Liberato, Kelcey Mawema, Stephi Cin-Salvo and Anna Diaz. Bringing the same self-aware humor as Blumhouse's prior genre mashups for another hilarious and thrilling combo, the movie arrives just in time for the Halloween season.\nRelated: New On Amazon Prime Video: All 138 Movies & TV Shows Arriving In October\nIn anticipation of the movie's release, Screen Rant spoke exclusively with producers Greg Gilreath and Adam Hendricks to discuss Totally Killer, the search for the perfect director for the script's vision, and the challenge of trimming down scenes to accommodate larger set pieces.\nScreen Rant: Greg, I'm very excited to talk about Totally Killer. How did the script first come to you, and what about it really spoke to your interest to want to help produce it?\nGreg Gilreath: Great questions, it was a script that was floating around at Amazon, and they were kind of up on it. We had partnered with Blumhouse and Amazon on this sort of small slate of films, and it was one that was in the mix. Just reading it, it was so apparent right away that this was something that could be really memorable, really fun, and really stand out and allow you to have a great viewing experience. A lot of these comedy-horror films are really reliant on self-referential [humor], sort of really understanding the depths of the slasher genre, or things like that.\nI really love that this was kind of an entry point into the into this thing, it was like, \"You don't need the deep knowledge of slasher films,\" it could kind of be a first step in, and it really was so comedy forward, we knew that we had the right director and the right cast on this. It could be sort of a door into the horror genre for a lot of people who might tell themselves, \"I don't like horror films,\" and I think it really has succeeded in that, because it's so funny, and here's so much heart. All the comedy comes from character, and emotion, and nostalgia, and sort of subverting nostalgia, as opposed to being like, \"Hey, you remember that scene in Prom Night when this thing happened? And if you don't, you won't get the joke.\"\nAdam Hendricks: I think that there are a few things. One is that the scope is really fun, it's a challenge, there's big action set pieces, lots of extras in '80s costumes, hair even, like, hair's a big deal. I think that was really exciting. I think that for us, humor wise, the opportunity of doing a film where someone with a contemporary viewpoint goes back to the '80s where people are unfiltered, and all of a sudden, just realizing that that time that I was born in — it's so long ago from now, it's as far away as the '80s were from the '40s like, how insane is that conceptually?\nFinally, [we just] love Natch, what a cool filmmaker, what a great person to get behind. This is her only horror thing, we loved all her non-horror stuff, and Greg and I think our tastes go way beyond, even though we're like we're such horror babies, we also just love all types of film. To have someone who's succeeded in television shows, but also rom-coms, and basically saying, \"I really want to murder people on screen,\" it's like, how do you not get behind that?\nYou talked about looking for the right director and the right cast, which did you find was the most important step first? Did you feel that the script needed to be touched up, or did you feel that Blumhouse and Amazon already had it set up, and you just wanted to help get the director?\nGreg Gilreath: I think it's always director first. It was a great script, but the thing that we always look for in a director that didn't write the script is a director who is like, \"This is a great foundation, but here's how I'm going to do this and make this my own.\" We knew that the script was excellent, but that finding that director who had a vision for it and had like a real keen understanding of, \"This is how I will hone this, and shape this, and maybe change it up just a little bit from what it was originally conceived,\" that was by far the most important piece of this puzzle.\nHow challenging would you say that journey was to find the perfect person who had that vision?\nGreg Gilreath: It was both incredibly difficult and incredibly easy. It's like when it's blue skies, and in your mind, you could have anything that you could possibly ever imagine or go out to any director, you have lists with hundreds of people, and you're watching films, and you're talking about it. Then, once we kind of hit on Nahnatchka, and talked about it some more, and then once we met with her, it became clear that she is the person to direct this film, so it was really easy. Once we spent those months, dreaming big and talking about everything, and everybody you could possibly imagine, and then it really collapsed in an amazing way as soon as we talked to her.\nOne of the things that also really surprised me about this movie is that despite having Blumhouse's name attached, it feels like a very big movie, production-wise. The sets and action feel pretty high-scale. What is that like from your position as a producer, trying to help bring the script to life, bring some of those big sets to life, while maintaining a modest budget for a streaming release?\nGreg Gilreath: Yeah, so, it's true of every single movie that's ever been made, there's never enough time or money to do everything you want, unless you're doing an Adam Sandler Netflix movie, where they're just like, \"Whatever you want,\" but outside of that, there's never enough time or enough money. So, Adam [Hendricks] and I have done over 30 movies at this point, and the process is really getting in there with the writer and the director, and the department heads on the movie, and sort of being like, \"What is the essence of the story that we have to keep?\"\nThere's always scenes that go, and fat that's trimmed, and there's always calls of like, \"Okay, these seven scenes, we really need to spend all of our money, and then maybe on these ones, we could just find a location that's already got all this stuff in it, and just maybe shift it a little bit, or maybe instead of shooting a big wide for this scene, we can kind of contain it a little bit to the small part of the room, because we know there will be those two people talking. It would be great to have that big wide, but having just two people talking close up like that will really give us the scope to go do the Gravitron, or do this chase sequence, or something like that.\" So, honing in on what those pieces are — and to Nahnatchka's credit too, we were way over budget at one point, and she was so adamant — and she was correct — that the Gravitron sequence tt the end had to stay, and if that went away, there would be no movie that was worth making.\nEverybody at a certain point, everybody — not fought her on it, but questioned whether that was the best choice. Because it was like, \"What if we made everything else 15% better?\", but she was like, \"Absolutely not. We're doing this.\" So we had to reverse engineer the movie and really dig into the script with her about like, \"Okay, this scene's four pages, can it be one? We have these three scenes, can they be two, we have these five characters, can we get that information in one?\" It was a real process of breaking down the movie scene-by-scene and element-by-element, and figuring out what can go and what has to stay?\nI'm actually really glad she fought for that Gravitron scene, it's radical. In talking about going back to the script and trimming things here and there, what would you say was the hardest scene that you really reworked to fit this budget?\nGreg Gilreath: That's a great question. I think there's a lot of different ways to slice that, so like the Dollhouse of Horrors, the haunted house sequence where they sort of finally get the killer, and the pre-Gravitron sequence. That was a thing that existed at the amusement park in Vancouver, we were going to at first build this whole giant thing that we were going to do, and we couldn't figure out how to afford it, and our production designer, Liz, was pitching all these ideas about, \"Well, what if we just did like an elaborate entrance, and then everything else was kind of minimalist? Or what if it was outside?\" We had 100 different conceptions of what that area was called, it was called the Enchanted Forest at a time, just so many conceptions of what that could be, and none of them felt great.\nThen, there was this moment where I was like, \"Wait, what's that weird, spooky building over there that's kind of boarded up? Can we go in there?\" And the locations rep was like, \"Oh, sure, I guess you can.\" Once we put our heads in there, it kind of all clicked for that scene, and that's the great thing about making a movie, where you're just sort of a little bit of kismet, we just happened to be walking over there, and somebody happened to be curious about what this creepy looking building was. Then, once we went in, it became clear that we were spinning our wheels and wasting our time on trying to build a whole new thing for that sequence that was never going to work, it was just never going to work because we didn't have the resources or the time to do it properly.\nAlso, I think knowing when to cut bait and pivot is such an exceptionally rare tool right now. I think that was probably the biggest change that we made from what the script was, everything else was just little [things], like the party kill sequence. There was an extra beat on the stairs, there was another thing in the garage, so it's like very surgical, for the most part, just carving out little things.\n35 years after the shocking murder of three teens, the infamous “Sweet Sixteen Killer“ returns on Halloween night to claim a fourth victim. 17-year-old Jamie (Kiernan Shipka) ignores her overprotective mom’s (Julie Bowen) warning and comes face to face with the masked maniac and on the run for her life, accidentally time travels back to 1987, the year of the original killings.

{"title": "The Boys: 10 Characters Fans Wish Could Have Died Twice", "date": "2023-10-05 22:30:23", "text": "There's plenty of deaths in The Boys, but some are more deserved than others. Here are the Top 10 The Boys characters fans wish could have died twice!\nThe Boys has no shortage of gruesome deaths splattered throughout its fictional world, and while that may be hard for some fans to stomach, those who are killed usually more than deserve what they get, making their deaths oh so satisfying. In fact, these select characters are so despicable, one death just doesn’t seem like enough of a punishment for them.\nWithin The Boys universe (created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson), practically everyone of note with superpowers is a vile, repugnant excuse for a human being. Sexual assault is rampant, drug use is a given, and even murder is commonplace among the separate superhero teams - including and especially the Seven. That isn’t to say there aren’t regular humans who are deserving of death in this world, as there are more than a few who are even worse than those with superpowers - which is something this very list will reflect. Between those who abuse their superpowers and those who are somehow just as bad without them, here are the Top 10 worst characters in The Boys who fans wish could have died twice.\nIt doesn’t take long for The Boys to establish exactly why A-Train deserves to die. In the very first issue, A-Train callously runs through a living person - specifically, Hughie’s girlfriend, Robin - while chasing a super-villain, killing her instantly. Then, in The Boys #3, A-Train is one of the three supes who sexual assault Starlight right after she’s been brought on to the Seven. In the end, Hughie kicks A-Train’s head right off his body after getting a jolt from some Compound V Butcher gives him, and that quick death is far more than he deserved.\nThe first example of a non-powered villain on this list, Little Nina is the head of a Russian crime syndicate who plotted to overthrow the Kremlin and appoint herself as the new head of state. Her plan was to use a group of supes to pull off this coup, and if it weren’t for the Boys, she would have likely succeeded. In The Boys #14, Little Nina suffers a relatively quick - albeit incredibly bizarre - death after a bomb goes off right next to her (or possibly inside her body), killing her in the explosion. Little Nina dedicated her life to gaining power at the expense of others, as she was no stranger to manipulation, torture, and - of course - murder, making her death all the more satisfying.\nA supe who picks on those weaker than him just for a laugh, and who manipulates those around him by making them fear for their lives. That is Malchemical, and fans assuredly wanted to see him dead from the moment he first appeared in The Boys #40. Malchemical has the power to alter his body’s molecular structure in a variety of ways. He can do anything from classic shapeshifting to turning himself into a cloud of poison gas. In fact, it was the latter form that killed him, as Butcher lit a match when Malchemical was in a gaseous state, lighting him on fire and burning him to death. His anticipated demise came after Malchemical tormented a relatively innocent group of supes, who weren’t very good superheroes, but tried their best to be. Those who prey on the most vulnerable deserve the most horrific of fates, and in Malchemical’s case, he deserves it twice.\nFirst and foremost, Stormfront is a Nazi, so that in and of itself earned him a place on this list. But even if he wasn’t, Stormfront still proved to be a despicable superhero and human being all the way up until his death in The Boys #37. According to his canon history within The Boys lore, Stormfront was used by Vought-American in conjunction with the United States government to commit local atrocities like killing off the entirety of a Native American tribe for the sake of building a dam on their land. Stormfront actively enjoyed killing people, as it made him feel more powerful, and that’s why watching him get stomped to death by The Boys was so satisfying.\nEvery horrible act of sexual violence, drug abuse, or flat-out murder committed by pretty much any supe in The Boys - including and especially those of the Seven - are made possible by this man, James Stillwell. Stillwell makes sure the proverbial curtains remain closed to the public when it comes to the horrific things done by Vought-American’s supes, and he’s paid a lot of money for doing this. In fact, James Stillwell is so bad that his fate is actually far worse than anyone else on this list: he’s still alive. As revealed in The Boys: Dear Becky, James lost his mind following the events of The Boys’ series finale, as he’s spotted roaming a pineapple plantation, raving about ‘good product vs bad product’. His fate is one that he has to wake up to day after agonizing day. That moment when he finally snapped was just as finalizing as any death on this list, and it’s something fans can only hope he still remembers deep within his now-fractured psyche.\nHaving recently made his live-action debut in the new Prime series Gen V, The Boys fans should now be at least semi familiar with John Godolkin, though they may still not know the full extent of his heinous crimes in the comics. Debuting in The Boys #24, Godolkin is the leader of the G-Men, as well as the person who runs a school for young supes. On paper, Godolkin is an upstanding citizen and leader of a high-profile superhero team. Behind closed doors, however, John Godolkin is a pedophile who victimizes the young supes in his care. Godolkin is gunned down by a small army deployed by Vought-American, along with practically every supe in his school, and the world became a safer place immediately following his grisly death.\nAnything bad done by Homelander is immediately made worse by the fact that he’s supposed to be this world’s ‘Superman’, and is meant to be the shining light of inspiration and hope in a world filled with violence and terror. But, as it turns out, Homelander is a genuine piece of human garbage who deserved every bit of the gruesome death he got. In The Boys #65, Black Noir reveals himself to be an enhanced (and mentally unstable) clone of Homelander who was created to kill him if he ever got out of hand - which he does in spectacular fashion. Within the Oval Office of the White House, Black Noir rips Homelander to shreds with his bare hands, leaving nothing left of the repugnant Superman knock-off except one of his arms and a bit of his torso.\nWhile Black Noir did the world a favor by killing Homelander, he wasn’t exactly a saint himself. In fact, the only reason Homelander was worth killing at all was because of Black Noir. Since Black Noir’s entire purpose was to kill Homelander if he got out of line, Black Noir took it upon himself to push Homelander over that line. He looked just like Homelander, so Black Noir put on Homelander’s suit, committed unspeakable acts of violence, and took pictures of himself doing it. This was all done in an effort to make Homelander think he did these things, pushing him to become the villain he already thought he was, and making it acceptable for Black Noir finally fulfill his dark purpose. After that was done - and after Homelander put up a hell of a fight - Billy Butcher finished off Black Noir himself, and the supe clone deserved every moment of agony the leader of the Boys put him through.\nSamuel Butcher, husband of Connie Butcher, father to Billy and Lenny Butcher, was a baker in London’s East End, though it’s heavily implied that he moonlit as a career criminal for cash on the side. Why he’s on this list isn’t because he supposedly had a penchant for breaking the law, however, but because he was a heavily abusive husband and father. Sam would mercilessly beat his wife in front of their kids, going so far as to blind her in one eye during a particularly violent rage-filled outburst. He was a cruel, sick man with a family who feared and hated him to their core. He died an unspectacular death in The Boys storyline “Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker”, with one of his own sons urinating on his corpse.\nWhile many might think of Butcher as one of the main protagonists of The Boys, they’d be very wrong. Butcher’s entire life revolved around intimidating, threatening, and blackmailing people into doing whatever he wanted. While he used this skill for good with the Boys by keeping supe’s in-line, he also did it with Vogelbaum, the man who created Compound V, and forced him to create a new compound that would kill every single supe in the world - effectively creating a means for genocide on a global scale. Not only that, but Butcher killed every single member of the Boys himself (except Hughie), turning on the people who trusted him the most. Butcher is seductively charming, to be sure, but he’s a bona fide super-villain, and his death in The Boys #71 couldn’t have come soon enough.\nThe heinous atrocities committed by everyone on this list makes them more than deserving of their violent fates. In fact, it’s safe to say that they should have to live their deaths at least one more time all over again, as these Top 10 The Boys characters are the ones fans wish could have died twice.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

The series marks the latest in a long and ongoing collaboration between Japanese manga publishing powerhouse Shueisha and American comic book publishing legend Marvel Comics.\nAs reported in Anime News Network, this month's issue of Shueisha's Saikyo Jump will feature the debut of Spider-Man: Kizuna - a brand-new ongoing manga following the adventures of a Japanese elementary student who becomes Spider-Man. While further details of the storyline were not announced before its publication, judging from the prior work of its creators, the story will likely include a fair share of high adventure mixed with humorous hijinks. The news title dropped in the October 4, 2023, issue of Saikyo Jump, which will continue to be its publishing platform thereafter.\nSpider-Man: Kizuna is based on Setta Kobayashi and Hachi Mizuno's one-shot of the same name. That story, which was published in September 2022, also appeared In Saikyo Jump. At the time Kobayashi posted a note to his X (formerly Twitter) account stating how excited he was to have the opportunity to work on a manga starring Spider-Man and how he hoped its readers would convince Shueisha or Marvel to serialize the title. While it took a few years, fan support for the Spider-Man: Kizuna one shot must have convinced Shueisha that the story deserved its own dedicated title and continuing series. More recently, Kobayashi went on to state that his aim in creating Spider-Man: Kizuna is to establish a new Japanese version of Spider-Man.\nThis is not the first time Shueisha and Marvel have collaborated. Last summer the two companies announced a manga spinoff to the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse called Spider-Man: Octopus Girl. That story follows the misadventures of Doctor Octopus who, after falling into a coma during another fight with Spider-Man, wakes up to find that he inhabits the mind and body of a Japanese middle school student. Even earlier, in 2019, the two comic publishing giants inked a deal in which a series of one-shot manga stories involving Marvel characters were produced and published on Shueisha's premier manga website Shonen Jump+. That collaboration resulted in the generation of some notable titles including Sanshiro Kasama and Hikaru Uesugi's Deadpool Samurai, and Secret Reverse by Yu-Gi-Oh! author Kazuki Takahashi.\nInterestingly, the 2019 Shueisha - Marvel collaboration also included a work by Mizuno entitled Avengers: Gag Reel which uses a traditional gag/prank manga style to poke fun at the usually super serious Avengers. Kobayashi is also not new to the parody scene. In 2018, he created Asta's Journey to Wizard King, a \"gag manga spinoff\" to Yuki Tabata's Black Clover. While Spider-Man is one of the most wisecracking heroes in Marvel, it certainly would be interesting to see him in an environment where everything could be a joke. If that's what Kobayashi and Mizuno are setting up Spider-Man: Kizuna as, it will definitely be a fresh new take on Marvel's classic hero from Shonen Jump publisher Shueisha.\nSource: Anime News Network, @settaboyashi (1), (2)\nMarcel Green is a writer for Screen Rant's Comics and Anime Sections."}
{"title": "8 Biggest Takeaways From The Exorcist: Believer's Scathing Reviews", "date": "2023-10-05 22:41:25", "text": "Most critics agree that The Exorcist: Believer is yet another unnecessary and dispirited attempt to extend the 1973 horror classic into a franchise.\nConsidering the abysmal reviews for The Exorcist: Believer, the main takeaways of the mass criticisms center around one common theme: it isn't good. The Exorcist: Believer is hardly the first attempt at implementing an entertaining and reliable horror franchise out of the celebrated 1973 original film, often heralded as the 'scariest movie of all time'. Believer was created with the intention to compete with modern independent efforts in the horror genre such as M3GAN and Talk to Me but mainly fell flat because of its lack of originality and purpose. Even with successful franchise revitalizer David Gordon Green at the helm (Halloween), most critics have lost their faith in The Exorcist franchise.\nThe original 1973 Exorcist still holds up as a terrifying movie that has unsettled audiences for some 50 years. The direct sequel The Exorcist II: The Heretic was released in 1977 under the new direction of John Boorman but failed to capture the prominence of the first film. 1990's The Exorcist III is arguably the best installment of The Exorcist franchise but still couldn't hold a match to the classic. Hollywood already got the hint that TheExorcist sequels were doomed, resorting to two even worse prequel films in 2004 and 2005 that seemed to have buried the franchise for good. Unfortunately, The Exorcist: Believer continued the trend of the woefully uninspired horror sequels.\nRELATED: The New Movie That's Perfect For Fans Of The Exorcist (Not Exorcist: Believer)\nMost critics agreed that The Exorcist: Believer was simply an unnecessary venture because it doesn't push the envelope on the already progressive state of the modern horror genre. In a time where many great horror films are finding innovative ways to terrify the masses, particularly due to standout auteur directors like Jordan Peele, Ari Aster, and Robert Eggers, The Exorcist: Believer goes in the opposite direction. The film is full of familiar horror tropes and similar situations to those found in the original movie, resulting in what feels like largely a paint-by-numbers movie which would hold up better if it weren't cast in such a monumental shadow.\nDirector David Gordan Green surely knew what he was up against when taking on The Exorcist: Believer, considering the original film's reputation as a landmark of horror. With this in mind, the one major requirement for any sequel of The Exorcist should undoubtedly be its overall fear factor, an aspect that feels like it was overlooked with 2023's Believer. Similar to The Exorcist III, which notably did not feature a single exorcism on screen, Believer's story feels like it was forced to fit under The Exorcist umbrella more than it was inspired by its actual legacy. The Exorcist III was based on a novel titled \"Legion\" and rebranded as an Exorcist movie, which feels like the case in parts of Believer.\nEllen Burstyn was wise to not reprise her role as Chris MacNeil, mother of the infamous Regan character from the original, until five decades had passed. Her big return to the franchise was effectively underwhelming, as Green and Blumhouse didn't utilize her as much as they should have in their attempts at revival. The 90-year-old Burstyn only agreed to return to The Exorcist franchise if Blumhouse agreed to increase her salary and donate it entirely to the charity of her choice. Burstyn's casting was evidently transactional and passionless, used by Blumhouse for the sake of continuity credibility and hardly any other reason besides that.\nRELATED:The Exorcist: Believer Review - Odom Jr. & Burstyn Elevate Gripping, Tame Horror Revival\nOne of the most challenging considerations with The Exorcist franchise is how impactful the original film was and how difficult as a result it is to produce something greater than one of the best horrors ever made. Several other successful and decades-spanning horror franchises didn't start out with such a high standard to live up to, such as Friday the 13th, Saw, and Child's Play. At times, the original Exorcist appears somewhat like an art film with profound, intentional cinematography, religious symbolism, and sophisticated themes of psychiatry in the face of supernatural phenomena. For anything to actually compare to the original, it would essentially have to be a modern masterpiece.\nMuch like Green's modern Halloween trilogy, The Exorcist: Believer was designed to be the first of a 21st-century Exorcist trilogy, which still might be the case. It's too early to tell whether Green would still be involved in that if Blumhouse decided to stick to that original plan. However, he is a talented enough filmmaker to possibly turn the franchise around with a redemptive Exorcist sequel. The Exorcist brand name will still always turn heads and catch the eyes of fans of the original movie, so not all hope is lost for the franchise that, by most critic's assessments, should have never started.\nLinda Blair was handed a script by Green and was prompted to become a part of The Exorcist: Believer cast. Blair declined despite studio excitement and willingness for her to reprise her role as Regan alongside Burstyn's Chris, which might have produced a more appealing film. This fault can't really be attributed to the film itself, as they at least tried to get Blair on board but were unable to convince her. Blair was a consultant on the film, primarily with the intention of creating a safe space for the child actors on set. Believer could have done more to explain Regan's absence but elected to chalk it up to her becoming estranged from her mother over time.\nRELATED: How Scary The Exorcist: Believer Is\nAt the end of the day, most critics see The Exorcist: Believer exactly for what it is: a flat and predictable horror movie hiding under the guise of a cinematic landmark. This is made even more clear by the sheer lack of imagination in the movie, almost identically hitting every beat of the original without properly building the suspense or believability to at least give it a chance of holding up to the original. Believer ultimately plays it too by the book to the point where it nearly feels like Green wants the audience to see the direct links to the original film but in formulaic structure, not in craftsmanship or effect.\nThe Exorcist: Believer only substantiates the argument that was already made clear with 1977's direct sequel which was equally disastrous. None of the three sequels or two prequels in The Exorcist franchise are any good. Believer should hit the nail on the coffin on a franchise that just wasn't meant to be. William Friedkin himself walked away from talks of The Exorcist 2 for the simple fact that he had no other story to tell with the material. Unfortunately, Blumhouse and Green did not have much of a story to tell with The Exorcist: Believer despite its potential, resulting in yet another disappointing installment of The Exorcist franchise.\n"}
{"title": "10 Worst Movies On Netflix", "date": "2023-10-05 22:50:26", "text": "Netflix is known for its incredible library of content, but the streaming service’s worst offerings include some truly terrible movies.\nNetflix has made a name for itself in the realm of streaming thanks to its incredible selection of movies and TV shows, but there are some truly terrible movies available to watch on the platform. Netflix has been operating for more than 25 years and has gone through several changes to get to where it is today. Starting life as a simple movie delivery service, it grew to the point that businesses like Blockbuster disappeared. Now Netflix creates its own content to rival what other studios put out.\nNetflix's catalog and the quality of its films have improved drastically over the years, but that doesn't mean that its releases are all hits. Many of the worst Netflix original movies feel rushed, poorly executed, or like a half-baked concept that just had money and star power thrown at it. Alongside its independent content, Netflix also features some really terrible movies from other studios, many of which will leave viewers confused, irritated, or downright bored.\nIn an age where superhero movies are making massive waves, Netflix tried its hand at making one of its own. Thunder Force follows the adventure of two childhood best friends who get powers from a science experiment, then team up to fight super villains. The whole film feels incredibly empty and predictable, with jokes that mostly fail to land. Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer helm the cast of Thunder Force, but everything from the chemistry to the plot is exceptionally poor, especially compared to what is being produced by larger studios.\nMarlon Wayans plays Rob Anderson, a man trapped in a time loop on the morning of his wedding, in 2017's Naked. He's cursed to reset the day over and over, during which he wakes up naked in a lift after being the victim of a crime. Naked leaves behind everything that makes a time loop film good, removing any concrete moral of the story and replacing it with cheap jokes and a silly premise. This film fails on every single front to deliver something coherent, engaging, or entertaining. For an absolutely mindless comedy, Naked delivers a sub-par experience all around.\nThe Ridiculous 6 brings together an impressive cast for a modern Happy Madison production, but despite the team in front of and behind the camera — and the funding from Netflix — it falls flat. In the movie, Adam Sandler discovers he has five half-brothers, and they set off on a Western misadventure to find their father. Everything about this film is wacky, zany, and quirky, but it's not in a good way. Everything feels over-the-top silly, and it lives up to its title as a truly ridiculous film. Sadly, it's too ridiculous to be watchable.\n2017's Death Note takes an absolutely outstanding anime series with depth and meaningful themes of morality and justice and turns it into something ugly. Death Note is subpar both visually and in concept. The film whitewashed the cast, even going so far as to change the names and locations from the anime. Death Note also does away with the motivations and background of its main character, watering down Light's most important qualities. The film destroys any semblance of meaning, and its CGI is weird and ridiculous. The anime is leagues better, so the live-action Death Note is not worth the watch.\nRELATED: 10 Live-Action Anime Adaptations That Ruined Their Source Material\nIn The Last Thing He Wanted, Anne Hathaway and Ben Affleck come together to create a film that largely loses track of itself. The narrative follows a journalist who gets mixed up in the middle of a series of crimes she's attempting to break the news on. Despite featuring talented actors, The Last Thing He Wanted meanders and wastes time, creating more loose ends than the movie knows what to do with.\nThe Last Days of American Crime is set in the alternative near future, where crime is running rampant, and the U.S. government is making a last-ditch attempt to stop it in its tracks. The intention is to somehow halt all crime through a broadcast. However, in the more than two hours this film takes to open up and explain its story, it manages to do nothing but run around in circles. The Last Days of American Crime delivers a series of clichés and action scenes in the process, none of which help the story overall. The film is excessively long and void of any meaningful resolution or concrete storyline.\nRelated: 10 Best Crime Movies On Netflix\nAdam Sandler has had an extensive career starring in comedy films, but his partnership with Netflix has seen a decline in the quality of his projects overall. He stars side-by-side with David Spade in The Do-Over, which sees the duo planning to fake their deaths to get a fresh start on life. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned. The identities they take on are in worse trouble than they were. The biggest issue with The Do-Over is that the level of the humor is well-suited for an audience of preteens — but it's rated TV-MA, so adults are the intended audience.\nThe Bubble proves that putting together a cast of incredibly talented actors does not guarantee a film with any level of actual quality. Karen Gillan, Pedro Pascal, Guz Khan, Keegan-Michael Key, and Leslie Mann are part of the cast that make up this flop. When a group of actors is trapped in a bubble due to the COVID-19 outbreak, they decide to continue making the film. Ultimately, the film gets lost, going deeper and deeper into the concept of a film within a film. The Bubble misses the irony it desperately tries to analyze, suggesting legendary director Judd Apatow may have been asleep at the wheel for this one.\nTall Girl already received a great deal of backlash from audiences who were not happy with the premise of setting up a girl with above-average height as something extremely unnatural and worth exploiting for a film. Ultimately, at the conclusion of the first film, characters wind up happy and more mature. However, Tall Girl 2 walks back any of that growth to make its lead character into a popular character struggling to connect with her old friends. Lack of plot, unfortunately bad acting, and manufactured drama converge to create a cash grab sequel for a film that didn't perform that well in the first place.\nJared Leto hasn't had the best track record with movies, and The Outsider unfortunately continues that trend. The 2018 film follows a former prisoner who ends up in the yakuza and begins a rampage of violent crime for his new employers. The main issue with this film is how it has no real character development. The story goes nowhere, and everything feels incredibly pointless. The opening scene is exciting, but after that first 10 or 15 minutes, the development stops. After that, it's essentially just a gore fest, making it one of the least worthwhile movies to watch on Netflix.\n"}
{"title": "1 Powerful Justice League Enemy Controls a Surprising Corner of the DCU", "date": "2023-10-05 23:00:26", "text": "The Justice League have faced some of DC's greatest threats, but a dangerously covert connection will soon have their backs to the Wall.\nWarning: SPOILERS ahead for Batman: The Brave and the Bold #5\nAs a team of the DC Universe's greatest heroes, the Justice League has no shortage of high-powered enemies looking to make their downfall a reality. From interdimensional evils like Darkseid to more street-level foes like the Key, the League has gone up against just about every big bad in the DCU.\nNow, one of their subtlest foes is working behind the scenes to hit the Justice League harder than ever before — with the surprising help of the WildStorm legacy. Batman: The Brave and the Bold #5 features the latest entry of “Stormwatch: Down With The Kings” by Ed Brisson, Jeff Spokes, and Saida Temofonte, in which the black-ops team learns that one surprising anti-Justice League figure has been controlling their every move: Amanda Waller.\nStormwatch has been collecting weapons that could take down the Justice League itself. When Ravager learns the truth, she makes it clear to Director Bones that she’s no longer taking part in their quest, especially after learning Bones is only a figurehead. Before Bones can finish spouting another lie, Stormwatch’s true commander, Amanda Waller herself, finally makes an appearance and reveals that she’s been running the team from the start.\nRelated: Marvel Finally Has Its Own Version of Justice League's Most Powerful Hero (According to Batman)\nWhile Stormwatch has been collecting weaponry with the express purpose of taking down the Justice League, they’ve been doing so under the impression that these weapons would be used only in self-defense should the more public-facing heroes of the DCU ever try taking them down. Unfortunately, as Ravager learns, that reasoning couldn’t be farther from the truth — but that lie plays exactly into Waller’s private mission throughout the current Dawn of DC era. After all, since the finale of Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Wall has been working with the Council of Light to weaken and the world’s greatest heroes, which is a mission that would benefit from an arsenal of anti-Justice League weaponry.\nThis is far from the first connection Waller has made with the grittier WildStorm corner of the DC Universe, as the Waller vs. WildStorm Black Label miniseries by Spencer Ackerman, Evan Narcisse, Jesús Merino, and Vicente Cifuentes makes clear. Waller has always been one of the publisher’s most morally flexible spymasters, so the notion that she would employ one of WildStorm’s most famous organizations, even one consisting largely of DC Comics Earth-0 characters, is totally in-line with her personal history. All in all, her moral flexibilty and willingnes to manipulate ever the darkest anti-heroes does not bode well for the future of the Justice League.\nWhen Amanda Waller sets her sight on a goal, she moves heaven and earth to make it a reality. Unfortunately, the Wall’s current goal seems to be the destruction of the DCU's greatest heroes. If the Justice League hopes to survive an onslaught at the hands of Amanda Waller and Stormwatch, they should start preparing for the worst.\nBatman: The Brave and the Bold #5 is available now from DC Comics.\n"}
{"title": "Occlumency Theory Explained: Why Harry Potter Failed (& Draco Succeeded)", "date": "2023-10-05 23:00:26", "text": "Harry Potter was never any good at Occlumency, and the reason for this may explain why Draco Malfoy found the skill so easy to perfect. \nThe Boy Who Lived never got the hang of Occlumency in Harry Potter, but this might not have had anything to do with a lack of talent. Severus Snape began teaching Harry this obscure branch of magic in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix since Dumbledore hoped it would ensure that Voldemort couldn't use his connection with Harry to gain information or possess him. Of course, these lessons went catastrophically. By the time Snape refused to continue teaching Harry, the boy hadn't come anywhere close to gaining control over his mind's security.\nThough Harry struggled with Occlumency, Draco Malfoy excelled at it. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, it was revealed that Draco had been taking Occlumency lessons from his aunt, Bellatrix Lestrange so that no one at Hogwarts would be able to determine what he was planning with the Death Eaters and Voldemort. He was ultimately very successful at this since even Snape was unable to dive into Draco's mind and figure out what he was planning. Harry was always as equally talented a wizard as Draco, if not a little more. So, why could the Slytherin boy master this skill but not the hero of Harry Potter?\nRELATED: Harry Potter And The Order of the Phoenix Ending Explained\nThe Harry Potter series demonstrated on several occasions that Harry had stronger-than-average willpower. In the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire book, Mad-Eye Moody (really Barty Crouch Jr) began teaching students about the Unforgivable Curses and tried to teach them how to protect themselves from such attacks. When he cast the Imperius Curse on his students, Harry alone could fight off the control. He did this with his will alone and fought off the Imperius Curse both this time and later when Lord Voldemort attempted to Imperius him as well.\nThis proves that Harry's lack of skill had nothing to do with his mental capacity, as Snape had suggested. Many have blamed Harry's failure at Occlumency on the professor, who never really took teaching him seriously and ultimately lost his temper and put an end to their lessons. However, the Wizarding World website suggests that Harry would have struggled with Occlumency even if he had a more patient teacher. This is because Harry was far too emotional—unable to hold back his anger at injustice and always ready to spring into action. This is part of what made him a great hero, but it takes a calmer, more cunning wizard to shut down his mind and master Occlumency.\nThis is precisely why Draco Malfoy was far more capable at Occlumency, and Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling has supported this. She stated that \"it was perfectly consistent with Draco’s character that he would find it easy to shut down emotion, to compartmentalize, and to deny essential parts of himself.\" She went on to state that Draco's upbringing, though lavish, was a fearful one. Lucius Malfoy expected the very best from his son, so weakness and excessive displays of emotion would not have been tolerated. To cope with this, Draco learned from a young age how to shut those feelings down and present a cold, strong, and proud exterior.\nIn addition, Draco was under immense pressure when he began learning Occlumency in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. He had just become a Death Eater and was eager to prove himself on the mission that, unbeknownst to him, he was always meant to fail. Therefore, when Bellatrix—who was surely a harsh teacher—began turning her nephew into an Occlumens, he would have put his all into succeeding since the alternative would have been death. On the other hand, Harry was relatively fearless when it came to Voldemort (even to a fault). Though Dumbledore told him it was necessary, Harry never feared Voldemort seeing into his mind.\nThe reason that Severus Snape was such a good double agent was because he was an expert Occlumens. Lord Voldemort was known to be an accomplished Legilimens and could confidently see into the minds of all his Death Eaters. To deceive him, Snape had to conceal his feelings for Lily and his determination to protect her son while also feeding the Dark Lord false information and memories. This took meticulous control that most wizards couldn't have managed—especially someone like Harry, who wore his feelings on his sleeves. Still, Snape wasn't always the epitome of self-control.\nIf Harry couldn't master Occlumency because of his emotional nature, then it's a surprise that Snape could. Though he always wore a calm mask in the Harry Potter movies, the books contained several instances of the Potions Master losing his cool. These weren't simple instances of a lost temper but full-on, destructive outbursts. One example is at the end of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, when Snape threw a fit because Sirius Black escaped, and no one would believe it was Harry's fault. If a man like this could master Occlumency, then Harry simply being emotional may not be a good enough reason.\nRELATED: Harry Potter - Every Clue That Snape Wasn't A Villain\nHarry's failure to learn Occlumency had major consequences in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Voldemort managed to plant false images in Harry's head of Sirius being tortured at the Department of Mysteries, and it was this that led Harry—and then the rest of the Order of the Phoenix—to the Ministry. Unfortunately, in an effort to save his godson, Sirius lost his life. Harry immediately regretted not taking Occlumency more seriously, but if it's true that it was his own emotional tendencies that kept him from being successful, he was better off not letting this go.\nYear after year, Harry became increasingly angry at the injustices of the wizarding world. When his teachers (especially Dolores Umbridge) treated the students unfairly, Harry would stand up and fight back. When the entire magical community believed he was lying about Voldemort's return, he all but yelled at the rooftops what he had seen. It was this quality that made Harry the perfect hero to stand against Lord Voldemort. Though Snape and Draco were skilled at blending in and hiding their true feelings, Harry Potter wore his own on his sleeves, and this made him impossible for the Dark Lord to control.\n"}

During their conversation, he shared an update on The Breathing Method.

Set sixteen years after the first film, the sequel finds Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri's (Zoe Saldaña) Na'vi family under the threat of a recombinant Quaritch (Stephen Lang) as they seek refuge with the aquatic Metkayina clan. During the final battle, Jake and Neytiri's oldest son Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) is fatally shot by one of Quaritch's men and dies in front of his family.\nIn a recent episode of Cinema Therapy, licensed therapist Jonathan Decker watched Neteyam's death in Avatar: The Way of Water and broke it down in detail, including Jake and Neytiri's response to the tragedy. While Neytiri becomes \"feral with grief,\" as Decker says, the therapist notes how Jake's response is different, as he blames his younger son Lo'ak for Neteyam's death. Read a portion of his commentary or watch the full video below:\nThey're both grieving. It's a petty, mean, hurtful thing to say, and it's super relatable. He blames his son for his other son's death. Which is, again, if you're in the headspace to evaluate what's really going on, you're not going to say something like that. Cut Jake some slack here, but he's still doing what he does, which is he's compassionate with his wife and he's tough on his sons.\nHe was getting to a better place. I do think it's true. We learn and we evolve and we grow, and we often do things better, as long as things are fine. We backslide into our past behaviors. Eeven though it was, as an audience member, it was frustrating and hurtful to see Jake do this late in the film. It's true to the character and it's true to how people are. It's true to human psychology. But we do need that catharsis. For there to be an arc, it has to go to a healthy place.\nAs the oldest son of Jake and Neytiri, Neteyam was expected to safeguard and care for his younger siblings. However, it is his more impulsive younger brother, Lo'ak, who convinces him to save their symbolic sibling Spider, the biological son of Miles Quaritch. Therefore, Lo'ak feels responsible for Neteyam's death and Jake, whose headspace is also clouded by grief, blames his youngest son for his oldest son's death. Neteyam's tragic death, and the resulting family dynamics, do set up a strong foundation for future character arcs in Avatar 3 and future sequels.\nAs already seen during the Avatar: The Way of Water ending, Jake and Neytiri should continue seeking retribution against Quaritch for their son's death as they attempt to put an end to his destructive rampage once and for all. Neteyam's death should also have a profound influence on Lo'ak, potentially making him more cautious about protecting his siblings or sending him down a dark path of pain and regret. The heartbreaking tragedy could also have an effect on Jake and Neytiri's other children, Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) and Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss), who will pursue their own paths of revenge or healing.\nSource: Cinema Therapy\n"}

Spoilers for X-Men #27 ahead!One of the most dangerous villains the X-Men have ever faced has plans to steal the Juggernaut’s powers and turn himself into the unstoppable Dr. Juggernaut. The events of Fall of X have put the X-Men on the back foot, with most mutants having either been killed or imprisoned. Now, one of the architects of the mutants’ catastrophic new status is prepared to make things even worse.\nX-Men #27 by Gerry Duggan, Phil Noto, VC’s Clayton Cowles, Tom Muller and Jay Bowen opens with Kate Pryde breaking into an Orchis prison and discovering Juggernaut. She provides the means for him to break out the following day, but at the end of the mission it’s revealed that his breakout attempt fails. Doctor Stasis, a version of Mister Sinister and one of the leaders of Orchis, says that Juggernaut is too dangerous to be left alive.\n“Rather than execute him, I’ve realized that magic gem of his is inside his body. I’m going to extract it surgically and then ingest it,” Stasis tells Firestar. “I hope the world is ready for Dr. Juggernaut. I’ve scheduled him for an autopsy in the morning.”\nMister Sinister and Doctor Stasis are two of the four clones that 19th century scientist Nathaniel Essex made of himself. His purpose in creating these clones was to try different methods for humanity to fight back against artificial intelligence in the future. While Sinister is a version of Essex with an X-Gene, Stasis is an ordinary human, albeit one with an abnormally long life. Believing that mutants are a greater danger than artificial life, Stasis becomes one of the leaders of the anti-mutant organization Orchis and helps orchestrate the attack on the Hellfire Gala that kicks off Fall of X.\nBoth Juggernaut and Mister Sinister have been staples of the X-Men’s rogues’ gallery for decades as formidable physical and mental threats, respectively. Cain Marko is known more for his brawn than his brain, as the powers granted to him by the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak make it so that he is literally unstoppable. With the added intellectual might of Doctor Stasis, he would be able to wield his physical strengths in genius new ways. While Stasis is a relatively new character, he has the same intelligence as Sinister, who is known for his cunning and always thinking ten steps ahead of his opponents.\nSinister recently enacted a plan to incorporate his genes into the DNA of every mutant resurrected on Krakoa, resulting in the creation of the Sins of Sinister timeline. Here, everyone on Earth became a version of Mister Sinister, and he was able to exert his power to not only take over the world, but extend his reign into the far reaches of space. He was even able to come up with a brilliant way to use Juggernaut’s abilities by turning him into a bullet that was then used to assassinate both Thanos and Galactus.\nThe one hope that Juggernaut and the rest of the X-Men have is that Stasis tells his plans to Firestar, who is working as a spy within Orchis. Firestar will need to alert her fellow mutants in order to stop him. If she is unsuccessful, then Doctor Stasis will be able to supplement his own abilities with the mystically-infused powers of the Juggernaut, a deadly combination that the X-Men would have no hope of defeating.\nX-Men #27 is on sale now from Marvel Comics.\n"}
{"title": "Future Pixar Movies Have A Major Problem, Despite Elemental's $490 Million Box Office Recovery", "date": "2023-10-05 23:40:25", "text": "Elemental managed an impressive comeback at the box office, but Pixar can't count on this happening again for its future theatrical projects. \nElemental made a spectacular comeback after its disappointing opening weekend, but Pixar still has a lot of work to do going forward. The Disney studio hasn't had a lot of luck with its films recently, and it was hoped that their element-themed romance would turn this all around. Unfortunately, Elemental's opening weekend made it look as if the film would be a box office bomb, which would be especially bad news for Pixar after other such failures. Thankfully, the studio's most recent movie made a surprising $400 million comeback. Still, Pixar can't count on this for all of its future projects.\nIn its opening weekend, Elemental only managed to bring in just under $40 million at the box office. Compared to studio successes like Toy Story 3, this is a significant flop. Still, things managed to trend upward for the film. Word of mouth really seemed to do Elemental some favors, and a surprising number of audiences turned up at theaters in the weeks that followed. Pixar's chief creative officer, Pete Docter, was thrilled (via Screen Rant) that audiences had wound up resonating with Ember and Wade as he thought they would, but it isn't lost on him that Elemental's disappointing weekend is still a problem.\nRELATED: Elemental 2 - Confirmation Chances, Release Date Prediction, Possible Sequel Story & Everything We Know\nElemental may have pulled itself together at the box office, but Pixar can't count on this happening for its upcoming new releases. This is something that Docter seems to recognize. He noted that even with Elemental's $400 million recovery, he plans to take \"another look at the projects we’re working on now\" to ensure that they meet the standard of their past successes. \"I really think I want to double down on what allowed us to speak to audiences to begin with,\" he said, still standing by his love for Elemental but noting that Pixar needs to return to its roots to avoid another close call.\nOverall, the fact that Elemental failed to bring audiences in on its opening weekend means that leading up to the film's release, people simply weren't interested. It took word-of-mouth for people to decide to hit the theaters. Though this says a lot about Pixar's marketing plan (something the studio also needs to take a closer look at), it could also come down to a loss of faith in the studio's films. After all, several of their recent movies have failed to meet audiences' expectations.\nThe pressure on Pixar might be different if Elemental was the studio's first project with a disappointing opening weekend. Lightyear (2022) only brought in $50 million when it hit theaters, but unlike Elemental, it never managed to turn these numbers around. The film has a worldwide gross of only $226 million—considerably lower than Elemental's—and is considered a critical failure as well as a box office bomb.\nOther Pixar failures were relatively well received by audiences once they started streaming on Disney+, but audiences didn't seem to think it was worth it to turn up at the theaters. Onward (2020), which holds an impressive 95-percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, only managed $141 million gross. Overall, these numbers reveal that Pixar is consistently missing the mark when it comes to predicting what stories will get audiences to buy tickets—something they used to get right consistently.\nPart of the reason for many of Pixar's failures is the decision on Disney's part to give the studio's films a simultaneous streaming release or to skip over the theatrical release altogether and jump straight to Disney+. This was the case for Turning Red, Soul, and Luca—all movies with decent critic reviews but a relatively poor return on investment. It's difficult to say why Disney deems this a good idea, but if Pixar wants to earn more theatrical releases, then it needs to take full advantage of the opportunities given.\nTo justify future theatrical releases, Pixar must prove it can make magic happen at the box office, and Elemental didn't manage this. Sure, the romance wasn't a complete failure, and its surprise recovery may allow Pixar to tread water for a time. However, if the studio's next movies continue the disappointing opening weekend trend, we will likely see a lot more Disney+ releases rather than theatrical ones. Hopefully, Docter meant it when he said that Elemental's performance has him taking a closer look at their upcoming projects because audiences are ready to see the old Pixar back in theaters.\n"}
{"title": "Reptile Ending Explained: Who The Killer Is", "date": "2023-10-05 23:48:51", "text": "Reptile is a thrilling mystery starring Benicio del Toro as a veteran detective trying to catch a killer. But who actually killed Summer?\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for Reptile.\nGrant Singer's thriller Reptile weaves a web of deception as Benicio Del Toro's Detective Nichols tracks down the killer of a young real estate agent named Summer (Matilda Lutz), and in the process uncovers department-wide corruption within the ranks of the Scarborough police force. After going through several suspects, including Summer's lover and fellow real estate agent Will Grady (Justin Timberlake), ex-husband Sam (Karl Glusman), and disgruntled neighbor Eli Phillips (Michael Pitt), he finally discovers the identity of the killer among the characters in Reptile along with their motivation for Summer's demise. Unfortunately, his revelations put him in the crosshairs of powerful players in a convoluted game of cat-and-mouse.\nWhen he brings evidence against the killer and corrupt members of his department to the chief of police, the pair pay a visit to Captain Allen (Eric Bogosian) whose been concealing the identity of the murderer the entire time. Unbeknownst to Nichols, the deception goes all the way to his superiors, and Nichols is forced to get into a shootout with his former colleagues before he can expose the entire conspiracy. Full of red herrings, plot twists, the film delivers on the hallmarks of a gripping procedural but nevertheless leaves a few lingering questions as Nichols uncovers who Reptile's \"reptile\" really is.\nIn a rather confusing flashback, it's revealed that Will Grady killed Summer. When Detective Nichols is chasing down yet another lead and trying to figure out who Rudy Rackozy called so many times on the day that Summer was killed. It isn't stated out loud but it's implied that Rudy called Will, who is seen in yet another flashback standing over Summer's barely-breathing body. Will intended to pin the crime on Summer's ex-husband, but unfortunately for him, Detective Nichols was too good at his job and traced the burner phone to Will.\nUnfortunately, this isn't the most innovative part of the plot, as the killer is often the boyfriend in thrillers like Reptile. While it's enjoyable to see Justin Timberlake play against type, his part in the film makes it feel formulaic. Fortunately, Will isn't given a villainous monologue, but at the same time, getting more scenes involving him being a little more sinister, rather than so much time wasted on Eli and other red herring suspects would have made the reveal feel more deserved.\nDetective Nichols initially thought it was suspicious that Summer sold houses for a real estate agency yet often didn't receive any commission for the sales. These sales were part of a drug laundering scheme concocted by Wally and the majority of the police in Detective Nichols' department, and Summer had started calling the FBI in preparation to tell them the truth about White Fish being a shell company. Will finds out about what she was planning to do and kills her before she can reveal how far up the corruption goes.\nThe corruption linking the police department and the shell real estate company is somewhat convoluted, but Detective Nichols starts to piece it together once he notices that contraband has been suspiciously disappearing from the department evidence room. Wally plants drugs in certain houses and then they get seized, and White Fish buys them for a fraction of their cost and makes considerable profits. Summer was the broker for these transactions and didn't know anything about it at first, but eventually, the guilt became too overwhelming.\nRELATED: Reptile: Why Judy Puts Tom's Hand In WaxProcedurals like Reptile need to get tighter as they progress, but it's at this point that the narrative gets more convoluted. A lot of loose ends are left dangling, such as why Captain Allen agreed to keep the Chrysler Imperial, seen at the scene of Summer's murder, in his garage. The \"why\" in Reptile is not as important as the \"how,\" and understanding character motivations only gets in the way of appreciating what they end up producing as far as tension and tone.\nEli Phillips is a Nostradamus-looking suspect who appears early on with a motive to kill Summer; Will Grady swindled his family out of their property, which forced Eli's father to take his own life. Eli threatens Will and he returns the favor by showing up one night in his apartment, telling him to stop sniffing around his business. He's joined by another figure who Eli seems to recognize, but they're never revealed to the audience. This person is most likely the chief of police, whose role in the entire tawdry tableau is revealed later when Detective Nichols tries to bring evidence of the corrupt officers to his attention.\nAfter the confrontation between Eli, Will, and the mysterious third intruder, Eli is never seen again in Reptile. When Detective Nichols returns to question Eli again, he finds his entire home scrubbed clean and a bottle of bleach on the counter. While the audience never sees Eli's death, it's implied that he was killed, dismembered, and his body was disposed of at a different location with no evidence left to implicate either Will or his accomplice in the crime.\nEli's fate is left open-ended and ambiguous in keeping with the shifting nature of the case. Singer purposefully makes all the characters suspicious in the beginning, particularly Eli, and including Detective Nichols himself. Eli represents one of the most obviously nefarious characters, but he's not only harmless - he cracked the case, and his death is meant to remain unknown so that fans can make up their own minds as the case progresses, constantly guessing just like Nichols, working to solve it along with him.\nReptile's intense finale is punctuated by an innocuous moment involving a frisbee hitting the large picture window where Nichols and Wally's incredibly intense confrontation is in full view. Nichols looks over to see children's noses pressed up against the glass, taking in the horrifying tableau of Wally on the ground, his own blood pooling around him, and Nichols holding his firearm. Singer has explained Reptile's frisbee scene in terms of his own position as a novice filmmaker; \"The idea is that I'm the kids playing. This is my first movie, I'm just enjoying myself, I'm just playing and this is my thing.\"\nLooked at within the context of the narrative, the frisbee is an ironic act of God that pulls Nichols, Wally, and the audience out of the moment and redirects their focus, and the horrors of what they're participating in are juxtaposed with the everyday act of children playing outside, creating a surreal space for introspection and reflection. The corruption of Wally's world, having already infiltrated friends and family, cannot be divorced from the children's incorruptible innocence operating as a deux ex machina, highlighting that everything has consequences.\nBenicio Del Toro gives an incredibly nuanced and intense performance in Reptile, using body language and long stares to communicate trauma and a wounded psyche. He's been accused of being on the take at his old department, which makes him a perfect candidate for Captain Allen's, or so Allen thinks, but Detective Nichols wants to actually have a fresh start and peace that will never come. He's asked at one point if he needs to be redeemed, a notion he becomes defensive about, but it's clear that he needs to solve Summer's murder for more reasons than simply being a thorough investigator.\nBefore her death, Summer finds a dried snakeskin, indicating all is not what it seems inside her house. The movie is called Reptile because as each character is introduced their nature changes, and after appearing to be one thing, they soon \"shed their skin\" and are revealed to be something else. Will Grady is a skittish wasp who becomes capable of stabbing his girlfriend, Wally is an avuncular poker buddy who turns out to be the kingpin in a drug scheme and tries to kill the \"rats\" bringing him down, and Detective Nichols is a perceivably corrupt cop shedding the skin of his old reputation to be an altruistic hero.\nCinematographer Mike Gioulakis crafts Reptile stylishly and makes salient use of reflective surfaces, particularly mirrors. Characters reveal key plot points, perform exposition, and question each other from within these glossy parameters, representing the way that things aren't always what they seem even when they're right in front of character's faces. It's an interesting technique that helps give Singer's thriller a distinct aesthetic and oeuvre.\n"}
{"title": "Django Unchained Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-05 23:51:23", "text": "Django Unchained has an ending that begs to be explained. Here is a deep dive into Tarantino's complex tale of love, freedom,  and redemption. \nThe complex Django Unchained ending begs for further explanation, as the story is much deeper than what it initially appears to be. Considered by many to be one of the greatest films in the Tarantino vault, Django Unchained starts as a gunslinging Western and quickly transforms into a tragic story of undying love. It's also a story of how that undying love can drive a man to darker depths than he thought possible.\nAfter their plan to fool the evil slaver Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) goes awry, Django has to shoot his way past his oppressors to set his wife free. The end of the film finds Django and Hildi riding off into the dark of night after a triumphant win from Django. Although this may seem like a happy ending, given the times and the nature of the events that just occurred, Django and Hildi may have trouble coming their way.\nThe ride off into the darkness is an ominous symbol of the dark road ahead for the couple. Not only would they have to somehow make their way out of the Deep South during a time when slavery had not yet been abolished, but Hildi and Django would also be surrounded by enemies actively hunting them for the crimes they just committed. From neighboring plantations to slave catchers and sheriffs, they'd have to keep the lowest of profiles to somehow sneak out of Mississippi unscathed and make their way up to the North to safety. Although Django could use his power of deceit to make a few allies, it's hard to imagine the couple living out their life in freedom without any consequences.\nIn the film, Candyland is a plantation in Mississippi known throughout the South for its cruelty and torture of Black people. Just the very mention of its name was enough to make Django uneasy. At the end of the third act, after Django is done shooting down every slave owner in Candyland, he takes it a step further by blowing it up with a stick of dynamite. This explosion doesn't just deliver a satisfying moment of redemption for Django's character, it's also symbolic of the concept of freedom.\nCandyland represents not just slave ownership, but oppression as a whole. Throughout the grounds, there are slaves in every room performing all sorts of unspeakable acts and being treated in the cruelest, most inhumane ways. Its destruction symbolizes the dismantling of oppressors and the idea of putting an end to enslavement once and for all, as evidenced by the film being set right before the Civil War.\nBy destroying Candyland, Django doesn't just set Hildi free, but he also frees other slaves, including Cora, Sheba, and the men who are being transported to the mines. All of their futures are tied in Candyland, and by burning it down and killing all the masters, Django sets them all free. The destruction of Candyland sends a message to onlookers and oppressors: a new future is coming, a future where the enslavement and inhumane treatment of Black people is not only unjust but will be met with consequences.\nCalvin Candie and Dr. Schultz are the polar opposites of one another. Dr. Schultz was the only White character who treated enslaved people with respect, addressing them by name and treating them like equals. He's even able to set a few free, like Django. Calvin Candie, on the other hand, is infamous for being mean, cruel, and ignorant. Not only does he prefer methods of torture, but he doesn't even see slaves as human beings. Candie genuinely views slaves as property, even watching a man get beaten to death in front of him without blinking an eye, unlike Schultz, who is visibly uncomfortable and shaken.\nIt's clear that Schultz and Candie don't like each other. They make each other uncomfortable and can not exist in the same space. One of them has to go, and when Candie calls Schultz back to shake his hand, he clearly makes the choice that it will be Schultz. At that moment, the tension between Dr. Schultz and Calvin Candie throughout Django Unchained comes to a head, and the climax is an all-out bloodbath. Although Candie insists that the handshake is just a traditional business move, the timing and context behind the request scream set up, which is why Dr. Schultz draws first blood. In the small act of a handshake, there is a greater symbolism of a shifting power dynamic, not just between the two men, but between the cruelty of oppressors and those who will rise up to defeat them in the end.\nThe moment when Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) realizes Django and Hildi know each other is the exact point in the film where things go downhill. Although this may seem like a sharp left, a reexamining of the scene gives away why it is so easy for Stephen to put two and two together. Stephen is one of Candie's most loyal servants, a traditional \"house Negro\" who enjoys privileges the other slaves don't get due to his loyalty. He is suspicious of Django and Dr. Schultz from the start, fearing they'll upset the balance of Candyland where he enjoys a relatively easy life, unlike his fellow slaves.\nKnowing the delicate nature of the situation, it is imperative that the crew be as careful as possible, for any misstep could cost them their life. But the attraction between Hildi and Django is too great, and after a tearful reunion, the two can't help but exchange a few longing glances at one another. The glances, however subtle, are evidence enough of Django and Hildi being familiar with one another, and that's the very moment that set everything in motion. If Hildi could've been assigned another task in the house, she could've avoided her public shaming and bloodbath that occurred at the plantation.\nWhen Django first tells Dr. Schultz his idea of rescuing his wife, Dr. Schultz practically takes it as a joke. The idea seems so unrealistic that he initially encourages Django to move on with his life. Then, against his better judgment, Dr. Schultz ends up accompanying Django on his impossible rescue mission. Although he claims it is because he felt responsible for Django after setting him free, a few moments in the second act show it's deeper than that.\nDr. Schultz has faith in Django's mission and truly believes that he can do it. To him, it is a matter of fate, a story written in the fairytales of German lore. Schultz knows that the bond that Hildi and Django share is too powerful and that Django will stop at nothing to achieve it; naturally, he wants to be the one to help his partner along. Schultz's compassionate heart helps him devise a clever scheme that gets him as far as the plantation–once he gets there, however, he starts to have regrets.\nWhen the reality of the situation sets in, Schultz begins to reflect on all the people who were tortured and killed to achieve Django's dream, and grows uncomfortable with the whole idea. When their cover is blown, Schultz is almost relieved that he's finally able to come clean with how much he regrets meeting Calvin Candie. It's lucky for Django that Schultz is an idealist at heart; maybe if given the chance to redo his decision, Schultz would've gone about things differently.\nTarantino is a director known for his clever use of color. Whether it's a filter or a costume, his bold use of color makes a statement about character roles and tone. Django Unchained is no exception to this rule and uses color and costumes to give the audience clues about the film's order of power.\nThroughout the movie, monochromatic costumes are often used as a symbol of importance. The powerful men in the South, like the U.S. Marshall, can be seen wearing all white or all black. The underlings tend to wear a combination of both, establishing a hierarchy through the use of color. Schultz, a man who treats everyone equally, usually wears neutral colors like gray. When characters are making a statement of status, they wear bold, bright colors, like Candie's luxurious burgundy suit and Django's royal blue ensemble.\nSince its 2012 release, there have been talks of a Django Unchained sequel, with Tarantino's plan to allegedly team Django up with the legendary sword-wielding hero Zorro. Instead, Tarantino opted to continue the story in a comic book series. However, if a sequel were to materialize on the silver screen, there are a couple of plot points it could run with.\nRight before his explosive death, Stephen yells that Django will be the one on wanted posters and that he'll be hunted down for what he did to Candyland. Django Unchained 2 could see Django go from the hunter to the hunted. As the new \"fastest gun in the south\", he could fight off those who come after him for the crimes he committed in Django Unchained. By then, he and Hildi could have started a family with gunslinging talents of their own. It would be extremely satisfying and fitting to see Hildi wield a pistol and help her beau shoot down bounty hunters.\nIG: @kysheeta_c\n\nKaillaby is a writer from NYC with a passion for anime, movies, and all things pop culture.

{"title": "14 Best Scary Movies To Stream", "date": "2023-10-05 23:57:17", "text": "With Halloween right around the corner, it's time to find the best scary movies to watch at home on streaming to get into the spooky mood.\nHorror movies have been becoming increasingly popular in recent years with some incredible remakes, sequels, and several new original stories that have made big waves. For years, horror movies were primarily enjoyed at the cinema with a group of friends as everyone gripped tightly onto their popcorn. Now, with the ease and availability of so many streaming platforms and their large libraries of content, more people are choosing to dim the lights in their own homes and snuggle up in a warm blanket to watch horror from the comfort of the couch.\nDedicated horror streaming platforms like Shudder are a good option for die-hard horror fans, but for more casual viewers getting into the spooky season, it's worth knowing what movies are available on other popular platforms. HBO Max, Peacock, and DirecTV appear to have the best selection of all-time great horror films for anyone interested in watching the classics like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, John Carpenter's The Thing, or Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street. And for even more of the best movies available right now on streaming, see the list below.\nThe Exorcist is widely regarded as one of the all-time greatest horror films ever made. Originally released in 1973 and then plagued by critical outrage from the Catholic Church seeking the film to be banned, The Exorcist drummed up a great deal of controversy while also being praised for its incredible screenplay and sound which helped to create a truly horrifying film. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and nominations in nine other categories. In The Exorcist, 12-year-old Regan becomes possessed by a demon and the film deals with the traumatic experience of trying desperately to exorcise her with the help of two priests. For keen horror fans, The Exorcist is a must-watch film available currently on HBO Max.\nPsycho has been adapted many times from the original novel by Robert Bloch, but perhaps none more famous or successful than the original 1960 film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. When a young woman's car breaks down on a quiet road, she is saved by the well-mannered young hotel owner, Norman Bates who provides her shelter and food in her dire need. The film becomes increasingly unsettling as the plot unfolds and it also contains one of the best twists in any horror to this day. Psycho is currently available to watch on Peacock.\nRelated: Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho: 10 Things That Still Hold Up Today\nStanley Kubrick's The Shining is adapted from the novel by famous horror writer Stephen King. Released in 1980, just three years after the book debuted and starred a young Jack Nicholson as a writer who takes his family along with him to care for a hotel in its off-season. Nicholson delivers an outstanding performance as a man slowly descending into madness and the story grows increasingly bizarre, tragic, and horrifying as events unfold. The Shining is now streaming on HBO Max and DirecTV.\nAlien, directed by Ridley Scott and starring a young Sigourney Weaver in the early days of her career, is another classic horror film that set the tone for what classic horror should be. Released in 1979, Alien expanded into a large franchise with many sequels and prequels, and still, more are being made now, the story of terrifying alien creatures that can infect and grow in the human body continues to be one of the most enduring and popular images in all of horror history. The first film in the franchise is currently available to watch on Hulu.\nHalloween was directed by the legendary John Carpenter who will appear on this list again. A deranged man in a mask sets out to commit violent murders around his hometown of Haddonfield and through this film and several sequels, the rampage only continues to get increasingly brutal and terrifying. The series also features Jamie Lee Curtis as possibly the most famous final girl of any horror franchise, Laurie Strode. Halloween is the classic slasher movie and perfect for getting into the Halloween spirit, available to watch with a subscription on Shudder, AMC+, or FuboTV, and free with ads on Crackle, Redbox, and Plex.\nChanging gears to a much more modern film for a moment, Get Out earned its place on this list of all-time great horrors thanks to incredible direction and vision from Jordan Peele and an outstanding performance by Daniel Kaluuya as a young black man who uncovers shocking secrets about his white girlfriend's family. The film plays on the uneasiness of this visit and the subtle challenges that may be experienced by an interracial couple with family who may not be accepting but takes this concept much further with unsettling twists and dark secrets. Get Out can be viewed on Peacock, FuboTV and FX Now with a subscription.\nRelated: Get Out's Inspirations Explained\n1982's The Thing is also directed by John Carpenter and tells the story of a group of researchers exploring Antarctica. During the course of their work, some thing begins to wreak havoc when their research is interrupted by disturbing occurrences. This creature has the ability to inhabit and imitate other beings and things get really weird, really fast. Starring Kurt Russell at the height of his career, The Thing is not to be missed and can be found on Peacock with a subscription.\nThis film from 1974 was originally marketed as being based on a true story in order to attract audiences, and it largely did that. However, the story is largely fictional with some details about the killer being inspired by the mass murderer Ed Gein. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has been remade and inspired sequels about the story which follows an isolated killer who wields a chainsaw and wears people's faces as a mask. This first installment steps up the intensity of classic slashers with a more high-powered weapon and a small group of victims to hunt down and can be seen over on Peacock with a subscription now.\nThe Silence of the Lambs starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins seeks to bring audiences deep into the mind of a twisted killer. Foster plays a young FBI agent who calls upon Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter for help on a case. The issue is, that Hannibal is himself a cannibalistic murderer. Despite his murderous tendencies, Hannibal is also brilliant, as a trained psychiatrist and capable of attuning his mind to that of other killers. Creepy and unsettling throughout, The Silence of the Lambs can be seen on HBO Max and DirecTV with a subscription now.\nEd and Lorraine Warren are experienced demonologists who assist others struggling with supernatural occurrences. During 2012's The Conjuring, they come face to face with exceedingly powerful demons and possessions that create an incredibly unsettling and disturbing film. Starring Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, The Conjuring is a dark and twisted tale that will make anyone look twice at unassuming dolls just in case something more sinister could be lurking within. Available to stream on both HBO Max and DirecTV with a subscription.\nRelated: The Conjuring Universe Complete Timeline\nThe haunting series of films that started with 2004's Saw follows the twisted games of a madman hiding behind a puppet played out by unsuspected and unwilling contestants. Jigsaw carefully selects his victims by watching people he deems to be unworthy, or perhaps not living up to their potential, and then he traps them in a fatal game, usually against other players in order to win their life and learn how to live a better, more grateful and attuned life. Some of the most gruesome and anxiety-inducing deaths in horror are played out in this series, but they are exceptionally well thought out and there's a twisted sense of morals to sink into with this series. Available to watch with a subscription on Peacock, Prime Video, Starz and FuboTV, or with ads on Tubi.\nWes Craven's literal nightmare fuel, A Nightmare on Elm Street was released in 1984. Following the terrifying Freddy Krueger who literally walks through children's dreams and kills them in their sleep, this movie is full of jump scares, and horrifying moments of the disfigured Krueger chasing children through lengthy dream corridors. This was also the film that launched Robert Englund as a horror icon and inspired dozens of parodies in pop culture. A Nightmare on Elm Street was also the first project that Johnny Depp performed in and can be seen on HBO Max with a subscription.\nScream is one of the most legendary franchises in horror with incredible stars like Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Matthew Lillard and even a brief appearance by Drew Barrymore. The series follows a series of murders in Woodsboro and eventually further afield. Scream does an incredible job of interacting with Horror as a medium with Scream first releasing in 1996 and playing with popular tropes from slashers that came before. Every installment seeks to subvert expectations and lead the viewers on a mystery manhunt to uncover the killer or killers under the Ghostface mask. Scream can be streamed on HBO Max for anyone with a paid subscription.\nX starring Mia Goth is a deeply harrowing film that follows a group of young people recording a porn film in rural Texas. The group has rented a property from an elderly couple who live on the land nearby and appear to become suspicious of what these holidaymakers are doing. The whole film creates an incredibly tense and challenging atmosphere as it deals with confronting and challenging imagery and once things start to go wrong, they go very, very wrong. The film also creatively uses Mia Goth to play both the role of the young starring actress and the older, more restricted woman to create interesting parallels and unsettling moments throughout. X can be seen on Showtime, FuboTV and DirecTV for those with a subscription.\n"}
{"title": "John Wick's Perfect Replacement Hero Debuted 2 Years Ago In This Action Movie Hidden Gem", "date": "2023-10-06 00:00:26", "text": "The future of the John Wick franchise feels increasingly unclear, but the perfect action movie replacement already hit theaters two years ago. \nJohn Wick is one of the most iconic action franchises out there, but even if John Wick: Part 5 happens, the future of the Lionsgate movies is uncertain — and there's one existing action hero who could replace Keanu Reeves' if it comes to it. Reeves made his debut as the assassin John Wick in 2014, winning the hearts of critics and general audiences alike. The success of the first John Wick movie spawned multiple sequels, as well as the less-loved TV series The Continental. John Wick: Part 4 could have served as a definitive ending for the film series, but it seems like Lionsgate isn't ready to let go yet.\nDespite John Wick 4's ending, John Wick 5 is starting to seem increasingly more likely. Additionally, the John Wick universe is expanding with spinoffs like The Continental. It's very possible the series will continue, even if it changes drastically. However, given recent developments, it's just as likely to conclude sometime in the near future. Either way, the perfect replacement for the John Wick franchise already exists; the hidden gem actually released in movie theaters two years ago.\nJohn Wick may have a hold on the action genre, but one 2021 movie has the potential to become its replacement: Nobody. Starring Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul alum Bob Odenkirk, Nobody debuted to stellar reviews, receiving an 84% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes and a whopping 94% from audiences. Nobody also fared well at the box office considering the circumstances — it released as the industry was still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic — and it's easy to see why audiences enjoyed Odenkirk's first outing as an action hero.\nNobody follows Odenkirk's Hutch Mansell, a former assassin whose deadly skills are reawakened when his home in the suburbs is broken into. The incident leads to a number of revelations, with Hutch's family eventually finding themselves in the midst of all the danger. Odenkirk gives a compelling performance as the movie's lead, and he could easily hold his own if Nobody were to become a full-fledged action franchise. Although the first movie didn't add anything particularly groundbreaking to the genre, it served as a promising and action-packed beginning to a story that could take over when the John Wick craze fades.\nAlthough John Wick doesn't need a replacement just yet, the franchise's future is feeling less certain. There are a few reasons for that, but the most obvious goes back to John Wick 4's ending. The most recent installment of the series concluded with Reeves' titular hero supposedly perishing during a face-off with Donnie Yen's Caine. It's possible the Baba Yaga faked his own death. However, if Reeves' character truly is gone, it'll be difficult for John Wick: Part 5 to keep the franchise going. The lead character — and the actor who plays him — is the main draw, so it's hard to see the series faring nearly as well without him.\nAnd while John Wick's franchise future could lean into spinoffs, prequels, and sequels, that approach may not be as promising as it once seemed. After all, The Continental attempted to explore the world of John Wick from a different perspective, but the 2023 series didn't capture the heart of the films. The Continental reviews are so much worse than the John Wick movies, suggesting that a future without the title character isn't so bright. With that in mind, the world may soon be in need of a new action hero.\nIf Nobody hopes to compete with — or even replace — John Wick, it will need to return with an equally compelling sequel. Fortunately, Nobody 2 is already in the works. Nobody 2 producer Kelly McCormick told Collider that, if everything goes as planned, production on the sequel should begin sometime in 2024. Writer David Leitch has been working on the script, and Odenkirk seems confident and eager to return.\nThe ending and post-credits scene of Nobody certainly leaves the door open for another go-round. Hutch hasn't addressed his inner conflict fully by the time Nobody comes to a close, and the character will need more screen time to make the decision the story is building to: should he forego his life as an assassin for his family or try to embrace both personas? This is an internal struggle that sets Nobody apart from John Wick, and it could become the action genre's next big focus.\nSource: Rotten Tomatoes, Collider\nAmanda Mullen is an entertainment writer with a passion for all things books, films, and television.

{"title": "New Stephen King Horror Movie Continues 36-Year Failure, Confirming Harsh Reality For Spinoffs", "date": "2023-10-06 00:00:26", "text": "Not even Stephen King's new horror movie can break free from a decades-long failure. Here's why not even the King of Horror can save it. \nStephen King's new horror movie Pet Sematary: Bloodline is continuing a decades-long failure that not even the King of Horror can avoid, and its performance at the box office is confirming a harsh reality for spinoffs of his original works. There have been plenty of Stephen King movie and TV remakes that have been done well, but when it comes to derivative projects, they don't seem to succeed as well. Not even following the intriguing character of Jud Crandall, and finding out the origins of the mystical burial ground introduced in the first Pet Sematary can make the film shine.\nEven working with a foundation rooted in King's works, sequels to his stories don't seem to draw nearly the sort of audience that material from his own imagination does. Beginning with A Return To Salem's Lot in 1987 and continuing with Pet Sematary 2 in 1992, movies that continue the world created in classic King novels never seem to find their footing with even his most ardent fans. In the shadow of their predecessors, a lot of pressure rides on their successfully recreating what made the originals so good, and based on everything we know about Pet Sematary: Bloodline, it's trying to tell its own story.\nDespite having an intriguing premise and promising to answer a plot hole that's plagued fans of Pet Sematary for 40 years, even Pet Sematary: Bloodline continues a negative trend of movies that are derivative of King's original books and stories. It follows Jud and his first encounter with the burial ground, something he explains many decades later to Louis Creed as he mourns the death of his family's cat and wonders how to return the smile to his young daughter's face. Jud encourages using the burial ground's power despite it being a \"curdled place\" because he wants to teach the girl that \"sometimes dead is better.\"\n Besides the odd choice to violate the natural order of things in order to enforce morals on someone else's child, fans have always wondered why Jud told Louis about the burial ground if he knew the consequences of burying anything there, and the film doesn't really answer that question, though it has many of the same thrills and chills of the original film. Lindsey Anderson Beer’s film only makes Jud's actions later seem more erratic than ever, and the low success of Pet Sematary: Bloodlines indicates that spinoffs and prequels only work when King himself is behind the story.\nDisregarding It: Chapter Two, which is simply the second part of one (albeit giant) Stephen King book, Doctor Sleep seems to be the only Stephen King movie sequel that has worked. Starring Ewan McGregor as an adult Danny Torrance, it centers on him healing from his traumatic experiences at the Overlook Hotel, exploring the supernatural power known as \"the shining\" introduced in King's novel by the same name, and Danny's relationship with a young teen who shines the same way that he does, and whose light has attracted more malevolent entities.\nOne of the main reasons why the movie works so well, aside from McGregor's magnetic performance and its truly immersive horror experience, is the fact that King had written the sequel it was based on. This helped create a solid foundation for its story, and it's no wonder why the movie clocks in at nearly three hours - the screenplay left none of King's world-building out the way Stanley Kubrick's The Shining did. Pet Sematary: Bloodline largely tries to do its own thing and flounders the most when it tries to sync up with King's book, ultimately failing because it doesn't answer any of the questions a prequel origin story should.\n"}
{"title": "DC Admits Jason Momoa Would Nail a Major Upcoming MCU Role", "date": "2023-10-06 00:00:26", "text": "DC pokes playful fun at the casting rumors surrounding Jason Momoa — including the possibility that he could play one major upcoming MCU role.\nWarning! Contains spoilers for DC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1!\nWith DC currently gearing up for a new cinematic universe, plenty of casting rumors are spinning — including the fate of the DCEU's Aquaman, Jason Momoa, who is often fancast as DC's Main Man, Lobo. In a new short story for Halloween, Lobo's daughter Crush points out his perfect MCU counterpart as well: Wolverine.\nThis surprising comparison takes place in the story \"Happy Hal(Lobo)ween!\" by Hans Rodionoff, Adam F. Goldberg, Danny Earls, Patricio Delpeche, and Dave Sharpe from DC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1. Lobo crashes his daughter's apartment to force her to help him come up with the perfect Halloween costume. This involves Crush trying to point Lobo towards Hugh Jackman's famous portrayal of Wolverine, but, due to legal issues, she can't outright say this.\nThis leads Lobo to dress up as a litany of Hugh Jackman characters, but never the iconic X-Men character. Finally, exhausted by her father, Crush suggests she dress up as the other superhero that Lobo bears a striking resemblance to: Aquaman.\nRelated: DC's Answer to Wolverine Gets Even More Savage With New Zombie Form\nLobo is one of the more extreme characters from the '80s and '90s, and a lot of fans believe that Lobo was DC's answer to Marvel's Wolverine. Lobo is an absolutely absurd satire of both over-the-top masculinity and action heroes in general. He's a wise-cracking bounty hunter who perpetually has a lit cigar in his mouth, and he travels around space on a skull-adorned motorcycle. It's obvious why Lobo is such a beloved character considering how ridiculous he is. Despite how beloved and popular Lobo is with fans, he's never been adapted into any live-action movies, and the idea of who would play him is a heated debate. It seems DC has not only confirmed who could play Lobo on the big screen — but also who could possibly play the MCU's Wolverine.\nOne of the most popular fan casts for Lobo is none other than Jason Momoa, who also plays Aquaman in the ill-fated DCEU. This fan cast is so popular that the actor has even responded to it, and it seems DC is completely aware of the demand. In this year's Halloween story, after Crush gets exhausted trying to get Lobo to dress up as Wolverine, she instead points him to dress up as Aquaman, which is a cute reference to both the actor's and fans' desire to see Momoa play Lobo. While Lobo doesn't believe he has any resemblance to Aquaman at all, he's only thinking of the Arthur Curry of the DC Universe. The version of Aquaman played by Momoa looks a lot closer to the Main Man.\nDC is well aware that fans want Momoa to play Lobo, and the actor himself is even up to the task. But, in admitting that Lobo shares a striking resemblance to both Aquaman and Wolverine, the publisher has revealed that, if Momoa can't ever play Lobo, then maybe he will find himself on the big screen playing the iconic Wolverine for the ever-expanding MCU instead.\nDC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1 is on sale now from DC Comics!\n"}

Known by millions for his sensational skills on the soccer field, David Beckham, along with his equally famous wife Victoria, has been in the spotlight for decades both on and off the pitch. Beckham rose to prominence as a loyal member of Manchester United, one of the greatest professional soccer clubs in the history of the Premier League. He started dating Victoria Adams in 1997 following her success as a singer in the popular Spice Girls group.\nBeckham aims to shine a light on David and Victoria's lesser-known qualities while revealing several new details on their careers and relationship history in the process. While everybody now recognizes the name Beckham, the documentary provides previously inaccessible coverage of the intricacies of what it's actually like to be David Beckham. The Netflix doc also chronicles David's humble beginnings and the internal battles that the superstar faced through the most intense and demanding parts of his celebrated career. David retired from soccer in 2013, fourteen years after marrying Victoria. Here are the ten biggest reveals from the four-partNetflix miniseries Beckham.\nRELATED: Untold Johnny Football – 10 Biggest Reveals About Manziel's Rise & Fall In Netflix's Documentary\nBeckham's first episode opens up with scenes of David Beckham tending to his bee farm fulling clothed in beekeeper's attire. He collects honey very naturally and hands some over to director Fisher Stevens, who is just as impressed as the viewing audience likely is. Outside of soccer, which Beckham has not played professionally in over ten years, beekeeping is just one of David's many hobbies that he enjoys regularly. Another favorite pastime of David's is to collect and assemble Legos. He unsurprisingly also loves to shop and invest in luxury items such as designer watches.\nBefore one of the most infamous games in David Beckham's career, Victoria revealed in Beckham that she told David that she was pregnant with their firstborn and eldest son Brooklyn. Victoria called David to tell him the news while he was in France awaiting a hotly contested matchup with the powerful Argentinian National team while she was in Brooklyn, New York, which inspired the name choice. Victoria reveals that while she and David were both incredibly happy about the news, she did not think much about how it would affect David going into one of the biggest games of his life.\nBefore David ever met Victoria in real life, he pointed her Spice Girls persona out on TV one day and announced that he was going to marry her. Beckham recalls being with former teammate Gary Neville and stating that he would marry \"the posh one\" in the future. Gary, of course, thought he was joking and started to laugh at David's earnestness. David soon proved to be incredibly serious about Victoria, who he knew nothing about at the time. By some magic, David turned out to be spot-on with his fortune-telling and he and Victoria have been together ever since.\nRELATED: 10 Biggest Reveals About Jason & Travis In Amazon's Kelce Documentary\nDavid and Victoria's marriage fell into very hot water when allegations surfaced about David's alleged infidelity with a former assistant of his by the name of Rebecca Loos. Loos came forward to the press that she and David had an affair that lasted four months when he first traveled to play in Spain for Real Madrid. David has always denied the allegations and Victoria has supported him, although both admit that it was the hardest part of their marriage by far. David recalls in the Beckham documentary that he is grateful that he and Victoria were able to come out of the difficult situation with their marriage intact.\nAfter the notorious incident in which David Beckham was ejected from the 1988 World Cup game against Argentina, he revealed that he was depressed after all of the public and media hate he received as a result. David recalls feeling hated by the entire country of England and not knowing how to handle all of the relentless public ridicule. Every time David would go anywhere in public, people would spit and cuss him out with fierce and intense hatred which left David feeling incredibly broken. David claims in Beckham that he was never quite the same after experiencing such public backlash on a national scale.\nDavid reveals in Beckham that he had a terrible spending habit when he first came into wealth. David is currently worth roughly $450 million so his early spending days did not do much to set him back financially. Beckham reveals that David's first paychecks that he revived on a Friday were typically gone by the following Saturday. He loved to spend his money on luxurious items, clothes, and even a brand-new BMW M3 from an Adidas endorsement deal. Considering Beckham's humble beginnings, it's hard to blame Beckham for indulging in the finer things.\nRELATED: Untold Hall Of Shame: The BALCO Drug Scandal & What Happened To Major Athletes After Investigation\nDavid's former soccer coach Sir Alex Ferguson expressed disapproval that David was starting to date Victoria Adams when he was still just a young player on Manchester United. Ferguson believed that dating a celebrity might steer David off the right path of becoming the world-class soccer player he could be. He instructed David not to take any photos together with Victoria in order to maintain their privacy. David obeyed and initially dated Victoria in secret, meeting in places like parks and avoiding the lurking eye of the paparazzi.\nDavid reveals that he charged his former Manchester United coach Alex Ferguson after the manager kicked a cleat at David, hitting him just above the eye. What was later revealed to be a freak accident and completely unintentional, an angry Ferguson kicked the soccer cleat at David which resulted in him apparently getting stitches. The following season, David was traded to Real Madrid, which was when his life began to spiral out of his control. He reveals in Beckham he never got to properly say goodbye to Ferguson.\nOne of the most unsettling revelations in Beckham is the horrific truth that David and Victoria received random threats that their newborn son Brooklyn would be kidnapped. These threats arose due to the lingering public hatred towards David after he was sent off in the 1998 World Cup. David recalls being afraid to leave the hospital in Beckham, sleeping up against the hospital room door where Victoria was staying. The couple recalls how they were somewhat robbed of the joy of their first newborn because of the intense paranoia circling around Daviid and the angry public.\nA lighthearted moment in Beckham arrives when Victoria recalls the instance in which David nearly missed the birth of his third son Cruz because he was tied up at a photo shoot with Jennifer Lopez. While the couple can laugh about it now in the Netflix documentary Beckham, David had cut it a little too close for Victoria to feel comfortable that he would be at the hospital with her when Cruz was born. In David's defense, he asked his wife what Posh would do, which ended up being one of the funniest moments in the four-part miniseries.\n"}
{"title": "The Exorcist: Believer Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-06 00:51:10", "text": "The Exorcist: Believer builds to a final exorcism to deliver an ending with twists and sequel setup. Here's everything that happens and what it means.\nWarning: Contains SPOILERS for The Exorcist: Believer!\nThe Exorcist: Believer's ending revolves around a final exorcism to save Katherine and Angela's lives, and the event includes major revelations, death, and set up for a new trilogy of movies. Picking up almost 50 years after the original The Exorcist's story, the sequel shifts the franchise's focus to new families whose lives are changed when their daughters become possessed by demons. This brings Victor (Leslie Odom Jr.) to find Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) in the hope that she'll help the two families save the young girls. Ultimately, the fate of the girls is put in the hands of their parents and various spiritual leaders.\nIt is no surprise that The Exorcist: Believer builds to a final exorcism that puts the fates of Katherine (Olivia O'Neill) and Angela (Lidya Jewett) in the balance. This comes after Angela is confined to a mental institution while Katherine's parents attempt to help her at home. Chris is absent from the final exorcism after being stabbed in the eyes by Katherine, but she encourages Victor to recruit different people from all types of backgrounds and religious beliefs to help perform the final exorcism. The entire story wraps up rather neatly as there is no The Exorcist: Believer post-credits scene, but the final revelations still leave room for sequels.\nThe final exorcism in The Exorcist: Believer takes place at Victor's house. Katherine and Angela are both brought to the location after it is fitted for an exorcism. Victor is joined by Katherine's parents, the pastor at Katherine's church, Victor's nurse neighbor who previously wanted to be a nun, a local root doctor, and another one of Victor's neighbors who believes in God. The plan immediately goes awry when the Catholic priest tells them he cannot lead the exorcism as promised, but he passes leadership to the nurse, Ann (Ann Dowd).\nThe initial attempts to get the demon out of the girls are unsuccessful, as they mock Ann for her past, but the root doctor helps turn the night around. This leads to the demon revealing an impossible choice has to be made among the people in attendance; they must choose which girl lives and which one dies. The demon states that only one of them will survive, which connects to a deadly decision from Victor's past. While Victor and Katherine's mom Miranda (Jennifer Nettles) agree that they cannot and will not make that choice, Katherine's dad Tony (Norbert Leo Butz) panics and tells the demon he chooses Katherine to live.\nRelated: When Will The Exorcist: Believer Release On Streaming?\nIt initially appears as if Tony's decision is accepted by the demon, as Angela begins to float in the air before collapsing on the ground with no heartbeat and Katherine begins talking and looking like normal. However, this is where the demon's deceitful nature comes into play, as Angela begins to breathe again but Katherine dies. While attempts are made to save Katherine's life, she is taken away from the world of living. The death choice made by Tony in The Exorcist: Believer mirrors the one Victor made in his past, where who is chosen to live actually dies.\nOne of the big revelations in how The Exorcist: Believer ends goes back to the movie's opening sequence which results in the death of Victor's wife. An earthquake in Haiti leaves his pregnant wife with severe injuries, and Victor is told that he must make a difficult decision to choose between keeping his wife or unborn baby girl alive. His wife's wish was for him to protect the child at all costs, and the fact that Angela is alive after the 13-year time jump indicates that he followed through.\nIt is only during the exorcism that the demon reveals to everyone that Victor actually chose to save his wife instead of Angela, but the baby survived the operation instead. The revelation that Victor chose his wife over Angela recontextualizes much of their relationship. This is not something that Angela knew on her own, but it does explain why Victor is so protective and watchful over her now. The Exorcist: Believer's scary focus means there is no time for Victor and Angela to talk about the revelation after she gets better, but it would not be surprising if this puts a strain on their relationship going forward if she remembers.\nAngela surviving the exorcism leaves her with a clear fate as she returns to school, but where Katherine ends up in The Exorcist: Believer is more tragic. The movie indicates that she is pulled to Hell after her death. Katherine is shown in the woods again before she begins to be pulled underwater by many hands. This appears to be a visual representation of Katherine being taken to Hell by demons after she is tricked into being the sacrifice. It is unclear if The Exorcist: Believer is the last the franchise will show of Katherine or if her experience in Hell will factor into the sequel somehow.\nThe biggest surprise of the movie's ending is Linda Blair's return as Regan in The Exorcist: Believer. The movie makes multiple references to what happened to Regan after The Exorcist, but she is not an active part of the story. Her fate is instead left as a lingering mystery for most of the runtime. Thankfully, The Exorcist: Believer confirms Regan is alive and well by bringing Linda Blair back for a quick cameo. Regan is shown reuniting with Chris in the hospital during one of the final scenes. The appearance is an indication that viewers could see much more of Regan in The Exorcist: Deceiver.\nOne story point in The Exorcist: Believer that could create some confusion is the identity of the main demon that possesses Katherine and Angela. It is never named, but there are references made that the demon knows Chris and that she's encountered this spiritual being before. Despite the implication that The Exorcist: Believer's demon is Pazuzu, it has been confirmed that this is not the case. Director David Gordon Green revealed as much during interviews pre-release (via IGN), noting that the sequel has a new demon. However, he refuses to confirm the identity of the new demon, and The Exorcist: Believer does not confirm it either.\nThe fact that Angela's life is saved in The Exorcist: Believer might also have more to it than meets the eye. During the final moments, flashes of the blessing of protection Angela's mom gets while she is still pregnant are shown. This could mean that the blessing is actually what saved Angela's life, making the parallels to Victor's death choice before a coincidence. This would mean that the blessing is strong enough to prevent the demon from killing Angela but still allows her to be possessed. Ultimately, it is up to each viewer to decide which reading they want to believe.\nConsidering Universal announced The Exorcist: Believer as the start of a new trilogy, it is no surprise that the ending leaves the door open for its sequel. The follow-up is confirmed to be called The Exorcist: Deceiver, which indicates that there is more to what audiences witness here. The pastor specifically calls the demon a deceiver after the initial proposal of the death choice, so that could be a sign that Katherine and Angela's fates are not quite as sealed as believed. In any case, there is no doubt that the demon will return in some form, possibly pulling on the grief Katherine's parents struggle with.\nThe Exorcist: Deceiver's story is also sure to build on Chris and Regan's reunion too. The decision to bring Linda Blair back for a quick scene is certainly meant to get audiences excited to have her and Ellen Burstyn play bigger roles in the sequel. Both actresses had plenty of input on The Exorcist: Believer, and while their roles in the sequel are not yet officially confirmed, the intention is rather clear. The question then becomes if The Exorcist: Deceiver will fully shift the franchise's focus back to the MacNeil family or if Victor, Angela, and others will remain prominently featured.\nThe meaning of The Exorcist: Believer's ending is one of hope and belief. Despite it being a horror movie about the demonic possession of two young girls that features brutal deaths, The Exorcist: Believer leaves audiences with a message that believing in the good, and even God, is what everyone needs. It is seemingly only after Victor believes that the exorcism can work and reconnects with his daughter through his wife's scarf that his attitude and her fate begin to change. If there is any doubt about The Exorcist: Believer's true meaning of hope and belief, the final voice-over monologue provided by Ann Dowd makes it clear.\nSource: IGN\n"}

In the second episode, before her date with Gerry, Theresa admitted that she was thrilled beyond belief to receive it, but also \"a little scared.\" She shared that Billy was the love of her life, and she wondered if she could find that again. Theresa's story is very similar to Gerry's, and they bonded over their losses on their date.\nTheresa got married to Billy when she was 18 years old. He was drafted during the Vietnam War, and came home to be in his brother's wedding. They got married with two days' notice. They were high school sweethearts, and began dating when Theresa was 14 and Billy was 16. They were married for 42 years. Tragically, Billy passed away because, as Theresa told Gerry, his kidneys were \"not good.\" He'd always had hope of having a kidney transplant.\nHowever, tragically, one day when Theresa was at work, Billy suddenly took a turn for the worse. She ran home, and watched him take his last breath. Theresa shared in her confessional that, before Billy died, he told her that he hoped she would find someone and get married again. She said that she knew that if Billy were there, he'd tell her to just go for it with Gerry.\nAccording to her ABC bio, Theresa says she is \"optimistic, encouraging, and ready to love again after loss.\"  In addition to spending time with her family, Theresa likes playing board games, gardening, reading romance novels, and hula-hooping. She also loves to sing, but alone in her car, and she loves '70s soft and hard rock. Theresa also taught herself all about the stock market. Theresa can be found on Instagram at @theresa_nist.\nRelated: Does First Impression Rose Winner Faith Martin Win The Golden Bachelor? (Spoilers)\nAccording to Reality Steve, Theresa is one of Gerry's final two women, so it's possible that she did win The Golden Bachelor. She filmed her hometown date on August 23. Theresa's fellow contestants Faith Martin and Leslie Fhima also received hometown dates, which filmed on August 19 and August 21, respectively. Faith was eliminated after her hometown date, leaving Theresa and Leslie as Gerry's final two women.\nThe Golden Bachelor's Theresa and Gerry have a strong connection, built on their shared sense of loss, but also their hope for the future. Their love story has had a beautiful beginning, so hopefully they'll leave the show together and in love in the end. Gerry and Theresa seem perfect for each other.\nThe Golden Bachelor airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. EDT on ABC.\nSource: ABC, Theresa Nist/Instagram, Reality Steve/Instagram\n"}

The second season of Tom Hiddleston's solo Disney+ series was announced on July 14, 2021, during Loki's season 1 finale, and is set to follow on from the events of the first season, which saw the eponymous God of Mischief exploring the Time Variance Authority (TVA), dealing with multiversal variants of himself, and coming face-to-face with Jonathan Majors' He Who Remains, a variant of Kang the Conqueror. The post-credits scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania teased the storyline for the next season of the MCU show, especially by teasing one of the new characters in the Loki season 2 cast.\nLoki's season 1 finale ended with Sylvie, played brilliantly be Sophia Di Martino, killing He Who Remains, which created thousands of branching timelines, and trapping Loki in a very different version of the TVA, ruled over by Kang the Conqueror himself rather than the fictitious Time Keepers. While Loki season 2 is set to introduce Victor Timely, another Kang variant, to the franchise, the MCU will also be blessed with the debut of Ke Huy Quan, fresh off a win for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards for his role in Everything Everywhere All At Once.\nRelated: Loki Season 1 Ending & Future Set-Up Explained\nKe Huy Quan assumes the role of Ouroboros in Loki season 2, confirming the rumors before the show's release that this would be his character. Quan is a brilliant addition to the MCU, having been featured as Short Round in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom when he was only twelve, and appearing as inventor Richard \"Data\" Wang a year later in The Goonies. After taking a lengthy break from acting, Quan returned as Waymond Wang in Everything Everywhere All At Once opposite Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, and Jamie Lee Curtis.\nKe Huy Quan's Ouroboros is revealed to be the chief engineer of the TVA - and, in fact, their only engineer. As such, he's responsible for the upkeep and repair of all of the faction's tools, including their time travel devices, which gives him some complicated tech to take care of. Luckily, OB is both shown to be an outright genius, and committed to his work, as the first episode of Loki season 2 sees him spend 400 years toiling away without a single visitor - until Loki himself appears.\nThere are a few different representations of Ouroboros in the pages of Marvel Comics. The Oculus Oroboros is introduced as a conduit of elemental magic, that depicts a variation on the classic ouroboros shape of a snake eating its tail by featuring a second snake. Doctor Doom once attempted to harness the power of the Oculus Oroboros, though was stopped by Doctor Strange. There is also an Admiral Ouroboros, who appeared in 2015's Silver Surfer Vol. 7 #11, depicted as an antagonistic character who comes face-to-face with the Silver Surfer after the latter becomes trapped in a time loop, reminiscent of Groundhog Day or Palm Springs.\nIt's unclear whether these idea will translate into Loki season 2, though the TVA's time-twisting technology has already been shown to trap individuals in time loops, as Loki was berated by Lady Sif over and over again as punishment. Interestingly, the time loop that the Silver Surfer finds himself in is referred to as a Möbius strip - Owen Wilson's Loki character is named Mobius M. Mobius, and Tony Stark utilized an inverted Möbius strip to crack time travel in Avengers: Endgame. It's possible that this time loop theme could play a major role in Loki season 2, but the name Ouroboros could also suggest a deeper connection to Loki himself.\nThe shape of an ouroboros is depicted as a snake forming a circle, with the end of its tail in its mouth. This image has roots in Ancient Egyptian and Ancient Greek iconography, but also has a deep connection to Norse Mythology, on which most of Thor and Loki's MCU storylines are based. In Norse Mythology, the ouroboros is formed by Jörmungandr, otherwise known as the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent, an unfathomably large snake-like creature that resides in the world sea, and is large enough to encircle the entire Earth and bite its own tail. Legend notes that when Jörmungandr releases its tail, the catastrophic Ragnarök event will occur.\nWhat deepens the mystery, however, is the fact that the Midgard Serpent is actually one of Loki's own children in Norse Mythology, along with Hel, the Goddess of Death, and the wolf Fenrir, both of whom were adapted for Thor: Ragnarok, though Cate Blanchett's Hela was Loki's sister in the MCU. In Norse Mythology, Thor often has run-ins with Jörmungandr, engaging in epic battles with the serpent, even fighting to the death during Ragnarök. It's unclear how much of this will be adapted by Ke Huy Quan in Loki season 2, but it could even point to a deeper link between Quan's character and the God of Mischief himself.\nNew episodes of Loki season 2 release every Thursday on Disney+\n"}

Frank Herbert's seminal 1965 sci-fi novel has been adapted to the screen several times starting with David Lynch's Dune from 1984, which was a critical and commercial failure and was disowned by the director due to studio interference. In 2000, a three-part miniseries officially titled Frank Herbert's Dune aired on the Sci-Fi Channel. Villeneuve's Dune, with the first film released in 2021, has become the definitive adaptation due to its critical and commercial success.\nAhead of the Dune: Part Two release date in March 2024, the Dune miniseries director spoke to ComicBook.com and shared his praise for Villeneuve's movies. Harrison, who wrote and directed the Dune miniseries, says he is \"very excited\" about what Villeneuve is doing with the story and hopes it will introduce newcomers to his previous adaptation. Read what he shared below:\nI'm very excited about it. Richard Rubenstein and I were still involved in the development of several attempts to try and get it off the ground after my miniseries. And maybe fortunately, some of those never came to pass because I think what Denis Villeneuve has done is just fantastic. And I love him as a director. I wasn't involved at all in the latest movies except to have my name put up there. But I think it's just fantastic and I'm really looking forward to the new ones.\nAnd I hope it does introduce a whole new audience to the Dune world. If they are able to get back and see my miniseries, I'm very proud of them. We were able to ... I think the success of them, they won a couple of Emmys and they were hugely successful here and abroad. I think they gave people faith that Dune actually could be adapted again.\nThe Dune miniseries was generally well-received by critics and audiences. At the time, it was considered a vast improvement over Lynch's Dune, which tried to cram the entire story, including all its intricate mythology and sprawling scope, into a single 2-hour 17-minute movie. However, it's worth mentioning that Lynch's preferred cut was three hours. Nevertheless, the Dune miniseries functioned better as an adaptation with a total runtime of 265 minutes. Today, the Dune miniseries still stands among the highest-rated programs ever broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel. As Harrison mentions, it also won two Emmys for Outstanding Cinematography and Visual Effects.\nBy breaking the book up into two parts, Villeneuve's movies adopted a similar approach as the miniseries, which is probably why Harrison appreciates them so much. Similarly, Villeneuve's Dune won several Oscars for its technical accomplishments, including cinematography, visual effects, production design, and sound. Villeneuve and Harrison's Dune adaptations actually have much in common, so it's possible the movies could bring new viewers to the miniseries, as the director hopes. However, one should temper their expectations considering the miniseries is now over 20 years old and was made on a fraction of the budget for $20 million.\nSource: ComicBook.com\n"}

More recently, it also tied with Netflix’s Ozark for spending the longest time atop Nielsen’s Top 10 Overall Charts.\nPer The Hollywood Reporter, Suits can now officially add this new record to its ever-growing list of accolades, as finally overtook Ozark’s 11-week record thanks to the legal drama’s 12 consecutive weeks in the top slot. Making the feat even more impressive, Suits achieved its record in a single continuous streak, while Ozark had previously held its title spread across multiple season releases.\nWhile Suits’ original 2011 release was a success for USA Network, earning favorable reviews and strong viewership numbers, the show’s popularity gradually waned following the departure of key cast members such as Meghan Markle and Patrick J. Adams. Nonetheless, the show’s recent resurgence on streaming reveals the enduring appeal of its quick wit and largely formula-driven narratives. However, the timing of Suits' continued record-breaking streak on streaming television coincides perfectly with many important conversations currently taking place about streaming services and the equity of continuing residuals paid to actors and creatives.\nEarlier this year, Suits writer Ethan Drogin admitted that while he was elated to see the show’s resurgence on Netflix and Peacock, he had earned less than $300 in streaming residuals despite its overwhelming success. While the Writers Guild of America has recently come to an agreement with streaming services, which includes a dramatic new performance-based pay bonus structure for writers, members of SAG-AFTRA are still currently waiting to see the outcome of their own ongoing strike action.\nWhile Suits’ recent resurgence in popularity may have no direct connection to the wave of industrial action sweeping through Hollywood, its timing perfectly demonstrated many of the growing inequities that industry guilds were attempting to challenge. Perhaps once the recent public interest in Suits begins to die down, the show’s enduring legacy will come to mean much more than its growing collection of streaming records.

Following directly on from the daring mission to pull Tom Hiddleston's Loki out of the timeline and stop his time-slipping, the first Loki season 2 stinger is also an important one.\nLoki season 2 has already started off strongly, with a complicated storyline injected with a lot of scientific jargon (not least from Ke Huy Quan’s Ouroboros). It’s also very obvious that the show is less interested in tying to wider MCU timeline events, and focusing instead on the continued battle for the Sacred Timeline set up by Loki season 1’s ending. But that doesn’t mean all MCU traits are out the window, with the post-credits scene offering that element of familiarity.\n Watch Loki On Disney+\nAfter the credits role on Loki season 2 episode 1’s ending and Loki has avoided being spaghettified or lost in time, the post-credits scene flips back to Sophia Di Martino’s Sylvie in the immediate aftermath of He Who Remain's death. Sylvie transports herself to 1982, enters a McDonalds (perfectly rebuilt from the early 1980s designs, including the freakish cartoon tree), speaks to the young manager and orders one of everything on the menu. Quite how she pays for all of those burgers, fries and nuggets is anyone's guess, but since the marketing has spoiled that Sylvie ends up working at the same McDonalds, maybe she's forced initially to do so to pay off the fast food debt. Or she uses magic.\nRelated: How Powerful Each Loki Variant Really Is (& Who Is The Strongest)\nAs confirmed by the Loki season 2 episode 1 post-credits scene, Sylvie didn't stay in the Citadel at the End of Time after killing Jonathan Majors' He Who Remains in season 1's finale. Having completed her mission, she did exactly as Thanos did, seeking her own personal peace, by leaving and jumping somewhere else in the timeline. Sylvie's outfit all but confirms that the McDonalds scene happens immediately after He Who Remains' death.\nThe question most will have watching the Loki season 2 episode 1 post-credits scene is why McDonalds and why 1982. For the first answer, you have to consider Sylvie's tragic origin story. As she reveals in Loki's Lamentis episode, the TVA attempted to prune her when she was roughly ten years old in human terms (but a lot older as a Frost Giant). She flees and spends the rest of her life on the run, which, judging by the life-span of Frost Giants (at least around 5000 years), would mean she'd probably been on the run for thousands of years. She never got her chance of her truly formative years, which would have included simple pleasures like the Asgardian equivalent of McDonalds.\nSylvie seems drawn to McDonalds because of the same wonder that made the fast food giants so popular with children. It's a simple, almost naive pleasure, completely in contrast with Sylvie's life of fight and flight. Sylvie has also never been able to enjoy anything, constantly looking over her shoulder and having to move everywhere to keep ahead of the TVA. Being able to go somewhere as innocuous as McDonalds and not be worried about how conspicuous she is in her Asgardian outfit, which she noticeably doesn't disguise, is a huge indication that she believes she's beaten the TVA.\nRelated: How Old Is Sylvie Compared To Loki?\nLoki season 2 episode 1 suggests that Loki time slips because Sylvie kicks him back into the past from the Citadel at the End of Time before she kills He Who Remains. Because he was previously pruned - i.e. removed from the timeline - his presence back on the timeline causes a glitch, sending him randomly slipping through time without warning. In contrast, Sylvie was never pruned - or at least wasn't \"deleted\" using one of the TVA time sticks - so is able to go back to the timeline in 1982 without the same danger of time slipping.Related: Why Loki Is Glitching In Season 2: Time-Slipping Explained\nSylvie's choice of the small town of Broxton, Oklahoma for her new home may not seem to have any significance in Loki's TV show lore, but it is an important site in Marvel Comics, which suggests it may be some sort of nexus location in wider Marvel lore. In the comics, Thor purchases land just outside of Broxton (paying with a truck load of gold), to rebuild Asgard in the wake of Ragnarok.\nObviously, in the MCU, Thor and Valkyrie rebuilt Asgard in Norway, but the new Asgard was in America on the page, setting up the events of Siege, which took place around Broxton. In that event, Norman Osborn seeks to invade Asgard, under the pretense of a threat to the United States, but really as a means to strengthen his own power. Loki actually plays a key role in that Siege, convincing Osborn to orchestrate a tragedy at Soldier Field football stadium, where thousands of civilians are killed during a battle between Volstagg and villains working for Osborn, as he and Loki watch on.\nOther notable events in Broxton include it being the site of the death of Cul Borson (AKA Serpent), as well as a war between the Asgardians and Galactus, and finally, its destruction by the God Of Hammers, which killed its residents, as a means to draw Thor's anger. Sylvie heading there in Loki's season 2 episode 1 post-credits scene doesn't tie to those events - though it could similarly endanger the town and its people - but it fits a rich Marvel history.\nLoki season 2 continues next Thursday, Oct. 12 at 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "The MCU Just Broke A Time Travel Rule The Avengers Called Unbreakable Only 4 Years Ago", "date": "2023-10-06 01:50:26", "text": "The MCU just broke one of its biggest time travel rules, only four years after it was established as unbreakable by Marvel movie canon.\nWARNING: This Article Contains SPOILERS For Loki Season 2, Episode 1\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe introduced time travel in Avengers: Endgame, but four years later, Loki season 2 has broken one of the major rules established by Marvel Studios' 2019 movie. After Thanos snapped away half the universe in Avengers: Infinity War, Earth's Mightiest Heroes set out to figure out how to travel through time in order to undo the devastation wreaked by the Mad Titan. With the help of Tony Stark's genius and Scott Lang's knowledge of the Quantum Realm, they managed it, and used time travel to gather the Infinity Stones and defeat Thanos.\nEndgame also established a certain number of time travel rules, the biggest of which was that if someone traveled back in time and changed the past, it wouldn't affect the present. As Smart Hulk explains, \"If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future, and your former present becomes the past, which can't now be changed by your new future.\" The scene further established that time travel in movies like Back to the Future and The Terminator are incorrect because their premises are based on the theory that changing the past does, in fact, change the future. However, the Loki season 2 premiere completely breaks this rule in a big way.\nRelated: Loki’s Powers Explained In Full: How Each Ability Is Different\nIn Loki season 2, episode 1, Loki is having trouble time-slipping, which essentially means he's being pulled between the past, present and future at random. This actually comes in handy when he and Mobius visit the TVA's chief engineer Ouroboros, aka OB, for help putting an end to the time-slipping. Loki meets OB in the present, then time-slips to the past, where he has a conversation with the engineer about how to fix his time-slipping problem, leading the past OB to create a Temporal Aura Extractor that will help solve the problem in the present. Since OB is shown remembering the conversation with Loki as it's happening in the past, the audience can deduce that Loki's actions in the past are changing the future.\nThis goes against everything Smart Hulk, and by extension Avengers: Endgame, established in terms of how time travel works in the MCU. If changing the past affected the future, then everything from the Avengers' time heist would've had ripple effects and when they returned to their present, it would've been completely different. Thanos may never have been able to achieve the snap in the first place, and it would've been an anticlimactic ending to the Infinity Saga. However, establishing one set of rules in Endgame and then proceeding to retcon them over and over and over again in Marvel movies and shows since has only led to more confusion. Still, there's an easy way for Marvel to explain Loki breaking Endgame's time travel rules.\nThere's one repeating line in Loki that helps to explain why the God of Mischief was able to change the future by changing the past: Time works differently in the TVA. It's a constant refrain in Loki season 1, and that theme has continued into season 2. If time as a whole works differently, it stands to reason that time travel works differently as well. This would be an easy explanation for Loki being able to break Endgame's rules, because Loki time-slipping breaks even the rules known by the TVA. However, the episode also establishes that the way time works in the TVA is changing, which may be explained by the creation of the multiverse.\nEndgame took place before Sylvie killed He Who Remains, so the MCU was existing within the Sacred Timeline, and any changes to it would've been pruned by the TVA. Hulk's time travel rules may have been true for the Sacred Timeline, due to factors outside his and the audience's knowledge, but now that the multiverse exists, time travel doesn't work in the same way. This explanation would set up the MCU to not have to adhere to the rules established in Endgame, while not actively retconning the movie. \nOf course, it still means that Marvel needs to re-establish what the MCU's time travel rules are and ensure all movies and shows stick to them. Considering the massive multiversal war teased by Loki, and the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania post-credits scene, it's important audiences are clear on how time travel and travel between multiverses works—not just in a single movie or show, but across the entire franchise. Endgame's time travel rules were already confusing and have been made worse because they've been retconned so many times that it's become a running joke, and even Loki season 2 joined in on poking fun.\nWhen Loki, OB and Mobius are having their conversation across time, Mobius realizes that Loki is changing the present by changing the past, and OB says \"there's no flaw in that logic.\" Although the dialogue doesn't call out the Avengers or Endgame by name, it feels like a major diss to the 2019 MCU movie due to how many times Endgame's logic has been called into question. The pithy comment is played as a joke, and considering Endgame established rules directly contrary to the scene, it makes the Avengers movie the butt of the joke.\nThat said, the Loki season 2 premiere likely isn't trying to be maliciously mean to Endgame, especially since the movie is beloved by many and was by far the MCU's most successful film to date. But Endgame's time travel rules have been widely discussed and dissected ever since it released, and even within the movie itself, they don't make much sense. Having Loki rewrite the time travel rules of the MCU, while poking a bit of fun at Endgame, is a good way to show audiences that Marvel knows what they're doing and are trying to fix their mistakes.\nIt also shows that Endgame's time travel issues are incredibly far-reaching and, even four years later, Loki is still working to fix them so the MCU can move forward into its Multiverse Saga. With Loki potentially changing Marvel's time travel rules (again), hopefully future MCU movies and shows will make more sense, especially Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars. While that remains to be seen, we do know Loki was able to break a major time travel rule established in Avengers: Endgame—while poking fun of the Marvel movie in the process.\nLoki season 2 continues next Thursday, Oct. 12 at 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Is Jonathan Majors' Kang In Loki Season 2?", "date": "2023-10-06 01:56:26", "text": "Audiences might wonder if Jonathan Majors' Kang is in Loki season 2 after He Who Remains and Kang the Conqueror were introduced in the MCU.\nWARNING: This article contains SPOILERS for Loki season 2, episode 1\nAfter he was introduced in season 1 and set up to become the next main villain of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, audiences may be wondering if Jonathan Majors' Kang is in Loki season 2. Majors joined the MCU in the Loki season 1 finale as the Kang variant He Who Remains, a version of Nathaniel Richards who had defeated all others and kept them at bay by creating the sacred timeline. Although Sylvie ended up killing He Who Remains and setting the multiverse loose, Marvel had made it clear that it wouldn't be the last viewers saw of Kang.\nSince then, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania introduced another variant, Kang the Conqueror, who was the main villain to Scott Lang and his family. Though that particular iteration of Kang was defeated by Ant-Man, the Quantumania post-credits scenes established there were innumerable other Kangs from across the multiverse. The second of the scenes also revealed a new version of Majors' Kang would be in Loki season 2, but now that the first episode has aired and he was nowhere to be seen, there might be some confusion over whether the villain will appear.\nAs seen in the Loki season 2 trailer, Majors will reprise his role as Kang variant Victor Timely in the show after appearing in the Quantumania credits scene. Little is known about the MCU's version of Victor Timely, since all that's been revealed is that he's an inventor/scientist of some kind working with time theory. In the Marvel Comics, Victor Timely is a persona adopted by Nathaniel Richards after he time travels from the future to the past.\nA month following the release of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Majors was arrested March 25 in New York City on charges of strangulation, assault and harassment. Although a trial date has not been set as of publication, the allegations against the actor have sparked speculation about his future in the MCU. Marvel Studios hasn't commented on the situation, but Loki executive producer Kevin Wright told Variety that Majors' arrest didn't affect season 2 because filming had wrapped in 2022.\nWright went on to explain there weren't any discussions about changing Majors' role in Loki season 2, saying, \"No. And that mainly came from — I know as much as you do at the moment. It felt hasty to do anything without knowing how all of this plays out.\" Given Wright's comments, it seems Marvel is waiting to see the final verdict of Majors' trial before deciding on his MCU future. Since the season was done before Majors' arrest, the show wasn't affected and Majors is still expected to appear in Loki season 2.\nIt's not known exactly which episode or episodes Majors will appear in during Loki season 2, but now that the premiere has aired, it's confirmed he wasn't in it. It's unlikely Majors' Victor Timely will be saved for the season 2 finale since he appeared in the trailer. After all, He Who Remains was hidden from all the Loki season 1 marketing, and he didn't appear until the finale. Since Victor Timely is shown in the trailers, he'll presumably appear earlier in the season, but exactly which episode of Loki season 2 remains to be seen.\nLoki season 2 continues next Thursday, Oct. 12 at 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Loki Season 2 Episode 1 Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-06 02:16:08", "text": "Loki season 2 hits the ground running in episode 1 which culminates in a twist-filled ending to set the tone for the God of Mischief’s second outing.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Loki season 2, episode 1.\nLoki season 2 begins almost exactly where the first season left off, with episode 1's ending providing plenty of twists and turns for the beginning of the God of Mischief's second solo MCU outing. In Loki season 2, episode 1, the titular Asgardian is attempting to deal with his new reality: a TVA under the control of Kang the Conqueror. What's more, Loki's former ally - Owen Wilson's Mobius - does not remember him as the lovable rouge begins slipping through time be it the past, present, or future.\nAs such, much of Loki season 2, episode 1 centers on Loki's predicament. Loki discovers that the Mobius who does not remember him is a result of him time-slipping into the past which provides plenty of Loki season 2, episode 1 Easter eggs. The episode is chaotic, to say the least, as the present timeline features Loki, Mobius, and Ke Huy Quan's O.B. finding a way to stop Loki's time-slipping before it is too late as the rest of the TVA deals with the aftermath of He Who Remains' death. With such a confusing, time-travel-oriented plot, here is everything explained about Loki season 2, episode 1's ending.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Episode 1's Post-Credits Scene Is Way Deeper Than You Realize\nThe episode opens exactly where Loki season 1 left off with Loki having time-slipped into the past of the TVA. After escaping the pursuing TVA soldiers, Loki crashes through a building and encounters the past version of Casey who does not remember him. Loki then slips for the first time back into the present as he tries to reunite with Mobius to explain his issue. After slipping between the past and present a few more times in his pursuit of Mobius, Loki finds himself in the War Room of the TVA in the past.\nHere he finds recordings of He Who Remains and Ravonna Renslayer from the Multiversal War and sees the original designs of the former's face adorning the War Room walls. Loki subsequently slips back into the present to finally encounter the versions of Mobius and B-15 that remember him, finally reuniting the cast of characters for Loki season 2. Loki begins explaining the complex situation to everyone present before Mobius opts to take Loki to Ouroborus - or O.B. for short - in an attempt to fix the time-slipping.\nLoki's time-slipping becomes more frequent from this point, often used for humor with his destination not shown until O.B.'s first scene. During this scene, Loki talks to the O.B. of the past while Mobius converses with the O.B. of the present. Eventually, Loki returns to the present until the third act of Loki season 2, episode 1 adds another twist to the tale.\nThe final time slip of the episode sees Loki travel into the TVA's future. Here, everything is in chaos. Loki frantically searches for a Timestick to conduct his part of O.B.'s plan to stop the time-skipping but not before he encounters Sylvie in the future. Sylvie makes it seem as though she has been searching for Loki before an unknown assailant prunes the latter, returning him to the present with Mobius and O.B. before the episode ends.\nConcerning how Loki managed to stop time-slipping, the answer is somewhat convoluted. O.B.'s plan to stop Loki's time-slipping was to have Loki prune himself as a means of stripping all traces of himself from every timeline. To make the plan succeed though, Loki had to prune himself at the same moment as Mobius activated a device called a Temporal Aura Extractor. According to O.B.'s theorizing, these two events happening at the same time would allow Loki to be pulled back into the present to stop him slipping through time.\nBy the time of Loki season 2, episode 1's ending, this plan is thrown into action. Loki slips into the future of the TVA as he frantically searches for a Timestick to prune himself when the time comes. Mobius puts the Temporal Aura Extractor in place, connected to the Temporal Loom - the aspect of the TVA that converts raw time into physical timelines. Eventually, Loki is pruned in the future by an unknown person meaning the Temporal Aura Extractor can pull him into the present, stopping the time-slipping seemingly for good.\nOne of the burning mysteries of Loki season 2, episode 1 was who pruned Loki in the future. As Loki is captivated by Sylvie's sudden appearance, someone prunes him from behind before anything else can be explained leaving both the audience and Loki without answers. Similarly, Loki returns to the present meaning it was not revealed who pruned him. The likely answer is that it was Loki who pruned himself. Loki is now aware that, at some point, a version of himself will appear at that exact point in time needing to be pruned to stop the time-slipping meaning he takes it upon himself to provide this.\nAlongside the question of who pruned Loki in the future, this scene provides many other questions. One of those is what Sylvie is doing in the TVA. As of the ending of Loki season 2, episode 1, the answer to this is unclear. It is likely that these events will be shown from the perspective of Loki and Sylvie as the season goes on given they take place in the future, potentially even in the final episode as the season delves even deeper than its predecessor into complicated time-travel storytelling.\nAnother unanswered question as of Loki season 2, episode 1's ending is who is calling the TVA phone in the future. As Loki sees Sylvie just before being pruned, a phone can be heard ringing in the TVA. The phone receives a lot of attention from both Loki and the camera meaning whoever is on the other end will likely be vital to the series' overarching story yet the identity of this mysterious caller is left frustratingly unclear as of the ending of Loki season 2, episode 1.\nAn interesting element of Loki season 2, episode 1 is that it changes the established time-travel rules of the MCU. In Avengers: Endgame, Hulk stated that it was impossible for someone who had traveled back to the past to change the future. Hulk explained that anything that happens in the past simply causes a brand-new timeline. However, Loki season 2, episode 1 proved different. Loki was directly impacting the events of the present when he time-slipped into the past as evident in his conversation with O.B. This could be because of the different time rules of the TVA yet regardless, it proves the MCU's time-travel rules are changing with Loki season 2.\nOne of the new elements of the MCU multiverse in Loki season 2, episode 1 is the Temporal Loom. O.B. describes the Temporal Loom as the section of the TVA in which raw time is refined to create physical timelines. O.B. also states that the endless branching of the timeline caused by He Who Remains' death is causing the Temporal Loom to overload which is causing Loki's time-slipping and the power surges at the TVA.\nConcerning what this means for the MCU multiverse, the ramifications could be huge. O.B. mentions that he will attempt to retrofit the Temporal Loom to handle the endless expansion of branching timelines. This could mean that the events of Loki season 2 essentially create the multiverse as O.B. figures this out which allows countless timelines to exist together. Regarding how else the Temporal Loom will affect the MCU multiverse, Loki season 2's next five episodes will hopefully reveal more.\nFinally, regarding what General Dox has planned for Sylvie in Loki season 2, episode 1, she simply wants answers. The TVA is in chaos after the death of He Who Remains which causes higher-ups like General Dox to somewhat panic. As a result, Dox states that she needs to know exactly what happened at the End of Time. To do so, Dox begins sending every single available TVA agent after Sylvie to extract an explanation from her, something that will undoubtedly cause trouble going into Loki season 2's future episodes.\nNew episodes of Loki release every Tuesday on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Every Loki Season 2 Episode 1 MCU Easter Egg & Reference", "date": "2023-10-06 02:43:21", "text": "Loki season 2 continues the God of Mischief’s MCU time-travel journey with episode 1, an installment filled with wider MCU Easter eggs and references.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Loki season 2, episode 1.\nLoki season 2, episode 1 continues the titular God of Mischief's MCU journey, bringing plenty of references and connections to the wider franchise with it. More so than many other Marvel Disney+ shows, Loki is tied intrinsically to the status of the MCU. The events of Loki season 1 were instrumental in the foundation of the MCU multiverse that led to stories like Spider-Man: No Way Home and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness becoming possible.\nJust as Loki season 1 kickstarted the events of the Multiverse Saga, Loki season 2 will be integral to its progression. This means that Loki season 2 will be filled with wider references to other MCU properties as well as other fun Easter eggs pertaining to different elements of the character. As such, here is every Easter egg, reference, and fun nod found in Loki season 2, episode 1, \"Ouroborus.\"\nMidway through Loki season 2, episode 1, Loki is introduced to Ke Huy Quan's character named Ouroboros, seemingly explaining the Loki season 2, episode 1 title. However, it has a deeper meaning than simply referencing the lovable new TVA agent. In the real world, an Ouroboros is a circular symbol often depicting a snake or a dragon devouring its own tail to signify the endless cycle of destruction and rebirth. Given the events of Loki season 2, episode 1, this seems fitting while also propping up Quan's O.B. to have a major role in the upcoming season.\nA common Easter egg that has come to be expected by every new Marvel Studios project is the updated logo for the company. With Loki season 2, episode 1, the Marvel Studios logo is gold and green. This reflects the two primary colors of Loki's design throughout the MCU as both an Easter egg to the character's past and the prominent color scheme of the first season.\nIn the opening chase sequence of Loki season 2, episode 1, Kang's statue is shown towering above the TVA. While this could be seen as simply a reference to the overall villain of the Multiverse Saga, it holds a deeper meaning. The camera pans backward from the statue and back into the TVA building in which Loki is being chased almost as if the statue is watching the events unfold. This is an Easter egg to both He Who Remains and Kang's presence in Loki season 2, with both versions of the character having presided over timelines as they watched events take place.\nJust as Marvel Studios properties have delved into the multiverse, so too have Sony's Spider-Verse movies. In the latter franchise, characters are shown to \"glitch\" when they are in a universe different from their own. The visual representation of glitching is incredibly similar to Loki's time-slipping. While a slightly different phenomenon in context, the visual design of Loki's time-slipping was likely an intentional Easter egg to another prominent Marvel multiversal story.\nAs is known from Loki season 1 and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Jonathan Majors will be responsible for bringing Kang the Conqueror's many variants to life. In Loki season 2, episode 1, a neat Easter egg features Majors' first appearance in the season. When slipping into the past, Loki finds a recording of He Who Remains and Ravonna Renslayer from the time of the Multiversal War which provides context to the TVA's history while also providing a fun Easter egg to Majors' overarching MCU role.\nThe character of Loki in Marvel is based on Norse mythology as is the rest of Asgard. In Norse myth, it is said that a world tree known as Yggdrasil holds together the Nine Realms on its branches. In Loki season 2, the Temporal Loom provides a similar function. The Temporal Loom takes branches of the timeline and forms them into physical matter, essentially acting as the Yggdrasil of the MCU and providing an Easter egg to Loki's Norse origins.\nOne of the more memed aspects of Loki's character in the MCU is his endless amount of hair flips. In Loki season 2, episode 1, this continues in abundance. After every time slip, Loki dramatically flips his hair over his shoulder. Given the countless time-slips shown in Loki season 2, episode 1, Loki's extra, over-the-top dramatic tendencies continue.\nThe new end-credit sequence of Loki season 2 provides an Easter egg to the state of the overall story. In Loki season 1, it was revealed that He Who Remains essentially constructed the Sacred Timeline to lead Loki and Sylvie to the Citadel at the End of Time. In Loki season 2, episode 1's end credit sequence, someone is shown reconstructing the events of the episode with miniatures and models. This references the central themes of Loki's story which center on the idea of free will against predetermination that will undoubtedly continue in season 2.\nThe end-credit scene of Loki season 2, episode 1 sees Sylvie exiting the Citadel at the End of Time in Broxton, Oklahoma. At first, this may seem like an innocuous location, yet it has deeper comic-book connections. In Marvel Comics, Broxton is where Thor rebuilds Asgard after the events of Ragnarok. While the MCU depicted this differently with New Asgard being situated in Norway, Loki season 2, episode 1's end-credit sequence including Broxton is a neat Easter egg to Marvel Comics.\nNew episodes of Loki release every Tuesday on Disney+.\n"}

The Predator franchise's return to feature movies saw Amber Midthunder's determined young hunter set out to prove herself when another hunter from across the stars began its own bloody game across the Great Plains in 1719. While Prey passed over a theatrical release and instead went straight to Hulu, it earned widespread acclaim from critics and has been seen as a return to form for the franchise.\nWith Prey now receiving a home release, Trachtenberg sat down with /Film and opened up about the movie's production, shedding some light on moments that didn't make it into the final cut. The director revealed that initially, Naru would encounter the Predator in the trees early on. For various reasons, which he explained, this was cut. Check out Trachtenberg's complete explanation below:\nI don't. This was a little bit of a filmmaking director trick of the trade. On the one hand, it was a sequence as we were devising it — Naru was in the tree in the beginning, so in my mind, it was to set up the sequence at the end, that the physical capabilities were there and the visual language was sort of already in the movie. I love the idea of seeing her running through the tree, and the Predator up there, because he's up in the tree so often in these films. Putting her up there, too, it could have been really fun. But I was also incredibly nervous that it ended up looking like Tarzan. The execution had to be perfect for it to be great. Then, it was also becoming very costly to do, and [it was] time-consuming, which, sometimes, is the same thing.\nIt was in the parking lot next to our stage, starting to map out where the trees were going to go, and having a talk with my producers about the cost and the implications and what's our schedule and other things that we needed also. So rather than fight to make it work, when other things were getting squeezed, I sort of waited until the things that were also critical were getting impacted. I said, \"You know what? What if we lost the thing? What if I took out that whole sequence? Then we could do this other ... Surely, you can't tell me that we can't.\"\nBut in the back of my mind, it was like, Okay, Dan. You're nervous about it already. Listen to your gut. It might not be great. The thing that I was the saddest to lose was, I thought, a clever use of the cut clamp, one of the Predator's weapons that Naru has in the sequence. So now, I'm glad that people can kind of see what it was. Previz is a tool that we use all the time in movies and TV sometimes, and movie fans and potential future filmmakers never get to see that stuff, so it's cool that they have it now.\nWhile Trachtenberg's initial idea for Naru and the Predator's first meeting was scrapped, the idea of it leaves the question of how Prey's narrative would be impacted by the sequence. It could be argued that seeing Naru's keen hunting skills could've impacted her journey, as her growth from a young hunter to the slayer of an advanced alien rival helped endear her to the audience, solidifying her as a captivating protagonist. While it likely wouldn't dampen her growth too much, it would make her actions in during the ending of Prey less of a surprise, as her skills would've already been shown.\nRelated: What Would Happen If Naru Met Other Predator Heroes?\nFurthermore, Naru's first true encounter with the Predator in Prey's final cut would surely be diminished if the pair met earlier. Naru's first glimpse at the Predator is both a surprise for her and the audience, as the alien makes his presence known when he slays a grizzly bear that she has been battling alone. Not only is the Predator's bloody intervention a shock, but it being able to annihilate large threats like bears with ease instantly makes Naru see how dangerous her foe truly is, raising the stakes further than before.\nWhile Prey's alternate first encounter established Naru's skill set and parallels with her Predator rival, the final execution proves that a longer wait may have been worth it. Alongside making her growth more captivating to watch and allowing further surprises, the greater build-up allowed for more anticipation around the Predator's on-screen debut. However, Trachtenberg still ensured a pre-visualized concept of this scene exists to give viewers a glimpse at an alternate take on the movie.\nSource: /Film\n"}

Then, it was also becoming very costly to do, and [it was] time-consuming, which, sometimes, is the same thing.\nIt was in the parking lot next to our stage, starting to map out where the trees were going to go, and having a talk with my producers about the cost and the implications and what's our schedule and other things that we needed also. So rather than fight to make it work, when other things were getting squeezed, I sort of waited until the things that were also critical were getting impacted. I said, \"You know what? What if we lost the thing? What if I took out that whole sequence? Then we could do this other ... Surely, you can't tell me that we can't.\"\nBut in the back of my mind, it was like, Okay, Dan. You're nervous about it already. Listen to your gut. It might not be great. The thing that I was the saddest to lose was, I thought, a clever use of the cut clamp, one of the Predator's weapons that Naru has in the sequence. So now, I'm glad that people can kind of see what it was. Previz is a tool that we use all the time in movies and TV sometimes, and movie fans and potential future filmmakers never get to see that stuff, so it's cool that they have it now.\nWhile Trachtenberg's initial idea for Naru and the Predator's first meeting was scrapped, the idea of it leaves the question of how Prey's narrative would be impacted by the sequence. It could be argued that seeing Naru's keen hunting skills could've impacted her journey, as her growth from a young hunter to the slayer of an advanced alien rival helped endear her to the audience, solidifying her as a captivating protagonist. While it likely wouldn't dampen her growth too much, it would make her actions in during the ending of Prey less of a surprise, as her skills would've already been shown.\nRelated: What Would Happen If Naru Met Other Predator Heroes?\nFurthermore, Naru's first true encounter with the Predator in Prey's final cut would surely be diminished if the pair met earlier. Naru's first glimpse at the Predator is both a surprise for her and the audience, as the alien makes his presence known when he slays a grizzly bear that she has been battling alone. Not only is the Predator's bloody intervention a shock, but it being able to annihilate large threats like bears with ease instantly makes Naru see how dangerous her foe truly is, raising the stakes further than before.\nWhile Prey's alternate first encounter established Naru's skill set and parallels with her Predator rival, the final execution proves that a longer wait may have been worth it. Alongside making her growth more captivating to watch and allowing further surprises, the greater build-up allowed for more anticipation around the Predator's on-screen debut. However, Trachtenberg still ensured a pre-visualized concept of this scene exists to give viewers a glimpse at an alternate take on the movie.\nSource: /Film\n"}

This article contains spoilers for Bachelor in Paradise season 9!\nBachelor in Paradise season 9 couple Aven Jones and Kylee Russell finally met in person after flirting online, and sparks were flying, but is the couple still together after their time together in Mexico? When Kylee arrived on the beach, was excited to meet Aven, who'd liked some of her pictures on Instagram and left a fire emoji on one. Although that was the extent of their interaction, she was very interested in meeting him. However, when she received the first date card of the season, Aven wasn't in Paradise yet.\nKylee asked Will Urena to join her for the first Bachelor in Paradise season 9 date, and they hit it off. However, when Aven arrived on the beach the next day, and asked Kylee on a date, she accepted. They had a wonderful time, and Kylee broke things off with a heartbroken Will. Kylee and Aven seem to be making a connection, leaving people wondering if they're still together today.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nKylee is a 25-year-old postpartum nurse from Charlotte, North Carolina. She made her Bachelor Nation debut on Zach Shallcross' Bachelor season. She and Zach didn't really have much of a connection. Zach eliminated Kylee over Zoom when he had COVID-19.\nKylee was also known for her conflict with Anastasia Keramidas, which led to an important discussion about microaggressions toward women of color. While on a group date, Kylee tried to steal Zach away from Anastasia. When Anastasia refused, Kylee said, \"I don't like to fight but...\" Anastasia told the others that Kylee was aggressive, and that she was scared of her. At \"The Women Tell All\" special, Genevie Mayo explained how this was an example of a microaggression because Kylee was not a threatening person. Anastasia apologized and said that it wasn't her intention.\nAven is a 29-year-old sales executive from Salem Massachusetts. He first appeared on Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey's Bachelorette season. He shared a deep connection with Rachel, and was her runner-up. Rachel got engaged to Tino Franco during her finale, but they broke up shortly after when Tino kissed another woman during a rough patch in their relationship. At the \"After the Final Rose\" episode, Aven appeared during a confrontation between Rachel and Tino and asked her if she wanted to catch up.

The following Saturday afternoon, they posted Instagram stories within ten minutes of each other from the same exact section of the Carolina Panthers exhibition game. Charlotte is Kylee's hometown.

They had good chemistry and shared some kisses. Hopefully, Aven and Kylee found the love that they've been searching for on Bachelor in Paradise season 9.\nBachelor in Paradise airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. EDT on ABC.\nSource: Daily Roundup\n"}

Find out who won and who they might nominate for eviction.\nWARNING! THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR BIG BROTHER 25!\nBig Brother 25 took a new turn as the week 10 Head of Household (HOH) is Bowie Jane. This is Bowie's first competition win of the season, after playing an under-the-radar game for the last nine weeks. Thursday's live eviction was shocking, as the houseguests flipped the vote once again, and unanimously evicted Mecole Hayes instead of Felicia Cannon. Felicia's eviction seemed inevitable until the houseguests had a last minute change of heart. Host Julie Chen Moonves ended the episode with the announcement that all of the remaining houseguests had made it at least to the Jury of 7.\nThe Big Brother 25 week 10 HOH is Bowie. As the outgoing HOH, Cameron Hardin was ineligible to play. The remaining houseguests, Bowie, America Lopez, Blue Kim, Cirie Fields, Cory Wurtenberger, Felicia, Jag Bains, and Matt Klotz, competed in a game that began before the episode aired. The Humili-verse brought Humili-gram posts to the memory wall, which were distorted photographs of the evicted houseguests with various pieces of information on them. The houseguests had to answer seven questions about the pictures. The game came down to a tiebreaker between Bowie and Felicia, with Bowie winning the game.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nBowie has been a bit of a wildcard this season. During week 5, she was very upset when her alliance flipped the vote and evicted Red Utley instead of Jag without telling her or Cameron. She has been aligned with Cameron throughout the game, so it's doubtful that she'll nominate him. It's possible that she could take revenge on her former alliance members for lying to her and target Cirie and Felicia. Another option would be to try to break up the Cory and America showmance, or even the duo of Jag and Matt. However, since Cameron is working with Matt and Jag, he might talk Bowie out of nominating them.\nThis is Bowie's first competition win of the season, and it's long overdue. It'll be interesting to see what she decides to do as HOH, as viewers haven't really seen her assert herself before in the game. Big Brother 25 feels like a whole new and refreshed game now that Bowie has won. It'll be an unpredictable week in the house as Bowie takes the lead.\nAlthough some might say that Bowie hasn't really been playing the game until now, sometimes watching and waiting is a great strategy. Because she managed to stay out of the drama that's ensued over the past few weeks, she was able to take in information and study her fellow houseguests. It'll be exciting to see which houseguests she'll target. Bowie's HOH is definitely living up to Big Brother's motto of \"expect the unexpected.\"\nBig Brother 25 airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT, Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EDT, and Thursdays at 9 p.m. EDT on CBS.\n"}
{"title": "Loki Season 2: Why Time Doesn't Matter In The TVA", "date": "2023-10-06 03:05:52", "text": "Loki season 2 continues to show why time doesn't matter to the Time Variance Authority and how the typical rules don't apply (normally).\nWarning! This post contains SPOILERS for Loki season 2, episode 1\nLoki season 2 continues the adventures of the titular God of Mischief (Tom Hiddleston) within the hallways of the MCU's Time Variance Authority, and the premiere further reveals why time doesn't matter inside the TVA itself. Having found He Who Remains at the end of Loki season 1, Loki was sent back to the TVA by Sylvie, though it was quite different from the TVA he originally left. Now, Loki season 2 offers new insights into why time works so differently inside the TVA.\nIn Loki season 2's premiere, Loki finds himself in the past, explaining why no one knew who he was in Loki season 1's finale as they hadn't met him yet. To that end, it's revealed that Loki is \"time-slipping\" where his body is involuntary and violently sent back and forth between the past, present, and future. However, this is something that should be impossible inside the TVA according to Agent Mobius (Owen Wilson) and Ouroboros aka O.B. (Ke Huy Quan), the TVA's head of Repairs and Advancement. Here's why time doesn't matter inside the TVA.\nRelated: Loki Season 2's First Post-Credits Scene Is Way Deeper Than You Realized\nAt its core, the primary reason time doesn't matter in the TVA is because the entire organization exists outside the normal confines of time and space. This is likely why its agents are able to live and work for hundreds of years, seeing as how Mobius and O.B. claim they hadn't seen each other in over four centuries. As has been said many times by Agent Mobius, \"Time works differently in the TVA\". Thanks to their technology such as TemPads, the TVA can enter and exit points of time across various realities as needed to maintain and protect the Sacred Timeline.\nAs Loki season 2 continues, it will be interesting to learn more about the origins of the TVA and how it was built by He Who Remains outside of time and space. However, that may be hard to do with the reveal that most TVA agents were routinely given mind wipes, preventing them from remembering the truth about former lives as variants or the TVA's true purpose in maintaining the Sacred Timeline. However, it also looks as though time itself is creeping into the Time Variance Authority now that He Who Remains is dead and the multiverse has begun to freely expand with new branch realities.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Cast Guide: Every New & Returning Marvel Character\nNot only has the TVA been experiencing power surges ever since the multiverse began expanding, but the TVA's Time Loom is at risk of overloading. Beyond its core function to create a physical timeline out of raw temporal energy, the Loom was apparently never made to handle the influx of new branch timelines. This forces O.B. to seal off the machine so he can hopefully begin retrofitting the Loom (lest the entire TVA be destroyed).\nLikewise, Loki's time-slipping is undoubtedly connected to the new multiverse expansion as well. Furthermore, it's been teased that the temporal affliction may have come through Sylvie's use of He Who Remains' TemPad in Loki season 1. Nevertheless, it does seem as though the core plot of Loki season 2 will be focused on saving the TVA from time itself.\nLoki season 2 continues next Thursday, Oct. 12 at 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}

What is their history?\nThe preview for Bachelor in Paradise season 9 episode 3 showed Tyler Norris arriving on the beach and reuniting with Rachel Recchia, so it's time to revisit their past relationship. Rachel and Tyler met during Rachel and Gabby Windey's Bachelorette season. Tyler was smitten with Rachel while watching her on Clayton Echard's Bachelor season, and had even written her a DM that he'd like to pursue her, which she didn't see before the show began filming.\nAlthough their relationship didn't work out on The Bachelorette season 19, Tyler and Rachel seemed happy to see each other on Bachelor in Paradise season 9. In the preview, Tyler asked to speak to Rachel, who said that she was waiting to talk to him and was so excited he was there. Brayden Bowers commented that it would be kind of cool and cute if something did happen between them. Sean McLaughlin, whom Rachel had been connecting with, felt anxious and nervous because Rachel was his only connection. As Rachel and Tyler possibly rekindle their romance, here's their relationship history.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nRachel and Tyler had a strong connection throughout The Bachelorette season 19. Their relationship was sweet and romantic, and it was clear that Tyler only had eyes for her. He even wrote a poem for her. Rachel gave Tyler a hometown date, and they traveled to Wildwood, New Jersey, where Tyler owned a business called Spirit Ball. They spent the day walking on the boardwalk, eating snacks, playing games, and riding a Ferris wheel. They met up with some of his friends and relatives on the boardwalk. However, Rachel admitted in her confessional that their relationship was behind the others, and she felt like a horrible person.\nAlthough Rachel was having doubts, Tyler couldn't wait for Rachel to meet his parents. He told her that he wasn't falling in love with her, but so in love with her. He gushed that Rachel was the most amazing person he'd ever met. She interrupted him and cried as she told him that she wasn't ready to meet his family. She apologized, and he thanked her for not creating an awkward situation for his family. He was also grateful that she allowed him to love again and said that knew she'd find love. Tyler was later shown arriving to meet his family alone, explaining to them that Rachel had broken up with him.\nDespite their breakup, Rachel and Tyler had a sweet reunion at The Bachelorette season 19 \"The Men Tell All\" episode. He told her that she did everything perfectly. He said that, even though it didn't end the way he wanted it to, he respected what she did, and she did it with the most class. Tyler then appeared on Bachelor in Paradise season 8, in which he fell in love with Brittany Galvin. However, he had his heart broken again when she ended things with him after the show.\nTime will tell if Rachel and Tyler reunite on Bachelor in Paradise season 9. However, they were both shown kissing other people in the previews for the show. It might be hard for them to get out of the Friend Zone at this point, but perhaps a romantic connection could be rekindled between them. Either way, Rachel and Tyler clearly care very much about each other, which is a beautiful thing to see.\nBachelor in Paradise airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. EDT on ABC.\nSource: Bachelor Nation on ABC/YouTube\n"}
{"title": "Alien Officially Reveals the Origin of New White Xenomorph Hybrid", "date": "2023-10-06 03:09:07", "text": "Alien's white Xenomorph is a new addition to the lore with a mystery surrounding how they came into existence. And now, their origin is revealed. \nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Alien Annual 2023 #1 After months of mystery surrounding Alien’s new Xenomorph subspecies, the answer to the question of how they came into existence has finally arrived, as Alien officially reveals the origin of the new white Xenomorph ‘hybrid’.\nIn Alien Annual 2023 #1 by Declan Shalvey and Danny Earls, readers are shown a spaceship containing a Xenomorph Queen and her brood crash-landing on LV-695 years before the events of Alien Vol. 3. When they hit the ground, they’re met with bug-like indigenous creatures who immediately investigate the Ovomorphs that litter the ground surrounding the crash-site. As per their nature, the Facehuggers leap out of their eggs onto the faces of these white ‘bugs’, and while the first few attempts at infection fail (given their faces are not the optimal size for Facehugger attachment), the aliens eventually find a way to release the genetic material needed to create Xenomorph life into the bodies of these ‘bugs’. The result is the white Xenomorph first shown in Alien Vol. 3, one of which overpowers the Queen and takes her place in producing Ovomorphs, with these new ones containing white Facehuggers.\nWhile it is interesting to see Facehuggers infect their hosts in a new and horrific way, it’s a bit underwhelming that this exciting new Xenomorph strain came about exactly how everyone would have assumed. Xenomorphs’ DNA Reflex is a key aspect of their entire species, and it’s been established that a dominant gene picked up by certain hosts can carry over to the next Xenomorph Queen and her brood. For instance, the Xenomorph as fans know them only look the way they do because of the genetic characteristics they picked up from human hosts. That’s also why creatures such as the Predalien look different, as that’s a Xenomorph born from a Predator host. These white bugs of LV-695 are the latest in a long line of Xenomorph hosts passing on their genetic traits to these alien parasites. Unlike the Red Xenomorphs from Aliens: Genocide (which this story seems to be inspired by, given the Xenomorph civil war), that were naturally-occuring Xenomorph mutants who came to be without the influence of a specific host, these white Xenomorphs relied entirely on these ‘bug’ hosts for how they came into existence - which isn’t too dissimilar to another line of Alien comics.\nIn 1992, Dark Horse Comics in partnership with Kenner Products published Aliens: Space Marines, a line of mini comics that were included with Aliens toys. The toys themselves were interesting variations of the classic Xenomorph, with ‘Mantis Alien’, ‘Scorpion Alien’, and ‘Rhino Alien’ being only a few examples. This was a creative way to sell kid-friendly Alien toys while also adding some variety, and the comics that were included explained that each of these Xenomorphs came to be after infecting aliens with those specific traits on new worlds. It was a great way to come up with new designs for Xenomorphs while also honoring the established lore, and it’s exactly what Alien Vol. 3 did with the white Xenomorph.\nWhile there’s nothing wrong with how the white Xenomorph was brought into canon, it does feel like a missed opportunity to delve deeper into uncharted, scientific hybridizations rather than the classic DNA Reflex. In fact, this very series introduced perhaps the most disturbing human/Xenomorph hybrid in the Alien franchise, and there was definitely room to expand on that idea. These people were operating in unregulated territory, they consisted of a mad-scientist mother, a naive but brave daughter, and a synthetic totally loyal to the mother. No one knew what they had, and the experiments that could have been conducted in secret had the potential to explore the deepest aspects of horror and human depravity in the name of science. However, despite what could have happened, fans can at least be satisfied in knowing the official origin of Alien’s new white Xenomorph.\nAlien Annual 2023 #1 by 20th Century Studios is available now.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "10 Best Sports Anime of All Time", "date": "2023-10-06 03:53:19", "text": "Sports anime are some of the most compelling in the medium, but only a few are great enough to be called the best (and have major impacts on sports).\nJust as sports films have captured audiences' hearts, sports anime have risen from the ranks of TV shows or comic-inspired series to become cultural phenomenons. And looking at the most beloved and popular sports anime ever released, it isn't hard to see why.\nThe best sports anime series deliver compelling character histories, challenges, and victories. They also deliver on important themes like friendship, loss, family, and dedication. If all of that wasn't enough, the top ranks of sports anime have also captured enough acclaim and devotion to not only be recognized as the best of their subgenre... but be seen among the top anime of all time.\nAlthough reactions to The Prince of Tennis may not be as universally positive as others, it remains a perfect sports anime for newcomers. Beginning as a manga which was serialized from 1999 to 2008, the series follows young tennis player Ryoma Echizen as he excels beyond his competition, quickly becoming a certified tennis ace. At the same time, following his school's efforts to win a team championship.\nThe plot is very straightforward, and while the cast of characters may not be as fleshed out as other sports anime, The Prince of Tennis still manages to be one of the best-selling manga series and most popular sports anime series of all time. Long-time fans of the genre might find it less nuanced, but for viewers new to sports anime, it's a great introduction.\nPerfect for fans of the Fast and Furious series (particularly before it shifted from street racing to secret agent superheroics), Initial D centers on the same Japanese street racing the film series emulated for Tokyo Drift. Beginning as a manga in 1995 from Shuichi Shigeno, the series exploded into numerous anime stories, divided into \"Stages.\"\nThough many viewers were introduced to the series through its popularity as meme fodder online, the tale of Takumi Fujiwara on his mission to become a respected racer is hard to beat in its genre. With incredible driving sequences and an upbeat soundtrack, Initial D is a thrilling and underrated anime, sticking to its lane every step of the way.\nRelated: Naruto's Creator Confirms the Surprising Inspiration For The Most Iconic Jutsu\nYuri on Ice debuted in 2016 to a warm welcome, following its hero Yuri Katsuki, a figure skater trying to decide what his future in competition will hold. During his journey he rediscovers his passion for skating, as well as love. While not as old as some other iconiuc sports anime, the series enraptured not just the usual anime crowd, but also professional skaters, too (gaining popularity when its choreography and soundtracks made the leap into real-world figure skating). The heart, struggles, and emotion of the show, as well as its uncommon sport of focus, guarantee it will remain a must-watch for years to come.\nYowamushi Pedal first aired in 2013, but had already garnered fans due to its success as a manga series still being serialized after its 2008 debut. Spanning 84 volumes and airing five seasons, the series follows Sakamichi Onoda, who joins a bicycle racing club. The award-winning series from TMS Entertainment has stood out not only for focusing on cycling, but also the appeal of the otaku protagonist. With plenty of humor and heart, Yowamushi Pedal is a series that anime watchers should take a chance on (if they aren't hooked already).\nCreated first as a manga by Tadatoshi Fujimaki in 2008, Kuroko's Basketball is a stand-out series for breaking typical sports manga conventions. It follows the titular character, Tetsuya Kuroko, as he joins up with a basketball team hoping to become the top contender at the high school level. While initially seeming typical, the series blends magical action with sports tropes and plot beats. The players each seem to have their own superpowers, allowing the games to feel extra suspenseful and intriguing. The broad cast of characters are also motivated in compelling ways, while the main hero is an unexpected and very quiet star. Kuroko's Basketball is a must-see anime that blends traditional sports anime with fantasy-esque elements.\nAce of Diamond is another series that began as a manga (2006 - 2015) before being adapted into an anime by Madhouse and Production I.G., first airing in 2013 (and spawning multiple sequel series and manga since). The hero of the story is Eijun Sawada, who wants to be a star pitcher, or an 'ace' on the baseball diamond. The series provides personal competition as teammates compete to become an ace, as well as the usual ups and downs of a season of league baseball. With a cast of characters outfitted with big dreams and engrossing baseball action, Ace of Diamond needs to be on the watchlists of any baseball fan, and anime fan besides.\nHaikyu!! is one of the best known sports manga and anime of the modern era - and it's no wonder why. Another Production I.G series, this manga turned anime follows Shoyo Hinata, whose determination and team-building throughout the series make the tale a stand-out (despite how young it is relative to other hit sports anime). Haikyu!! has won several awards, and though it has concluded, it is worth jumping into sooner than later. Hinata's perseverance and struggles, as well as the camaraderie that builds into success, makes this a must-watch sports anime.\nWhile less widely known or cited than some other modern sports anime, Major deserves a spot on this list. First launching as a manga by Takuya Mitsuda and serialized from 1994 to 2010, followed by an anime airing in 2004, this baseball anime follows Goro Honda, who strives to be a professional pitcher like his father. What makes it unique is the length of the story, taking Goro from his early years playing the sport all the way to the major leagues.\nWhile demonstrating a progression far beyond one championship or season, Major has all the hallmarks sports fans love, but also enjoys a fan base including all-star MLB pitcher and hitter, Shohei Ohtani. The major league player has mentioned his love for the series in interviews, proving it isn't just a compelling story, but an inspiring one for aspiring athletes of all ages.\nCreated by George Morikawa as a manga in 1989, Hajime no Ippo has often been compared to Rocky. This underdog hero is Ippo Makunouchi, who enters the world of boxing when a professional boxer interrupts one of many instances of bullying in the young man's life. After Ippo learns how to box, the heart of the story comes from rivalries, character interactions, and the growth that Ippo undergoes as a result.\nLike the titular hero of Rocky or The Karate Kid, the hero in this anime is an underdog in a combat sport, who learns about himself and others the stronger he gets. Fans of either film should give Hajime no Ippo a chance, as the series has proven it can resonate long-term with audiences.\nIn 1990, mangaka Takehiko Inoue debuted what would become one of the most beloved sports manga, and eventually anime, in the world. Beginning with Toei Animation in 1993, the most recent film of the series The First Slam Dunk was still a box office hit. Slam Dunk is credited with increasing basketball's popularity in Japan, making it one of the most influential sports stories in manga and anime... if not the most influential of all-time.\nThe series follows Hanamichi Sakuragi, an intimidating, trouble-making gang leader who hopes to impress a girl by learning how to play basketball. His journey to becoming an accomplished player and leader of his championship team is already etched in anime history, so if any anime fan has yet to see it, it's a wrong to right sooner than later.\n"}

This article contains spoilers for Loki season 2, episode 1.\nLoki season 2 is finally here, and the MCU's latest streaming show premiere delivers plenty of answers - and even more questions. Kicking off immediately after Loki season 1's cliffhanger ending, the titular god of mischief finds himself uncontrollably bouncing back and forth in time. Loki season 2 episode 1 centers this condition as the primary conflict, though it's clear that all is not well in the TVA.\nLoki season 2 episode 1 follows most of the returning Loki cast and also introduces newcomers like Ke Huy Quan's Ouroboros as they try to navigate the sudden and explosive growth of the MCU timeline. It all starts with some familiar tropes: the Loki/Mobius bromance is strong, there are lots of complex questions, as well asLoki season 2 episode 1's post-credit scene following the now inevitable MCU trend. While the overarching story of Loki season 2 is reasonably straightforward so far, there are still plenty of reveals that form the foundation for the season to come.\nRelated: Every Loki Season 2 Episode 1 MCU Easter Egg & Reference\nIt doesn't come as much of a shock, but Loki season 2 opens up immediately where Loki season 1's cliffhanger left off. Having been kicked through a time door by Sylvie, Loki has arrived in an unfamiliar TVA, complete with He Who Remains imagery and a Mobius who doesn't recognize him. Fortunately, and more surprisingly, the mystery of where - or rather, when - Loki ended up is answered quite quickly.\nWhen Loki ends up in a different TVA at the end of Loki season 1, it appears as if he may have found himself in an alternate timeline branch from where he started. However, Loki season 2 quickly clears up that that isn't the case. Instead, Loki has been sent to the past. That clearly explains why Mobius doesn't recognize him (they haven't met yet), but the visual changes to the TVA remain a mystery.\nFor reasons unknown to him and viewers, Loki is suffering from a condition called Time Slipping. Because of this, he finds himself being pulled back and forth between the past, present, and future. The events of the Loki season 2 premiere have supposedly stopped this effect, but time will tell if it actually worked.\nThe big plot twist of Loki season 1 is that the Time-Keepers are not, in fact, real, and He Who Remains is secretly pulling the TVA's strings from the end of time. However, Loki season 2 reveals that wasn't always the case. In the past that Loki keeps unwillingly revisiting, imagery of the Time-Keepers is replaced with paintings, statues, and references to He Who Remains. At some point, presumably shortly before a TVA-wide mind wipe, the Kang variant changed his mind and removed himself from the picture.\nWhen Loki first finds himself in the past TVA, he plays an audio recording from a device on a wall. The voice is clearly Jonathan Majors' He Who Remains. Interestingly, the recording captures him thanking the TVA's Ravonna Renslayer for her help in his victory during the Multiverse War in which countless Kangs all battled and almost destroyed time itself. Whether she remembers this period in her life and what it means for the future is yet to be seen.\nOne of the unique elements of the TVA is that it supposedly exists outside of time. However, Loki's Time Slipping seems to imply that's not the case. Ouroboros seems familiar with the condition, but he seems to think that it's impossible, given that traveling through time in a place without time doesn't make sense. However, since it's clearly happening - and since the episode teases more about the TVA agents' mind-wiping - the TVA must exist in a more traditional environment than previously thought. Where or when that is, however, remains a mystery.\nOne of the best reveals in Loki season 2 episode 1 is the introduction of Ke Huy Quan's TVA engineer, Ouroboros. On the surface, the man who literally wrote the book on the TVA and its mechanical workings can certainly reveal plenty of interesting tidbits moving forward in the season. However, there appears to be more going on with him. Given he remembers Mobius visiting him 400 years earlier, but Mobius has no recollection, he may be the only TVA agent who's never had his memory wiped. Or, at least, it's been a lot longer.\nGiven that Avengers: Endgame introduced time travel as a major element, it makes sense that it also defined how time travel works in the MCU. Simply put, any changes made in the past don't affect the time traveler's own future. Instead, changes create a new branched timeline. In theory, this avoids grandfather paradoxes in which a time traveler can undo their own existence. However, Loki's actions in the past contradict this, having immediate effects on the future. For example, Ouroboros instantly remembers meeting Loki as Loki is simultaneously speaking to him in the past. The ability to affect the future from the past is wildly powerful and may be a key to the fight against Kang moving forward.\nRelated: The MCU Just Broke A Time Travel Rule The Avengers Called Unbreakable Only 4 Years Ago\nIn Loki season 2, episode 1, the TVA is suffering power issues. Ouroboros immediately recognizes that this must be because of a problem with the massive Temporal Loom. How exactly the device works isn't explained in detail, but, in the abstract, it takes every branch of time and collects them into a single, physical strand with a defined and stable shape. However, as the TVA has (perhaps temporarily) stopped pruning, the Temporal Loom is overloaded with timelines. Short of resuming pruning and killing millions, no answer is presented as to how to fix it.\nLoki's Time Slipping is understandably frustrating, and O.B. explains to him and Mobius that the Loom can be used to stop it. Mobius has to walk into the seemingly endless chamber containing the device and then harpoon Loki out of the timeline after the latter can prune himself at precisely the right time. It's convoluted, but the plan seemingly works. Time will tell if Loki's Time Slipping is really fixed or not.\nAs Loki is waiting for Mobius to prepare the Loom, he Time Slips into the future for the first time. There, the TVA is evacuating - possibly because of the Loom breaking down in the past - and Loki can't find a Time Stick. While wandering the halls, he sees Sylvie appear in an elevator, though he's soon after pulled back into his present time. Who pruned him - and why a phone was mysteriously ringing in his presence right before Sylvie appeared, are mysteries left for another episode.\nLoki season 2 episode 1 contains a short mid-credits scene that seems to reveal where Sylvie went after killing He Who Remains in the Loki season 1 finale. She ends up in Broxton, Oklahoma, in the year 1982 and doesn't seem to have chosen that time or place on purpose. Once there, she walks into a fast-food restaurant and is seemingly swept away by her newfound freedom. She closes the Loki season 2 premiere with the optimistic line, \"I want to try everything.\" \n"}

This post contains SPOILERS for Loki season 2, episode 1\nLoki season 2's premiere features an exciting mystery surrounding its newest character and instant MCU breakout Ouroborus (Ke Huy Quan). Also known as O.B., it appears as though the head of the Repairs and Advancement department has a fully intact memory unlike his fellow agents working at the Time Variance Authority. This begs the question as to why He Who Remains allowed Ouroboros to keep said memory.\nIn Loki season 1's ending, He Who Remains (Jonathan Majors) was revealed as the true founder of the TVA, having created the organization to help maintain the Sacred Timeline where his variants (like Kang) would never exist. To that end, several fictions were put in place to keep the agents of the TVA complacent such as the Time-Keepers. Likewise, it's been revealed that agents like Mobius (Owen Wilson) and many others continually had their minds wiped, preventing them from remembering their past lives as variants while also ensuring they wouldn't question the TVA's true purpose. However, Loki season 2's premiere implies O.B. never had his mind wiped.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Cast Guide: Every New & Returning Marvel Character\nAs the chief (and only) engineer at the TVA's Repairs and Advancement department, Ouroboros is a key part of the Time Variance Authority. As such, Loki season 2's premiere confirms he's in charge of all the technology and inner workings of the TVA. He even wrote the entire TVA guidebook. However, Agent Mobius struggles to remember their history and even O.B.'s name due to the mind wiping by He Who Remains. Conversely, Ouroboros is able to recall their history with no issue, including his conversations with Loki after the God of Mischief time-slipped back into the distant past of the TVA. This establishes that O.B. possibly never had his mind wiped by He Who Remains.\nIt stands to reason that Ouroboros has always been far too integral to the TVA's operations to be mind-wiped. After all, it certainly seems as though the entire organization would fall apart without him. While the full extent of his knowledge remains to be seen, it's possible that O.B. may have been aware of He Who Remains' role in founding the TVA. Although he seems innocent enough, it's quite possible that O.B. knew the truth about the Time Variance Authority's true purpose and the truth about his fellow agents all along. There's also the possibility that Ouroboros was so isolated by his work that he wasn't deemed a threat the same way the other agents would have been.\nRelated: Every Loki Season 2 Episode 1 MCU Easter Egg & Reference\nThe TVA looks to be at risk of being destroyed thanks to the newly expanding multiverse. Needing to retrofit the TVA's Time Loom so it doesn't overload from the massive influx of raw temporal energy, perhaps O.B. will point Loki and Mobius in the direction of Victor Timely, the confirmed Kang variant who's set to appear. Existing as an inventor of time travel giving lectures in 1901, perhaps Timely can help O.B. stabilize the Time Loom as a replacement for He Who Remains (who remains no more). At any rate, O.B.'s intact memory will likely play a big factor going forward in Loki season 2.\nNew episodes of Loki release every Thursday at 6pm PT / 9pm ET on Disney+.\nWant more Loki content?

Luckily, there is an easy way to cure yourself of these afflictions.\nCurses are not very common in Baldur's Gate 3, but if you are unfortunate enough to come across one, you will need a way to remove it. The Level 3 Spell Bestow Curse can inflict multiple curses, affecting checks, saving throws, health, and/or attacks. Cursed items can provide useful bonuses at terrible cost. You may even get a particularly nasty curse called Tharchiate Withering.\nTharchiate Withering comes from the Tharchiate Codex, a cursed book on necromancy found in the Elminster Vault. Tharchiate Withering decreases your Constitution by five points. This can dangerously limit your health. Luckily, there's a simple move most players have easy access to, whether personally or through a companion. Even if, somehow, you lack the resources to cure your curse, you can find them.\nRelated: Should You Equip Cursed Items In Baldur's Gate 3?\n In order to get rid of curses like Tharchiate Withering in Baldur's Gate 3, you will need to know a spell called Remove Curse. Remove Curse is a Level 3 Abjuration Spell that removes curses of all types, from enemy spells to cursed items. This spell is available to Clerics, Warlocks, Wizards, and Paladins of the Oath of Devotion. It's an Action Spell, so you can quickly recover from any curse that may afflict you. You will need to be at Level 5 or higher to cast the spell yourself.\nIf you open the Tharchiate Withering but find yourself without the classes possessing the needed spell, don't worry. Since Shadowheart is a useful High Cleric, she knows Remove Curse. Simply direct her to use the spell, and the Curse will disappear. You could teach the spell to Gale or Wyll since they also have the needed classes to learn Remove Curse, but it is easier to bring Shadowheart along.\nIf you still lack a companion or class to cast Remove Curse, you will need to find a Scroll of Remove Curse. This is a rare scroll worth 100 gold pieces. You can purchase the scroll from merchants or stumble upon it while collecting loot. There is no definite area where all players can find a Scroll of Remove Curse. If you can only remove a curse by hoping you find a specific scroll somewhere in Baldur's Gate 3, you are better off avoiding the Tharchiate Codex or any items that bestow curses.\n"}
{"title": "Assassin’s Creed Mirage: How To Assassinate Fazil The Great Scholar (Without Getting Caught)", "date": "2023-10-06 09:00:27", "text": "An important target to assassinate in Assassin's Creed Mirage is Fazil the Great Scholar, an evil man who is hard to take down without getting caught.\nFazil the Great Scholar is one of your targets to assassinate in Assassin's Creed Mirage, found in a large Symposium that can be difficult to infiltrate without getting caught. This leader of the Order of Abbasiyah has been conducting human experiments to try and control dark magics. The perverted knowledge wielded by Fazil must be stopped, but his actions' insidious and hidden nature makes him hard to find.\nThe mission to eliminate Fazil begins in The Great Symposium, a massive academic building with twisting turns and multiple floors. Before you even start, use Eagle Sight to look for places that might hold potential clues regarding the Great Scholar's location. The restricted area here is smaller than Assassin's Creed Mirage's large map size, letting you focus on specific points of interest to investigate.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nBasim can blend into the background of spots throughout the Symposium in Assassin's Creed Mirage and eavesdrop on different people to learn more about Fazil's whereabouts. From the room where you start in the area, head right and turn left before reaching a set of stairs leading to the upper levels. Find a distraught librarian here talking to someone about how they lost an important book of Fazil's.\nHead outside to find two speakers near a bench talking about rumors of underground passageways below the House of Wisdom. An individual named Kahraman can be spoken to about these tunnels, but they will deny any possibility of secret routes unless you have proper payment. You will need to give them a Scholar Khidmah Token in Assassin's Creed Mirage to bribe Kahraman into telling you more.\nKhidmah Tokens can be earned by pickpocketing people along the city streets or by completing various Contracts. Each has a different effect and can be used to purchase favors from different characters you meet.\nThe two speakers may also mention that a gardener might have a key that unlocks the path into the underground area. You should be able to find this gardener close to the roof on one of the highest floors you can climb up to. Activate your Eagle Sight to pinpoint the worker's location ahead of time, and be careful not to get spotted as you try to keep your notoriety low in Assassin's Creed Mirage.\nYou can find the path leading to the underground passages next to a Gatekeeper, who guards an ornate blue door in the same place next to the stairs leading to the librarian. When you talk to this NPC, they will ask Basim, \"Those Who Came Before are...?\" This is clearly some code demanding a specific response in Assassin's Creed Mirage that you might be able to learn by exploring the House of Wisdom.\nNow, the door behind the Gatekeeper can also be opened by the key you get from the gardener, so there are multiple options. However, if you want to avoid sneaking past the Gatekeeper to use the key, you will find the passcode inside the book the librarian lost. If you follow the librarian from where you eavesdropped on them, you can use Eagle Sight to spot the book in Assassin's Creed Mirage on a balcony to the northwest of the Symposium.\nYou must avoid some guards to reach Fazil's book in a restricted section of the Symposium past the librarian, which you can see is glowing orange when you use Eagle Sight.\nThe rest of the passcode revealed in the book is \"Those Who Shall Return,\" a phrase that will convince the Gatekeeper in Assassin's Creed Mirage to open the door. The room you enter is scattered with different scrolls documenting Fazil's recent works, including a Great Work in the basement. Go ahead and move a bookshelf in this space to reveal a set of stairs going down into a Restricted Area within a series of tunnels.\nThis section of the assassination may be the trickiest to complete without getting into a fight due to the many guards who patrol the passages underneath the House of Wisdom. Mark enemies with Eagle Sight to ensure you don't get surprised as you explore this labyrinth in Assassin's Creed Mirage. Use your Whistle ability to lure guards into corners for quick and silent kills that fail to alert anyone lurking around this area.\nEventually, you will find a room with three guards commenting on how they plan to use \"volunteers\" for the Great Scholar's experiments near some iron cages and shackles. Wait until one of them leaves before using throwing knives to make the red pots in the room explode, which will either kill them or cause a distraction for easy assassinations. Travel a bit further to the left of the room to a larger prison space in Assassin's Creed Mirage.\nNear the holding cells, here is a note from Fazil saying that all those he conducts his ritual on must be wearing the right clothing before being brought to him. Go through the first cell door you see and travel under a break in the right wall to discover one of the Great Scholar's previous victims in Assassin's Creed Mirage. Disguise yourself with the clothes from the corpse to act as the next willing participant in Fazil's demented studies.​​​​​​​\nThe WhitePatient's Robe you put on lets you blend in perfectly, getting a free escort from one of Fazil's soldiers when you go past the prison door. Descending another staircase places you in a terrifying ritual chamber, Fazil's library of taboo knowledge and dark practices in Assassin's Creed Mirage. In the center is a mechanism that resembles a flower where Fazil is arguing with others about interruptions to his \"Great Work.\"\nSimply press the Blend In option at the center of the machine to start a cutscene that lets you assassinate Fazil the Great Scholar without getting caught in Assassin's Creed Mirage.\n"}
{"title": "Starfield: How To Make Your Character As OP As Possible", "date": "2023-10-06 09:30:25", "text": "Explore planets, battle monsters, fight pirates, and travel through space with a chip on your shoulder thanks to this Starfield OP Character guide.\nBecause there is no level cap in Starfield, making your character as OP as possible is merely a matter of maxing out all 82 skills. That being said, it will be long before you can reach that stature. Furthermore, there is an argument to be made about your background, traits, weapons, and armor, all of which play a role in making your character as OP as possible.\nNonetheless, you can do so if you want to be the most powerful spacer across Starfields 120 Star Systems. That being said, you will have to commit to a lengthy and scripted playthrough to make it happen. Because making your character the most powerful in Starfield requires more than selecting the most powerful perks and weapons.\nRelated: How To Build The Most Ridiculously OP Ship In Starfield\nWhen it comes to making your character as OP as possible in Starfield, it largely depends on the starting background, traits, and skills you choose, with the latter being the most crucial. This is because they essentially outline your character's playstyle and, thus, how effective they are in combat and conversation.\nPlayers looking to make their character as OP as possible should also consider getting the best Starfield Starborn Powers.\nYour character's Background and Traits don't make or break how OP they are. However, they do significantly speed up the process at the start of the game. As a result, it's best to start on a fresh playthrough to follow to create an OP character.\nThe background you choose in Starfield is significant because it grants you three starting skills. While there are several best backgrounds in Starfield to choose from, you will want to go with the Soldier background to make your character as OP as possible. This is because, with Soldier, you get starting skills in Ballistics, Boost Pack Training, and Fitness. These are all skills you will push to get early on, so you could save those skill points and grab them now with the Soldier background.\nTraits are optional in Starfield, and you can select up to three. The kicker is that while you can lose traits in Starfield, you can't add them later on - another reason why starting on a fresh playthrough is best. The best traits to pick in Starfield to make your character as OP as possible are Alien DNA, Wanted, and Introvert.\nAlien DNA is arguably the most important because it provides more health and oxygen. While healing and food items are less effective with this trait, you will level up your character's Wellness skill, eventually rendering these effects obsolete in your game. You will also want to grab the Wanted trait. You will gain extra XP from bounties, and this trait will make your character OP by allowing you to deal extra damage when your health is low.\nThe final trait to acquire is Introvert. All it does is reduce your oxygen consumption when traveling alone. However, it's the perfect trait to combine with the Isolation skill, which is one of the skills you will be looking to max out.\nThe path to making your character as OP as possible in Starfield mainly depends on your chosen skills. Of course, the end goal of making your character as OP as possible should be to max out every skill in every skill tree in Starfield. That being said, some skills are more important to focus on than others. According to Khraze Gaming on YouTube, to make your character as OP as possible, you will want to focus on fully maxing out every one of these skills first.\nSkill Tree\nSkills to Max\nPhysical\n \nSocial\n \nCombat\n \nScience\n \nTech\n \nBy maxing out these skills, you will have the most OP character in Starfield. That being said, it will take a while to max out all the skills listed; that's why you will want to use this trick to level up fast in Starfield. The more XP you farm, the more skills you can buy; thus, the faster and more OP your character will become.\nAn Outpost XP Farm early on is also another great way to grind XP and Credits that will contribute to making an OP character.\nBecause you're focusing on leveling many skills in your Combat skill tree, any gun you use will automatically rip enemies to shreds. That being said, it's still worth looking at the most powerful weapons in Starfield. Though these weapons are already good, they will be even more powerful in your hands. What's more, because you're focusing on maxing out the \"Weapon Engineering\" skill in your Science skill tree, you can add mods to these weapons to make them even as OP as possible.\nYour armor is the finishing touch to take your OP character to the next level. While the Starborn Suit is the best armor in the game, you will have to wait a long time to get your hands on it. As a result, it is recommended to get the Mark 1 Spacesuit early in Starfield or the Mantis ship, suit, and backpack. Both are among the best armor in Starfield and which you choose depends on your preferred style.\nRegardless, if you follow the steps outlined above for your character's background, traits, and skills, it won't matter what guns and armor you use because you'll already have the most OP character in Starfield.\nSource: KhrazeGaming/YouTube\nRiley is currently attending Mount Royal University for a degree in Journalism.

Your mission here is to rescue the rebel leader Ali ibn Muhammad, preferably without getting caught by the many guards who swarm this large outpost. There are many ways to break into the Prison, from fighting your way inside to adopting a clever disguise.\nThe Gate Prison can be found by checking the World map and looking southwest from the Metal Factory, close to the Iron Gate that leads outside the main city. Depending on your notoriety level in Assassin's Creed Mirage, approaching this area could be fairly easy or incredibly hard to even show your face. Feel free to scout the location beforehand to know where guards patrol and how many are within the jail.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nWhile you could get into the Damascus Gate Prison by fighting your way inside, you can also ask for help from the Merchant or Rebel groups found nearby. Those who have no patience for a stealthy approach could take out guards in battle as they fight waves of enemies to reach Ali. However, this approach is obviously pretty dangerous in Assassin's Creed Mirage and would require you to have many healing items to recover from injuries.\nThe main character, Basim, can heal using Elixirs that restore your health to its maximum capacity, but you may only hold up to two at a time by this point in the game's story.\nClose to the Iron Gate by the jail, you can meet with a merchant who can help you sneak into the Prison by disguising you as their assistant. This favor isn't free, though, as you will have to pay the merchant one Merchant's Favor Token. This unique currency ordinarily gets you discounts with vendors across the city and is gained by either pickpocketing people on the streets or completing different Contracts in Assassin's Creed Mirage.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed Mirage: How to Find (& Complete) Contracts\nAnother way to get into the Prison is through the rebel you can talk to located to the east of the jail, who can rally a group of warriors to mount an assault against the Prison while you sneak in. This distraction may help more than the merchant since it takes out more than a few guards who could have exposed you inside the fortress. A Power Token that normally resets your notoriety will be needed to grant this favor from the rebel group.\nNo matter how you decide to infiltrate the Damascus Gate Prison in Assassin's Creed Mirage, you will still have to sneak past or eliminate several guards to find and rescue Ali ibn Muhammad.\n"}
{"title": "Starfield: The Best Physical Skill Builds", "date": "2023-10-06 10:00:25", "text": "While Combat skills seem to be the most appealing ones, you can excel in Starfield with a well-rounded Physical build. Here are some of the best.\nUsing Starfield’s best Physical skill builds can be an easy way of powering through opponents and getting through the game without major inconveniences – all while not excluding the challenge factor that outer space involves. Such builds are centered on grounded exploration and combat rather than using your spaceship and usually focus on survivability, combat power, and even stealth prowess. As Starfield is quite an open-ended RPG when it comes to skill trees, you can mix and match abilities to round out the perfect build. In fact, you are incentivized to do so, as most of the best Physical builds in the game stem from such combinations.\nPhysical skill builds do not necessarily mean that you will only invest in abilities from that tree, but that will be the main focus when building your character. You will likely be using many Combat skills in Starfield to perfect your Physical build, as combat abilities allow you to exterminate opponents while surviving hard battles. There are endless possibilities on how to build your character, especially because Starfield’s lack of a level cap essentially allows you to max out all of your skills, but focusing on specific builds while progressing through the game’s many stories can be a great way of making your experience more pleasant.\nRelated: 10 Starfield Quests You Definitely Want To Avoid\nA very fun Physical build to play around with is what you can call a space samurai build. Its focus is high survivability rates mixed with close and personal face-to-face combat with melee weapons – preferably a sword, which can make the build live up to its name. Mixed up with Ronin, one of the easiest Starfield character backgrounds to start off with, players can initiate their progress on the build from the get-go. While the damage output will largely stem from the Dueling skill on the Combat tree, you will want to invest most of your points on the skills from the Physical tree.\nThe Space Samurai Build in Starfield\nPhysical Skills\n \nOther Skills\n \nFor starters, your first priority should be the Wellness stat. Though there are objectives to unlock each level of the skill, you should try to max out all four levels as quickly as possible. This will boost your total HP by 40% and allow you to get in your enemies’ faces with an improved safety measure.\nThe second priority should be Pain Tolerance in the second row. You can either take it to level 3, which will reduce the physical damage you take by 15%, or max it out to get a 5% chance to completely ignore physical damage when your health is low.\nThe next obvious step is to maximize Martial Arts in the Physical tree as much as possible. This ability will increase your chances of landing a critical hit with a melee weapon by 15%, get a 15% boost to the chance of disarming your opponent, take 10% less damage, and reflect 50% back when blocking. This, of course, requires you to use some of Starfield’s best melee weapons, such as the Wakizashi. The last necessary skill is called Rejuvenation, and it will allow you to restore HP in and outside of battle if fully maxed out.\nIf you want, you can throw in a few extra skills to allow you to have different approaches to combat. Using Stealth and Concealment, both on the Physical tree, will give you the opportunity to walk around unnoticed, get close to opponents, and strike them down for 10x the regular damage you would normally do. This goes against the traditional samurai code and leans more into something of a shinobi, but everything is allowed in space. This is a fantastic complement to the build, leaving open combat as a second option to your stealthy slaughter.\nAnother similar build that focuses on melee damage is the boxer. Unlike the samurai, however, you will not be using melee weapons, but instead your bare hands. This build uses most of the high survivability skills offered from the previous skills, but takes advantage of the abilities that allow you to fight with your fists.\nThere is a decent amount of skills in Starfield that give you bonuses for not using weapons, so this is what the build is centered around.\nThe Boxer Build in Starfield\nPhysical Skills\n \nOther Skills\n \nOne of the main differences is that the Boxing skill from the Physical tree will be featured front and center with this build. The ability, when leveled up to 4, will allow you to do 100% more damage with unarmed attacks and give you a chance to knock down opponents. You will also consume less O2 when running in combat and using powered attacks. Another important skill in Starfield for the boxer build is Neurostrikes. At level 4, you will have a 20% chance of stunning an NPC with an unarmed attack, dealing additional EM damage, and knocking down nearby opponents when you stun an enemy.\nA skill that goes well with the samurai build but is essential for the boxer build is Gymnastics. This will allow you to use the combat slide and take less fall damage, while also increasing your jump height and overall running speed after using the combat slide or mantling.\nThe boxer build benefits from speed to get close to opponents and fight against them, so having this Physical skill unlocked can improve that strategy. The boxer in Starfield is equivalent to an overpowered monk in any fantasy RPG.\nSurvivability is key with the boxer build as well, so Wellness, Pain Tolerance, and Rejuvenation are also essential.\nThe last Physical build to use in Starfield is different from the two previous ones, which were focused on melee damage. The unstoppable tank build will also have a lot of survivability involved, but the focus here will be using powerful weapons to melt through opponents without ever having to stop or fear enemy encounters.\nThe idea is to be a complete juggernaut. Aside from Wellness, Pain Tolerance, and Rejuvenation, you will want to invest in all 4 levels of Weight Lifting. This Physical skill allows you to carry more weight and, thus, comfortably carry several heavy weapons and shotguns – you also get a 50% resistance boost to stagger.\nThe Unstoppable Tank Build in Starfield\nPhysical Skills\n \nOther Skills\n \nAnother Physical skill to use with this tank build is Energy Weapon Dissipation. This will reduce the energy damage you take and give you a chance to reflect it back to the opponent when your health is lower than 50% in Starfield. Because you are expected to take damage and, possibly be injured, Cellular Regeneration can also be a helpful Physical skill to invest in.\nAside from the Physical tree, there will also be important modifications to the skills from the Combat tree to make this Physical build work. Instead of Dueling, you will want to use Ballistics, Shotgun Certification, Demolitions, Heavy Certification, Rapid Reloading, and Targeting.\nThis will allow you to make the most out of shotguns and heavy weapons, as well as deal more damage when firing without aiming down your sights. With this, you become a walking grenadier and arsenal that can get close to opponents without fear of dying, exterminate them, and proceed to the next one.\nThere are several different Physical builds to use in Starfield, and these are some of the best and most varied ones to use so far.\n"}

To mark them on the map, Basim must spot them with either Enkidu or his own Eagle Vision.\nEnkidu can be scared away if you use him too close to a Restricted Area with a lot of guards, or near where there are archers on the rooftops.\nTo use Enkidu’s Eye, activate him and look for gold lines on the skyline. Focus on them and fly closer if necessary and Enkidu will mark it for you. This could also reveal other valuable items not automatically marked, such as Mysterious Shards, but look out for other gold lines as well. Basim can do the same thing using his Eagle Vision, but he will have to get much closer physically to do so.\nOnce the Gear Chest is marked, Basim will have to navigate to them, and these chests are almost always in Restricted Areas and behind locked or barred doors. This means Basim will have to take down a guard with a key or knock the bar off the door from a window to enter the room with the chest, as is the case in the Metal Factory. Try to employ stealth gameplay mechanics to do so, as being seen will cause Basim's Notoriety to increase.\nOnce you reach a Gear Chest, opening it might present another challenge to Basim. Some Gear Chests can be opened automatically, but others will require a Merchant Token, which is one of three types of Khidmah Tokens in the game. These Merchant Tokens can be found by completing Contracts, and some Gear Chests will require them to be opened. If Basim does not have any Merchant Tokens, he will have to return later to open the Gear Chest. Once he collects the Gear, Basim will be able to continue his journey through Baghdad in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage.\n"}

It was a rocky return for Ben Song (Raymond Lee), as the reboot's main character had to complete an exceptionally dangerous leap without the help of his team. Although he's ultimately successful, Ben later learns that he's actually been missing and presumed dead for three years. But before he can even begin to process the news, it's off to the next leap.\nIn an interview with TV Insider, Grismer shares that Quantum Leap season 2 will include more flashbacks to Ben's past. Grismer, who is also a directing producer on the series, mentions that the flashbacks will appear \"as they're needed\" which is something that's established in the premiere episode. Read Grismer's quote below:\n“There are various flashbacks throughout the season, for sure. They appear when they’re needed.”\nIn the debut episode of season 2, titled \"This Took Too Long,\" Ben has a moment where he flashes back to Addison (Caitlin Bassett). Toward the end of the installment, Ben thinks back to a conversation he had with Addison where he expresses fear of losing her because of their work on grand projects like Quantum Leap. She responds calmly, and with a gradually beaming smile, and says: \"Then you'll come find me.\" The conversation is clearly significant, given the news that Ben will receive moments later.\nAfter successfully completing the objective behind his leap, Ian (Mason Alexander Park) finds Ben. It's a heavy moment, but the emotion of their reunion doesn't land, With obvious reluctance, Ian tells Ben about how he's been missing and presumed dead. It sets up the rest of Quantum Leap season 2, but it also fulfills the flashback. Ben has lost Addison, he's lost time with her, and he has to find her again.\nRelated: Quantum Leap 2022 Cast & Character Guide\nIt's an early example of how the reboot, which airs Wednesdays on NBC and streams on Peacock, will weave in flashbacks. It's an important way of fleshing out the main character, which in itself is a key goal if the new Quantum Leap hopes to eventually have a chance of matching the original's popularity and largely enduring cultural relevance.\nSource: TV Insider\nAbdullah Al-Ghamdi joined Screen Rant in 2019.

Here’s how to get it.\nUnlocking the Agaou Throwing Axe in Cyberpunk 2077’s Phantom Liberty DLC is a great idea, as the new weapon added can do some impressive damage to opponents. The throwable machete is part of Phantom Liberty, a paid expansion for CD Projekt Red’s popular RPG. The Agaou is considered an iconic piece of gear and one of the coolest new weapons in Cyberpunk 2077. What makes it so special is that it can be thrown at enemies for massive damage but, in addition to that, it also discharges an AoE shock effect onto them.\nThis additional electric damage not only eats away at their life bar but also has a considerable explosion radius that affects nearby characters. What makes the Agaou Throwing Axe a special weapon is that it has a perk that grants a 125% headshot damage multiplier. With a throwing weapon build, the potential of the Agaou can be enhanced significantly, especially if you are using a Sandevistan that allows you to slow time and throw the axe with critical precision. This is easily one of the strongest melee weapons in the Phantom Liberty DLC and one that should immediately be sought out if you are looking to improve your damage output.\nMore Cyberpunk: 10 Most Powerful New Weapons (Phantom Liberty DLC)\nUnlocking the Agaou Throwing Axe in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is fairly simple, especially when considering how powerful the weapon actually is. To get it, you will need to head to the southeastern portion of Dogtown, a new area added with the DLC. There, you will find a location with increased criminal activity, which will be the base where you can get the Agaou.\nTo reach the destination, you can fast-travel to the Luxor Wellness Spa waypoint and start heading south until you see the icon with the three skulls. This is where your enemies will be, and where you will finally obtain the Agaou in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. The next step is cleaning the house, so you can eliminate all the criminals in the area and make your way through the building. The strategy you employ here is irrelevant, so you can either go in guns blazing or try a stealthier approach.\nThe important thing is that you eliminate the big boss at the end, named Ayo Zarin. They fight primarily with melee weapons and have a large chunk of health, so adapt your combat strategy accordingly. Upon defeating them, you will be able to loot the Agaou Throwing Axe off Ayo Zarin’s body, along with several other items. These include a cache access card, which grants you access to a nearby loot room in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty.\n"}

Players will encounter a Shard early in the game at the end of the tutorial, but it will not be until the end of the first main investigation in Baghdad that players will be able to encounter them again. This will happen when Roshan tells Basim to reconnect with Nehal after he admits that he is troubled by how they parted.\nMysterious Shards are one way to find premium Gear, although they will only unlock one full set of Gear in total. Players can find more Gear by opening chests, but Mysterious Shards are also the only way to finish Neha's Calling Investigation. This will lead players to search for Mysterious Shards and find a hidden chamber.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nWhen Basim finds Nehal, one of the recurring secondary characters in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, again she will ask him to investigate the Mysterious Shards to help her out. This will start Nehal’s Calling Quest on the Investigation menu, and Basim will have to track down a mysterious area in the desert. She will give him a couple of clues as to where to find this area, and Basim will agree to try to help her with her obsession.\nThis is also the time when Basim can start finding Mysterious Shards, as before that while they are listed as a collectible in each region on the map of Baghdad, it will not be possible to find them. Like with Dervis’ Artifacts, players will have to find them by wandering around various parts of the map. They will spawn randomly, and when players approach they will learn that Order members are transporting them around Baghdad.\nOnce Basim has found an Order member with a Mysterious Shard, they can follow them throughout the streets of historical Baghdad to find a good place to ambush them. Players have to assassinate the Order member to get the Shard, but this might be dangerous as most of them also travel with guards. Look for hiding places along the road to lure guards away and whittle down their numbers. Once the Order member is alone, do the same thing to take them down and get their Shard piece.\nThe best way is typically to find a haystack, as Basim will not likely be noticed, and it will count as a stealth kill even if civilians and guards are nearby. Hide in a haystack and pull the Order member in to assassinate them.\nBasim can find the place by searching for the right area, as the clues suggest that it is near an oasis north of the ‘Aqarquf Dunes. There is a Synchronization Point right next to an oasis drawing on the Northeast corner of the map, and that is where Basim should head. Dive into the water and into a cave and follow it through until the end to find the chamber with pillars inside.\nEach pillar will require a different number of Mysterious Shards, and once Basim has enough to fill one he can put his Shards in that pillar and exchange them for a piece of Gear. The first one available is the Samsaama, a special dagger that can steal health every fifth hit, and the gear found in the chamber is already fully upgraded. Find all the Mysterious Shards to fully unlock the chamber, the gear hidden within, and complete Nehal’s Calling Quest in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage.\n"}
{"title": "Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s Best Armor Is A Huge Disappointment", "date": "2023-10-06 11:01:25", "text": "One of the most elusive quest rewards in Assassin’s Creed Mirage is fittingly effective, but it doesn’t really fit into the game satisfyingly.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage doesn't quite employ the extensive gear systems of its RPG predecessors, but there is still a decent number of options when it comes to what outfit to wear. The wardrobe Basim can collect throughout the game is largely comprised of robes resembling those traditionally worn by the Hidden Ones – often primarily white or off-white and hooded – but some, and particularly some costumes, have a bit more variety, including a few that are definitely more armored than Basim's default attire. The most exclusive outfit in the game, however, is disappointing compared to the verisimilitude offered by most others.\n[Warning: The following article contains minor spoilers for Assassin's Creed Mirage.]\nTaking players to 9th century Baghdad, AC Mirage is a refreshing return to the series' central, long-running conflict between the Hidden Ones and the Order of the Ancients – two shadowy organizations that would manifest the Assassin Brotherhood and Templar Order respectively in later centuries. Mirage's gameplay reflects this return to the series' earlier era as well, in part including a number of outfits which don't have defensive stats, but do provide unique perks. There is also a certain set of collectibles, which offers a mysterious set of armor as its ultimate reward, a quest line which has seen multiple variations in the series since Assassin's Creed 2.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nFairly early in Assassin's Creed Mirage, Nehal tells Basim of a supposed treasure hidden somewhere near an oasis in the desert north of Baghdad, beginning a quest called \"The Ancient Place.\" The aptly named Northern Oasis is indeed holding such a treasure – three, in fact, locked behind mysterious mechanisms in a cave only accessible by diving to the bottom of the oasis' water. The mechanisms are unlocked by inserting a certain number of Mysterious Shards, found on the person of and taken from (either through pickpocketing or killing and looting) people connected to the Order throughout Baghdad.\nFive Shards will unlock the most coveted prize: Milad's Outfit. The trait unique to Milad's Outfit, Forgotten Terror, makes it so a bright flash of lightning disorients nearby enemies whenever a successful air assassination is performed (i.e. jumping on an enemy from above to assassinate them). Especially in the later sections of the game, when Milad's Outfit is likely to be acquired and a breadth of other tools in Basim's possession make Mirage's dangerous combat less so, this flash of lightning can help tremendously. Not only does it give the player an immediate advantage over surrounding enemies in a fight, it also makes it so performing an assassination and fleeing the scene is much easier.\nRelated: \"What [Players] Loved First\" - Simon Arseneault On Assassin's Creed Mirage\nWhile helpful in a variety of gameplay situations, Milad's Outfit looks a bit ridiculous, like an over-designed suit from a Marvel movie, and feels entirely disconnected from the rest of the game. AC Mirage – despite featuring Basim as its protagonist – actually has very little to do with the Isu. Simply collecting these Mysterious Shards and slotting them into an ancient mechanism is far less interesting than a reward that has a meaningful connection to the story. For instance, the Armor of Altaïr, which can be acquired by Ezio in Assassin's Creed 2, deepens the connection between the two master assassins, fits into the story of Ezio recovering Altaïr's codex, and is in sync with the general aesthetic of the Assassin Brotherhood.\nMilad's Outfit's only connection to Mirage's story is that Order members are seeking it, and apparently covet the Mysterious Shards. Milad is never mentioned in any other capacity, and the outfit is woefully anachronistic. It even goes so far as to alter Basim's voice, making it deeper and slightly digitized – an understandable feat for a bit of Isu technology, but it feels shoe-horned into Mirage like something of an obligation. Having powerful and unique rewards for potentially lengthy side adventures is always welcome, but the reward for collecting the Mysterious Shards in Assassin's Creed Mirage, Milad's Outfit, is quite a letdown. Luckily, its powerful perk can still be utilized with its appearance changed by equipping a Costume.\n"}
{"title": "When Loki Takes Place In MCU Timeline", "date": "2023-10-06 11:40:25", "text": "Loki will pick up with the God of Mischief both before and after his death in Avengers: Endgame, and here's how it fits into the MCU timeline.\nHere's where Loki fits into the Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline. First released as the third of Marvel's Disney+ shows, Loki brings back Tom Hiddleston as the titular God of Mischief, following on from his disappearance with the Space Stone in Avengers: Endgame. That movie fully introduced time travel to the MCU (after it was first explored in Doctor Strange), and Loki takes things further, revealing the Time Variance Authority (TVA), which keeps watch over the timeline and multiverse, with the Loki season 1 ending carrying some major implications for both.\nAll of that means the MCU timeline (or timelines) is central to Loki, which feels particularly necessary after Avengers: Endgame. That movie created several branches, and while most were closed by the time the end credits rolled, there were some discrepancies and disagreements over exactly how it all worked. That's something Loki puts right, but just where - or rather, when - exactly do its own events take place, and how does it fit into the MCU overall?\nRelated: Everything We Know About Loki Season 3\nThe answer to where Loki fits in the MCU timeline is a slightly convoluted one. Because he teleported away with the Tesseract, creating a new branched timeline, Loki takes place after The Avengers in 2012, with the God of Mischief still a villain and several years away from redemption. However, the show is also releasing after Endgame, and it's clear the film's events have also taken place, because the time heist had to have happened in order for Loki to have teleported away (something the series shows and addresses). That puts it in a strange position of existing in several places of the timeline, or perhaps none at all would be more accurate, but it does make sense given the involvement of the TVA.\nThe TVA operates outside of time and space, meaning it doesn't have to adhere to the same rules of the MCU timeline. While Loki teleports away into another timeline during Endgame, he is found by the TVA and taken to their headquarters, meaning that he too now exists outside of the timeline itself. That puts the character in a fascinating position, allowing for several different possibilities for where he might go next. Loki itself features different time periods - especially given Loki season 2's time-slipping - and so the character can be shown all across the MCU's timeline, rather than in one fixed point, even though his journey is more linearly picking up from that point in 2012.\nRelated: Loki’s Complete MCU Timeline Explained\nMarvel Phase 4 is utilizing several different timeline tricks. Black Widow is a prequel set between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War; WandaVision took place just after Avengers: Endgame, but mimicked multiple decades; Eternals spans thousands of years. It's an approach that helps massively expand the scope of the MCU and naturally fits as it looks to open up the multiverse too. Loki works well for both of those because of its ability to explore different timelines, including the many branches created in Endgame, while also creating a new character arc following on from The Avengers.\n"}

At the end of episode 4, the main students arrived at Dr. Cardosa's house to subdue Sam, who went there to kill the doctor for his involvement in the Woods. While Marie is trying to get Sam to calm down, she suddenly wakes up in bed next to Jordan.\nNow, Prime Video has released a new trailer for Gen V episode 5, revealing Marie's sudden time jump didn't just impact her. In the trailer, Jordan reveals they are missing multiple days of time, which is implied to have impacted everyone who was at Cardosa's house. The trailer also promises a look inside Sam's psyche as he battles people he thinks are puppets.\nPrior to Marie waking up in bed with Jordan, she had been trying to calm Sam down after Emma grew in size and pinned him to the ground. However, now that her and her friends have lost time following their attempt to save Cardosa, it's unclear what the final results of their efforts were. It's also unknown why they lost time, or how it's connected to Gen V's ongoing Woods mystery.\nSince everyone involved in the incident has been impacted, it's likely a Supe is behind their memory loss. Sam may have more powers than he's letting on, wiping the students' memories so he can escape without them every finding out where he went. Another possibility is that Cardosa called a Supe who knows about the Woods to step in, erasing Marie and her friends' memories to ensure whatever happened in those missing days is never discovered.\nNow that Gen V has introduced a new memory loss mystery, it appears the group discovering the truth behind the Woods will be much harder than they thought. Perhaps the mystery surrounding the Woods will be used to set up a dangerous new storyline in The Boys season 4, which is expected to follow-up one some plot points from the spinoff. Now that the Woods' conspiracy has deepened, it will prove even harder to discover everything going on below Godolkin.\nSource: Prime Video\n"}
{"title": "Who Is Ravonna Renslayer? Loki's Marvel Villain & Kang Link Explained", "date": "2023-10-06 11:50:25", "text": "Judge Renslayer is a primary character in Loki season 1 and 2. Here's who Ravonna Renslayer is in the comics, and what her connection is to Kang.\nIn Loki, Judge Ravonna Renslayer, an agent with the Time Variance Authority (TVA), an organization responsible for maintaining the proper flow of time in the MCU, is played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Ravonna Renslayer has a wealth of comic book history to back her up as a character. Crucially, her comic history links her strongly to Kang the Conquerer, the time-traveling, multiverse-hopping villain who is set to be a large part of the MCU's upcoming future.\nThroughout Loki Mbatha-Raw's role as Ravonna Renslayer is both memorable and divisive. While she plays a friend to Mobius, the Loki season 1 ending - and the first episode of season 2 - paint her in a more complicated light. Flashbacks demonstrate her callousness in following TVA rule as she worked as an agent to collect even child variants like Sylvie. In the comics, Ravonna is known best as the long-time love interest of Kang the Conqueror, the villain intent on ruling all timelines. Here’s everything to know about Loki’s antagonistic TVA judge, her comics origin, and link to Kang.\nRelated: Everything We Know About Loki Season 3\nMbatha-Raw’s Loki casting was announced in February 2020. At the time, reports did not state which character she’d be playing in the Disney+ series. However, it was revealed her role would be that of the leading lady. Judge Renslayer's role in season 1 provided more context for this, showing Ravonna's time in the TVA, and her turn from being intensely committed to the faction - hunting down Sylvie and turning on Mobius for the TVA - to becoming one of its biggest critics in season 2 in order to try and bring about meaningful change for the institution, and protect the recently reformed multiverse.\nThis serves to flesh out a figure who both serves an antagonistic role, but who also has some real moral complexity, making her future in the Loki season 2 cast all the more exciting. Given Renslayer's comic origins, it seems she may well play just as integral a role in the second season as she did in the first.\nRavonna Renslayer was first introduced in 1965’s Avengers #23 and has gone by several different aliases, including Terminatrix and Temptress. She was born in the late 40th century and is the daughter of King Carelius, a ruler of one of Kang’s kingdoms. While Ravonna doesn’t have any superhuman abilities, she is highly intelligent and is skilled in hand-to-hand combat and proficient in the use of advanced future technology. Using a teleporter and other futuristic tech to detect energy fields, Ravonna is capable of traveling through time.\nShe has gone up against the Fantastic Four and the Avengers, who attempted to stop her from retrieving the Ultimate Nullifier, a weapon capable of destroying anyone the wielder wishes. In this instance, Renslayer wanted to destroy Kang the Conqueror, who opted to kill the Avengers rather than save her while visiting with the Grandmaster. At other times, she’s been the Avengers’ ally (though it’s short-lived), working with them to defeat Kang from taking over the 40th century. Renslayer is relentless, passionate, and incredibly capable. No matter what Renslayer got up to, however, she proved how clever and formidable a foe and ally (depending on the day) she could be sans powers.\nRavonna Renslayer first crossed paths with the time-traveling Kang when he attempted to conquer her kingdom and fold it into his growing empire in the 40th century. For a long time, Kang’s love for Renslayer was one-sided, and she despised him because of his imperialistic ways. When the Avengers showed up to defeat Kang, she initially joined them to do so in a bid to stop him. Due to his love for Renslayer, Kang allowed the kingdom to rebel against his plans because he hoped Ravonna would change her mind and marry him. Kang was certainly smitten considering Ravonna is the only ruler he didn’t kill while seizing control.\nWhen Kang’s general attempts to assassinate him, Ravonna sacrifices herself to save him, putting her in a coma until Kang could find a way to revive her. Ravonna becomes Kang’s greatest love and greatest nemesis - someone who loved him, then sought revenge and killed him. While the time-displaced princess eventually returns Kang’s feelings, she often feels betrayed by his actions. He’d much rather conquer the timeline or try and kill the Avengers than save her, and Ravonna grew tired of coming in second place to his diabolical schemes. Either way, her love-hate relationship with Kang plays a big role in her story. At one point, Ravonna even becomes the ruler of Chronopolis, a realm Kang created outside of time.\nRelated: 10 Burning Questions Loki Season 2 Can Finally Answer\nJudge Renslayer’s link to Kang is crucial. Her presence in Loki foreshadowed the show's plans to bring the time-traveling villain into the MCU as early on as the series. It’s important to note Jonathan Majors was officially cast as Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man 3, which means plans for his role in the MCU were already in motion. Considering Ant-Man came up with the idea to use the Quantum Realm to time travel, it makes sense that Kang would be a villain in the film. However, bringing Major's Kang into the MCU at the end of Loki season 1 allows for more build-up before he appears in later movies, and helps to develop the complex character more thoroughly.\nIt's unclear how much of Ravonna's origin story has been retained by the MCU, and how much of it might come into play later, if at all. Ravonna's variant is shown to the TVA as a school teacher who very much is not a princess in the 40th century. Additionally, while she knows a lot of the TVA's secrets, it is unclear how she knows them, how much she knows about Kang's existence, and whether Miss Minutes plays some role in the relationship between the two. However, Loki season 2 is sure to explore more about the Renslayer, and could well angle into adapting more of her comic storyline for the MCU.\nThe MCU has played fast and loose with comic backstories before, so it's no surprise that it's seemingly the same for Ravonna Renslayer. Loki season 2 has a lot of opportunities to further expand the character, potentially allowing for some aspects from the comic to be enmeshed alongside an entirely new and exciting story, whenever and wherever that takes her.\n"}
{"title": "Star Wars Spoiled Its Thrawn Finale Twist Two Weeks Ago", "date": "2023-10-06 12:00:24", "text": "A frightening new soldier for Grand Admiral Thrawn debuts in the Ahsoka season 1 finale, having been foreshadowed by two previous episodes.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nThe season 1 finale of Ahsoka featured the surprising appearance of zombie stormtroopers, which was foreshadowed in previous episodes. As a concept, zombie stormtroopers have been around since the Star Wars Legends continuity, debuting in the 2009 horror novel Death Troopers, by Joe Schreiber. Fascinatingly – and perhaps unsurprisingly – both iterations of the undead stormtroopers are zombified by the dark side of the Force in some form.\nIn Ahsoka episode 8 “Part Eight: The Jedi, The Witch, and The Warlord,” a team of Thrawn’s stormtroopers is sent to confront Ahsoka Tano, Ezra Bridger, and Sabine Wren, aware that they will be no match for the Jedi trio. After being cut down, the stormtroopers are promptly resurrected as near-invincible zombies by the dark magick powers of the Great Mothers, a trio of Dathomirian Nightsister Witches. This grisly use of the stormtroopers was foreshadowed on two occasions in previous Ahsoka episodes.\nThrawn’s contingent of stormtroopers appears along with Grand Admiral himself in “Part Six: Far, Far Away.” The stormtroopers, like Thrawn, were sent to Peridea by Ezra Bridger and a group of purrgil in the series finale of Star Wars Rebels, so the soldiers had spent years on the extragalactic world, surviving with no resources other than what was aboard Thrawn’s flagship, the Chimaera. Fittingly, their protective suits of armor are in various stages of disrepair, displaying cracks and missing elements, which are replaced (or held together) by gold and red ribbons. Most fascinatingly, the episode’s subtitles refer to them not as stormtroopers, but as Night Troopers.\nAt first, it appeared that this was simply a nickname for the stranded stormtroopers who continue to serve Grand Admiral Thrawn, but the Ahsoka finale makes their name far more fitting. The Night Troopers, like Thrawn, are allies of the Nightsisters, whose new lore establishes that they originate on Peridea. The fact that a group of the Night Troopers are turned into the stormtrooper equivalent to Nightsister zombies (like those seen in Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Jedi: Fallen Order) makes their name an even better instance of foreshadowing.\nRelated: 15 Star Wars Easter Eggs In Episode 8\nThe Night Troopers themselves were foreshadowed two episodes before their debut in Ahsoka “Part Four: Fallen Jedi.” The mysterious former Imperial Inquisitor Marrok spews a green mist upon being struck down by Ahsoka Tano, making him likely a magick-enhanced Nightbrother or perhaps simply a zombified Inquisitor. While Marrok's resurrection was likely the work of Morgan Elsbeth, the Great Mothers demonstrated their ability to reanimate deceased beings at a much higher scale with the Night Troopers. With Thrawn and the Great Mothers arriving on Dathomir at the end of the Ahsoka finale, the New Republic will likely soon face more of his zombified minions.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}

Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story is a prequel series to Shonda Rhimes' hit Netflix series Bridgerton and while it primarily follows the rise of a young Queen Charlotte (India Amarteifio), the show explores several Bridgerton characters in their younger years, such as King George III (Corey Mylchreest), Lady Agatha Danbury (Arsema Thomas), Brimsley (Sam Clemmett), and of course Violet Ledger (Connie Jenkins-Grieg).\nWhile a potential Queen Charlotte season 2 has not been confirmed since it was only intended to be a miniseries, the success of the show could lead to the development of other Bridgerton spin-offs that focus on different characters. The events of Queen Charlotte could even possibly affect a potential storyline in Bridgerton season 3 involving Violet and Lady Danbury. Hailed for their diversity and steamy scenes, both Bridgerton and Queen Charlotte have been huge successes, and the demand for Bridgerton spinoffs has skyrocketed. And one character whom Rhimes is seriously considering for a potential spinoff is the young Violet.\nRELATED: Queen Charlotte Already Gave Bridgerton Season 3 Its Best Story\nConnie Jenkins-Grieg plays a younger version of Violet Bridgerton. While the young Violet's role in Queen Charlotte is much smaller compared to the show's main cast, the series still does an excellent job showcasing what a young teenage Violet was like before she married Edmund (Rupert Evans) and became the Dowager Viscountess Bridgerton. Queen Charlotte also focuses on Violet's relationship with her parents, unveiling that while she had an uneasy relationship with her mother, she had a much stronger and happier relationship with her father, who often made hats for the young Violet.\nAdditionally, when comparing Jenkins-Grieg's performance with that of Ruth Gemmell's portrayal of the character in Bridgerton, the two very much complement each other as both provide their own spin on Violet without having each version clash against each other. Considering that she is much older in Bridgerton, Gemmell does an excellent job portraying Violet as a fiercely protective and loving mother while Jenkins-Grieg excels at showcasing a much younger, enthusiastic, and energetic teenage version of the character.\nWhile Queen Charlotte creator Shonda Rhimes has not confirmed whether any other Bridgerton spinoffs are in development, she did hint that she is very passionate about the idea of working on a story centered on Violet and that she would be very interested in that being the possible next spinoff. When speaking about Queen Charlotte Rhimes said, \"There's no plan to explore anybody in particular. I was just doing this because I was so passionate about the subject. Although, in writing it I got very interested in Violet's story. So, we'll see.\" (via Hello) However, whether this Violet Bridgerton spinoff will happen is still unclear, but hopefully, its development will be confirmed soon.\nTimothy Lee is a writer who has been working at Screen Rant since 2023.

{"title": "10 Massive Story Spoilers For Baldur's Gate 3", "date": "2023-10-06 12:00:24", "text": "Although Baldur's Gate 3 is a game built on player choice, the main plot still manages to be packed with twists and reveals to keep players guessing.\nIn a game as massive as Baldur’s Gate 3, it should come as no surprise that there are twists and turns to the plot. With such an epic plot full of adventure and romance, these twists can catch some off guard. From character motivations to shocking identity reveals, BG3's story has plenty to keep even those coming back for yet another playthrough on their toes.\n[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3.]\nSet over 120 years after Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn, Baldur's Gate 3 sees the rise of a new dangerous cult linked to mind flayers and seeking world domination. With many different endings that depend on choices made throughout the plot, BG3 cannot be fully experienced in a single playthrough. With that in mind, although there is still plenty to surprise during a repeat playthrough, there are some key story moments that will only be as impactful once.\nRelated: \"An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas\": Baldur's Gate 3 Review\nOnce in the Shadow-Cursed Lands in Act 2 Mizora, Wyll’s patron, will pay the camp a little visit. She has a mission for Wyll, and the rest of the party to rescue one of Zariel’s ‘assets’ who has been grabbed by the cultist of the Absolute. This is a great opportunity to negotiate with Mizora to try to free Wyll from his contract with her.\nRelated: All Baldur's Gate 3 Characters That Can Join Camp, Ranked\nThe twist comes when reaching the Mind Flayer Colony under Moonrise Towers and discovering that Mizora herself is the one who needs rescuing and is trapped in one of the mind flayer pods. There is then a choice to save her or leave her to die, but as killing her will also mean Wyll dies as well, letting her out of the pod is the best option.\nOnce in Act Three of Baldur’s Gate 3, the party will hear about a new crime boss in the city known as the Stone Lord. This new criminal is terrorizing the other criminal guilds who ask for the party’s aid in dealing with this issue. In particular, Nine-Fingers, the leader of the Guild, will want to talk to Jaheira, where she will reveal that the Stone Lord is none other than Jaheira’s old companion, Minsc. Hearing this information is one thing, but when it is confirmed by confronting the Stone Lord at the Counting House, nothing feels quite like seeing Minsc in the role of a villain.\nRelated: Baldur's Gate 3: Why Minsc's Return Is Such A Big Deal\nMinthara is a drow paladin found in the Shattered Sanctum in Act One, who will ask the party to reveal the location of the Druid Grove. Siding with her will mean the end for all the druids and tielfings there and is one of the more morally objectionable decisions in Baldur’s Gate 3. However, what isn’t immediately obvious is that Minthara is simply a thrall under the control of the Absolute.\nRelated: Baldur's Gate 3: Pros & Cons Of Romancing Minthara In BG3\nAfter siding with her in Act One, she can be met again in Moonrise Towers, where the other members of the cult have turned on her and sentenced her to death. Once she is rescued, it is revealed that just like many of the other True Souls the party has met, Minthara's mind was not entirely her own.\nAt the beginning of Act Three, the sleeping party is ambushed by githyanki and the Dream Guardian, who has been protecting everyone from the Absolute, calls out for help. Entering the Astral Prism leads to one of the biggest twists in the game as it is revealed that the Guardian is who they appear.\nPleading for the party’s help is a mind flayer calling themself the Emperor, explaining that they didn’t think the player character would help if they knew the Dream Guardian’s true identity. Refusing to help will mean a game over, but it is shocking to meet the party’s savior face-to-face for the first time and see who they really are.\nJust as the party is coming to grips with working with a mind flayer, BG3 throws another twist with the Emperor at the team. Delving into the Wyrmway beneath Baldur’s Gate, the party can discover even more about their illithid ally. After battling an undead dragon, it is revealed that the Emperor was once Balduran, famed adventurer and founder of Baldur’s Gate. When asked about it, the Emperor will show their life through flashbacks, including how they became a mind flayer.\nRelated: Should You Help The Emperor In Baldur's Gate 3?\nIn the beginning, it is insinuated by the Dream Guardian that they are the one keeping the party safe from the Absolute with their own powers. However, at the same time, it is revealed that they are a mind flayer called the Emperor. It is also revealed that the true source of the party’s protection is the imprisoned githyanki, Prince Orpheus. Orpheus is the son of Mother Gith, who freed her people from the mind flayers with her power to block their influence, a power she passed onto her son. Later in BG3, the party will face the decision of whether or not to free Orpheus, but his initial reveal is one that stands out.\nRelated: Baldur's Gate 3: Should You Free Orpheus In BG3 Or Side With The Emperor?\nVery early in Baldur’s Gate 3, the party will learn about a magical artifact called the Nightsong that is supposed to be hidden under the temple of Selune. A wizard named Lorroakan has even hired a band of adventurers to find it, but they found themselves outmatched by the goblins. However, it is not until the end of Act Two that the Nightsong is revealed to be a person, not an item, the aasimar daughter of Selune, Dame Aylin. Learning that the Nightsong is a person puts a whole new slant on Lorroakan’s search, especially once it is revealed that he knows what the Nightsong really is.\nShadowheart is one of the more complex companions in Baldur’s Gate 3, with a mysterious past that she can only partially remember. However, if she is encouraged to turn away from Shar, her personal questline will eventually lead to a massive and heartbreaking reveal. Shadowheart learns that her parents were followers of Selune, Shar’s sister and rival and that she was taken as part of that rivalry.\nRelated: Jennifer English On How Baldur's Gate 3's Shadowheart Was \"Her Dream Job\"\nBut it gets even more tragic as Shadowheart’s parents are revealed to be alive, held prisoner by Shar, and used to torment Shadowheart. At the end of the quest, Shadowheart is forced to make the choice: return to Shar and free her parents, or stay free herself and let them die.\nRaphael is a character met very early on in BG3, and once he has properly introduced himself, the party will learn he is a cambion, wishing to make a deal with them. However, the terms of the deal are unclear, and it is not until Act Three that Raphael’s full plan is explained. Raphael is, in fact, the son of Mephistopheles, one of the rulers in the Nine Hells, and he wants to make a deal to put him ahead of his father.\nRaphael will offer the Orphic Hammer to free Prince Orpheus and work with him in place of the Emperor. In exchange, Raphael wants the Crown of Karsus, which is currently being used to control the elderbrain. The Crown will allow him to take control of the Hells and eventually beyond, and should the party take the deal, Raphael will further explain his grant plan in a post-credits cutscene.\nAt the beginning of BG3, the enemy seems to be a strange new cult, worshiping a new god and controlling its followers with mind flayer tadpoles. However, it is not until Act Two that the true threat is revealed, as the cult is a front for the Dead Three, Bhaal, Bane, and Myrkul, who once again are attempting world domination.\nThis is a fantastic and clever way to link Baldur’s Gate 3 to its predecessors and without using the same paths that had been trodden before. However, there is a further twist at the very end when the elder brain explains that it was the true genius behind the entire plan and used the Dead Three Chosen to bring them the Crown of Karsus and build an army for them to set in motion the Grand Design.\n"}

{"title": "Even Dragon Ball Fans Missed The Real Reason Vegeta Became A Villain in Super", "date": "2023-10-06 12:00:24", "text": "Vegeta became a villain again in Dragon Ball Super, but this actually has a great explanation and it's connected to Destruction and Ultra Ego.\nAlthough fans were undoubtedly excited when Vegeta briefly reverted to his villainous ways during Dragon Ball Super's Granolah the Survivor Arc, this seemed quite sudden and unexpected. However, the series already explained why it happened, and subsequently proved that the Saiyan Prince would likely never suffer another relapse like that again.\nVegeta turns on Goku in chapter #76 of Dragon Ball Super, going off to fight Granloah on his own, but what Vegeta mutters to himself when the Cerealean is about to kill him demonstrates that Beerus led him to believe that he needed to change as a person to effectively wield the Power of Destruction (Hakai). In chapter #69 of Dragon Ball Super, Beerus tells Vegeta that his own power as a God of Destruction is unbounded because he only thinks about destruction, and that if Vegeta wanted to wield Destruction, he would have to destroy any stray thoughts he had.\nAt the time, Beerus was chiding Vegeta for spending too much time feeling responsible for the sins of the Saiyan race. However, Vegeta clearly interpreted Beerus' words as a need to return to his old, ruthless ways. During the fight against Granloah, Vegeta forces his opponent to destroy the ruins of his list civilization, and then even attacks Goku, telling him he would rather die than team up with him again. This seemed a completely random turn to fans, but it all makes sense because Vegeta was actually trying to master his new power, which came to fruition with his Ultra Ego transformation.\nHowever, as proved by his later apology to Beerus, Vegeta was only fighting dirty against Granolah and said those horrible things to Goku because he was trying to wield Destruction in the most effective way, as Beerus told him to. This would explain why Vegeta is able to drop acting like he once did almost too quickly, as though nothing even happened. Surely enough, soon after that Vegeta teams up with Goku again, and the two Saiyans witness together the memories of Bardock, creating an even stronger bond over the legacy of their species.\nSo even though many fans may have felt that Dragon Ball Super promised to make Vegeta a villain again and then failed to deliver, Beerus' comments to Vegeta about how he could master Destruction and then Vegeta's admission about how he failed to revert to how he once was all explain everything perfectly. Vegeta's return to villainy failed because he was trying to be someone he no longer was, and Dragon Ball Super was just giving fans one last glimpse of this version of the Saiyan Prince before shutting the door on that chapter of his life for good.\n"}
{"title": "Loki Time-Slipping Explained: All 3 Timelines Loki Jumps To", "date": "2023-10-06 12:00:26", "text": "Loki season 2 finds the God of Mischief slipping through time – a phenomena that seems similar to glitching in the Spider-Verse.\nLoki season 2 finds the Asgardian God of Mischief dealing with the problem of time-slipping - a process in the MCU that seems remarkably similar to glitching from the Spider-Verse franchise. The comparison is a fair one, given how the Spider-Verse and Loki season 2 cast both deal with the concept of a disorganized multiverse and variants traveling to times and spaces not their own. It is unclear, however, if there is a technical difference between time-slipping and glitching, or if the only difference between the two conditions is terminology.\nThe concept of time-slipping was first introduced in the Loki season 2 trailer, as Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Agent Mobius (Owen Wilson) met with O.B. (Ke Huy Quan). A member of the TIme Variance Authority's \"Repairs and Advancement\" division, O.B. was able to identify the strange condition that seemed to be paining Loki and causing him to randomly teleport across time and space as \"time-slipping.\" A more worrying problem, however, was the fact that it was supposed to be impossible for anyone to time-slip within the Time Variance Authority's offices, and yet Loki was somehow managing it.\nLoki season 2's main timeline is in present-day - specifically, just after the events of the Loki season 1 finale. This naturally makes it the most important timeline thus far in the show, as it covers the current events of series, including detailing Mobius and O.B's efforts to help Loki tackle his unusual condition. However, the other two timelines shown in Loki season 2, episode 1 are also definitely noteworthy.\nLoki is sent far into the past in the show, providing a look at a whole new period of the MCU multiverse's history. This is the result of Sylvie sending him back in time in the Loki season 1 finale, allowing her to kill He Who Remains without interference. However, being sent back in time appears to have created more issues for Loki than just the initial transportation into the past, as it may well be responsible for his time-slipping in season 2.\nLoki season 2 episode 1 also shows a glimpse into the future, which doesn't look promising for either Loki, the TVA, or the MCU, to say the least. This glance at the future shows it on the brink of destruction, which is worrying enough by itself without the extra information that Sylvie appearing in it looking the same means it can't be that much further in the future. Hopefully the efforts of Loki and his allies can prevent this from staying what the future looks like, though nothing is certain at this point in time.\nIt is still uncertain precisely why Loki is time-slipping in Loki season 2. What is clear is that he is being pulled randomly \"between the past and present\" and between multiple points in time as well as space. It is possible that the time-slipping is some manner of side effect of Loki's encounter with He Who Remains in the Loki season 1 finale and the chaos that was unleashed when the Sacred Timeline was broken, or a result of Sylvie sending him back in time. It is also possible that the time-slipping is a time-based attack being inflicted on Loki by one of the many Kang variants now running unchecked across reality.\nWhatever the reason for Loki's time-slipping, it cannot be denied that the physical symptoms are remarkably similar to glitching from the Spider-Verse films. Glitching occurs when beings enter a universe that is not their own and begin to experience intense physical pain as their bodies shift wildly, rebelling against the differing reality around them. The Spider Society were able to avoid glitching with the use of advanced technology, which is apparently unknown to the Time Variance Authority if glitching and time-slipping are the same thing.\nHowever, while the symptoms are similar, there is no guarantee that time-slipping and glitching are the same thing. A number of multiverse travelers entered the Marvel Cinematic Universe during the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home and none of them showed symptoms similar to either glitching or time-slipping. There could be some other factor in play, such as Doctor Strange's magic negating the effects of time-slipping or glitching. It is also possible, as one theory suggests, that the Raimi Spider-Man and Amazing Spider-Man universes are similar enough to the MCU to not cause immediate glitching. In any case, this is one mystery that Loki season 2 will have to unravel.\n Whatever the cause of Loki's time-slipping, it may prove to be as much a boon as it is a hindrance. While Loki is clearly pained by the process, his random travels through time set the story of Loki season 2 into motion, with the God of Mischief describing how he saw much during his travels across time and that \"if what I saw is true, there is nothing that stands between this world and utter destruction.\" This could make Loki into an oracle of sorts, being able to guide the present into a different path that ensures a better future.\nThis presumes, of course, that the information Loki is seeing during his time-slips is accurate and that he and his allies will be able to plot the correct course based on what Loki sees. That might prove challenging enough, even without the suggestion that Loki's time-slipping is the result of Kang attacking him directly or a side effect of Loki confronting the Kang variant known as He Who Remains and re-creating the multiverse. In any case, it is ironic that Loki, a being often associated with chaos and confusion, should suddenly be a source of illumination who can help restore order.\nLoki season 2 releases every Thursday on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Why Always Sunny's Original Dee Actress Was Replaced After The Pilot", "date": "2023-10-06 12:00:26", "text": "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is known for its charismatic main cast, but that was almost very different, as the original Dee was replaced.\nSweet Dee is one of the key characters in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, but the original pilot for the series leads to a bigger story behind the Kaitlin Olson Jordan Reid Always Sunny casting. Olson played Dee Reynolds throughout every season of the TV show, with her being one of the funniest members of the show's gang of five. However, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia was almost very different, with Kaitlin Olson not joining the show until after the series was greenlit.\nIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphia follows Charlie, Mac, Dee, Dennis, and Frank, the five owners of a run-down bar in Philadelphia named Paddy's Pub. The gang gets into all kinds of wacky situations, with their horrendous personalities getting them into trouble in nearly every episode. Despite the show's popularity, the origins of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia show that the series was almost entirely different, with it originally focusing on a group of actors in Hollywood. However, the story isn't the only detail that was switched in the show, as the pilot featured an entirely different Dee.\nRELATED: It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia Season 17 Renewal, Release Date Prediction & Everything We Know\nThe Kaitlin Olson Jordan Reid Always Sunny history goes back to the original pilot for the series. It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's pilot didn't actually feature Olson in the role of Dee. Although Charlie Day, Glenn Howerton, and Rob McElhenney are in the original episode, Dee was actually played by an actress named Jordan Reid. Jordan Reid was the girlfriend of Mac actor Rob McElhenney in the early years of the show's development, leading to her and the group of friends all starring in the original It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia pilot.\nWith It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia wrapping up season 16, it's hard to imagine anyone but Kaitlin Olson in the role of Dee. However, Jordan Reid may have appeared in the final show if it wasn't for some behind-the-scenes drama. By the time the series was greenlit, Jordan Reid and Rob McElhenney had broken up, causing Reid to leave the series. While Jordan Reid has made some small appearances in shows like Law & Order, she isn't nearly as present on screen as the cast of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\nDespite Reid being the show's original Dee, Kaitlin Olson is so much better for It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. In the pilot, Jordan Reid's performance is a lot more subdued than Olson's take on the character, with her manic and deranged line readings making the character who she is today. Even though Dee Reynolds is often sidelined, Kaitlin Olson manages to bring so much personality to the character, making her integral to the show's success.\nOn top of that, keeping Jordan Reid around after the breakup would have probably hurt the show. The behind-the-scenes emotions may have hindered the show's comedy, possibly making it not work nearly as well as it does now. While Jordan Reid probably could have pulled off a great Dee, the decision to bring in Kaitlin Olson was the right choice for It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\nRELATED: The 50 Best TV Shows Of All Time, Ranked\nWhile the casting turned out well for the show, the Kaitlin Olson Jordan Reid Always Sunny casting has some unpleasant history as well. Reid addressed her role in the pilot and her removal from the show in the past and suggested she was forced out due to her relationship with Rob McElhenney coming to an end. Following the end of their relationship, Reid claims (via Ramshackle Glam) that McElhenney \"he told me in no uncertain terms that if I did not stay in the relationship, I would be off the show.\"\nReid did eventually break up with McElhenney after the pilot was shot with FX. Shortly after, Reid's manager \"let me know that while Rob, Glenn, and Charlie had been picked up for the series, I hadn’t been.\" Though the It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia cast hasn't commented on the casting but Reid later says she doesn't hold a grudge against them and reveals she and McElhenney are friends again (via The New York Times). Reid also admits Olson is funnier and perfect for the role, showing that she looks back on her role in the history of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia with a gracious attitude given the circumstances.\nColin McCormick is a Senior Writer with Screen Rant and has been a proud member of the team since 2019.

{"title": "Creed 4 Should Pay Tribute To Rocky V's Biggest Plot Hole", "date": "2023-10-06 12:11:24", "text": "Creed III's story setup for Amara's future in Creed IV might require a sly tribute to Rocky V's most notorious plot hole to make it work.\nIn order to pay off Creed III’s story setup for Amara’s future, Creed IV might have to make a winking tribute to the most infamous plot hole from Rocky V. In its first three installments, the Creed series has focused on Adonis “Donnie” Creed’s attempts to live up to the legacy of his late father, the world champion Apollo Creed. But Creed III has set up Donnie’s own successor: his daughter Amara. If Creed IV wants to follow up on this story setup, it’ll need to make some alterations to the franchise’s already complicated timeline.\nOne of the most poignant scenes in Creed III saw Amara visiting her dad at his boxing gym. She wanted a go on the punching bag to emulate her dad, so Donnie gave her some pointers on how to improve her stance and get the most power out of each punch. This touching scene seemed to pretty clearly telegraph a future for the franchise in which Amara will follow in Donnie’s footsteps and pursue a career as a boxer. But if Creed IV is going to continue that storyline, it’ll need to mangle the timeline much like Rocky V did.\nRELATED: Creed 4 Will Be Michael B. Jordan's Most Difficult Movie Yet\nOne of the most notorious plot holes in the Rocky franchise arrives at the beginning of Rocky V. Immediately after his fight in Russia at the end of Rocky IV, Rocky comes home and Rocky, Jr. is somehow much older than he was in Rocky IV. One of Creed IV’s best storytelling options is to continue the idea that Amara is going to become a boxer like her dad. But she’ll need to be at least in her mid-teens, if not late teens. If the sequel goes that route, they should also hint that the events are taking place immediately after those of Creed III.\nWith a baffling seven-year time jump, Dame’s complicated prison sentence, and a misplaced rematch with Ricky Conlan, Creed III has already messed up the series’ timeline. As it stands, even if Creed III takes place seven years after Creed II, Amara goes from being born to being nine years old between those movies. The only way to fix the timeline is to not fix it, but rather remind audiences that the Rocky franchise’s timeline has never made any sense with a timely throwback to Rocky V’s Rocky, Jr. storyline.\nThe Creed comic book is already set 10 years after Creed III as it follows an older Amara as an amateur boxer. That sets the story in 2035. Creed will become a sci-fi series if it keeps going further into the future. Creed IV should just maintain the current timeline. It’s much easier for a production to keep a present-day setting than to imagine what the world might look like 12 years from now. Normally, the movie would just not mention what year it is, but if one minor bit of dialogue can imply that it’s still around our present, that will be enough of a nod to Rocky V.\n"}
{"title": "Star Trek’s First Holodeck Episode Is Great, But Created Its Biggest Cliche", "date": "2023-10-06 12:11:24", "text": "This Star Trek: The Next Generation season 1 episode is incredibly fun, but it introduces an issue that would plague many future holodeck episodes.\nThe first Star Trek episode to prominently feature the holodeck comes in Star Trek: The Next Generation season 1, and while the episode itself is great, it introduces an element that becomes a cliché in future holodeck episodes. In TNG season 1, episode 12, \"The Big Goodbye,\" Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) takes a break from his duties as captain of the USS Enterprise-D to try out the ship's newly upgraded holodeck. Picard takes on the persona of fictional hard-boiled detective Dixon Hill and invites a few of his crew members along for the ride.\nCaptain Picard, Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), and ship's historian Whalen (David Selburg) don their period-accurate mobster gear and step into San Francisco of the 1940s. They marvel at how real the holographic environment around them looks, from the cars on the street to the people who populate the program. Everyone gets caught up in the story of Dixon Hill and everything seems to be going well until Whalen is shot with a very real bullet. Dr. Crusher states that his injury could prove fatal if he is not taken to sickbay soon, but the holodeck refuses to respond to any commands, leaving the crew members trapped inside.\nRelated: Star Trek: The Next Generation Cast & Character Guide\n\"The Big Goodbye\" is an incredibly fun episode with great performances from the main cast, but some of the mechanics of the holodeck do not make sense. The holodeck malfunctions after an alien probe scans the Enterprise, which somehow turns off the safety features, traps Picard and the others inside, and cuts off communications to and from the holodeck. For one thing, it's unclear why the holodeck would have safety features that can be turned off or why it would be able to craft real bullets. Logically, the holodeck should shut off when any malfunctions occur, reverting back to a regular room.\nAs Ensign Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) works with Lt. Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) to repair the holodeck, he says that shutting the holodeck down could cause the crew members inside to \"vanish.\" This makes even less sense and raises a whole host of questions about the nature of the holodeck. In future Star Trek holodeck episodes, the safety protocols would continue to malfunction, although the danger of the people inside dematerializing is never mentioned again. Still, if one ignores the illogical inconsistencies of the holodeck technology, \"The Big Goodbye\" is an immensely entertaining episode that allows the characters (and the actors) to have a little fun.\nDespite its frequent malfunctions, the holodeck is an incredible piece of technology the likes of which people of the 21st century can only dream about. It's clear why it would be such a popular feature on starships and starbases, as it allows people to visit their favorite fictional worlds or eras of history. While Star Trek: The Original Series had genre episodes such as the very fun \"A Piece of the Action,\" they had to create an often thin explanation for why an alien planet resembled Earth of the past. The holodeck removes any limitations, opening up the doors for the creative teams behind Star Trek to do all kinds of fun genre episodes.\n\"The Big Goodbye\" recreates the hard-boiled detective genre, but later holodeck episodes would dive into Westerns, spy thrillers, and old-school sci-fi serials, among others. Episodes on the holodeck give the actors a chance to wear something other than their Starfleet uniforms and play alternate versions of their characters. The best holodeck episodes offer insight into the characters and help them work through their problems. While the first-ever holodeck episode in Star Trek: The Next Generation may have introduced some cliches, it also led to a long line of fun and entertaining Star Trek episodes.\n"}

If the Loki season 1 ending cliffhanger is anything to go by, season 2 will bring another helping of time travel drama to the MCU.\nSo far, Loki is the only one of Marvel Studios' live-action Disney+ series' to be gifted a second outing, though the animated What If...? and Spider-Man: Freshman Year have also been confirmed for second seasons too. Loki's time travel and timeline-jumping allows for endless possibilities for season 2, particularly after the titular God of Mischief appeared to find himself in a new timeline at the end of Loki season 1 - one where the TVA is ruled over by Kang the Conqueror instead of He Who Remains. With season 1 unleashing the multiverse, Loki season 2 will likely soon change the franchise drastically once again.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Cast Guide: Every New & Returning Marvel Character\nLoki season 2 released October 5, 2023, showing Tom Hiddleston back in action as Loki. Prior to this, the biggest step towards Loki season 2 came with the release of the first trailer, and the post-credits scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, as the MCU's first Phase 5 film featured the return of Loki and Owen Wilson's Mobius M. Mobius, who met Majors' Victor Timely in the early 20th Century. This confirmed that Loki season 2 would feature more time travel antics, showing the TVA duo investigating Kang the Conqueror and his variants throughout history.\nWhereas audiences wait patiently for some projects to be announced and confirmed by Marvel Studios, Loki season 2 was confirmed to be in development in the final moments of season 1. The finale, \"For All Time. Always,\" ended with the stinger revealing that \"Loki will return in season 2.\" This sticks to Marvel Studios' desire to expand on secondary characters' stories while interconnecting them to the theatrical releases - though it seems Loki isn't there yet, as his story still has some way to go on the small screen.\nLoki suffered delays along with many of Marvel Studios' Disney+ series - but luckily, Loki season 2 hasn't been delayed as drastically as some of its fellow TV shows. Originally planned for a summer-2023 release date, Loki season 2 instead released on October 5, 2023 - having been moved forward a day from its prior October 6 date - and is also set to release an episode every week. Similarly to Loki season 1, season 2 consists of six episodes, releasing every Thursday until the finale airs on November 9. Loki season 2 will be the second of the MCU's Disney+ shows releasing in 2023, following June's Secret Invasion, but preceding Echo, which will be released towards the end of November.\nMuch of the Loki season 1 cast is set to return for the second season alongside Tom Hiddleston in the starring role of Loki, the Asgardian God of Mischief. Returning for Loki season 2 are Owen Wilson as Mobius M. Mobius, Sophia Di Martino as Sylvie, Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Ravonna Renslayer, Wunmi Mosaku as Hunter B-15, Eugene Cordero as Casey, a.k.a. Hunter K-5E, and Tara Strong as Miss Minutes. Fresh off a monumental win at 2023's Academy Awards ceremony, Ke Huy Quan joins the cast of Loki season 2 as Ouroboros, the TVA's chief engineer.\nKe Huy Quan is joined by several other new additions, as Kate Dickie and Liz Carr also join the cast in Loki season 2, episode 1, in the roles of General Dox and Judge Gamble respectively - two high-ranking TVA officials, who appear set to provide further obstacles for the protagonists of the show. Rafael Casal also appears as Hunter X-5, who is a lower-ranking TVA operative who will also provide Loki and company trouble based on his concerns about their dealings. Charlie Cameron and Jack Cunningham-Nuttall round out the roster of newly introduced season 2 figures, with Cameron appearing as a mail cart driver, and Cunningham-Nuttall playing the bewildered McDonald's cashier who Sylvie speaks to at the end of the episode.\nKang actor Jonathan Majors is also set to reprise his role as the many variants of the Multiverse Saga's major villain. In Loki season 1, Majors portrayed He Who Remains, the guardian of the Sacred Timeline, before he played Kang the Conqueror himself in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Peyton Reed's third Ant-Man film also saw Majors portray many more variants of Kang the Conqueror, forming the Council of Kangs, and debut as Victor Timely in a tease for Loki season 2, so it's unclear just how many variants of Kang will be appearing in the upcoming Disney+ series.\nBy killing He Who Remains, Sylvie unleashed the multiverse, allowing an innumerable amount of branching timelines to form, meaning Loki season 2 could span many different time periods and alternate realities. Loki season 2, episode 1 supports this idea, with Tom Hiddleston's anti-hero seemingly being flung through time as a result of the multiversal changes to the MCU.\nThe Loki season 2 synopsis states that \"'Loki' Season 2 picks up in the aftermath of the shocking season finale when Loki finds himself in a battle for the soul of the Time Variance Authority. Along with Mobius, Hunter B-15 and a team of new and returning characters, Loki navigates an ever-expanding and increasingly dangerous multiverse in search of Sylvie, Judge Renslayer, Miss Minutes and the truth of what it means to possess free will and glorious purpose.\" As such, it seems that the sequel season will further explore what Sylvie killing He Who Remains did precisely to the larger landscape of the MCU, combining the Loki season 1 cast's personal stories with the overarching narrative surrounding Kang and his variants - especially with one such variants confirmed to appear in the form of Victor Timely.\nThere have been rumors that the TVA could be involved in Deadpool 3 in the MCU's Phase 6. As such, it's possible that Loki season 2 could begin to lay the foundations for Ryan Reynolds to make a smooth entrance into the MCU.\nAudiences were gifted their first look at Loki season 2 as part of 2023's Disney+ trailer, promoting Disney's own streaming service. However, this trailer only gave viewers a brief glimpse at what might unfold in the upcoming series, not revealing much past Tom Hiddleston and Owen Wilson's returns as Loki and Mobius. At 2022's D23 Expo, audiences were gifted a look at the first full trailer for Loki season 2, which was released later on for the general public.\nHe Who Remains was revealed as the man behind the TVA in Loki season 1, and as a variant of Kang the Conqueror. In Marvel Comics, Kang is a time-traveling villain and a thorn in the side of Earth's Mightiest Heroes, often putting the fate of the world at risk. The MCU's Kang the Conqueror and his variants have been shown off in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, and since the title of the MCU's next major crossover event is Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, it's expected that Kang is the Multiverse Saga's new Thanos - which all started in Loki season 1, so season 2 will surely develop this further, potentially setting up even more variants for the future.\nLoki season 2 releases every Thursday on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Spider-Man's Complete MCU Timeline Explained", "date": "2023-10-06 12:20:25", "text": "Tom Holland joined the MCU as Spider-Man in 2016's Captain America: Civil War, and has since become one of the MCU's most important superheroes.\nSince his introduction to the MCU in 2016's Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man has become one of Marvel Studios' most important superheroes, and audiences have seen him grow throughout his teenage years. After Marvel Studios and Sony negotiated a deal in 2015, Tom Holland was cast as the MCU's official version of Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man, taking over the role from Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, who'd portrayed the wall-crawler in Sony's prior franchises. Holland made his first appearance as Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil War, but has since been involved in Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, has completed his first solo MCU trilogy, and Spider-Man 4 is in development.\nAs one of the MCU's youngest heroes, Peter Parker was introduced in Civil War as a 15-year-old student who had only recently been gifted his superhuman abilities after being bitten by a spider. Marvel Studios chose not to retell Spider-Man's origin story in the MCU, as it had previously been adapted twice at Sony, so Parker was instead thrown straight into the action. Over the last seven years, audiences have watched Peter Parker grow from a teenager into a young adult, with Spider-Man: No Way Home setting him up to embark on a new adventure in the MCU's future. Here's a breakdown of Spider-Man's entire timeline in the MCU.\nRelated: 10 Spider-Man Movie Moments That Divided Fans Most\nNot much is known about Peter Parker's childhood in the MCU, other than the fact that he was born on August 10, 2001, and at some point in his youth, his parents became absent. This left him in the care of his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, which follows Parker's backstory laid out in Marvel Comics and in Sony's previous Marvel films. Some theories have suggested that Spider-Man's parents may still be alive in the MCU, which could be revisited in the future, though there has currently been no mention of them in the MCU.\n2010's Iron Man 2 released years before Spider-Man joined the MCU, but after Peter Parker's debut, theories began to arise suggesting the child seen taking on a HAMMER Drone wearing an Iron Man mask could have been a young Peter Parker. While this was purely speculation, Tom Holland himself confirmed this theory while speaking to The Huffington Post, showing that Parker had been a fan of Iron Man long before the armored Avenger recruited him. This connection would later see Tony Stark become a mentor to Peter Parker, and demonstrates the brilliance of the MCU's interconnectivity.\nIn a change from the widely-accepted backstory for Spider-Man, Uncle Ben died prior to Peter Parker being bitten by a spider in the MCU. While Marvel Studios has never shown Uncle Ben on screen, he was mentioned during 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming, with his death being noted as being one of the main reasons Parker chose to keep his identity as Spider-Man a secret from everyone, including Aunt May. Uncle Ben's death left a lasting legacy on Parker's actions as Spider-Man, and made his connection with Aunt May even stronger, as the pair only had each other from then on.\nAt the age of 14, Peter Parker was bitten by a spider and gained spider-like abilities overnight. These meant he was able to stick to walls and ceilings, adjusted his eyesight, and gave him enhanced strength, reflexes, agility, and senses. As a young genius, Peter Parker used his scientific mind to create synthetic webbing that he could shoot from utensils on his wrists, allowing him to operate as the vigilante Spider-Man. His actions as a \"friendly neighborhood Spider-Man\" caught the attention of many fans in Queens, and saw him quickly become an internet sensation, with videos showing him catching speeding cars and saving bystanders.\nAfter learning of Spider-Man operating in Queens, Tony Stark tracked him down and recruited him to join his team in Captain America: Civil War, marking Peter Parker's MCU debut. Parker traveled to Berlin with Stark and Happy Hogan, was gifted a new, streamlined suit, and fought alongside Team Iron Man against Team Cap, who had drifted apart over disputes caused by the Sokovia Accords and the framing of Bucky Barnes. During this battle, Spider-Man fought Captain America, Bucky Barnes, the Falcon, and Ant-Man, proving his worth as a new hero in the MCU, but was dropped back home after the events of the film.\nBack in Queens, Spider-Man longed to officially joined the Avengers, but in the meantime, dealt with smaller threats, such as retrieving a stolen bicycle, stopping a carjacker, and thwarting a bank robbery. In investigating strange technology in the neighborhood, Spider-Man learned of Adrian Toomes' Vulture, witnessing his robbery of tech acquired by Damage Control. Parker scaled the Washington Monument to save his friends, and intercepted the Vulture's crew on the Staten Island Ferry, but almost caused catastrophe. Spider-Man later battled the Vulture at Coney Island, incapacitating the villain and earning Stark's trust, though he would refuse Stark's offer to become a member of the MCU's Avengers.\nDuring a field trip to the MOMA, Parker's Spider-Sense alerted him to alien activity in New York during Avengers: Infinity War. He arrived to help Iron Man and Doctor Strange handle Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian, but found himself inadvertently traveling into space after stowing away on Maw's ship. Luckily, Parker was on hand to help save Doctor Strange, and his bravery in these moments prompted Tony Stark to finally christen Spider-Man as a member of the Avengers. Parker helped Stark land Maw's ship on Titan, and prepared to battle the Mad Titan Thanos once the Guardians of the Galaxy arrived.\nAfter meeting the Guardians of the Galaxy, the team, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man devised a plan to retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos once he arrived on Titan in search of the Time Stone. Spider-Man put up a strong fight against the Mad Titan with the help of Strange's portals, but was ultimately no match for Thanos, who proclaimed him to be an \"insect.\" Parker saved the Guardians of the Galaxy after Thanos hurled Titan's moon at the planet, but soon found himself trapped on Titan with the other heroes after Thanos acquired the Time Stone and departed for Earth.\nUnaware of Thanos' actions in Wakanda in the final moments of Avengers: Infinity War, the surviving heroes on Titan waited and watched as most of them turned to dust following Thanos' snap. All the Guardians of the Galaxy, except for Nebula, disappeared, followed by Doctor Strange, which left Spider-Man as the last hero to suffer the same fate. In an emotional moment, Parker apologized to Stark before turning to dust, leaving the armored Avenger distraught and unsure of what to do next, though he would return to Earth and battle in Peter Parker's name during Avengers: Endgame.\nFive years after being snapped away by Thanos in Infinity War, the Hulk's snap in Avengers: Endgame brought back all the dusted heroes, including Spider-Man. Peter Parker joined the Avengers for the Battle of Earth, returning to his homeworld through one of Doctor Strange's portals. Parker was key to protecting the Avengers' Infinity Gauntlet in Endgame's final battle, though would eventually hand the artifact over to Captain Marvel. After Iron Man gathered the Infinity Stones and eradicated Thanos and his army, Peter Parker had a moment to say a final farewell to his friend and mentor, and turned up to Stark's funeral with Aunt May before returning home.\nEight months after the Battle of Earth, Peter Parker was still suffering the loss of Tony Stark, but embarked on a school trip to Europe nonetheless. However, the appearance of Nick Fury and a multiversal hero, Mysterio, dragged him back into action. Mysterio soon revealed himself to be a fraud, intent on destroying London in an effort to fool the world into thinking he's the strongest hero ever, with the help of Stark's drones casting illusions. Peter Parker would use his Spider-Sense to detect Mysterio's illusions, eventually taking him on one-to-one and defeating the villain, earning the respect of Nick Fury (who had actually been the Skrull Talos in disguise).\nDuring Spider-Man: Far From Home's excursion to Europe, Peter Parker and MJ finally began their romantic relationship, shortly after the latter worked out that Parker was Spider-Man. After returning to New York, Parker and MJ embarked on their first date, swinging through the streets of the city much to MJ's dismay, yet this would end with Spider-Man's identity being revealed to the world by J. Jonah Jameson. In Spider-Man: No Way Home, Parker mentioned that his favorite time had been the one week he'd spent with MJ before the world found out who he is, but the pair would stay together even through this difficult time.\nAfter Parker, MJ, and Ned Leeds were refused enrollment into MIT because of their connections to Spider-Man, Parker sought the help of Doctor Strange to make the world forget his true identity. However, Parker tampered with Strange's spell in an effort to have Ned, MJ, Aunt May, and Happy remember him, which caused a destabilization of the multiverse, dragging individuals who knew Peter Parker from other realities into the MCU proper. Spider-Man: No Way Home saw Parker attempt to cure the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Lizard, and Electro from Sony's previous Spider-Man films, yet he'd come to odds with Strange, who wanted to send them home to their deaths.\nSpider-Man: No Way Home saw Peter Parker trap Doctor Strange in the Mirror Dimension and continue his scheme to cure the multiversal villains of their various inflictions. However, the Green Goblin living inside Norman Osborn didn't want to be cured, and convinced Lizard, Electro, and Sandman that they didn't need to be either, leading to an epic battle at Happy Hogan's condominium that tragically ended in the death of Aunt May. Whereas Uncle Ben usually delivered the \"with great power\" speech, May got this chance in No Way Home, urging Parker to do the right thing, but leaving him angry and heartbroken nevertheless.\nAfter Aunt May's death, Tom Holland's Peter Parker was met by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's versions of Spider-Man, also dragged into the MCU proper by Doctor Strange's spell. Together, the trio created cures for each of the multiversal villains, and during a battle at the Statue of Liberty, managed to inject each villain with their cure, including, reluctantly, Norman Osborn. Interacting with his variants allowed Holland's Spider-Man a few moments of brotherhood and connection with people who knew exactly what he was going through, giving him the opportunity to learn from their shared experiences.\nDespite curing all the multiversal villains, their existence in the MCU threatened the stability of the multiverse, but Peter Parker realized the only way to protect everyone was for Doctor Strange to complete his original spell. Doing this, everyone forgot Peter Parker, yet retained memories of Spider-Man. This returned the other Spider-Men and their villains to their home realities, but left the MCU's Spider-Man completely alone, as not even MJ, Ned, or Happy remembered him. With his place at MIT jeopardized, Parker began a GED program from his new apartment in New York, and sewed himself a new suit to operate as a more mature Spider-Man in the MCU's future.\n"}
{"title": "Carol's Walking Dead Spinoff Exit Actually Saved Daryl's TV Show", "date": "2023-10-06 12:20:25", "text": "Carol's exit from the original Daryl Dixon spinoff plan has actually helped save the show despite Melissa McBride and Norman Reedus' great chemistry.\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 4\nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon was initially supposed to feature Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) alongside Daryl (Norman Reedus), but her exit actually helped save the show. Daryl and Carol were two of the most popular characters on the main show and were mainstays for the entire 11 seasons. Both developed massively as characters and were crucial for The Walking Dead's final arc. The premise of a spinoff between the two does sound promising, although perhaps not essential. Despite being fan favorites and having great chemistry, Daryl Dixon has benefited from Carol not being included in the spinoff and leaving Daryl solo.\nWhile the spinoff is better off without Carol, it has nothing do to with the quality of her character or Melissa McBride's performance. In fact, a solo Carol spinoff would likely have worked just as well, but the two together is simply not necessary. Many aspects of their relationship have already been explored. They have helped each other overcome emotional difficulties in their life and have grown closer as a result. They have also had their moments of confrontation but come the finale, their friendship was stronger than ever. Having already explored most of their relationship dynamic, a show featuring both Daryl and Carol would be less likely to succeed.\nFrom everything Daryl Dixon has offered so far, it is difficult to see how it would have worked with Carol involved. With the plot focusing on the importance of Daryl's arrival in relation to the main supporting characters, Carol also being part of this would make both her and Daryl feel less special. The relationship dynamic Daryl has with Isabelle (Clémence Poésy) and Laurent (Louis Puech Scigliuzzi) has helped give Daryl Dixon the highest Rotten Tomatoes score of all The Walking Dead projects. Adding Carol to the mix may have created different dynamics and conflict, but ultimately, they would have hurt the show.\nDaryl's relationship with the rest of the group is complicated enough without adding Carol to have potentially contrasting opinions. A spinoff with both characters may have had an entirely different plot, but that only further emphasizes the idea that the spinoff is better without her given how well Daryl's spinoff has performed. The unique feeling of Daryl alone in France couldn't be replicated with an ally alongside him; his journey into the unknown gives off a completely fresh feeling that could only be achieved on his own. Carol is a great character who should continue being involved in The Walking Dead universe, but she would be better off having her own spinoff, rather than sharing the spotlight.\nAlthough Dead City had a solid first season, it further highlighted that Walking Dead spinoffs are suited to one character. Daryl Dixon has been better than Dead City throughout its run, mainly because it has focused solely on Daryl. The cast and characters have been much more memorable in Daryl's spinoff since they serve a more important purpose to the show. Whereas Negan (Jeffery Dean Morgan) and Maggie's (Lauren Cohan) show revolves around only their journey, the supporting characters in Daryl Dixon are crucial in driving the plot and matter far more to the story.\nBy focusing only on the protagonist, Daryl Dixon gives new cast members the chance to really shine as Isabelle alone is far more interesting than any new character introduced in Dead City. By prioritizing Maggie and Negan, it makes everyone else unimportant as their story is the only one to get invested in. With Daryl Dixon, there are plenty of new communities that quickly become prominent as they are all involved in helping Daryl complete his journey. By no means is Dead City a poor show, but by having such a fixed narrative, its potential becomes far smaller than a show with an individual protagonist.\nEven though the show's narrative has worked better without her, Carol could still appear in Daryl Dixon. One of the episode previews showed Daryl contacting someone, the most likely candidate being Carol. This gives her an easy way to enter the picture, be it by joining Daryl in France or being there to meet him when he finally makes it back to America. Melissa McBride has already been spotted filming for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 2. Ensuring the focus still stays on Daryl's story in France is important, but if done right, Carol could be a strong supporting character rather than a dual protagonist.\n"}
{"title": "The Highest-Grossing Pixar Movies Of All Time", "date": "2023-10-06 12:20:26", "text": "The highest-grossing Pixar movies include Toy Story and Inside Out, but which movie from the studio comes out on top?\nThe highest grossing Pixar movies of all time might not quite reach the level of Disney Animation movies, but with the critical acclaim added on, they might be even more impressive. Pixar Animation Studios got started in 1979 as part of LucasFilm before breaking away and becoming its own animation studio under Steve Jobs and Apple. After making a short film called Luxo Jr. in 1986, the studio worked hard to create the first-ever CGI animated movie in 1995 called Toy Story. That was just the start, as Pixar quickly became one of the top critically acclaimed animated movie studios in cinema history.\nUsing data from Box Office Mojo, the highest grossing Pixar movies worldwide have an impressive list of films, titles that can compete with anything from Disney, DreamWorks, Sony, or any other animation studio pumping out feature films. These include stories about sentient toys, a world where cars exist, but people are nowhere to be found a world where monsters deliver screams and laughs to remain alive, and even a world where the emotions in a child's mind like the upcoming Inside Out 2, are living beings that help determine people's actions and reactions.\nRELATED: The 50 Best Movies Of All Time\nA Bugs Life was the second-ever Pixar movie following Toy Story, and while it made more than the first Pixar movie, few people talk about it anymore. One problem with its release was that DreamWorks also had a movie about bugs hitting that year in Antz. While A Bug's Life made almost $200 million more than Antz, it was still not a huge take at the box office and ranks near the bottom of the highest grossing Pixar movies of all time. The movie still carried on the Pixar method of delivering a smart story with brilliant animation, this one based on the Aesop fable The Ant and the Grasshopper.\nBy the time Pixar released Cars 3, it had delivered a couple of disappointing releases with the misunderstood Brave and poorly received The Good Dinosaur. Add to the fact that people had soured on Cars after the first two movies, and it kept people away from theaters for this third movie. That is disappointing because Cars 3 was the best of the three and delivered the type of story Pixar specializes in. Much like Woody in the Toy Story franchise, Lightning McQueen needed to figure out where his place in the world was when he saw the end closing in. This third movie held back the zany humor and had a lot of heart, which might lead to Cars 4.\nThe first Cars movie wasn't received overly favorably by critics, but it still made good money for Pixar. The movie was a love letter to the iconic Route 66 and how interstates helped kill the small towns along the roads that Route 66 connected. While it didn't get good reviews, there were fans who connected with the story, and they helped the movie rise up the charts of the highest grossing Pixar movies of all time, and while it made less than its first sequel, it still finished with a respectable $461 million at the worldwide box office.\nThe first Toy Story movie remains an iconic classic, but that was Pixar's first movie, and it wasn't going to be a huge box office success thanks to that. However, Pixar had a chance to recoup on their newfound popularity with the sequel, Toy Story 2. One thing that has set Pixar apart from many other studios is that the sequels are often even better than the originals, especially in the Toy Story franchise where the second movie eclipsed the first and the third was better than the second. The movies in that specific series also made more money with each installment, with the second making more than the first, but not as much as the third and fourth.\nIn what might be the biggest surprise in Pixar movie history, Elemental moved up the list of the highest grossing Pixar movies of all time despite everyone calling it a bomb. The reason people dismissed Elemental was because it had a bad opening weekend. However, no one foresaw the movie having the legs it did. While some thought it was going to fail like Lightyear, the difference is that Elemental was an original idea and those need positive word of mouth, even if it is a Pixar movie. It picked up that word of mouth and almost ended up at $500 million and proved to be a hit.\nWall-E, which earned $521 million worldwide, is a movie that proved Pixar are masters at what they do. The movie features almost no dialogue, which seems ludicrous for a kid's movie. However, it worked beautifully. WALL-E is a robot left on Earth to clean up the mess after humans had to abandon the planet due to pollution, causing toxic poison in the air. He soon sees and falls for another robot called EVE, and the two of them try to send the message that Earth is ready to give humans a second chance.\nA Pixar film that deserves more attention, Brave is the studio's take on a Disney Princess movie, and it shows how Pixar was able to turn the tropes of a Disney Princess movie on their heads, grossing $538 million worldwide in the process. The princess in this movie, Merida, does not need a man to help save her, and she confronted both the curse that she unknowingly placed on her family and the expectations that come with her societal role, with determination and courage. The combination of it being a familiar genre and Pixar's history at this point helped it be a hit.\nThough Cars 2 is one of Pixar's less successful works critically, it grossed $191 million domestically and $559 million worldwide. The story of Cars 2 flips the script of the original movie and turns the fish out of water story into a spy caper, as Lightning McQueen sets out to stop crime overseas. Cars 2's critical reception did not signal the end of the Pixar franchise. Far from it, in fact, as it was followed by a sequel, and help spawned the spin-off movie series Planes.\nMonsters, Inc. tells the original story of Mike and Sulley, as they work to power the city of Monstropolis by collecting the screams of human children. Unfortunately, when one kid, Boo, escapes into the monster world, Mike and Sulley have to put her back without their co-workers or boss noticing. Monsters, Inc. scared its way to a $290 million domestic gross in 2001. Worldwide, it took in $578 million. It was followed not only by a feature-length prequel but also a Disney+ release which acts as a sequel, titled Monsters at Work.\nRELATED: Pixar Proves Animated Movies Don’t Need A-List Actors To Be Successful\nRatatouille is a film that took Pixar overseas, as the story's setting is Paris, in the world of fine dining cuisine. Its story follows Remy, a rat who wishes more than anything to be a chef, and Linguini, the human who becomes his friend. Together, they save a restaurant and impress an otherwise harsh food critic. Showing that a great artist can come from anywhere, Ratatouille's heartwarming story not only made $623 million at the worldwide box office but is one of several Pixar films to win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature.\nThe Incredibles follows a family of super-powered individuals who find themselves in a world that no longer accepts superheroes. However, when the family's dad, Mr. Incredible, gets a secret offer that will let him get back into hero work, he jumps at the offer, leaving the rest of his family behind to figure out what's going on and what to do about it. The first Incredibles movie was not only a critical and box office success, grossing $631 million worldwide, but it also introduced audiences to one of Pixar's funniest characters, the iconic Edna Mode, making it an even more memorable affair.\nAn emotional and lovely story, Up follows a retired man, Carl, who wishes to visit Paradise Falls in South America—a destination he and his wife had planned to visit before her passing. After being asked to move into a retirement home, he takes his dreams into his own hands and flies his house there using helium balloons. The adventure was a hit with fans, as it swept in $293 million at the domestic box office and $735 million worldwide. Full of lovable characters, talking dog Dug later received his own spin-off series of shorts on Disney+, titled Dug Days.\nMonsters University is the prequel to Monsters, Inc. which follows Mike and Sulley back in their college days. Though they first find themselves at odds, they soon come together as they compete to become the best of their university's scarers. Monsters University helps establish how Mike and Sulley come to be at their jobs in Monsters, Inc., and capitalized on the pair's chemistry to earn a humongous $743 million worldwide.\nCoco takes its inspiration from the Mexican celebration of the Day of the Dead and follows a boy, Miguel, who dreams of being a musician but is forbidden to become one by his family. A string of events lands Miguel in the Land of the Dead, where he meets his ancestors and uncovers secrets of his family history. Particularly celebrated for its gorgeous visuals and soundtrack, Coco made $210 million domestically but finished off its run with an impressive $807 million gross worldwide, one of the highest grossing Pixar movies of all time.\nInside Out tells the story of a hockey-loving girl, Riley, who grapples with the reality of moving. The movie is largely told from the perspective of the emotions in Riley's mind; Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. Together, they aim to help Riley settle into her new home, discovering the complexity of emotions along the way. The animated movie deals with serious issues in a way that's easy for viewers of all ages to understand, and its success led to the announcement of a sequel, Inside Out 2, scheduled for release in 2024. Inside Out made $356 million domestically and $858 million worldwide.\nClownfish are naturally shy, so Pixar decided to find out what happened when one of these creatures, Marlin, was forced to venture through the ocean to track down his son, Nemo, in Finding Nemo. The resulting film is heartwarming and breathtaking, leading to theme park rides and a sequel. Finding Nemo raked in a $380 million domestic gross, adding on an additional $559 at the foreign box office that led it to take $940 million worldwide, easily moving it into the running for one of the highest grossing Pixar movies of all time.\nFinding Dory explores the origins of Pixar's favorite blue tang fish, Dory. When the largely forgetful Dory begins to get flashbacks of the past, she ends up on a journey to track down her parents. The popular sequel to Finding Nemo earned $486 million at the domestic box office, contributing to a gigantic $1.02 billion worldwide. It received exceedingly positive reviews for further exploring this favorite character while staying true to the tone of its predecessor. It was the love for the first movie that helped this become one of the highest grossing Pixar movies of all time.\n Toy Story 3 explores Woody and the gang's attempt to return home after they are mistakenly donated to a daycare before Andy leaves for college. Things get tense when the Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear—a stuffed animal who was abandoned by his owner—drags the toys through an agenda of his own. The third installment in the Toy Story series was released eleven years after the second and played its way to $415 million at the domestic box office. This combined with the overseas takings led to a gross of over $1.06 billion worldwide, one of the highest grossing Pixar movies of all time.\nThe most recent entry in the iconic Toy Story franchise, Toy Story 4, outdid all entries in the series that came before it to earn $1.07 billion dollars worldwide. The toys' latest adventure explores what happens when Woody's new kid, Bonnie, makes her own toy using a spork and googly eyes.

{"title": "&quot;Should Probably Win Best Picture&quot;: Barbie Gets Rave Review From Fan-Favorite Horror Director", "date": "2023-10-06 12:22:09", "text": "Even horror movie directors are fans of Barbie, as a fan-favorite genre filmmaker explains why Greta Gerwig’s film should probably win Best Picture.\nDoctor Strange and The Black Phone director Scott Derrickson has added his voice to the long list of vocal supporters of Greta Garwig’s Barbie. Based on Mattel’s iconic line of fashion dolls, the movie smashed box office predictions to become the highest-grossing live-action comedy of all-time. Off the back of the movie’s monumental success, Warner Bros. is striving to have it nominated in several key awards categories for next year's Oscars, including Best Original Screenplay, Best Picture, and acting nominations for Barbie stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.\nWhile speaking with The Playlist’s The Discourse podcast, Derrickson discussed his favorite movies of the year and nominated Gerwig’s Barbie and the Argentinian possession horror film When Evil Lurks as his top two. He also went on to describe Gerwig’s film as an “extraordinary movie on every level” and deserving of a 2024 Best Picture win. Check out his comments below:\n“By the way, those movies [based on existing IP] can be amazing. I think ‘Barbie’ is the best film I’ve seen this year—well, maybe that’s not true; I saw this horror film, ‘When Evil Lurks’ at Fantastic Fest, but ‘Barbie’ and ‘When Evil Lurks’ those are my two favorite films of the year, which couldn’t be further away from each other.\n“’Barbie’ is a good example of populist I.P. that was treated with true brilliance. That’s an extraordinary movie on every level. I think it should probably win Best Picture; the writing is so clever and so smart and subversive, the acting is amazing, and it’s so entertaining, it’s artful in its visuals, the style of it, it’s just an awesome film.”\nWhile Barbie’s overwhelming box office success and widespread popular appeal make it a natural choice to be listed among the nominees of 2024’s Academy Award for Best Picture, for years many commentators have noted the category’s tendency to favor smaller, independent fare over big-budget blockbusters. While this year’s own list of nominations seemed to buck the trend somewhat, by including box office hits like Avatar: The Way Of Water and Top Gun: Maverick, the award would ultimately end up going to the much more modest Everything Everywhere All at Once.\nIn fact, it has now been over 20 years since a Best Picture winner has accumulated anything akin to Barbie’s impressive $1.43 billion worldwide gross, namely since 2003’s The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, whose own takings topped $1.14 billion. Though it is fundamentally true that box office popularity does not always equate with excellence in film making, Barbie reviews have praised Gerwig's approach for its exceedingly clever writing, impressive production values and exceptional performances.\nMoreover, Gerwig is no stranger to seeing her films contend for Best Picture and retains many of the independent filmmaking sensibilities that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences seem to value so highly. Yet at this stage, it is not even clear whether Barbie will be nominated, let alone win. With a growing list of filmmakers like Derrickson on her side, however, Gerwig's chances are steadily growing.\nSource: The Playlist\n"}
{"title": "The War Doctor's Name Is Meaningless In Doctor Who Now", "date": "2023-10-06 12:31:24", "text": "The War Doctor is never classed among the regenerations due to their actions during the Time War, but the War Doctor deserves to be recognized.\nDoctor Who has rendered the War Doctor’s name meaningless despite their redemption at the end of the Time War. The War Doctor was introduced in the 50th Anniversary special of Doctor Who, when the questions around the events of the Time War were finally answered in “The Day of the Doctor”. The War Doctor is technically the 9th Doctor, but his hidden story meant Christopher Eccleston’s regeneration in New-Who is classed as the 9th Doctor. Throughout “The Day of the Doctor”, David Tennant and Matt Smith’s 10th and 11th regenerations recalled their time as the War Doctor with great shame, hiding their past as much as possible.\nDue to the supposed genocide the War Doctor caused during the Time War, the War Doctor disavowed the name of the Doctor, deeming themselves unworthy to represent it. Rescinding the name of the Doctor meant Eccleston’s incarnation became the 9th Doctor and the War Doctor had no name, but was referred to as the War Doctor, Doctor of War, the Warrior, and the Renegade. The Doctor may be ashamed of this version of themselves, but this is not the only reason the War Doctor has no title, and it may not be entirely fair the War Doctor is rejected in this way.\nRelated: Doctor Who Season 14: Release Date Prediction, New Cast & Everything We Know\nThe Doctor may be ashamed of the Ward Doctor’s intentions during the Time War, but this may not be deserved. “The Day of the Doctor” revealed the actual events of the Time War and proved the War Doctor did not actually commit double genocide. Being able to find a peaceful solution to the Time War with 10 and 11 did mean the War Doctor was comfortable taking their name again, but due to the timelines being out of sync this never comes to fruition. The War Doctor reclaiming the Doctor’s name also had no effect on the regenerations, and the War Doctor is still not classed as the 9th Doctor.\nNot only did the War Doctor not do what they are accused of, but other regenerations have followed through with morally worse actions. The Doctor aims to be the hero, but even regenerations after the War Doctor commit actions much worse than that version. The 13th Doctor committed a horrific triple genocide in Flux by extinguishing the Daleks, Cybermen, and Sontarans in one. Not only that, but the 13th Doctor showed no remorse for their actions, whereas the War Doctor massively struggled with the weight of their would-be actions. Flux alone questions how Thirteen is more deserving of the Doctor name than the War Doctor.\nHowever, the War Doctor still not embracing the Doctor’s name is more complicated. The skewered timelines meant the 9th Doctor believed they caused the ending of the Time War and committed genocide against their own race, something that weighed heavily on them. The War Doctor is no worse than other Doctors, and arguably better than some, as someone still needed to be responsible for the ending of the Time War. The War Doctor did not do what they were accused of, but they are an easy scapegoat when the Time Lords and the Doctor themselves needed someone to blame.\nThe War Doctor taking the fall and dropping the title of the Doctor represents that sacrifice. His separate identity also encouraged the Doctor’s own growth to make them become almost a different person, even a new Doctor. The War Doctor’s actions plays on future incarnations' minds, because when it came down to it, the Doctor knows they were willing to commit an act as detestable as genocide in Doctor Who, making him symbolic of an era the Doctor would rather forget.\n"}

One of the most controversial aspects of the franchise, the Genesis Device is a destructive weapon in the galaxy, despite its benign origins and intentions. In Star Trek #12, a new and similar weapon is unleashed during the “Day of Blood,” with shocking results.\nStar Trek #12 is written by Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly and drawn by Angel Unzueta. The Klingon Emperor Kahless has obtained the Bajoran Orb of Destruction and plans to use it to complete his god-killer array. While analyzing the Orb of Creation, Spock and Scotty realize it has the same energy signature as the Genesis Device. Harnessing the power of the Orb takes a team effort, with both crews coming together to build a device that can tap into its energies. They fire the Orb’s energies at Kahless’ headquarters. Plants and grass begin to spring up, ultimately reaching the throne room and reviving a dead Alexander, while Kahless retreats.\nThe Genesis Device began with the best of intentions, but left a dark legacy. First appearing in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, the Genesis Device allowed its user to terraform a planet in a matter of hours, as opposed to decades. One of its designers, Doctor David Marcus, immediately saw its potential as a weapon, and his fears were realized when both Khan and the Klingon commander Kruge sought to use it against the Federation. The Genesis Device worked, but thanks to David introducing proto-matter into it, it was not stable. Eventually, the Federation shut down its research into the technology.\nThe Orb of Creation shares a lot in common with the Genesis Device. Both bring life to where there was previously none, but the Orb is far more stable. This no doubt owes to it being crafted by non-linear beings far beyond our comprehension. The Bajoran Prophets have a firmer grip on the nature of space-time and this allows them to build something that will truly work. Humans, by nature of their linear existence, do not understand these concepts and lack the power as well, forcing them to take shortcuts, like using proto-matter. The Orb also revived Alexander much like Genesis brought back Spock.\nRelated: These Two Characters Are Star Trek's Newest, Greatest Odd Couple\nHowever, as seen in season three of Star Trek: Picard, the Federation never stopped working on the Genesis Device. When Worf raided a Section 31 facility, he saw the research had continued, resulting in the Genesis II. It was a “blink and miss it” reference, and was never talked about again. The ability to rapidly terraform a planet is an awesome one, but unfortunately the potential for evil inherent in it renders it non-practical. However, the Bajoran Orb of Creation, Star Trek’s new super weapon, fulfills the promise of the Genesis Device in a much better way.\nStar Trek #12 is on sale now from IDW Publishing!\nShaun Corley is a freelance writer currently residing in the mountains of Appalachia.

{"title": "Marvel Definitively Explains Old Captain America’s Endgame Plot Hole, Gives Steve Rogers The Ending He Deserves", "date": "2023-10-06 12:36:42", "text": "4 years after Endgame, a seismic confirmation about the MCU's Sacred Timeline finally closes the biggest Captain America plot hole.\nWarning: This article contains SPOILERS for Loki season 2\nMarvel's Loki season 2 subtly blows apart Avengers: Endgame's ending by finally, and definitively, answering the Captain America plot hole that has plagued the MCU since its release in 2019. A hidden reveal, which the episode leaves viewers to interpret themselves, without explicitly discussing it is the latest significant Endgame change in the period since the Avengers finally took down Josh Brolin's Thanos, continuing the Infinity Saga's over-riding importance to the MCU. The implications of that reveal are not only major for Endgame, but also for the future of the MCU beyond Avengers: Secret Wars.\nWhen Loki season 1 released in 2021, the show opened a significant plot hole that retrospectively changed Captain America's otherwise perfect Endgame ending. The ending saw Chris Evans' Captain America skip out of the main MCU timeline to return to the 1940s and get his happily after with Peggy Carter after returning the Infinity Stones to their correct places. While avoiding the temporal disaster the Ancient One predicted would otherwise happen, Cap's decision created a new multiverse branch, that Loki's introduction of the TVA should have made problematic. In short, Captain America's happy ending branch should have been pruned as a violation of the Sacred Timeline, and only an implied loophole (that He Who Remained allowed it for some reason as an exception) has been the only justification. Now, Loki season 2 has made that suggestion MCU canon in a genius way.\nRelated: Every Loki Season 2 Episode 1 MCU Easter Egg & Reference\nThe first episode of Loki season 2 introduces the Temporal Loom, a huge invention of the TVA created to allow He Who Remains to control the flow of time, as he revealed he was doing in season 1. Loki's lore previously revealed that He Who Remains managed to harness the power of Alioth to end the Multiversal War by defeating his own rogue variants and destroying their timelines, before consolidating the Sacred Timeline. What wasn't quite as clear was how He Who Remains kept control of the flow of time without using the Infinity Stones (which the Ancient One claimed controlled the flow of time in Avengers: Endgame). But Loki season 2 reveals that as well as using the TVA to prune rogue branches, He Who Remains used the Temporal Loom to form the Sacred Timeline in the first place.\nCrucially, the other thing the Temporal Loom reveals is that the way everyone has thought about the Sacred Timeline is actually a lie. Simplified images of the timeline in Loki season 1 presented a single line, with individual branches breaking off from it, but season 2 reveals that the Sacred Timeline is actually a bundle of separate timelines bound together to form a rope, rather than a single thread. That seismic change means that as well as the main MCU timeline (either 616 or 199999 depending on who you believe), multiple other \"universes\" are actually part of the Sacred Timeline.\nFundamentally, Loki season 2 reveals that the Temporal Loom was always designed to tie branches together into one acceptable Sacred Timeline, so branches weren't all outlawed, it was simply that too many of them would destroy the order of the Sacred Timeline. As OB says:\n\"The Temporal Loom is the heart of the TVA. It's where raw time is refined into physical timeline. And it's not constructed to weave together so many new branches, so it's overloading.\"\nIn other words, He Who Remains allowed the existence of different universes and branches, as long as they could be tied together in a linear rope, existing parallel to one another, and not causing chaos. As the image of the unstable Sacred Timeline from the TVA's own monitors shows in Loki season 2's premiere, the Temporal Loom has a built-in threshold for branches, and it's only after that point that things start to really go wrong:\nThat is huge for Captain America and Avengers: Endgame, because it suggests that the branch that Cap created by returning to the 1940s on Earth-616 was just one of the multiple threads within the unified Sacred Timeline. It didn't create a deviation from He Who Remains' plan, because it was tied into the Sacred Timeline by the Temporal Loom, which offers the belated explanation behind why the TVA didn't appear to prune Chris Evans' veteran Avenger.\nThat also means that Captain America was able to live his life happily without looking over his shoulder for TVA hunters as Sophia Di Martino's Sylvie was forced to. While he may have had to hide his existence from those in the timeline he knew he was \"killed\" when he went into the ice, Cap could marry Peggy Carter and get the true happy ending he had been robbed off by Captain America: The First Avenger's ending.\nEven more intriguingly for the MCU away from Avengers: Endgame specifically, the new explanation of the Sacred Timeline also explains why the Amazing Spider-Man, Raimi's Spider-Man, Sony's Spider-Verses, Fox's Marvel Universe (which is confirmed to come into the MCU with Deadpool 3) and basically every other Marvel movie timeline \"annexed\" to the MCU were able to coexist with the MCU without the TVA turning up to prune them, despite their confirmed links to the MCU.\nFor the MCU's future movies, that also means that any future Multiversal War that ends with the Sacred Timeline being restored could still include the same alternate universes as threads within the larger timeline system. That would mean Deadpool could still exist outside of the main timeline, if Marvel Studios choose to isolate him, and opens up further possibilities with the Multiverse, without there needing to be a catch-all solution that makes other timelines impossible. Quite how that will play out will obviously be revealed in the upcoming Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars, but the idea that that would have to be a full reset to unify all timelines perhaps isn't quite true.\nNew episodes of Loki season 2 release every Thursday on Disney+\nWant more Loki content?

{"title": "Loki Season 2 Has A Key Piece Of Evidence That Backs Up The Biggest Secret Wars Fan Theory", "date": "2023-10-06 12:41:25", "text": "The premiere of Loki season 2 provides a key piece of evidence that helps back up a major theory focused on the God of Mischief's role in Secret Wars.\nWarning! This post contains SPOILERS for Loki season 2, episode 1\nLoki season 2 provides some key evidence for a major theory regarding the titular God of Mischief's role in Avengers: Secret Wars. Having failed to stop Sylvie (Sophia Di Martino) from killing He Who Remains (Jonathan Majors) in the finale of Loki season 1, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has returned to warn the Time Variance Authority of the imminent danger ahead. However, his major MCU future may have been teased as well.\nAs seen in Loki season 2's first episode, Loki is suffering from \"time-slipping\" where his body is involuntary and violently sent back and forth between the past, present, and future. However, it's been argued that this temporal affliction should be impossible inside the TVA given its existence outside of time. Loki's potential role in Avengers: Secret Wars is perhaps teased as well, supporting theories about the God of Mischief and his future with the TVA in light of a rapidly expanding multiverse.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Episode 1's Post-Credits Scene Is Way Deeper Than You Realize\nAccording to a popular Avengers: Secret Wars theory about Loki, the God of Mischief will soon be positioned to fix the multiverse. As a strong act of redemption, Loki could become a hero during the events of Secret Wars with the decision to take over the TVA. However, this would go beyond maintaining the original Sacred Timeline to ensure that He Who Remains' variants wouldn't exist (such as Kang). According to this theory, Loki would create a new Sacred Timeline out of the various realities that will likely be in conflict during Secret Wars, thereby providing the MCU with a brand-new universe in the aftermath.\nBecause He Who Remains' variants engaged in a multiversal war before the creation of the Sacred Timeline, it does seem as though history might repeat itself, first with Kang variants in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and then on an even bigger scale with Avengers: Secret Wars. As such, Loki could find himself in the unique position to bring about order from the chaos he's certain is coming. After all, He Who Remains was quite confident that his variants would return with the freed multiverse and all of its branch realities, and the multiversal threat of Kang has already been proven in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\nKeeping this Secret Wars theory in mind, Agent Mobius tells a time-slipping Loki in Loki season 2's premiere that there still needs to be a \"Loki Who Remains\" before they can figure out what to do about He Who Remains' variants. Despite being a joke on Mobius' part, this does support the idea that Loki could end up replacing He Who Remains in the MCU's future. He could end up being the one to oversee the creation of a new timeline with the God of Mischief ironically providing order and stability across realities.\nLoki replacing He Who Remains is certainly a compelling idea when looking at his overall arc. Although he didn't experience the events of Thor: The Dark World, Ragnarok, and Avengers: Infinity War like the original Loki, this variant of the God of Mischief is still becoming a more redemptive figure, having learned what it truly means to have glorious purpose. As such, the idea of Loki finding a new purpose by taking on the complex responsibility of forging a new timeline in Secret Wars is quite appealing.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Cast Guide: Every New & Returning Marvel Character\nBeyond Agent Mobius' joke, Loki's belief in an imminent multiversal war is a tease as well. Although Loki wanted more time to come up with a plan, Sylvie was convinced that He Who Remains was evil and had to be killed. However, Loki season 2 confirms Loki wasn't and still isn't convinced He Who Remains was all that bad. Loki's now questioning if He Who Remains was in the right, having made the hard choice to destroy entire realities for the sake of saving all the others from the most dangerous variants of himself.\nReferencing the multiversal war that came before with He Who Remains' variants, Loki believes the only certainty he and Mobius have is that another war is coming very soon. As such, this is likely the multiversal war that will soon be seen in Avengers: Secret Wars with Loki season 2 serving as critical setup for the crossover set to release in 2027. As such, only time will tell if Loki does end up taking over the TVA as He Who Remains' eventual replacement in the MCU.\nNew episodes of Loki release every Thursday at 6pm PT / 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "The Incredibles 2 Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-06 12:41:25", "text": "The long-awaited sequel, The Incredibles 2, wrapped up Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl's stories while still leaving the door open for a threequel.\nThe Incredibles 2's action-packed ending perfectly wrapped up The Incredibles story but still left the door open for a potential threequel. It took 14 years for Disney Pixar to finally release a sequel to the 2004 film, and audiences were eager to have their unanswered The Incredibles questions addressed. Though the Parr family got a happy ending in the original movie, it was unclear whether Supers would ever be legalized again or how Bob and Helen would handle their superhuman children (including their multitalented baby, Jack-Jack). It may have taken over a decade, but by the end of The Incredibles 2, this was all laid to rest.\nThe Incredibles 2 picked up right where The Incredibles had left off, with the Parr family facing off against the new supervillain, the Underminer. Though they had learned to cooperate and appreciate each other to an extent in the 2004 movie, it's clear from this first scene of the sequel that they didn't quite have this perfected. Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl failed to take down the Underminer and were once again blamed for destroying city property. However, in the wake of this incident, siblings Winston and Evelyn Deavor requested Helen's help in moving toward legalizing Supers again, and a mysterious villain, the Screenslaver, began causing chaos to stop them.\nRELATED: The Incredibles 2 Cast & Character Guide\nNear the end of The Incredibles 2, Helen devised a plan to track down the location of the Screenslaver and take him down for good. The villain could control people through hypnotization, using nothing but a screen. When Helen, as Elastigirl, found the villain's hideout, he was revealed to be nothing but a pizza boy, something that puzzled her greatly. Still, by publically eliminating this thread, Elastigirl had succeeded in convincing the world that Supers should be legal again. Winston Deaver arranged for ambassadors from around the world to meet on a boat to sign a document allowing the Parr family to fight crime again.\nJust before this grand event, Helen discovered that the inside of the Screenslaver's mask contained electronic screens, and she quickly realized that this meant the pizza boy was only being controlled by the real villain. Unluckily for Elastigirl, she realized this in front of Evelyn Deaver, who was, in fact, the real Screenslaver and villain of The Incredibles 2. She put the goggles on Helen's face, taking control of her. This is when she revealed that she planned to take control of all the Supers on Winston's boat and force them to crash it into the city, definitively proving that Supers shouldn't be trusted.\nEvelyn explained that her father, who had been shot and killed during a break-in at his mansion, would have survived had he called the police instead of waiting on Supers to save him. She felt that Supers were a hindrance to the world, more destructive than helpful, and despite Winston's reverence for them, she desired to see them all fall. Thankfully, before she could pull off her plan, Dash, Violet, and Jack-Jack managed to get to the boat and free their parents from mind control, and the Superfamily fought together once again, successfully turning the ship away from the city to safety.\nThe Parr family weren't the only ones who saved the city from the Deavers' out-of-control boat. A league of other Supers had also been taken under Evelyn's control, and once Helen and Bob were freed from their screened goggles, they fought to release the others. From there, everyone worked together to save the day—a spectacle that was made public on screens across the city. This meant that, despite mind-controlled Frozone publically announcing that the Supers were waging war on normal society, the public was willing to let it all go and again support the legalization of Supers.\nMoreover, the ambassadors remained on the Deavers' boat throughout the entirety of the dramatic rescue, so they were still willing to show their support for the Supers with their signatures. In one of the final scenes of The Incredibles 2, Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and countless other Supers were seen in a courtroom while a Judge declared the repeal of the Superhero Relocation Act. Finally, Bob and Helen, as well as their talented children, were allowed to publically continue to make the world a better place.\nBob Parr may have been the main character of The Incredibles, but in The Incredibles 2, it was time for Elastigirl to take center stage. This made a lot of sense with her previous character arc since, after the Superhero Relocation Act, she became determined to live by the rules and focus on her family instead of saving the world. Still, this hadn't been initially her goal. At the beginning of The Incredibles, Elastigirl stated in an interview that she had no interest in settling down and starting a family. She was at the top of her game and wanted to continue representing women as she kicked some criminal butt.\nThough she had been reluctant in The Incredibles, she stepped up and proved herself to be a pretty remarkable hero when she took it upon herself to fly a jet out to Syndrome's island and rescue her husband. However, the beginning of The Incredibles 2 revealed that Helen was still conflicted about her two identities. She ultimately realized that to do what was right for her children, she needed to leave her home and be Elastigirl again. Her role in saving the day in The Incredibles 2 completed her Incredibles arc by balancing her identity as a wife and mom with that of Elastigirl.\nOf course, just because Helen carried the focus of The Incredibles 2 doesn't mean Bob didn't have a part to play. As Elastigirl returned to being a full-time Super, Bob did precisely what he had said he wanted during the Mr. Incredible interview at the beginning of The Incredibles—he dove into being a father. Before the Superhero Relocation Act made Supers illegal, Bob had already been considering hanging up his Super Suit to start a family. It was only because he was forced to retire before he was ready that he resented his domestic life. In The Incredibles, Bob learned to appreciate his family, and in The Incredibles 2, he really perfected being a dad.\nEdna Mode and Jack-Jack Parr were quite the unlikely match, but since the infant seemed to have all Super abilities in one, the designer took a particular interest. The Incredibles 2 revealed that when Syndrome kidnapped Jack-Jack and was subsequently killed after the baby revealed his powers, Bob and Helen had been too far below them to really see what had happened. Therefore, at the start of The Incredibles 2, the Parrs still believed that their youngest son had no powers.\nThis all changed when Helen started her job with the Deavors. Getting used to caring for all three kids at once became considerably more complicated when Jack-Jack suddenly began walking through walls, multiplying, and turning into a horned demon baby. Exhausted and unsure of what to do, Mr. Incredible took his son to see Edna, who was fascinated to see a baby with such power. She designed him a suit that came with various safety measures, and with a remote control, Bob could track Jack's location, extinguish any flames the baby created, and, overall, just ensure he was safe.\nRELATED: Incredibles 2: All of Jack-Jack's 18 Powers Explained\nThe Incredibles 2 gave the Parrs a satisfying ending while still leaving things open for a potential threequel. The family is seen driving into the crime-fighting sunset, ready to work together to make the city a better place. Still, the fact that they had just dropped off Violet's date at the movie theater demonstrated how the struggle between balancing a personal life and being a Super would always be present. This means countless opportunities for a continued story.\nAdditionally, it's implied that Evelyn Deavor might not have been entirely dealt with. Though she was arrested, Violet mentioned that, as a wealthy genius, she would likely get a slap on the wrist. The Screenslaver's agenda against Supers was unchanged, and there's always a chance she could return as an even more pronounced villain in The Incredibles 3. Still, since it took 14 years after the first Incredibles movie for The Incredibles 2 to be released, it could be a while before we know if Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and their Superfamily have any more stories to tell.\n"}

Poe's work has an influence on many Dark Academia works, so it is interesting to see him as a character in one, especially with Melling's committed performance, and the gothic feel of the thriller keeps the tension high until the intriguing reveal of The Pale Blue Eye's true killer.\nBased on the novel by Donna Tartt, Ansel Elgort stars in The Goldfinch, a movie about a young man whose mother was killed in a bombing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City when he was 13. After her death, he set out to survive on his own after taking a famous painting from the museum after the bombing called The Goldfinch. Not all Dark Academia movies take place in university settings, and the idea of the illustrious world of art plays a big role in this movie, which plays in the same sandbox as the best of the genre.\nFor fans of blending magic with their scholastic endeavors, The Magicians will take them on an enchanted, angst-ridden adventure accompanying Quentin Coldwater, a student of Brakebills College for Magical Pedagogy, as he acquaints himself with the realm of magic. Along with his group of grad school chums, Quentin endeavors to not only learn about wielding magic himself as a magician but also use it to prevent impending dangers to the institution and humanity en masse. The series is based on the novels of Lev Grossman.\nThe Dark Academia Netflix movie franchise continues in Enola Holmes 2. The sequel finds Enola attempting to get her own detective business off the ground when she begins looking into the disappearance of a young factory worker. Brown continues to be charming and heroic in this role, ensuring that she will have a great new franchise once Stranger Things ends. The new movie also has the added benefit of including more of Henry Cavill's Sherlock Holmes, with great chemistry shared between him and Brown. The movie continues to draw influence from Arthur Conan Doyle's work while being its own thing as well.\nWhile he is best known for his fantastical worlds of elves and hobbits, J.R.R. Tolkien worked as an English professor and published several academic works as well. In the 2019 biopic Tolkien, Nicholas Hoult stars as the esteemed author in this movie that tells the story of his early life as a professor and author, and the moments that led to his creation of his magical world. Much of the movie takes place during his time as a teenager where he fell in love with his future wife, and then his time at Oxford, where he developed his love for language.\nReleased in 1992, School Ties is another movie that shows the dark side of elite schools and the separation between the haves and have-nots. The movie takes place in 1955 and follows a working-class teenager who received a football scholarship to an exclusive Massachusetts prep school. However, he finds it hard to fit in and hides his Jewish heritage from his new friends, knowing their negative stereotypical views. The cast had some of the top young stars of the era, with Brendan Fraser, Matt Damon, Chris O'Donnell, Ben Affleck, and Cole Hauser in the cast as students.\nBased on the popular series of books, A Series Of Unfortunate Events focuses on the tragic story of three orphaned children — Klaus, Violet, and Sunny Baudelaire — as they attempt to discern the truth about their parents' sudden demise. Their only remaining guardian, the mercurial Count Olaf, inspires anything but familial comfort. As Olaf plots to get his hands on the siblings' fortune, they are obliged to outsmart him, though his disguises and elaborate plans make it increasingly difficult. The show is based on the novels by the clever Lemony Snicket (Daniel Handler).\nFrom television horror hit-maker Mike Flanagan, The Haunting of Bly Manor is hailed as one of the scariest Dark Academia shows on Netflix. The series is the follow-up to Flanagan's The Haunting of Hill House and features much of the same cast from that show. Taking inspiration from the works of writer Henry James, the show follows a young governess who is hired by a man to care for his orphaned niece and nephew at the Bly estate. Once there, the young woman finds strange occurrences that hint at dark secrets. Like Flanagan's other shows, The Haunting of Bly Manor will keep viewers on the edge of their seats.\nBased on the real-life Shelby family, who built an empire of gambling and bootlegging from the ashes of the war and a ruined England, Peaky Blinders displays the raw talent and resourcefulness that can result from education found in the gritty streets of Birmingham. The popular series follows the main protagonist Tommy Shelby on his rise through his family's hierarchy and the criminal hierarchy of Birmingham. Eventually, his influence and power reach further than he ever dreamed; to the English aristocracy, where his street smarts are pitted against the nobles' book learning to astonishing results.\nWhen even the famous consulting detective Sherlock Holmes can't solve the case, a group of misfits who live on the streets of gritty Victorian London are called upon to lend their talents to its shadowy machinations by his esteemed associate Dr. John Watson. This is Holmes' as fans have never seen before, and the eccentric characters are as unique as the series of supernatural capers they help solve. Viewers will enjoy helping \"The Irregulars\" solve their puzzles as much as the intriguing setting, which vacillates between the criminal underworld and the royal palace.\nBased on the novels by Deborah Harkness, A Discovery of Witches is a Prime Video Dark Academia show about a witch and a vampire who protect powerful texts at the Oxford Bodleian Library. In the world of the series, vampires and witches are long-time enemies, but here they realize they have to work together to keep a specific book out of the hands of people who wish to unleash a great evil on the world. The cast includes Matthew Goode as vampire Matthew Clairmont and Teresa Palmer as witch historian Diana Bishop. There were three seasons of the series and a total of 25 episodes.\nRELATED: The 50 Best TV Shows Of All Time, Ranked\nThere have been several adaptations of the Charlotte Bronte book Jane Eyre, but one of the best arrived in 2011 from director Cary Joji Fukunaga (True Detective). This Dark Academia movie stars Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre, an orphan with a dire childhood who found a home with St. John Rivers. Once she turned 18, she went to Thornfield Hall where she became a governess. However, she soon falls in love with Mr. Rochester, the master of Thornfield Hall (Michael Fassbender). The movie won several awards and even picked up one Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design.\nOscar-winning director Guillermo del Toro has played with the Dark Academia genre before in Crimson Peak and other projects, but he has a lot of fun embracing it in this twisted Netflix series. Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities is an anthology horror series that features eight separate stories that are told with that gothic feel placed within modern settings. Other filmmakers such as Vincenzo Natali, Ana Lily Amirpour, and Jennifer Kent helm some of the other stories. The anthology ensemble also includes actors such as Andrew Lincoln and Dan Stevens. While perhaps not as impactful as some of Guillermo del Toro's best movies, it is a strong anthology series for fans of the filmmaker.\nReleased in 2009, An Education was a coming-of-age drama based on the memoir by British journalist Lynn Barber. In the movie, Carey Mulligan stars as Jenny, a schoolgirl who meets a charming con man who seduces her (played by Peter Sarsgaard). A period picture, the story takes place in 1961 in London and Jenny has dreams of attending Oxford when she meets David. She then allows him to manipulate her and her parents, and soon learns that things are not always as good as they seem as she almost ruins her entire chance for an education and future. The movie picked up three Oscar nominations, including one for Mulligan.\nThe free-spirited and dynamic younger sister of Sherlock Holmes, the famous consulting detective, finally embarks on her own exciting adventure in Enola Holmes, starring Millie Bobby Brown as the titular Holmes sibling. Well-versed in martial arts, physics, astrology, history, and methods of deduction, she puts all of her incredible skills to work discerning the whereabouts of her missing mother, with no help from her famous older brother. Though her educational background is formidable, it isn't based on formal training and thus is dismissed despite its immense efficacy.\nBefore he was Doctor Strange in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Benedict Cumberbatch took on the role of Sherlock Holmes, the world's greatest fictional detective. In this series, created by the BBC, Holmes and his partner John Watson (another MCU veteran in Martin Freeman) had four seasons and some of Holmes' most popular cases as the intellectual detective solved the toughest of crimes. The episodes were all feature-length, with three in each season, and one special that arrived in 2016. Of the Dark Academia shows on streaming services, Sherlock remains one of the smartest.\n\n"}
{"title": "Darth Vader Names the 1 Person He Hates Most in the Galaxy (& It's Not Obi-Wan)", "date": "2023-10-09 00:01:26", "text": "Darth Vader hates Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars lore, a hatred that's matched only by that of himself, yet there still exists one person he hates more. \nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Star Wars: Darth Vader #39 There are few people in the Star Wars galaxy Darth Vader hates more than Obi-Wan Kenobi, even if that hatred does stem from blinding self-loathing and misdirected sorrow. However, there is one other person who Darth Vader hates even more than his former master - and no, it isn’t himself.\nEven before he fell to the dark side, Anakin Skywalker always held resentment for Obi-Wan. Episode II highlights this probably the best out of any film or show set in that time period, with Anakin telling Padmé how Obi-Wan doesn’t trust him, how he’s holding him back, and even how Obi-Wan is ‘jealous’ of his power. This resentment culminated in the epic climax of the entire prequel trilogy, with Anakin and Obi-Wan’s fateful battle on Mustafar in Episode III. Then, Vader’s hatred for Obi-Wan was solidified before their final encounter in Episode IV during the Disney+ series Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, during Vader’s latest mission in Star Wars canon, he’s forced to dig deep within himself to unlock a hatred the likes of which he’d rarely felt before for the sake of his own survival, and the person he focused on wasn’t Obi-Wan Kenobi or even himself, it was Emperor Palpatine.\nIn Star Wars: Darth Vader #39 by Greg Pak and Raffaele Ienco, Darth Vader overcomes his tenuous grasp on the Force to destroy a portion of the Scourge that was inhabiting a deadly Clone Wars-era droid that never saw mass production. To do that, Darth Vader had to focus on his blinding hatred, and really pinpoint the thing he truly hated most in the galaxy. His mind glided over a number of qualified individuals, including Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, and himself. However, by the end of the issue, it’s strongly implied that the true source of Darth Vader’s hatred was Palpatine, and he used that hatred to crush this Scourge-host with the clenching of his fist. This point is then driven home further, as Darth Vader is now on his way to Coruscant to challenge Palpatine face-to-face.\nIt is true that Darth Vader has admitted on more than one occasion that he hates himself more than anyone else, with one example seen in the Star Wars Tales #9 story “Resurrection” during his fight with Darth Maul. However, based on his entire Star Wars character arc, it makes way more sense that Vader actually hates Palpatine the most. By hating the Emperor, Darth Vader has given Palpatine dominion over him, as hatred is the source of dark side power. Plus, every bad thing that’s ever happened in Vader’s life is because of Palpatine, and while Anakin Skywalker was originally ignorant to that fact (and even blamed Obi-Wan instead), Darth Vader certainly was not. This is why Vader was able to find redemption after killing Palpatine in Episode VI, as doing so was a physical action representing the metaphorical destruction of Vader’s evil self, and his acceptance of the light side through the love he had for his son.\nThis isn’t to say Darth Vader doesn’t have intense hatred for Obi-Wan as well as immense self-loathing, as he unarguably does. However, when it comes to who Darth Vader hates more than anyone in the Star Wars galaxy, himself and Obi-Wan Kenobi don’t hold a candle to the true point of Darth Vader’s hatred, Emperor Palpatine.\nStar Wars: Darth Vader #39 by Marvel Comics is available now.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "Disney Once Had A Horror Movie Banned For Being Too Dark", "date": "2023-10-09 00:10:27", "text": "One Disney horror movie, which is now considered one of the most important animated films of all time, was once banned for being too dark.\nWalt Disney Studios has released some successful horror films, but in 1929, one horror movie was banned for being too dark for audiences. Disney's animated short The Skeleton Dance is one of the most essential animated shorts in cinematic history; it brought animation out of the silent era and was one of the first cartoons released in the golden age of animation between 1928 and 1969. However, the circumstances of its release were quite unique, especially compared to other Disney features and short films.\nThe Skeleton Dance was the first of Walt Disney's famous Silly Symphonies series of animated shorts. It was produced and directed by Walt Disney, animated by Ub Iwerks, and its score was composed by Carl W. Stalling. As implied by the title, the short 5-minute film depicts four skeletons rising from the grave and dancing, playing music, and causing havoc in the dead of night. Despite the cartoon's success, it was clear that its dark story and eerie animation didn't agree with everybody during its initial release, although it is one of the most important Disney animated movies.\nThe Skeleton Dance was the first of three horror-themed shorts that was released by Disney in 1929. Disney created this short, along with Hell's Bells and The Haunted House to show that they could tackle the horror genre efficiently through animation. The Skeleton Dance was one of the first films to use medieval dance macabre imagery; the four skeletons in the short, dance together, frighten animals and cause chaos before returning to the grave. Some felt the short was too frightening in nature, and it led to the cartoon being banned from viewing in Denmark due to its dark story and design.\nRelated: Disney's Upcoming Movie Releases - From 2023 To 2025\nIn 1930, The New York Times reported that Denmark had banned The Skeleton Dance entirely for being \"too macabre\" for audiences. There was concern that the black-and-white animation combined with the intense music was too graphic and frightening for its target audience at the time. Since the cartoon's release, the ban in Denmark has been lifted and Disney has continued to expand their work in the horror genre following the short's initial release.\nSince its release in 1929, The Skeleton Dance is considered an animated masterpiece, as it was one of the first cartoons to perfectly synchronize the animation and the sound together at the same time. Up until then, cartoons were created first and the sound was added later. It remains an important aspect of animated history and has influenced several horror cartoons in later years. While Disney received praise for the animation and the production of the cartoon, there was also criticism for its dark theme.\nRelated: All 27 Pixar Movies Ranked From Worst To Best\nIn July 1929, Variety magazine posted a review warning parents not to bring their children to watch The Skeleton Dance. They deemed that some scenes, such as where the four skeletons use their bones as instruments and scare owls and cats, were too dark for young audiences. Critics also pointed out that the musical accompaniment and the graveyard setting of the cartoon proved too gruesome for children to watch. Nevertheless, despite the controversy at the time, The Skeleton Dance proved monumental for the production of Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies and is still regarded as an animated classic horror movie today.\nEidhne Gallagher is a Movie and TV Features Writer, living in Ireland.

{"title": "10 Burning Questions Barbie 2 Must Answer", "date": "2023-10-09 00:20:26", "text": "From what Barbie’s life will be like in the real world to what happens to Ken and Barbieland, here are 10 burning questions Barbie 2 can answer.\nIf Barbie 2 happens, it will have to answer some burning questions regarding the events of Barbie. Greta Gerwig's Barbie achieved incredible success, having taken more than 1.4 billion dollars at the global box office, so it makes sense for Warner Bros to follow it up with a sequel. At present, there has not been a confirmation of Barbie 2. However, considering the success of the movie, a sequel happening seems more likely than not.\nHowever, a sequel needs to do more than just drive sales for the studios, it needs to continue the story established in Barbie and revisit some key moments. The movie ends with Robbie's Barbie now a part of the real world, arriving at her first-ever gynecology appointment, which confirms that she became human. There is also a shroud of mystery about what happened to everyone else in Barbie Land and the effect that this connection between the real world and Barbie Land had on both. Here are some of the questions that need to be answered in a potential Barbie 2 story.\nThe Barbie movie ending revealed that Barbie returned to the real world and was cared for by Gloria's family. After they drop her off at a doctor's appointment, she steps up to the reception desk and with a great deal of excitement announces her reason for being there is that she has her first gynecology appointment. This is a clear indication that Barbie is no longer a doll, as earlier in the film she notes that everyone in Barbie Land doesn't have reproductive organs. But it isn't just leaving Barbie Land that transformed her, as she clarifies that she and Ken were still without reproductive organs when they first entered the real world.\nBarbie is used to a simple life where most things tend to come easy. The real world tends to be full of contradictions and complications, so how has she gotten used to life outside of Barbie Land is an important question. Her first introduction to the real world was a confusing and challenging time for her but hopefully, with the help and guidance of Gloria and her daughter Sasha, Barbie is assimilating well. Barbie 2 could explore her getting used to a new way of living and fitting into the wider world.\nThe balance in Barbie Land is clearly pretty fragile. In almost no time at all, Ken returned to Barbie Land with basic knowledge about what patriarchy was and decided to turn Barbie Land from a peaceful utopia into a teenage boy's dream full of horses, cars, and parties. The Barbies managed to restore the natural order and regain control, but with new complex notions about power struggles and a greater sense of autonomy, how is Barbie Land coping is a mystery. Are the Ken's happy to return to their lives as background characters, or has the landscape shifted and both sides looking at how to further improve their society together?\nWill Ferrel is hilarious in Barbie as the CEO of Mattel, but Barbie raised a serious concern by asking where the women were in the boardroom. Gloria was already working for Mattel, and now that Barbie has joined the real world, there are two perfectly capable candidates to help provide a female perspective and connect with the customers of Mattel should they be looking for a more diverse boardroom. Barbie 2 could explore the shift in power at Mattel and how the company seeks to further represent and reflect its customer base in its leadership team.\nBarbie Land is a beautiful landscape of pink, with houses spaced evenly apart and all positioned on uniform streets next to each other. But one big concern was raised during the Ken uprising, where do the Ken's actually live? When the Kens decided to take control of Barbie Land and occupy the Barbie dream houses for themselves, the Barbies asked where they were supposed to live, and no one had any answer. Obviously, the Ken's should not have stolen the Barbie's homes, but where is it that they live and sleep wasn't answered. A sequel could go a long way to explaining where the Kens all go when Barbies aren't around.\nRelated: The Barbie Movie Cast & Character Guide\nKen's entire arc in Barbie was trying to understand who he was without Barbie. As a character, Ken was created as an accessory to Barbie, and so he formed much of his identity around her, but when Barbie decides to leave Barbie Land behind, Ken decides to take some time to work on himself and get a better understanding of who he really is. Outside his job, beach, what does Ken do, what does he like, and where does he sleep? All of these questions and more could be explored in a sequel where Ken has had some time for introspective thought.\nAllan is Ken's best friend in Barbie, and during the Ken uprising, Allan seems a little bit lost possessing no strong desire to take over Barbie Land and disturb the natural order. When the Barbies plan to reclaim their homes and remove Kens from power, Allan joins them and helps to restore Barbie Land to its original glory. As a singular anomaly in Barbie, Ken is unique and separate from the other Kens and Barbies, raising the question of what happens to him after the events of Barbie. Played by the beloved Michael Cera, seeing more of Allan and learning what happens to him next is a must for any future sequel.\nBarbie is a central figure in Barbie Land as Stereotypical Barbie. Her home is in a central position, and she has a great deal of influence over her peers. So what happens to Barbie Land after Stereotypical Barbie moves out? There would be an empty home in the center of the street, and Barbie's home was frequently the site of parties and gatherings with the rest of her friends. Finding out what actually happens to Barbie Land would be an important part of the story to develop in Barbie 2.\nIt's revealed early on in Barbie that Margot Robbie's character is connected to a woman in the real world who played with her as a doll. In addition, Kate McKinnon's Weird Barbie is also shown being played with as a doll in the real world. Considering these connections to people in the real world and Robbie revealing that it is possible to go and seek out their owners, do any of the other Barbies decide to go off in search of their owners? This could be a fascinating development for a sequel to explore. And Robbie could provide help to her friends to transition and adapt to the real world considering her pioneering journey.\nFinally, now that Barbie is outside of Barbie Land, what does she do with all her free time is a major question. She clearly hangs out with Gloria and her family, but it would make sense for her to pursue her own independence with the chance to work and live on her own. To do that, she needs to find a way to earn money and adjust to everyday life eating real food and getting groceries. Barie could have landed a job at Mattel working with her friend Gloria, but she could also pursue other careers to get more experience of what it's like to be a real person. Barbie 2 could see her pursue a way to fit into regular life, potentially studying or working.\n"}

In the past few decades, horror parodies have increased in popularity. Shaun of the Dead is a popular twist on the Dawn of the Dead franchise from the early aughts. More recently, Freaky – a horror spin on Freaky Friday – and Happy Death Day – a scary version of Groundhog’s Day – have graced the screens. This holiday season will add another fun horror movie to the mix.\nOn October 5, It’s a Wonderful Knife’s trailer dropped, creating hype for the upcoming movie horror twist on the holiday film It’s a Wonderful Life. The preview includes multiple exciting elements like a person’s wish that they hadn’t been born, lots of blood, and a fast-paced plot. Additionally, there’s a scary slasher villain called the Angel. When unmasked, the preview shows a familiar face – that of actor Justin Long. It’s a Wonderful Knife proves that Justin Long deserves to be recognized as the horror king he is.\nMultiple famous actors started out in horror flicks, and Justin Long is no exception. Two years after his first on-screen appearance, Long starred as Darry in Jeepers Creepers, reprising his role in the second film too. These aren’t the only horror films he’s appeared in though, as the list of Justing Long horror movies is quite large. In the cult classic animated horror movie Hair High, Long voiced a teenager named Dwayne. He also appeared as Clay Dalton in Drag Me to Hell, Wallace Bryton in Tusk, and Hap Jackson in House of Darkness. His most recent horror movie is the 2022 horror mystery film Barbarian, though he has three more in post-production.\nRelated: 15 Best Horror Movies Of All Time, Ranked\nIn addition to his film work, Justin Long has appeared in two horror TV series. Long played a one-off role in Creepshow, season 2, episode 5, “Night of the Living Late Show.” In this episode, he plays Simon Sherman, a man trying to escape from his marriage by creating a VR system that causes a person to experience anything that happens in the virtual world. Additionally, Long is a series regular in Disney Plus’s reboot of Goosebumps, where he plays a teacher with a connection to supernatural murders that occurred decades earlier.\nIn Justin Long's recent years, he's taken to acting as villains in horror media. In Disney Plus’s reboot of Goosebumps, Long plays Nathan Bratt, the teacher who becomes the antagonist after his body gets possessed by an evil spirit. Throughout Barbarian, his character AJ Gilbride acts in his own self-interest, even pushing Tess off the water tower after she comes back to save him. Taking these roles into consideration, it’s fitting that Justin Long plays the killer in It’s a Wonderful Knife. He is well practiced at making his mannerisms and face menacing, turning himself into a convincing bad guy for a horror movie.\n"}
{"title": "Red Hood's Custom Bullets Just Gave Him a Cooler Version of the Dark Knight's Utility Belt", "date": "2023-10-09 00:30:25", "text": "Red Hood has always struggled to find his place in the DC Universe, but one cool new gadget might just prove where Jason Todd truly belongs.\nWarning! Contains Spoilers For DC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1!\nIt's no secret that DC has been struggling to find the right path for Red Hood, but the answer may have just come from this year's Halloween special — which reveals that Jason has an even cooler version of Batman's iconic utility belt. Jason's unique new weapons show the exact niche that Red Hood belongs in DC lore: fighting the supernatural.\nDC annual October tradition of releasing something extra spooky continues this year in a large anthology of horror stories: DC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1. One stand-out story, \"The Dark Bite\" by Christopher Sean, Laneya, Dexter Soy, Veronica Gandini, and Wes Abbott, features Nightwing dealing with vampires in Bludhaven. He calls in backup in the form of Red Hood, who shows up on the scene and proves to be surprisingly effective at fighting the supernatural.\nRed Hood reveals that he created antidotes for each supernatural threat he expected to face, including vampires, werewolves, and demons. Each antidote comes in a special dart designed for his guns. This level of preparedness for fighting the supernatural shows exactly where Jason Todd belongs in the DC Universe.\nRelated: Red Hood Isn't Actually Human - Official DC Theory Explained\nAs the second Robin, Jason Todd had big shoes to fill by following in the steps of Dick Grayson. In fact, when Jason was first introduced, he was a near carbon copy of Dick. Over time and after a Crisis event, Jason became his own character — especially after Jason was killed off by the Joker. When he returned, nearly two decades later, it was as the brutal vigilante Red Hood. Jason was now posed as an enemy to the Bat-Family, but this status quo didn't last long either. He eventually rejoined Batman's allies, albeit with some disagreements over how to handle criminals. This has led to DC's struggle in finding a place for Jacon in the central DCU, but this Halloween special shows that Jason's perfect place has always been with the supernatural.\nExcept for Damian Wayne, Jason coming back from the dead is something almost no other Bat-Family member has done. When Damian was killed and returned to life, he had short after-effects of Kryptonian-like powers, so it's fair to assume that Jason might have some after-effects as well. It's possible that Jason's revival has made him more in tune with the supernatural. Batman does everything he can to fight criminals and protect the living, but there are a lot of people who have already been murdered, and whose crimes go unsolved. Jason could step in and use his connection to the supernatural to help solve them\nJason shows in this issue that he has specialized equipment to take on demons, vampires, and werewolves. While Batman has shown impressive equipment to take down vampires, he rarely has to employ them. Giving Jason run of the supernatural corner of DC would finally give him a place to belong. Several different alternate universe stories have embraced Jason's connection to magic and the supernatural, such as the video game Gotham Knights, which leaned heavily into Jason having mystical abilities. In DCeased: Dead Planet Jason was the leader of Shadowpact, a vigilante group that specifically deals with magic and the supernatural. All of this proves that Red Hood has a place in the DC Universe — DC just has to let him take it.\nDC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1 is out now from DC Comics!\n"}
{"title": "Ellen Burstyn Was &quot;Very Skeptical&quot; Of The Exorcist: Believer Before Agreeing To Join Sequel", "date": "2023-10-09 00:37:22", "text": "The Exorcist: Believer director David Gordon Green reveals that Ellen Burstyn was skeptical of the sequel, and it took some time to get her onboard.\nThe Exorcist: Believer director David Gordon Green reveals that Ellen Burstyn was initially reluctant to join the project. The new movie serves as a direct sequel to the original 1973 film, The Exorcist. Believer succeeded in doing what no other installments in the franchise could: Getting Burstyn to reprise her role as Chris MacNeil for the first time since 1973. Burstyn earned an Oscar nomination for her performance as MacNeil in The Exorcist, a mother whose daughter, Regan (Linda Blair), shows signs of demonic possession. However, she has been reluctant to dive back into the franchise.\nIn an interview with A.Frame, Green confirmed that it was no easy feat getting Burstyn onboard for The Exorcist: Believer. The first time he approached her, she shot down the idea of being a part of the cast. Over time, though, Green was able to win her over. Check out his statement below:\nI could have done it without her, but it's a big relief, as someone trying to honor the original film, to have someone I'm not exactly looking for permission but who can hold my hand as I step into sacred territory. If there's any hand I want to hold here, it's Ellen Burstyn's. At first, she was very skeptical. Her immediate answer was, \"Hell no.\" I think people have approached her many times about sequels, so I said, 'If you won't be in my movie, at least be my friend.'\nWe ended up talking about my intentions and the story I'm trying to tell, how I want to go about it, and how I can make this meaningful to me, personally. I start every project very self-indulgently. I want this to be a movie for me. I can acknowledge that there is a significant fan base, but I can't give it the tools I have unless I know that the movie needs me, and I need it. Ellen and I spoke and shared literature and philosophies and had a few social conversations. When I then sent her the script, I think she was probably, in my eyes, pleasantly surprised that I'd incorporated some of the conversations that we had, that I'd personalized it for her and taken great lengths to pay respect to the Chris MacNeil character 50 years later. We had a tremendous collaboration, and I'm very proud to have worked with her.\nNow that The Exorcist: Believer has premiered and reviews have started flowing in, there is the question of if Burstyn made the right call to re-enter the franchise with this movie. Unfortunately, The Exorcist: Believer hasn't managed to differentiate itself from other installments in the franchise in terms of reception. As of this writing, its Rotten Tomatoes score stands at just 23%, making it the third lowest-rated movie in the series. While it hasn't done terribly at the box office, its opening weekend was slightly less than predictions estimated.\nAt the same time, Green's statement indicates that prospects of success didn't lead to Burstyn's decision to return. Instead, her main concern was that The Exorcist: Believer respected the original movie. Not only have other films in the franchise been ill-received, but some haven't respected the source material at all. For example, Exorcist II: The Heretic was directed by someone who despised the original movie and the novel it was based on, trying to take the franchise in a new direction with terrible results. Considering this, it's not surprising that she appreciated how much Green valued her opinion.\nWhile critics had negative things to say about The Exorcist: Believer, one thing they couldn't accuse it of is desecrating the franchise's legacy. Many singled out The Exorcist: Believer's respect for the franchise and desire to return to its roots as one of the few positive aspects. Though some felt that the movie wasted Burstyn, others felt her presence helped drive home its purpose of paying tribute to the original. Ultimately, The Exorcist: Believer isn't perfect, but the quality may not have mattered as much to the original star as knowing her opinions and role in the franchise were valued.\nSource: A.frame\n"}
{"title": "Every Adventure Time Character Who Appears In Fionna & Cake", "date": "2023-10-09 00:40:27", "text": "The Adventure Time spinoff Fionna & Cake features several fan-favorite Adventure Time characters — and a few less-than-optimal antagonists.\nWARNING: This article contains SPOILERS for Adventure Time: Fionna & Cake.\nThe Max spinoff Adventure Time: Fionna & Cake features several of the original Adventure Time characters — and a few antagonists too. Fionna, a human who's sick of dead-end jobs in her magic-less world, ends up in the Land of Ooo with her pal Cake the Cat. The spinoff's titular characters, who are alternate versions of Adventure Time's protagonists Finn the Human and Jake the Dog, then join Simon Petrikov (a.k.a. Ice King) on a multiverse-traversing journey.\nWhile Fionna and Cake's place in Adventure Time’s timeline is a bit complicated, it has its roots in the original series. In Adventure Time season 3, Finn and Jake are subjected to Ice King's poorly disguised fan fiction, which centers on Fionna and Cake. The Max miniseries stems from this story-within-a-story, but, thanks to an entity called Prismo, canonizes Fionna and Cake and establishes their universe as one that was secretly hidden within Ice King's mind (hence the fan fiction). The journey Simon, Fionna, and Cake embark on sees the characters confronting their pasts in order to accept their futures, and, along the way, the trio encounters more than a few familiar faces.\nOne of the main characters of Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake, Simon Petrikov is still tormented by his past as the Ice King. Feeling isolated and like a relic of the past, Simon tries to resurrect his late fiancée, Betty. Instead, he opens a portal in the back of his head, allowing Cake to emerge in the Land of Ooo. A few episodes later, Simon is responsible for bringing Fionna to Ooo as well. In an attempt to reconcile their pasts and futures, the trio embark on a cosmic, multiverse-hopping quest. Given how much Simon's story figures into the larger Adventure Time canon, it's great to see him serving such an important role in the spinoff.\nThe creators of Fionna and Cake were keen on making Fionna distinct from Finn. In order to give more weight to her multiverse adventures, the team cut down Finn's screen time. In the second episode of the Adventure Time spinoff, Simon goes on a brief quest with adult Finn, who's bulked up and grown a long beard. Later, in another universe, viewers get a glimpse of Farmworld Finn, a character who stems from the original series. Unfortunately, the Distant Lands miniseries confirmed that Jake is dead in Fionna and Cake, hence adult Finn's homage-paying chest tattoo.\nIn Fionna and Cake episode 8, the talking cat finds another fan-favorite character: BMO. A living prototype video game console, BMO lives alone in a desolate land stretch of land but proves to be a trusty sidekick when called upon. While BMO tries to help the trio gain more insight into Ice King's madness, their spinoff role is short-lived. Even so, it's a treat to see BMO adventuring through the Land of Ooo once more.\nIn the sixth episode of the miniseries, Simon works with the Winter King, an alternate version of Simon's Ice King persona who was able to escape the Ice Crown's curse. Together, the duo try to replicate Winter King's crown, but they're soon kidnapped by Candy Queen. In a fun role reversal, the unhinged, villainous Candy Queen is actually an alternate version of Princess Bubblegum who was corrupted by the crown's curse. By the episode's end, Fionna destroys the crown, which saves this alt-PB from madness.\nRELATED: Adventure Time's Distant Lands: Obsidian Fixed A Huge Problem\nIn Fionna and Cake's vampire timeline, Simon dies, which means he isn't around to protect and raise a young Marceline. Instead, the half-demon is adopted by the menacing Vampire King, which causes Marcy to grow into a ruthless, power-hungry vampire known as The Star. Bent on destroying humanity's remaining survivors, The Star delights in killing, making her a much darker version of Adventure Time's Marceline the Vampire Queen.\nA human-turned-wizard, Betty was Simon's fiancée before he became Adventure Time's villainous yet bumbling Ice King. In Adventure Time's series finale, Betty sacrifices herself to protect Simon and fuses with a malevolent entity called GOLB (more on that later). In Fionna and Cake, a lonely Simon tries to resurrect his lost love and shares his past with Fionna. Ultimately, Simon comes to learn more about the magnitude of Betty's sacrifice, which helps him more readily accept his present.\nKnown as The Wishmaster, Prismo is \"a manifestation of an old man's dream.\" The cosmic entity resides in the Time Room, which itself exists at the center of Adventure Time's multiverse. In the episode \"Wake Up,\" it's revealed that he's a sleeping old man's dream projection and that his almighty existence is tied to the mortal's slumber. Disillusioned with his job, especially after Jake's death, Prismo secretly creates Fionna and Cake's universe and hides it inside Ice King's mind — which draws the attention of his enemy, Scarab the God Auditor.\nRELATED: Adventure Time: 15 Best Episodes Of The Series Ranked\nThe embodiment of chaos and disorder, GOLB is the Adventure Time franchise's big bad. The cosmic, malevolent entity eventually comes to the Land of Ooo in Adventure Time's final season and is only defeated by Betty, who fuses with it. In Fionna and Cake, GOLBetty plays a small role. For starters, The Lich, a death-dealing cosmic entity and Adventure Time antagonist, now prays to GOLBetty. However, the character's more significant role comes into play when Simon apologizes for allowing Betty to continually sacrifice her happiness and agency for him.\nDescribed by Adventure Time's canon as \"an ancient cosmic being as the manifestation of death,\" The Lich is a continual thorn in Finn and Jake's sides. In Fionna and Cake episode 8, \"Jerry,\" the character comes into play after the trio seeks out BMO's pal, the eponymous Jerry. Ultimately, it's revealed that Jerry is actually the Lich.\nRELATED: Adventure Time: 13 Times The Quirky Cartoon Actually Was Scary\nIf Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake returns for a second season, it might feature more of Beth and Shermy, a somewhat mysterious duo who were first introduced in the Adventure Time series finale. The spiritual stand-ins for Finn and Jake, Beth and Shermy live in an even more dystopian Land of Ooo, roughly 1,000 years after the events of Adventure Time, though Fionna and Cake episode 7 gives viewers a brief glimpse into their plans to take down antagonist called Gibbon. Later, in episode 9, GOLB transports Simon's mind into that of Shermy, allowing Simon to gain some important insight by visiting a library of the future.\nNominated for an LA Press Club National Arts & Entertainment Journalism Award in 2022, Kate is a freelance entertainment writer and editor.

{"title": "10 Unanswered Questions About The World Of John Wick After Its Prequel", "date": "2023-10-09 00:50:27", "text": "The Continental prequel series promised to explain the origins of the famous assassin hotel. It only made the John Wick Universe more mysterious.\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for The Continental!\nFans hoping to learn more about the John Wick Universe might be upset about the amount of unanswered questions surrounding its world-building after The Continental: From the World of John Wick. The prequel series followed a young Winston Scott as he battled nefarious kingpin Cormac (Mel Gibson) for control of the New York Continental Hotel, but even after proving victorious, Winston was just at the beginning of his immersion in the world-building that has made the John Wick films so distinct and beloved. While it was fun to see how he met Charon and why he wore an ascot, fans wanted more from his origin story.\nIf The Continental season 2 happens, it's possible that many of these questions will be answered. After all, there are decades left to Winston's reign as The Manager of the most powerful of all the assassin hotels, and he has only begun to understand the machinations of the High Table and the cohort of assassins he finds himself controlling. There are endless opportunities for more stories in the John Wick Universe after The Continental's ending, so things like the ascension of Laurence Fishburne's Bowery King, and the implications of possessing the coin press might still be answered.\nDuring the events of The Continental Mazie is the Bowery Queen, changing the Bowery King's origins in the John Wick films where he's played by Laurence Fishburne opposite Ian McShane's Winston. McShane is 20 years Fishburne's senior, but in the films it seems Fishburne was aged up so they could be contemporaries. McShane is also 20 years older than Lance Reddick who plays Charon as an adult, so it's possible that if Fishburne's Bowery King is active during The Continental he's a teenager, or Mazie's son, actively trained as her second-in-commad, to inherit the Soup Kitchen and its network of spies if the High Table orders her extermination.\nThe Adjudicator implies that she had something to do with Frankie stealing the coin press, perhaps out of her own mysterious motivations or to get rid of Cormac's means of control. As an Adjudicator, her role is to determine whether matters are being handled in accordance to the High Table's rules and if not, arbitrate and decide punishment. Winston killing her is an act of defiance against an organization he has only begun to understand as someone outside its paradigm, but with the coin in his possession, and the ability to leverage both Cormac's death and a rogue Adjudicator's, he may not face the same consequences.\nAt the end of The Continental, it's clear that the coin press hidden in the Scott family car was transferred to the bank Winston purchased for the Bowery. If the Bowery was able to keep ahold of it for the next 40 years, they would have the means to control the flow of commerce — that is, social relationships — in the criminal underworld. While it's clear that Fishburne's Bowery King is able to operate independently of the High Table, it's not so clear how he accomplishes this, but perhaps because he has the ability to flood the market with gold coins that would render the High Table's control useless.\nIn John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, John Wick travels to Morroco and visits one of the High Table's mints where the distinct gold coins are made and stored before going into circulation among his cohort of assassins. It's possible that Cormac, obtaining so much influence at the New York Continental with the coin press, necessitated such an infrastructure eventually, though it seems like an organization that predates the Roman Empire would have already been in place. Clearly, the High Table needed to take countermeasures against anyone who would seek to duplicate Cormac's plan.\nLike John Wick, Winston also bears the mark of the Ruska Roma as seen in John Wick: Chapter 4, the assassin clan that took in a young John Wick after his parents died. He didn't have it in The Continental, which only told the story of his very beginnings with the High Table and the world of John Wick. After learning the ropes, it's possible that he met The Director (Anjelica Huston) and chose to join the Ruska Roma himself, perhaps even sponsoring John's membership when he found him. It only makes sense that Winston would have pledged himself to a clan in order to avail himself of its resources.\nThere are certain characters in The Continental that don't appear in the John Wick movies, such as KD, Lou, Yen, and much of the core cast. Some of these characters, like gentlemanly sharpshooter Jenkins, had probably passed away by the time John Wick was carrying out his vendetta, but many of the other members of the cast would have been Winston's age, but they're mysteriously absent except for Charon and Uncle Charlie. It's possible that they were killed, ran afoul of the High Table or, if they were fortunate, managed to get out of the lifestyle and not become entangled in its politics.\nThe assassins in The Continental look and behave like supervillains. From The Twins to the assassin with a skeleton face mask, wrist cuffs, and a machete, they're not exactly the sleek, suit-wearing assassins that appear in the John Wick films. There's a scene where Winston gifts the Bowery suits in order for its operatives to infiltrate the hotel, but they stand apart from the crossbow-wielding characters running maniacally down the halls like comic book characters. Perhaps a more unified aesthetic came with time, and Winston had a hand in cultivating the ethos behind \"the suit maketh the man.\"\nViolence occurs on Continental grounds continuously in the John Wick prequel, with only a red light and a voice declaring, \"Incident on Continental Grounds\" to indicate a problem. The fact that Winston steps off the stoop in order to legally shoot The Adjudicator means nothing given the mayhem that occurred inside. The Continental chain has always been a safe haven in the John Wick films, to the point where John's abuse of it ignites an international incident, but the rules are very poorly defined in The Continental show.\nFrankie told Winston that he stole the coin press on behalf of Nihilus/The Nile, but this organization is never mentioned again. It's possible that this is an assassin clan much like the Ruska Roma, or connected in some way, but it's something that's never fleshed out. There are numerous assassin clans in the John Wick movies, and some have intriguing titles while ethnic groups simply bring together others. It's also possible that Frankie was lying, but it seems like something that would become important in The Continental 2.\nLemmy comes across one single operator in The Continental but the John Wick films show dozens of them processing assassination contracts. The most important assassin hotel in the world only has one operator, which implies that the assassination field grew exponentially in the intervening decades, necessitating a huge hiring initiative. But the series doesn't show a sense of scale, or how the High Table is an internationally recognized organization, resulting in The Continental: From the World of John Wick seem very small and self-contained in comparison to the John Wick films.\n"}

Spoilers ahead for Batman #138!If fans didn't think the Dark Knight was losing it, Nightwing's unexpected anti-Batman contingency might make them think otherwise. \"Gotham War\" is intensifying and a vow from the past makes a heartbreaking return.\nIn Batman #138 by Chip Zdarsky and Jorge Jimenez, Bruce has gone beyond the pale during his war with Catwoman. He's kidnapped Jason Todd and conditioned him to experience fear whenever his adrenaline gets too high, rendering him unable to fight. To aid the Bat-Family's search for Red Hood, Nightwing finds Batman's remote system and attempts to access it before he's interrupted by Damian Wayne.\nThankfully, Tim Drake gives Nightwing the time he needs to access Batman's remote system and figure out what he's up to. Unfortunately, it requires an audible passphrase that Bruce entrusted to Dick Grayson: The same vow Nightwing swore the day he pledged to become a crime-fighter. Before Nightwing can finish the phrase, Batman does it for him. He chews his former sidekick out, saying that Dick has forgotten the promise he made long ago. Nightwing, however, says that it's Batman that's gone too far, only to be proven right when Dick discovers the awful conditioning Batman has done to Red Hood.\nThings are rapidly going to hell for Nightwing and the rest of the Bat-Family. Catwoman embarked on a new venture to save Gotham by training low-level criminals to become skilled cat burglars like her, an effort that's seen a sizable reduction in crime. However, Batman vehemently opposed the plan, sending him on a crusade to dismantle Selina's operation. As the war in Gotham intensified, Batman became more brutal taking down Catwoman's operatives and Bruce's closest allies as he's been egged on by his dark backup personality, the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh.\nHearing the vow Nightwing swore so long ago once again is a painful sign of just how messed up things are right now in the Bat-Family. Batman is seriously unwell and doing things that he ordinarily never world. Batman gave Nightwing access to Bruce's remote system because he knew he could trust Dick to stop him if Batman ever went too far. Nightwing takes his vow as seriously as he did the first day he said it and he's willing to do whatever it takes to stop Bruce. Even if that means fracturing his relationship with his old mentor for good.\nWhen Nightwing was brought in as Batman's sidekick, he promised that he would fight against crime and corruption. It's only fitting that the code that allows Dick access to Batman's system is the same vow he said as a child. Right now, something is corrupting the Dark Knight, and Dick has to do whatever he can to stop him. Nightwing and his family are at a major crossroads as Batman starts losing himself to his backup persona. The vow isn't just an apropos passphrase, it's a somber reminder that if Nightwing has to, he has no choice but to take down Batman for his crimes. Batman #138 is on sale now.\n"}

Gino no longer has a job to spend money on Jasmine.\n90 Day Fiancé star Gino Palazzolo doesn’t have a job in season 10, and he had not told Jasmine Pineda about it. Gino and Jasmine were first seen on reality TV show 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5, in which they documented their first in-person meeting. While Gino, 52, was in Panama with Jasmine, 36, she found out he was sending her nude photos to an ex. As per Jasmine, the pictures circulated online and reached her workplace,e leading to her being fired. The American literature teacher then became dependent on Gino for money. On 90 Day Fiancé season 10, Jasmine is coming to Michigan to get married to Gino.\nJasmine has already shown how bad she is at making financial decisions. Before leaving Panama, Gino gave Jasmine money to buy a wedding dress. She, instead, spent it on getting a Brazilian Butt Lift. Jasmine lost weight and felt getting implants was necessary but has not told Gino about it. Jasmine wishes Gino were more appreciative of her getting her nails, hair, and laser hair removal done because she thinks it’s her putting in effort to look pretty. Jasmine thinks Gino is cheap. It will be interesting to see how she reacts after finding out he doesn’t even have a job to spend and can't spend lavishly on her.\nGino was laid off from his job when he was introduced on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5. Gino used to work at Ford as an engineering program manager. He worked there for a year. His last job was at Faurecia in the product development position. Gino’s LinkedIn profile still shows he works there, which could mean it hasn’t been updated yet. Gino has a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. He began working in September 1993 as a product design and release engineer.\nHowever, in 90 Day Fiancé season 10, episode 1, the cameras caught Gino walking out of his office on his last day there. Gino said he had told his boss that he needed to take a leave of absence from his job for a while. Gino had no plans of coming back for a year. Gino wanted to make Jasmine a “priority” and help her get on her feet in Michigan. This included helping Jasmine get her social security number, driver’s license, etc. Gino was worried that Jasmine would return to Panama if she couldn’t adapt to her new American life.\nGino was still helping Jasmine out with her rent and bills. Gino was helping Jasmine “quite a bit financially” after she lost her teaching job. According to Gino, the hard part was that Jasmine had become spoiled, and coming to Michigan would give her a “taste of reality.” Gino was looking to buy a treadmill for Jasmine, but he didn’t go ahead with the purchase because of his “tight budget.” Moreover, Gino had not told Jasmine about him quitting his job.\n“Because Jasmine likes to live the luxury good life, and I don’t have any income or money, oh my god, she’s gonna kill me,” Gino confessed. He felt it was best for him to wait until she could come to the U.S. Gino was going to tell Jasmine about him not having a job when Jasmine came to Michigan. Living together in America will not be a cakewalk for this 90 Day Fiancé season 10 pair.\n90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\nSource: Gino Palazzolo/LinkedIn, Gino Palazzolo/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "The Winter King Season 1 Episode 6 Recap: 7 Biggest Story Reveals", "date": "2023-10-09 02:01:26", "text": "The Winter King episode 6 introduces a major character from the King Arthur legend, while Derfel finally sees his biggest wish come true.\nWarning: Major spoilers for The Winter King season 1 episode 6 below!\nThe Winter King episode 6 features some big changes for Arthur, including the introduction of a key character from the legend. This MGM+ adaptation of the Bernard Cornwell novels offers a gritty reinvention of the King Arthur myth, with a healthy dash of Game of Thrones thrown in. The first five episodes detailed the return of Arthur (Iain De Caestecker) to Britain years after he was banished by his father King Uther (Eddie Marsan), and finding it divided and on the verge of being overtaken by Saxon invaders.\nArthur has no particular desire to become king following Uther's death, he is the only one with a sense of clarity about what must be done to save the country. While Winter King lacks the epic bombast of later Game of Thrones seasons, it's doing a good job of bringing the legend down to Earth. That's not to say the fantasy elements have been completely cast aside, as episode 6 proves. Some big changes are on the horizon for Arthur, and his plan to unite the kingdoms might be finished before it even begins.\nRelated: The Winter King Cast & Character Guide: Who's Who In The MGM+ King Arthur Show\nWinter King episode 5 ended with Arthur fighting in a duel with best friend Owain (Daniel Ings), who had led a raid that ended in the deaths of innocent miners. While Owain tried to weasel out of responsibility, Arthur dubbed him a \"coward\" for his acts and the two had a vicious battle. This ended with Arthur running Owain through with his new sword Excalibur, and the sixth episode picks up in the immediate aftermath of this. Arthur cradles Owain's body, while everyone else in the kingdom stands around in shock.\nRegardless, Merlin (Nathaniel Martello-White) arrives and comforts him, before raising Arthur's arm and declaring him the new ruler of Dumnonia. Before Uther's death, he had named three defenders for his baby heir Mordred: Owain, Bishop Bedwin (Steven Elder) and Gundleus (Simon Merrells). With the latter being a murderous traitor, Owain being killed by Arthur and Mordred obviously being too young to rule, this is why the leadership role falls to Arthur.\nStill in shock over Owain's death, Arthur is later seen in his quarter polishing Excalibur. Merlin comes to speak with him and reveals Arthur didn't find his \"mother's\" sword by accident. In fact, Merlin confirms the sword is indeed the mythical Excalibur, and that he himself got it from a druid in Ireland years earlier. Merlin gave the sword to Arthur's mother, who decided not to give it to her son in case Uther suspected Athur of potential treason. The fact Arthur later found the sword by himself is taken as a good sign by Merlin, as he believes it gave him the strength to win the duel.\nThe first episode of Winter King opened with Arthur saving a young Derfel from a spike pit, where he was placed by Gundleus' people. Naturally, Derfel grew up with serious hero envy for Arthur and dreamed of becoming one of his warriors. The first half of season 1 made it clear Derfel isn't suited for civilian life, so when Arthur is making the trip to Caer Dolforwyn, he stops by Avalon.\nThis is where he makes Derfel's wish come true by asking him to become one of his warriors. After his time with Owain, Derfel has gotten a taste of how the life of a warrior isn't as noble as he once believed, but he still accepts the offer without hesitation. He soon gets a makeover by Arthur's men and joins them on the trip to Gorfydd's (Aneirin Hughes) kingdom.\nGundleus almost rivals Game of Thrones' Ramsay Bolton in terms of vileness, but despite being so hated on the show itself, he's surprisingly lucky. His massacre on Avalon saw him murder a baby, commit sexual assault and kill Queen Norwena (Grace Ackary), but the fact he's the nephew of Gorfydd saw Arthur spare him as a bargaining chip. Gorfydd's past experience with Uther has given him little faith in Dumnonia, but as a sign of respect, Arthur releases his nephew.\nOf course, the priestess Nimue (Ellie James) has more reason than anyone to hate Gundleus and doesn't take the news well. When she and Arthur talk later, Nimue tells him she will still have her revenge on Gundleus, no matter how long she has to wait. For now, at least, the \"vagabond\" king is safe from harm.\nIn addition to releasing Gundleus, Arthur also suggests that he marry Gorfydd's daughter Ceinwyn (Emily John) as a way to unite their kingdoms. While this offer sounded good on paper and Arthur sees how it will only strengthen the bonds between Dumnonia and the other kingdoms, he soon has doubts about going through with it. He and Ceinwyn - who is also nervous about the prospect of marrying a stranger - go through with their betrothal ceremony, but time will tell if he commits to the actual wedding in a future episode. Given that he's now smitten with somebody else, the odds are strong he will back out.\nMerlin's big subplot in Winter King episode 6 involves him having a vision of stumbling upon an icy cave and recovering the Horn of Bran from it. This horn is part of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain, which are mythical items said to be infused with magic properties. They can be anything from a coat to a special weapon, with the Horn Of Bran said to grant whoever drinks from it whatever beverage they desire.\nRelated: The Winter King's Nimue Explained: Arthurian Legend & Lady Of The Lake Mythology\nSo if they wished to consume an endless supply of red wine, the horn would provide it. Merlin believes that if he recovers the horn, he will be able to find the rest of the treasures too. Nimue believes Merlin is setting about this mission to \"appease\" the Gods, but he thinks recovering the items will help them reclaim Britain. Thus, Merlin set out on a quest to the wilderness in the North to hunt for the Horn of Bran, which is said to be the most difficult item to find.\nThe latest episode finally introduces Guinevere (Jordan Alexandra), who is revealed to be Ceinwyn's best friend. The night before he meets Ceinwyn, Arthur and his men rest in a local forest. He goes for a walk and sees Guinevere and her horse from a distance. After a shout out to the Lady of the Lake - a role traditionally taken by Nimue in King Arthur stories - Guinevere speaks to him under the assumption he's just one of Arthur's men. There's clearly an instant attraction, and while she's not impressed when he learns who he really is, she offers a sympathetic ear when he confesses his guilt over Owain's death.\nThe Winter King's version of Guinevere lost her lands in an Irish raid when she was young, and having been raised in Gorfydd's kingdom, is as close to Ceinwyn as a sister. She's a shrewd thinker too, as she reveals in her thoughts about the politics of Arthur marrying Ceinwyn. Having seemingly never read the legends of King Arthur himself, Gorfydd insists that Guinevere accompanies Ceinwyn in her married life. Assuming Arthur does go through with the marriage, the fact he and Guinevere will still be around one another will presumably lead to an affair.\n"}
{"title": "10 Slice Of Life Anime Featuring Criminals", "date": "2023-10-09 02:02:02", "text": "From Spy x Family to The Way of the Househusband, these anime series perfectly mix slice-of-life elements with memorable criminal characters.\nSlice of life anime is usually concerned with grounded and relatable matters, hence the name, but that's exactly what makes these series that feature criminals all the more fun. Whilst it's almost always more high-stakes series that dominate the anime scene, slice-of-life series have been growing ever more prominent in recent years. Series like Spy X Family and My Dress-Up Darling both became surprise hits in 2022, largely because of the slice-of-life elements that made them eminently watchable.\nThe popularity of Spy X Family and its central characters, who harbor some dark and very illegal secrets, might be particularly interesting for anime fans into heist or crime stories too. However, it's far from the only great anime to hilariously combine criminals and everyday life. From shows where the criminals are a source of real drama, like Beastars, to ones where they're the butt of all the jokesm like The Way of the Househusband, there are tons of slice-of-life anime series where criminals play a big part.\nRELATED: 10 Best Anime About Having A Pet\nThough The Yakuza's Guide to Babysitting isn't the first slice-of-life anime to imagine a criminal being forced into a situation where they need to care for a small child, they proved that there was still plenty of humor to be found from the premise last year. Its criminal main character is Tooru Kirishima, a yakuza member feared for his violent nature when enforcing the will of his boss.\nHowever, in this uplifting slice-of-life anime, he's forced to take a more tactful approach when he's suddenly tasked with taking care of the boss's precious daughter. Showing their everyday lives as the two slowly come to understand each other, it's the clash in personalities between the two that's the source of the best comedy and the best heartfelt moments that The Yakuza's Guide to Babysitting has to offer.\nWhilst it's primarily a supernatural action show, there are enough slice-of-life elements in the intriguing Durarara!! to keep fans of the everyday-focused genre interested. Like a regular slice-of-life show, the strength of Durarara!! lies in its characters, which include a mysterious dark figure on a bike, the devious information broker Izaya, and the rough-edged bodyguard Shizuo.\nDurarara!! is a great anime for beginners that weaves multiple plotlines together, including moments that show the everyday lives of its high-schooler main characters as they try to piece together the supernatural events that seem to be occurring in their dangerous part of town. Even they themselves might be more involved in criminal activity than they let on, making the show an intriguing mystery that's worth unwrapping.\nWhilst The Way of the Househusband's central character, Tatsu, seems to have left a life of crime behind, that doesn't mean the series isn't full of current or former Yakuza members getting in the way of his newfound peaceful life as a stay-at-home husband. Once a notorious gangster, Tatsu approaches housework and being a good husband with the same zeal and seriousness as any criminal activity.\nThe Way Of The Househusband is a relatively short and sweet anime series and the animation itself is fairly bare-bones, but for anyone that enjoys the humor of an absurdly rough former Yakuza member dealing with everyday situations like shopping for groceries, the show's compact nature only makes it more of a joy. Funny and unique, the series gets an unbelievable amount of feel-good fun out of its former criminal protagonist.\nMuch like how the game combines ordinary social simulation with supernatural elements, Persona 4 the Animation mixes fun slice-of-life with an absorbing mystery centered on a series of brutal serial killings taking place in the rural town of Inaba. With the help of a strange phenomenon involving a TV channel, the high-schooler protagonists attempt to stop the killings.\nThough the serial killer is largely a background figure, the presence of the hilarious delinquent Kanji Tatsumi, terror of the local police and gangs alike, more than makes up for it. Adapted from the amazing JRPG of the same name, Persona 4 the Animation might not be a match for the game in terms of slice-of-life content or fun action, but that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining in its own right.\nAnother series in the surprisingly flourishing niche of shows where criminals end up taking care of young children, Hinamatsuri is slightly different in that the child in question is far from an ordinary one either. Materializing in a strange metal pod in front of Yakuza member Yoshifumi Nitta, she comes with some strange and dangerous powers that mean looking after her is a lot more fraught than usual.\nWhether she proves a valuable asset to Nitta in his criminal affairs or whether she ends up blowing him up instead, the familial relationship that forms between the two makes up the heart of the show. Despite being an anime with a unique reverse isekai premise, Hinamatsuri thrives on the same everyday wholesomeness that all the best slice-of-life shows have, and just as importantly, it has many laugh-out-loud moments.\nProof that a slice-of-life series can be one of the most popular anime of the year when combined with just enough crime and intrigue to keep action fans happy too, Spy X Family is a comedy like no other. Its central family might seem ordinary, but it was actually put together by international spy Loid Forger and, unbeknownst to him, he might not even be the most dangerous criminal in the group.\nWith his fictional wife, Yor, secretly an underground assassin, and his child, Anya, able to read minds, everyone in the family has their secrets but that doesn't mean they can't share heartwarming moments to rival the best slice-of-life shows. Along with Spy X Family's hilarious side characters, it's a recipe for hilarity and fun like no other and it's no surprise a second season is already on the way this year.\nRELATED: 15 Longest-Running Anime Of All Time\nFor a fresh slice-of-life comedy centered on criminals, Buddy Daddies began airing in January and has already gained fans looking for something to scratch that itch. The series begins with the professional assassins Kazuki Kurusu and Rei Suwa about to pull off an elaborate scheme to kill a mob boss on Christmas Eve, but before it can become a very different kind of show, in wanders a lost four-year-old girl.\nWith their plan foiled, the pair end up taking the energetic Miri home and soon find fatherhood comes naturally to them despite their dangerous careers. Buddy Daddies is fast-paced and the jokes and action might be a little too non-stop for viewers hoping to experience a more laid-back slice-of-life anime. Despite that, the hijinks the pair get into whilst trying to keep the ever-unpredictable Miri safe in a dangerous world make for a great time.\nThough it leans more toward an old-fashioned gag comedy style than a typical slice-of-life format, the hilarious way it shows superheroes and criminal masterminds in the most mundane situations means Tentai Senshi Sunred fits rights into the genre. The show is centered on the daily lives of Sunred, an ally of justice, and General Vamp, head of an evil organization bent on taking over the world.\nWhilst that might make it sound more like high drama, it turns out their everyday lives are as ordinary as everyone else's, with Sunred a lazy gambling addict and Vamp a polite conscientious homemaker who takes good care of his minions. The best slice-of-life anime might have ridiculous premises but Tentai Senshi Sunred has them all beat with a short, punchy format that brings out all the absurd comedy of the contrasting hero and villain pair.\nRELATED: 10 Best Isekai Anime Of All Time According To IMDb\nIf some of the criminals that typically feature in slice-of-life anime aren't dangerous enough, Jormungand steps things up by centering on characters that are actually international criminals, illegally selling weapons whilst trying to avoid the wrath of the CIA. Despite the high stakes involved, Jormungand dwells on the ordinary elements of the life of Jonah, a bodyguard tasked with protecting the gang's leader.\nThat doesn't mean there isn't plenty of violence and action to enjoy in Jormungand too. At its heart, the show is an action series and it's more than satisfying when it comes to well-animated set pieces to set the heart racing. Whilst it might not be a charming low-stakes anime affair that slice-of-life fans often expect, Jormungand is one of the few shows that attempts to seriously portray the everyday lives of criminals, and that gives it a unique appeal.\nSlice-of-life anime series revolving around high-school clubs might be incredibly common, but Beastars is different in that it takes place in a society comprised of anthropomorphic animals where carnivores and herbivores co-exist despite a heavy suspicion of one another. Despite rising tensions, Legoshi finds himself developing a bond with a white rabbit he meets while on lookout for the drama club.\nWhilst Legoshi struggles with his carnivorous nature, the world turns out to be even more violent and twisted than it seems as the Lion Yakuza gang comes to play a major role. Despite that, it's a show that's at its best when showing the mundane lives of its characters as they grow and learn from each other. Featuring one of the best slice-of-life anime protagonists ever in the form of Legoshi, that's no surprise either.\nMORE: 10 Slice-Of-Life Anime That Focus On Clubs\nA freelance list writer for Screen Rant, Jordan Woods has already written well over 300 pieces for the site since he began in 2021.

The Londoner works as an influencer for a living, and here's how she makes money.\n90 Day Fiancé season 10 introduces Sophie Sierra, who works as an influencer for a living. Sophie is a 23-year-old who lives in London, England. Sophie is in love with Rob Warne from Los Angeles. Sophie came across 32-year-old Rob on Instagram. Mixed-race Sophie was following Instagram pages for mixed-race men. He was the only man she followed because she found him cute. Rob usually ignored the women who reached out to him on social media, but he was surprised when he saw the reality TV show star. The couple started talking on DM, where the first thing Rob told Sophie was that if he had a girl like her, he’d stop looking.\nEven if they were from opposite sides of the world, Sophie and Rob felt the connection due to their similar pasts where they faced bullying and racism. After talking for six months, Sophie flew to LA, where she ended up staying with Rob for two months. Sophie put the idea of the K-1 visa in Rob’s head. They got engaged, and now Rob is worried about Sophie not relating to him because of how different their backgrounds are, especially financially. Sophie expects Rob to move out of his studio apartment, which doesn’t even have a bathroom. Rob knows it’s not the ideal place for him to bring Sophie, who he calls a princess.\nSophie does fashion modeling and content creation for work. She refers to them as \"social media things.\" Sophie has listed down some of the benefits of her job. She doesn’t have to stay in one place to do her work. Sophie could be traveling around the world and still making content for her social media profiles. Currently, Sophie has 132k plus followers on Instagram alone. She shares pictures from her travels across the world. In some of her old pictures, Sophie sports dark, brunette hair, making her look quite different from her blonde 90 Day Fiancé season 10 look.\nOne of the perks of her job is that Sophie gets “free clothes.” Sophie can be seen modeling for various fashion brands on her IG page. In fact, most of Sophie’s content is pictures of her in different stylish outfits and showing off her fit physique. An older video on Sophie’s Instagram profile reveals she used to have the username @sophiecheshire and recorded dance videos for her followers to see. Sophie may not have mentioned it on 90 Day Fiancé, but she also makes music. Sophie’s SoundCloud page gives access to her songs, such as “Twilight Zone” and “One Small Step For Man.”\nSophie said her family is wealthy during her debut on the first 90 Day Fiancé season 10 episode. She claimed it was because her granddad is a really hardworking man. She doesn’t know what he “does”; she just knows he makes a lot of money. Sophie has always lived in nice houses. She went to private school and traveled to a lot of places, too. “I’m really lucky for that,” Sophie admitted. She grew up in Spain. Rob mentioned that Sophie has always lived in nice places where she didn’t have to pay rent. She’s even used to maids. Rob wants to bring his “spoiled rich girl” down to Earth to make their marriage work once she moves to the U.S.\n90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\nSource: Sophie Sierra/Instagram, Sophie Sierra/SoundCloud, Sophie Sierra/Instagram, Sophie Sierra/Instagram\n"}

UK native Sophie is going to get married to Los Angeles man Rob Warne.\n90 Day Fiancé season 10 introduces a new cast member named Sophie Sierra, whose past is as interesting as her relationship with Rob Warne. Sierra, a 23-year-old living in Londo,n had been in an online relationship with Rob, 32, from Los Angeles, for six months. The couple decided to take the next step when Sophie moved to the U.S. for two months. She stayed with Rob in his house, which was a stark contrast to where she’d lived all her life. Sophie comes from a wealthy family, even though she may not know what her rich grandpa did for a living all his life.\nThe fact that the reality TV show couple has financial inequalities between them isn’t the only red flag about Sophie and Rob. Sophie had been on a dating app while she was in America, and Rob had also been speaking to another girl online during a rough patch they had. Sophie is also hiding the fact that she’s bisexual from Rob. But the real reason why Sophie and Rob started dating is very special to Sophie. It is because they bonded over everything they’d been through as mixed-race children who faced a lot of pain growing up.\nSophie opened up about her tough experiences in life during her 90 Day Fiancé introduction. Sophie said she was mixed race. Sophie’s dad is Black, while her mom is White. Sophie's mom, Claire, made an appearance in episode 1. Sophie said she's been very close to her mom since she was little because she had no siblings. Sophie moved to England when she was 16 years old, and her mom moved with her. Sophie's mom is not Rob's biggest fan, but she wants her mom to get along with him because they will eventually become a family once Sophie gets married.\nSophie was raised in Spain, where there weren’t any Black people, so she was the only mixed or Black kid in the whole school. Growing up, Sophie was bullied. She did not have any friends at school. Sophie believes that despite going through difficult things, she’s really thankful for them. Sophie says these experiences led her to become the person she is today. Her experiences also led to her meeting the love of her life, Rob.\nBefore she met Rob, Sophie followed several Instagram pages featuring mixed-race men. She saw Rob on one of these pages and followed him because she thought he was cute. Sophie and Rob connected via text messages and FaceTime. Even if they were from opposite sides of the world, and even if she was raised in a “nice area” and he was raised in a “rough area,” Sophie and Rob had very similar childhood experiences. Like Sophie, Rob also never fit in anywhere and was bullied. Despite growing up in different ways, the 90 Day Fiancé couple found a connection that they hadn’t found with anyone else.\n90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\nSource: 90 Day Fiancé/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "The Winter King's 13 Treasures Of Britain Explained (Including Horn Of Bran)", "date": "2023-10-09 02:11:27", "text": "The Winter King episode 6 sees Merlin set out to recover the Horn of Bran, one of the mythical Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain.\nWarning: Major spoilers for The Winter King season 1 episode 6 below!\nThe Winter King's latest episode finds Merlin having a vision of the Horn of Bran, one of the mythical thirteen treasures of Britain. Bernard Cornwell's Warlord Chronicles novel trilogy remixed the legend of King Arthur with some historical fact and presented a largely grounded take on the myth. That's not to say the bolly abandoned the fantasy elements, as Merlin still played a major role. The Winter King show cast Nathaniel Martello-White as Merlin, where he acts as a mentor to Arthur (Iain De Caestecker) while often disagreeing with his decisions.\nFor the first half of season 1, magic hasn't played much of a role, though Merlin's \"Death of Britain\" visions certainly suggested bad things to come. The sixth episode digs a little deeper into Merlin's abilities, as he decides to set out on an adventure to retrieve an important object. He also confirms to Arthur that his new sword is Excalibur and that Merlin himself brought it over from Ireland years before; the fact it found its way into Arthur's hands makes it seem like the Gods really wanted him to have it.\nRelated: Who The Saxons Are In The Winter King Season 1: Real History & Arthurian Enemies Explained\nMerlin has been lacking in subplots for much of Winter King season 1, aside from an ill-advised attempt to kidnap baby Mordred. The heir to the throne of Dumnonia is, according to Merlin's visions, destined to become a bloodthirsty tyrant who will lead to the end of Britain. Merlin thus tried to take Mordred and planned to drop him off at a village, where he would be raised with no idea of his royal heritage. Arthur foiled this plan, but episode 6 gives Merlin a new task. He has a vision of entering a snowy cave, where he discovers the Horn of Bran.\nThis is said to be one of the fabled Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain, which are a series of magical items found in Welsh manuscripts that date back to the 15th Century. The Horn of Brân Galed from the North is said to be filled with whatever drink a person desires; so if they want an endless supply of wine, the horn will provide it. Merlin sets out on a quest to the wilderness in the North to recover the horn and believes that if he recovers it, he can find the other treasures too.\nThe manuscripts always state that there are thirteen treasures of Britain, though some texts change what those items are. Some even list Arthur's sword Excalibur among those magical objects. Here are the rest of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain:\nWhite-Hilt, the Sword of Rhydderch Hael the Generous - It's said that if a well-born man draws this sword, it would ignite in flame. Rhydderch was one of the Three Generous Men of Britain and was always willing to hand the sword over to those who asked. However, nobody ever asked when they learned what it did.\nThe Hamper of Gwyddno Long-Shank - A hamper that is said to multiply the food placed into it a hundredfold.\nThe Chariot of Morgan Mwynfawr (AKA the Chariot of Morgan the Wealthy) - A special chariot that will take someone wherever they wish to go really quickly.\nThe Halter of Clydno Eiddy - Also known as The Handy Halter, this will summon whatever horse a person wishes for in the halter.\nThe Knife of Llawfrodedd the Horseman - A knife that is said to serve up to 24 men at a table.\nThe Cauldron of Dyrnwch the Giant - A cauldron that distinguishes the brave from the cowardly. So if a brave man puts meat in the caldron, it will boil fast. However, if a so-called coward puts meat in, it wouldn't boil at all.\nThe Whetstone of Tudwal Tudglyd - Once again, an object to separate the strong from the weak. If a brave warrior sharpened their sword on this whetstone it would kill anyone it drew blood from; if a coward did the sharpening, their sword wouldn't even draw blood.\nThe Coat of Padarn Beisrudd - Yet another item that discriminates against cowards. This coat will fit those who are brave, but it won't fit weaklings.\nThe Crock and Dish of Rhygenydd Ysgolhaig - Similar to the Horn of Bran, this will serve whatever food a person desires.\nChessboard of Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio - A large golden chessboard where if the pieces (which are made of silver and crystal) are set up right, they'll play themselves.\nThe Mantle of Arthur in Cornwall - This renders anybody under it invisible, but it allows them to see out.\nThe Stone and Ring of Eluned the Fortunate - A ring that Merlin already seems to possess in Winter King. Like the aforementioned Mantle of Arthur, this renders the wearer invisible.\nMerlin believes that if he retrieves the Horn of Bran - which Nimue (Ellie James) claims is the most difficult item to find - then the others will soon follow. If they complete this sidequest in The Winter King, Merlin claims the objects will give them back the power to reclaim Britain. That might be wishful thinking on his part, but it'll be interesting to see what happens if he can actually recover them all.\n"}

Her son, Juance, was introduced in episode 1.\n90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda has kept a lot of secrets from her fans, including information about her two sons, which she’s finally revealing in season 10. Jasmine, from Panama City, became a famous face in the world of reality TV since her 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days debut. Jasmine, 36, and her partner, Gino Palazzolo, 53, struggled to find a balance in their relationship while dealing with issues such as jealousy, anger, and insecurity. Following their engagement and almost two years of waiting, Jasmine got a K-1 visa to move to Michigan and get married.\nJasmine has two sons with her ex-husband. She spoke about them during her introduction in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5. Jasmine had said her oldest son lived with her ex-husband and the youngest with her. Jasmine’s younger son had a very hard time during the pandemic with the city being under lockdown. Jasmine and her mother, Cecelia, decided to take him to stay with her mom in the countryside. However, this was a temporary arrangement.\nJasmine revealed the names of her sons in her 90 Day Fiancé season 10 debut episode. Juance accompanied his grandmother and aunt Liz to Jasmine’s apartment as his mom packed her bags to move to America. “The eldest is Juance,” Jasmine said. She confessed that the connection she has with Juance is “out of this world.” She loves taking him for ice cream and fast food, which Juance isn't allowed when he's with his dad. Jasmine waited for a year after she first met Gino to introduce him to her kids. “Because I wanted to make sure it was something long-lasting. Any mother would understand that,” Jasmine explained.\nJasmine’s sons got along very well with Gino despite them speaking different languages. Watching them interact was a “beautiful moment” for Jasmine that she would never forget. When fans used to ask Jasmine why she never posted her sons’ pictures on social media, Jasmine said it was because she agreed with their father to not share information about them online. Jasmine said her ex-husband is a doctor and also a lawyer. However, Jasmine’s ex-husband is now fine with the boys going with Jasmine to the U.S.\nJasmine had not told Juance that she was leaving Panama. She had told him that she was getting a visa, but not that it was approved, and moving to the U.S. Even if her kids have a comfortable life in Panama, it’s Jasmine and Gino’s plan to bring them to the U.S. as soon as possible. Jasmine told Juance about her moving with great difficulty during the 90 Day Fiancé premiere. She told him he would be staying with his dad, his aunt, and grandma until Jasmine could figure out where they would live and which school he would attend. “Juance really wants to move to America,” Jasmine laughed.\nShe thinks it was Gino who put the idea in Juance’s mind. No child would want to be separated from their mother, even if it was temporary. As of now, Jasmine has not revealed if she’s managed to bring the kids to the U.S. Jasmine is there now, and is possibly already married to Gino since she came to the U.S. more than three months ago. Jasmine may bring Juance and JC to live with her and Gino and won’t hesitate to share the happy news with her followers once it happens.\n90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\n"}

At home, Nicole is a homebody who works as a hairstylist, makeup artist, and beauty consultant. On the reality TV show, Nikki is in a relationship with her boyfriend, Justin, from Moldova.\nNikki and Justin’s relationship is a unique one because she first met Justin 17 years ago in his country. The personal trainer proposed to Nikki, and she brought him to the U.S. on a K-1 visa. However, two weeks later, Nikki and Justin started facing relationship problems.

{"title": "&quot;Who Came Back?!&quot; Massive Walking Dead Scene Teases Rick Grimes' Fate After Season 11", "date": "2023-10-09 02:25:29", "text": "A shocking exchange in The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5 seemingly teases a huge development related to Rick Grimes' fate in the franchise.\nWarning: Spoilers for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5\nA surprise scene in The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5 seemingly lays the groundwork for Rick Grimes to re-enter the picture. Of course, it’s no secret that the original Walking Dead hero is on his way back to the franchise. But details of his return for The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live – and if he’ll ever reunite with his friends – remain shrouded in mystery.\nDue to plans for The Ones Who Live, Rick meeting with at least one Walking Dead character (Michonne) is assured at this point. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said for everyone else. However, it’s always made sense that the franchise would want to work its way toward Rick crossing paths with his children, and perhaps old allies like Daryl and Carol as well. Thus far, Daryl has been on a fruitless mission to find Rick, but whether or not it would ever amount to anything was unclear. An unexpected development in this storyline appears to have finally presented itself in The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5.\nThe message was distorted by static, but Carol could be heard telling Carol that someone “came back.” Purposely, the show ensured that the name was inaudible and ended their conservation, preventing Daryl from getting an answer when he asked, “who came back?” The episode never provided any possible explanations to the tease, but it’s obvious who viewers are meant to suspect. Of the characters absent from Alexandria, none stand out more than Rick Grimes. After all, Daryl spent much of his time looking for him after the explosion on the bridge and promised Judith he’d bring her father back.\nInterestingly, Rick isn’t the only candidate for this tease. Alternatively, Carol could mean Michonne, who left to find him in season 10. It’s not impossible that Michonne paid a visit to Alexandria before the events of their shared spinoff, The One Who Live. She’s already been away a while, and could decide to check in on her kids before heading back out to complete her mission to find Rick.\nA third option would be Heath, a confirmed victim of the CRM and a character who disappeared in season 7. Heath was never around long enough for his return to matter that much to Daryl, but his connection to the CRM – and by extension, Rick Grimes – would make his arrival in Alexandria something worth bringing up to Daryl. Lastly, there’s Fear the Walking Dead's Morgan, who may very well be going back to Alexandria now that he’s looking for Rick. However, he doesn’t have that deep of a history with Daryl, which is why a reference to him would seem insignificant.\nFurther reinforcing the idea that Rick’s return may have happened off-screen is Carol’s odd behavior during her talk with Daryl. Carol’s evasiveness made it clear that something was going on back at Alexandria that she felt reluctant to mention. If she didn’t want to talk about it, that could be a sign that it involves news that would alarm or distract Daryl. Rick suddenly coming back after being gone for more than a decade would certainly qualify. The same would be true if it’s Michonne that returned, as that too would connect with Rick’s Walking Dead story in some way. Either way, chances are things aren’t as “quiet” in Alexandria as Carol suggests.\nA big part of what made Daryl Dixon episode 5’s big tease such a shocking moment is the idea that Rick Grimes is expected to be busy dealing with the CRM in The Ones Who Live. In spite of that, The Walking Dead is hinting that Rick will come home regardless. Rick wanting to reach Alexandria does make sense, considering that he has family and friends there. Getting back there may have been his goal all along, but the CRM has been standing in the way. That was made evident when he was shown failing to escape from their clutches in The Walking Dead series finale.\nWhile seeing his loved ones may be the main point of going back, it’s not the only motivation he might have. A more pressing reason may be the threat posed by the CRM. It would be out of character for Rick to bring them into his fight and put them in harm’s way, but that’s a risk Rick might take if Alexandria is already on their radar. The CRM has potential Lance Hornsby connections, so there’s at least a chance the CRM has targeted them over what happened to Lance in season 11. If so, Rick could be trying to warn them of the danger that’s about to arrive on their doorstep.\nAs exciting as it would be for Rick to reunite with so many of his friends from The Walking Dead, doing so would further muddle the Walking Dead timeline. Firstly, The Walking Dead: Dead City takes place after the events of Daryl Dixon, meaning that any monumental developments should have been addressed in Maggie and Negan’s spinoff. Naturally, Rick coming back would be too big of an event to ignore; it’s hard to imagine the former leader of the core group coming back into the fold not being referenced by either Negan or Maggie. This also applies to whatever problem Carol was hinting at in episode 5.\nClearly, Daryl Dixon’s “who came back?” exchange with Carol is instrumental to what comes next for The Walking Dead franchise, whether it specifically refers to Rick Grimes or not. Presumably, the Daryl Dixon season finale will hinge on Daryl’s ongoing struggles in France, hence why it’s probably not going to offer any explanation as to who Carol meant. With this in mind, there’s little doubt that the purpose of this scene was to build a new mystery for the franchise to solve sometime after season 1. And since it pertains directly to the people of Alexandria, it implies the return of more familiar faces.\nThis prospect supports mounting theories of a massive Walking Dead crossover. Morgan’s search for Rick and Daryl’s own intention to find him both build evidence for the idea that The Walking Dead plans to unite its characters once more. A new mystery unfolding in place that isn’t the current setting of a spinoff only strengthens that possibility. It could be that after The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon, The Ones Who Live, and Dead City, they’ll all come together to fight the CRM in an epic war to end the franchise.\nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon releases new episodes on Sundays on AMC.\n"}
{"title": "Daryl Dixon Now Knows The 2 Biggest Secrets In The Walking Dead", "date": "2023-10-09 02:25:29", "text": "Daryl Dixon began his French spinoff adventure as a humble traveler, but now knows the two biggest secrets in the entire Walking Dead universe.\nWarning: spoilers ahead for Daryl Dixon episode 5.\nDaryl Dixon has officially made its title character privy to the two best-kept, lore-shattering secrets in AMC's entire The Walking Dead franchise. Daryl Dixon's French vacation may have happened entirely by accident, but Norman Reedus' rugged hero has gained a great deal during his time there, making friends with religious rebels, landing himself an adopted son, and enjoying Mork & Mindy reruns. Daryl Dixon even found a new signature weapon to replace his crossbow. More valuable than all of the above, however, Daryl has gained two vital pieces of knowledge that will change his understanding of the zombie outbreak forever.\nAs revealed in The Walking Dead: World Beyond's ending, France is the most important country in the franchise. Not only is France where the zombie outbreak allegedly started, but the land famous for its \"246 varieties of cheese\" seemingly has just as many zombie variants, including the lethal Burner zombies Daryl encountered in episode 1. Because of the country's immense narrative importance, setting Daryl Dixon in France always looked like a calculated move on AMC's part. That proves to be the case in Daryl Dixon episode 5, \"Deux Amours,\" which confirms Daryl knows two big secrets that he didn't before.\nThe Walking Dead: World Beyond attributed the zombie outbreak to a group of French scientists led by the enigmatic \"Primrose Team,\" members of which have since been imprisoned or executed. During Genet's speech in Daryl Dixon episode 5, the villain alludes toward this, proclaiming, \"Finally, out of greed and hubris, they [the ruling elite] unleashed this plague upon the world... They gave us this disease... Their disease can be our cure.\" Genet may not mention specific names, but her rant does explicitly mention both how the virus started in France, and that it was human-made. She also heavily implies that the scientists responsible were funded by wealthy sponsors, which seems logical enough.\nAs Genet spouts this vitriolic exposition, Daryl watches on from the gladiatorial pit below. The room's PA system ensures Daryl has no choice but to hear Genet's words, and the revelations contained within should be completely new to his naive ears. Throughout The Walking Dead's 11 seasons, Rick Grimes and his merry band of survivors remained completely ignorant to how the zombie outbreak began. Even a CDC encounter with Dr. Jenner shed no light on The Walking Dead's virus origin, with the French scientists evidently keeping their culpability hidden from international colleagues.\nDaryl Dixon episode 5 is, therefore, the first time Daryl would have heard any details regarding the zombie virus being created in a French lab, making him one of precious few Walking Dead characters to learn the truth. As Genet's prisoner, Daryl doesn't exactly have time to digest this information - especially since he's about to find himself on the wrong side of an undead gladiatorial showdown. Once the dust settles, however, the massive significance of Genet's speech about the zombie virus may finally register in Daryl Dixon's mind.\nHow The Walking Dead's zombie virus started is not the only secret Daryl has learned since departing U.S. shores. Following his capture in Maine, Daryl wound up as a prisoner on Genet's floating lab. Not only did Daryl encounter a super-fast climber during his escape attempt, but he undoubtedly would have noticed the various zombie experiments taking place aboard the vessel. While Daryl Dixon has never claimed to be as erudite as Eugene or as cunning as Carol, he can surely put these pieces together and figure out that Genet is somehow engineering zombie variants.\nDaryl's experience in France has only confirmed this truth further. As a combatant in Genet's arena at the end of episode 5, Daryl Dixon watches on as one of her zombie subjects is injected with a bright green substance, then suddenly bursts forward at great speed. Zombie variants are not, in themselves, new to Daryl. Rick's group encountered them briefly during The Walking Dead season 1, then more prominently in season 11. Nobody in the main show, however, knew where these super-zombies came from, resulting in wild speculation from Aaron and a humble \"what the f**k...?\" from Negan.\nWhile the finer details of zombie variants are yet to be revealed, Daryl has at least uncovered their connection to Genet's Pouvoir des Vivants. He has also personally witnessed a drug that, upon being administered to a member of the undead community, turns a zombie into a raging weapon, rather than just a lumbering nuisance. Combined with the details Genet reveals about the outbreak, Daryl is now significantly wiser than he was at the end of The Walking Dead season 11.\nDaryl's newfound insight into The Walking Dead's zombie lore has massive implications for the wider franchise. Assuming Daryl eventually makes contact with the Commonwealth and his old pals, he can pass the information on. That would mean all major characters from The Walking Dead would finally know how the outbreak began, more or less, as well as why some zombies have leveled-up. These tidbits would then spread across the United States, illuminating the apocalypse for those who survived long enough to find out.\nDaryl being the bearer of zombie news was actually set up by The Walking Dead's series finale. Maggie sent Daryl away to \"find out about\" the wider post-outbreak situation, but, as confirmed by Daryl himself in Daryl Dixon episode 1, all he found was trouble. Had Daryl not been captured by Pouvoir des Vivants in Maine, he would have returned to the Commonwealth having failed in his mission spectacularly. Thanks to his French detour, Daryl will now come home carrying two massive secrets to share with Maggie and his old friends.\nDaryl Dixon continues Sunday on AMC.\n"}

A look at how she makes a living.\n90 Day Fiancé star Ashley Michelle is a witch for a living, but there’s more to her job than just tarot reading. Ashley is from Rochester, New York. She’s 33 years old. Ashley met her partner Manuel in Ecuador on New Year’s Eve 10 years ago. Manuel, 35, is a construction worker. He had asked Ashley to dance, and Ashley couldn’t resist Manuel’s bouncy hair and beautiful skin. She and Manuel were engaged within a week of meeting. Their long-distance relationship didn’t last, however, leading to their breakup. After spending seven years apart, Ashley and Manuel reconnected. He’s now coming to the U.S. to get married to Ashley.\nAshley’s spirituality guides every aspect of her life. The reality TV show newbie said she was a witch during the premiere episode. She is a tarot reader and an astrologer as well. Ashley also specializes in shadow work. As per Ashley, people are still afraid of the word witch. She claims it’s because they have been conditioned to believe that a witch is someone who has a crooked nose and crystal ball while throwing hexes at people. That’s not anything that Ashley does. Ashley’s family was religious when she was growing up, yet she became the “crazy one” because of her rebellious nature and soon began dabbling into the occult.\nOn Instagram, Ashley calls herself a “Spiritual Guide and Brand Alchemist.” Ashley has listed the services she offers to her interested clients in the link in her bio. One of them is called “SIREN.” It stands for “Sacred Initiation for Rebel Entrepreneurial Newbies.” It is a six-month group coaching business. It caters to those who want to be healers and spiritual practitioners or have “gifts to share with the world.” Ashley’s customers are those who have felt a “soul calling” and want to help others. She helps them get their branding and marketing right so they can find their “unique Siren song” to launch and grow their personal brand.\nIt’s not uncommon for 90 Day Fiancé cast members to have their own Cameo accounts. But Ashley had hers even before she became a reality TV star. One can book a personal video with Ashley for US $15. She can answer questions, give some advice and pep talk, or even roast someone when she’s not creating a birthday wish for her client. Ashley can also do a tarot card reading or give shutouts to small or big businesses if that’s the client’s requirement.\nAshley has her own podcast called “The Goddess Complex.” She describes it as an “eclectic podcast” which can cover “many layers of spiritual development from starseeds & rituals to running an online biz & moon magick.” Ashley’s podcast covers all the topics involved with spirituality. Ashley has released quite a few episodes so far with titles such as “I’ve Been Keeping Something From You” and \"Self Sabotage In Business.\"\n90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\nSource: Ashley Michelle/Instagram, Ashley Michelle/Instagram, Ashley Michelle/Instagram, Siren, Cameo, The Goddess Complex\n"}
{"title": "How Daryl Dixon Got To France In The Walking Dead Revealed", "date": "2023-10-09 02:30:27", "text": "Daryl Dixon's Walking Dead spinoff takes place in France, but the mystery of how he got there is stretched across the spinoff's entire debut season.\nWarning: spoilers ahead for Daryl Dixon season 1.\nCompletely removing itself from AMC's wider The Walking Dead franchise, Daryl Dixon takes place primarily in France, but how Norman Reedus' titular protagonist traveled from the United States to Europe is a long and winding mystery. While The Walking Dead is hardly new to the spinoff game, Daryl Dixon represents the franchise's biggest paradigm shift yet, relocating the zombie horror action from U.S. shores to France. Without the benefit of commercial flights, explaining this journey after The Walking Dead's zombie virus ravaged civilization was always going to be a complex matter, and while Daryl Dixon does address the question fully, it does so across the entirety of its debut season.\nAdding to the mystery, Daryl Dixon season 1 recounts the tale of how Daryl reached France in non-chronological order. Episodes 1-4 fill in small details, before Daryl Dixon episode 5, \"Deux Amours,\" traces right back to the start, incorporating flashbacks to when Daryl was still on home soil. Finally, the sequence of events that led Monsieur Dixon to a beach near Marseille is now clear.\nRelated: The Walking Dead's Daryl Dixon Cast & Character Guide\nIn The Walking Dead season 11's ending, Maggie sent Daryl away to discover more about the post-apocalyptic world, and that epic trip takes him all the way to the distant realm of Maine. Requiring bike fuel, Daryl accepts a deal from a stranger - gather zombies in exchange for gasoline. That a skeptical, cynical, lone wolf like Daryl would trust this man's proposal suggests operations like this have become common in The Walking Dead's world since the main TV show ended. Unfortunately for Daryl, this trade racket is actually run by Pouvoir des Vivants - a villainous group based in France and led by Genet.\nRelated: Daryl Dixon's New Walking Dead Spinoff Villains ExplainedThe zombies Daryl and his American friends round up are to be shipped off and used in Genet's zombie variant experiments. Nevertheless, the deal Daryl makes to work in exchange for gasoline is completely genuine. Had Daryl simply gathered the zombies as requested and taken his reward, he would have soon been enjoying Halloween treats in the Commonwealth, and the entire Daryl Dixon spinoff story could have been averted.\nAlas, Daryl breaks the rules by punching a fellow worker after realizing the man was responsible for murdering a young boy who was also part of their group. Both men are punished, with Genet's soldiers taking them prisoner, moving them to her offshore lab, and shoving them in a cell to be used for zombie food. This is evidently the fate that befalls anyone who breaks the rules while working for gasoline. Daryl loses his precious crossbow during the capture.\nDaryl Dixon avoids explaining the exact mechanics of what Genet is doing on the sea-faring vessel Daryl and his fellow prisoner get taken to, but episode 5's flashback leaves no doubt that Pouvoir des Vivants is using the boat as a lab to delve deeper into the arcane science of zombie variants. Not only does Daryl encounter a fast Climber zombie during his escape, but the apparatus aboard the ship is almost identical to the equipment spotted at Genet's castle in Daryl Dixon episode 3. In both scenes, a zombie head in a jar of fluid is hooked up to some unknown machinery. Likewise, the same unidentified scientist appears in both locations.\nRelated: All 5 Powers The Walking Dead's New Zombies HaveOne aspect of these experiments apparently involves controlling how much flesh a zombie consumes. Two cages of undead are glimpsed during Daryl Dixon episode 5's flashbacks - likely the same zombies Daryl and his cohorts were rounding up back in Maine. One cage is marked \"feed,\" while the other reads \"fast.\" Genet's prisoners are used for the former group, with an unlucky captive thrown into the rotting crowd at regular intervals.\nThanks to a successful \"play dead\" ruse and some classic Daryl Dixon head-bashing, Daryl and his fellow captive successfully break free, causing enough havoc among the ship's guards to reach a lifeboat. This small vessel is the same boat Daryl can be seen floating upon in Daryl Dixon's very first scene, face-down with a barely-conscious protagonist spread on top. Given how Daryl's friend accidentally drops the boat into the water rather than lowering it gently, and how Daryl then flings himself overboard to avoid an oncoming variant, it's possible that Daryl simply drags himself onto the upturned raft and stays that way for the entire trip.\nDaryl Dixon never reveals exactly where Genet's floating laboratory is located. Given that Daryl gets captured in Maine and Genet is based in Paris, the most likely guess is somewhere in the Atlantic between the United States and France. Daryl eventually washes south, then east, landing in the region of Marseille. This indicates that he must float past Portugal, Spain and Gibraltar, then across the Balearic Sea, before landing in southern France.\nTaking over France is a full-time job, and this raises questions over why Genet expends such great effort toward recapturing Daryl Dixon. Losing a prisoner is one thing, but Genet makes apprehending this rogue American a top priority, despite his initial crime being incredibly minor. Genet's science project can help to explain her seemingly disproportionate interest in a single prisoner. Daryl has seen the lab-boat, the experiments, the scientist involved, and knows the sinister truth behind why American survivors on the East Coast are being invited to hunt zombies in exchange for fuel. Genet simply cannot afford for Daryl to be roaming around freely.\nThe other reason concerns Daryl's messy escape. During the course of his jailbreak, Daryl all but decimates Genet's operation aboard the boat, letting her zombies out of their cages, killing multiple guards, spoiling her test subjects, and accidentally causing one or two small fires. As alluded to through Daryl Dixon's various nods to Charles de Gaulle, Genet perceives herself as the de facto ruler of France, and seeks to unite the country's survivors behind her flag. During her speech in Daryl Dixon episode 5, Genet draws a clear line between friends and enemies, so she likely views Daryl going unpunished as a show of weakness that would weaken her claim as leader.\nDaryl Dixon continues Sunday on AMC.\n"}

Episode 5 of the series ended with Daryl facing off against a stronger, faster zombie in a Pouvoir arena. The antagonistic group's leader, Genet, also plans to make Laurent support the Pouvoir to bring the Union of Hope under her control.\nNow, The Walking Dead (via WotNot) has released a trailer for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 6, revealing what to anticipate in the season finale.\nThe trailer reveals Daryl, Laurent, and Isabelle will be reunited following Daryl's escape from the fast zombie he's been forced to fight. As the group makes one last push for the Nest, Genet sends Codron after him, hoping he will finally enact his revenge after Daryl killed his brother.\nNow that it's confirmed Daryl will escape from the clutches of the Pouvoir, it appears he might make it to the Nest with Isabelle and Laurent. Given how important Laurent is for the Union of Hope, though, it's unclear whether he will continue to accompany Daryl on his future journey. This is especially because Daryl is still focused on getting home, despite forming a strong bond with Isabelle and Laurent on their way to the Nest.\nWhat's waiting for Daryl at home is currently unknown, though, given the mystery surrounding his latest conversation with Carol. A talk between the two in episode 5 revealed someone has returned to the Virginia communities, though Daryl is unable to discern who it is. This will likely be addressed in The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 2, which will seemingly see Carol cross the Atlantic to join Daryl in France.\nBecause of his future reunion with Carol - and the namesake of the show - it seems The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 1 finale won't show Codron get his revenge against Daryl. However, that doesn't mean Genet's loyal servant won't hurt someone else in Daryl's group that he's grown attached to. Just how much more suffering Daryl, Isabelle, and Laurent will face before arriving at the Nest will be clear once the finale airs next Sunday on AMC.\nSource: The Walking Dead (via WotNot)\n"}

Nikki is a 47-year-old recording artist known as Nikki Exotika from Hoboken, New Jersey. When she’s not performing, Nikki sheds her diva alter ego to become a homebody who works as a hairstylist, makeup artist, and beauty consultant. Nikki is a trans woman who’s done “every kind of plastic surgery” from head to toe. Nikki met Justin in the most unexpected way. 17 years ago, Nikki used to date a Russian man who was deported from the U.S. after committing a crime.\nReality TV show star Nikki’s ex-boyfriend got deported to Chişinău, Moldova, where Nikki flew to meet him. The man had a different girlfriend there. Nikki rebounded by finding Justin, who was then named “Igor” on a website in Moldova. She renamed “Igor” Justin because of his resemblance to Justin Timberlake. Justin proposed to Nikki on her fourth visit to Moldova. Justin’s K-1 visa was approved. He moved to the U.S. to get married to Nikki.\nTwo weeks after Justin came to the U.S. for the first time, the couple “had some issues” that couldn’t be resolved. Justin was being lazy. He never helped Nikki out with the housework. He expected Nikki to cook and clean for him apart from her working to make money for them. They had a lot of arguments, and during one such quarrel, Nikki told him, “Yeah, well, I have a secret to tell you, I used to be a man.” It had been two years since Justin and Nikki had begun dating.\nNikki was about 20 years old when she had her sex change operation. Nikki finally felt like the woman she wanted to be, she was “reborn again.” Nikki was living her life in “stealth.” It meant that she didn’t tell people she was born a man. She was still very closed off when discussing her sexuality. She never had any trans or gay friends. She wanted some time to find herself. Justin was “freaked” out when he found out the truth about Nikki from her own mouth. “He was in shock,” Nikki revealed.\nJustin fled from the U.S. back to Moldova, where he was depressed for a “really long time.” Nikki and Justin stayed in contact, but they started talking again two years ago when they were both single. Nikki thought of giving their relationship a second chance. The 90 Day Fiancé cast member booked a Mexico vacation three months later so they could connect all over again. This is when Justin told Nikki that she was the love of his life and proposed to her. Nikki then applied for the K-1 visa for the second time.\n90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\nSource: Nikki Sanders/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "Doctor Who's Classic Companion Reveals Why Ncuti Gatwa's Era Is Important", "date": "2023-10-09 02:42:48", "text": "Former Doctor Who star Sophie Aldred explains why incoming Doctor Ncuti Gatwa's casting is important to the show, citing a sweet personal story.\nSeventh Doctor companion actor Sophie Aldred explains why Ncuti Gatwa's upcoming Doctor Who era is significant. The Sex Education star will take the keys to the TARDIS in the show's 60th anniversary celebrations before going on to lead his first seasonal special during the holidays. Gatwa's first full season will be Doctor Who season 14, and it will air in 2024.\nSpeaking to RadioTimes ahead of Doctor Who's 60th anniversary, Aldred revealed that Gatwa's casting on the show has already left a profound impact on her. The Seventh Doctor era star explained that her own son expressed interest in watching the series following Gatwa's casting announcement, showing how the actor has already drawn in a new generation of fans. Check out Aldred's full answer below:\n\"He's gonna be such a brilliant Doctor. He's just got everything, he's just amazing. And also, when it was announced that he was going to be the new Doctor, my son, who's gay and a drag queen, came running downstairs and said, 'Mum, I'm going to start watching Doctor Who now,' because he's not watched it, he's not been that fussed.\n\"And I just think it's brilliant, all these amazing casting choices that Russell T Davies is making. So, I think we're just gonna have a whole new generation and a whole new fanbase for Doctor Who, which is very, very exciting. So, yeah, I'm thrilled to see how it's gonna go.\"\nWhile Gatwa's new era of Doctor Who is appealing to established viewers due to the returns of celebrated former creatives, it is undeniable that it is also opening the door for newcomers. With his award-winning role as Eric Effiong in Sex Education and his appearance in the summer box office hit Barbie, Gatwa is a rising star who has already created anticipation for his Fifteenth Doctor. Furthermore, Gatwa's casting marks a significant moment in Doctor Who history, as he becomes the first Black actor to lead the series.\nDoctor Who season 14 has also attracted attention for its potential handling of queer characters and topics. Davies' previous work both within Doctor Who and beyond have featured topics surrounding the LGBTQIA+ community, and Gatwa himself came out publicly as queer in an interview this year. It is also believed trans Heartstopper star Yasmin Finney will appear in season 14, reprising her role of Rose Temple-Noble from the show's 60th anniversary. With members of the LGBTQIA+ community at the forefront of Doctor Who both behind and in front of the camera, the show will hopefully feature a welcoming and inclusive world of adventures going forward.\nBetween eye-catching costumes, an all-star line-up of guest appearances, and a celebrated actor leading the show, the future of Doctor Who is incredibly bright and already receiving much attention. Aldred's son's reaction is one shared by many, who for the first time could see an accessible point to jump into the series. With viewers both new and old eager to jump into the Time Vortex alongside Gatwa's new Doctor, the actor's first adventure is sure to be one of 2023's most highly anticipated TV moments.\nSource: RadioTimes\n"}

Although the development and cancelation of a Jabba movie has been known history for quite some time, it's only recently that Del Toro's involvement has been revealed. Now, the visionary director has confirmed that he did indeed work on a movie starring the galaxy's most infamous crime lord, providing some compelling insight into what the film could have looked like.\nThe news of a Jabba the Hutt movie was confirmed in 2017, though it wasn't long before it was canceled. With Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm and the Star Wars IP only being a few years old at the time, many of their movie ideas never left the development stage. However, a Jabba the Hutt movie from Guillermo del Toro would have certainly been very dynamic and intriguing. Confirming his involvement, you can see Del Toro's interview with Collider below where he shares that his Star Wars movie would have been about \"The Rise and Fall of Jabba the Hutt\":\nAccording to Del Toro, it certainly seems as though he and his collaborators had a large amount of the movie planned out: “We designed a great world and great stuff. We learned. So, you can never be ungrateful with life. Whatever life sends you, there’s something to learn from it.\" While Del Toro seems to have made his peace with the movie's cancelation, it's possible scripts were written and concept art created before the movie was axed.\nRelated: How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order\nBy all accounts, \"The Rise and Fall of Jabba the Hutt\" does sound fascinating. Having lived to be nearly 600 years old before his demise in Return of the Jedi, there would be so much ground to cover regarding the crime lord's rise to power through the ranks of the Hutt clans in the Outer Rim. To that end, it follows that the movie would perhaps end with the daimyo establishing his power base on Tatooine, the peak of his rise while also the beginning of his fall as seen in the original trilogy of Star Wars films.\nIf anyone could have made a successful Star Wars movie starring what's essentially a giant slug puppet, Guillermo del Toro was certainly the right call. Likewise, there's no doubt that Del Toro would have captured the true villainy of Jabba the Hutt, the merciless and renowned crime boss who held the entire Outer Rim in an iron grip for centuries, one who fed monsters in his basement those who displeased him with a booming laugh that would strike fear into the hearts of his victims. Seeing the origins of such a powerful Star Wars character would have been extremely exciting.\nSource: Collider\n"}

However, it is completely worthwhile. When out of enemy sight, the Abbasid Knight Outfit slowly regenerates Basim's health, making it ideal for an assassin of his nature. The Abbasid Knight Sword and Dagger that come with the set are also worth picking up. However, the set isn't finished even if you have all the pieces. To properly complete the collection, you must find all the Abbasid Knight Upgrade Schematics scattered throughout the map.\nTo acquire all the Abbasid Knight Upgrade Schematics, you must find and open Gear Chests scattered throughout the Karkh and Abbasiyah regions. However, acquiring these upgrade schematics is unique because the gear drops based on the number of chests you open rather than opening a chest in a specific location. For example, regardless of which Gear Chest you find first in the Karkh region, as long as it's the first one you have seen, it will have the Abbasid Knight Outfit. In other words, the loot always drops in order of the item first, then Upgrade Schematics after.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nTo acquire every piece and Upgrade Schematic for the Abbasid Knight set in Assassin's Creed Mirage, you will have to open all the chests in Karkh and Abbasiyah. The Abbasid Knight Outfit, dagger, and the two Upgrade Schematics for both pieces are found in six Gear Chests in Karkh.\nThe Abbasid Knight Sword and Upgrade Schematics can be found in three of the six Gear Chests in Abbasiyah. However, because the pieces unlock by order, you'll need to open all the chests in Abbasiyah anyway, which is good because in addition to completing the Abbasid Knight set, you will also get the Zanji Uprising Dagger and the two upgrade schematics for it as well.\nThe Abbasid Knight Outfit heals Basim when undetected and below 50%, but the sword and dagger pair with it. The Abbasid Sword, for example, causes light attacks to deal 30% more damage when you are below 50% health. Conversely, the Dagger will grant you 30% damage resistance when you're below 50% health.\nMany of the Gear Chests you're searching for in Karkh and Abbasiyah are puzzling. Some will challenge you with enemies protecting it, while others will require you to solve a puzzle, such as using a fire pot to blow open an entry. In addition, some Gear Chests will even require you to obtain a key before you can open them.\nBecause the map size in Assassin's Creed Mirage is huge, locating each Gear Chest in Karkh is difficult to put into words. Thankfully, the Game Guides Channel on YouTube can pinpoint where to find each of the six Gear Chests in Karkh. It's also worth noting that the Gear Chests hidden inside buildings can be highlighted using Enkindu or Basim's Eagle Vision.\nOne of the Gear Chests in Karkh is locked behind a door that won't open until you complete the \"Gilded Butterflies\" Main Quest.\nAll three of the Abbasiyah chests that contain the Abbasid Knight Sword and Upgrade Schematics will require a key to unlock a door or the chest itself. In every instance, the key is far from the actual Gear Chest location. Thankfully, GamerPillar on YouTube outlines exactly where to find the Gear Chests and the keys needed to open them.\nOnce you have all of the Abbasid Knight Upgrade Schematics, you will need the right materials to perform the upgrades. To upgrade the Abbasid Knight Outfit to tier two, it will cost 30 Steel Ingots and 60 Leather in addition to the Upgrade Schematic.

{"title": "Assassin's Creed Mirage: How to Solve the Tales of Baghdad Quests", "date": "2023-10-09 09:00:28", "text": "The Tales of Baghdad Quests in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage might need a little creativity to find, but they give Basim insight into Baghdad’s civilians.\nIn every region of Baghdad in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, there will be a collectible labeled on the map called “Tales of Baghdad.” These vaguely named collectibles can be hard to find, and there is no real solution given to Basim as he traverses the city and becomes a Hidden One. Therefore, players have to seek answers independently to figure out how to solve these puzzles.\nIn Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, players will be tasked with finding and solving many different types of puzzles, but the Tales of Baghdad quests are a special type of puzzle. They allow Basim to interact with the people of Baghdad by helping them with something they need, usually finding it for them. Each one is slightly different, but they all have the same basic problem-solving process.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nUsing Enkidu’s Eye or finding a close Synchronization Point is the best way to see each quest's location. There is one in each section of the Assassin’s Creed: Mirage's map, although they will not always pop up when players activate the first Synchronization Point in a given region. Generally, activating the closest Synchronization Point will do the trick; if not, Enkidu can find it while surveying an area. The icon will look like the golden flower symbol that the game uses as a save icon.\nThe Tales of Baghdad Quests all have rewards of either skill points or Dirham, the game's currency that can be used to purchase upgrades for weapons or outfits in Assassin's Creed: Mirage, making them worth the effort to help someone out.\nOnce the location has been found, Basim can travel there and activate the quest. There will not be a given or automatic quest activation for the Tales of Baghdad. Instead, look around for someone Basim can talk to, usually with a conversation icon above their head. They will be close to the quest marker but not necessarily right on top of it. Once Basim has spoken with them, they will tell him what they are looking for or need him to do, and he can then choose to do so.\nOnce the conversation is over, use Basim’s Eagle Sense to find your objective. These quest objects usually glow orange, and the Tales of Baghdad quests often require players to look for particular things, such as a gravestone or pages of a book. When you are done, if the quest does not automatically update, return to the quest giver and speak to them to finish it. Although they all require Basim to find slightly different things, it will be the same basic process to solve each Tales of Baghdad puzzle in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage.\n"}

{"title": "Assassin’s Creed Mirage: How To Assassinate The Treasurer (Without Getting Caught)", "date": "2023-10-09 10:01:27", "text": "An elusive target known as The Treasurer can be hard to assassinate in Assassin's Creed Mirage without getting caught, unless you grab a certain item.\nDifferent targets to assassinate in Assassin's Creed Mirage are difficult to approach without getting caught, especially the well-defended Treasurer. The influence this figure wields lets them sit at the top of Karkh's web of power, where they tax poor merchants to fund the controlling Order. Their true identity has remained a secret as they approach the Bazaar marketplace in search of a rare Eastern hairpin to add to their collection of seized artifacts.\nThe \"Gilded Butterflies\" quest puts the main character Basim against the Treasurer, to not only find who they are but to also gather information about where they could be found. Go ahead and use your Eagle Sight to scout ahead and determine where most guards are located in restricted areas. Those who don't want to increase their notoriety in Assassin's Creed Mirage need to be careful as they explore defended areas like the Bazaar market.\nRelated: \"A True Return To The Series' Best\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Preview\nSimilar to assassinating Fazil the Great Scholar in Assassin's Creed Mirage, your first task here should be to gather intel about the events going on in the Bazzar. Basim can eavesdrop on different conversations by sitting on benches or blending into the background. However, if you go into the main market, you can find the merchant Kong, who agrees to tell you some info on the Treasurer in exchange for a favor.\nKong wants you to find a decorative plate that had been taken from him earlier before giving out any knowledge he may have on the Treasurer. Your quest marker will point you to a room with a shelf you can move to reach a higher floor of the Bazaar. Reach a space above the room to use a red pot to make part of the wall explode, letting you place the shelf in a place under the space where the plate is being kept.\nYou might be able to find other merchants who accept Khidmah Tokens in Assassin's Creed Mirage to gain some discounts on powerful items or clues from around the Bazaar to help you against the Treasurer.\nReturning to Kong reveals that he overheard two women who said that the Treasurer is likely someone from the East. Continue forward through the Bazaar until you hear a merchant selling foreign goods up a set of stairs to the right in Assassin's Creed Mirage. Talk to the merchant to reveal that the Treasurer is after a rare hairpin from China that is apparently up for grabs at a particular auction being held in the market.\nNot too far away from the merchant you just talked to, you'll see two women with a magnifying glass symbol above them on a higher floor of the market. Climb toward the fountain in the center of the Bazaar by using the ropes attached to it. This will lead you to the room with the mysterious travelers in Assassin's Creed Mirage, where you should sit on a nearby bench to eavesdrop on their continuing conversation about the Treasurer.\nOne of the two women here is a Perfume Supplier talking to someone named Qabiha before leaving to a more private location. Use Basim's trained stealth skills to follow them and learn more about the Treasurer's deals and projects in Assassin's Creed Mirage. After eavesdropping a bit longer, speak to Qabiha to learn that the Treasurer has a particular interest for a special perfume made with blood, and that they are actually a woman named Ning.\nFiguring out the Treasurer's identity from Qabiha gives you a face to look for in the crowds of the Great Auction, the large event you learned about earlier from the merchant selling goods from the East. Travel back through the first floor of the Bazzar to find a merchant who can take you to the Auction. This figure will be marked in orange by your Eagle Sight as you explore the crowd of merchants in Assassin's Creed Mirage.\nTraveling to the Auction shows a row of benches with a Host on a large podium ready to get started, sit on any of the benches here to participate. A small cutscene will take place that gives you your first look at Ning, the Treasurer who you've been searching for throughout the mission in Assassin's Creed Mirage. Eventually, the hairpin will be brought up as an item that you can bid on using whatever Coins you have.\nYou can either try to outbid the Treasurer or do nothing at this point in Assassin's Creed Mirage, though the second option is likely better since you won't lose any money. If you don't pay for the hairpin, you need to steal it from the merchant who did buy it from the Auction. Simply climb up to the second level of the Auction area and move behind the man in black robes to swiftly take the hairpin while no one is looking.\nThe last step of this mission is tricky, since you need to have a special item called the Dragon Brooch to gain an audience with the Treasurer in Assassin's Creed Mirage. Head back to the entrance of the Bazaar and sneak past the soldiers guarding a Restricted Area. Go inside until you find a small room with the Brooch on a table protected by two guards, who you can silently kill by luring them to a changing closet.\nOnce you have the Brooch, follow your quest marker to reach another section of the market guarded by soldiers of the Ivory Coin. Ordinarily, these men wouldn't let you through without the Brooch, but now they will eagerly let you inside. Follow the escorting guard until you reach a large audience chamber with the Treasurer past her large assortment of artifacts she's obtained over the years.\nThe \"Interact\" prompt in the audience chamber gives you another quick cutscene where you can finally assassinate the Treasurer without having been caught in the crowded markets of Assassin's Creed Mirage.\n"}

The Quiz Professor will be found in several locations throughout the game, each time with a new question to solve.\nThe Quiz Professor will be looking for an answer pertaining to a specific Pokémon in the surrounding area. However, there won't be any multiple-choice selections to choose from. Instead, players will need to track down the Pokémon they believe is the answer and speak with it before reporting back to the Quiz Professor.\nRelated: \"A Fine Game That Knows Its Niche\": Detective Pikachu Returns Review\nDuring the first case, The Missing Jewel, the Quiz Professor will be encountered for the first time in Serenity Park. She can be found below the entrance to the terrace, near a set of stairs. She can be easily spotted on the path standing next to a Toucannon. The Quiz Professor will have three questions, but each one must be answered before she will tell you the next.\nInteracting with a Pokémon before receiving the question will not register the answer, so you will need to interact with the correct Pokémon again, even if you already have, after receiving the question.\nQuestion\nAnswer\nWhere To Find The Pokémon\n1. What Pokémon catches prey using its looong tongue?\nLickitung\nThe Lickitung needed to solve this question can be found further down to the left of where the Quiz Professor is. The Lickitung will be found next to a young boy and is rather large, so it shouldn't be too hard to spot. Speak with this Pokémon to solve the first question.\n2. What Pokémon uses its cute looks to put you off your guard, so it can steal from you?\nPurrloin\nFor Purrloin, head over to the fountain found in the park, and there will be an elderly gentleman sitting on a bench. Purrloin should be hanging around him. Interact with this Pokémon to solve the second question.\n3. Best Buds always stick together - what Pokémon moves as a group?\nFalinks\nThe group of Falinks will be found behind the Quiz Professor, under the terrace. There will be several of them all together, as expected, so they should be easy enough to track down.\nDuring the second case, The Fabled Aura, the Quiz Professor will be found a second time in the Southern Ruins area, one of the many beautiful settings in Detective Pikachu Returns; head up the hill to where Ursaring is hanging out and turn right. The Quiz Professor can be found once again hanging out with her Toucannon. She will have three new questions that will be completed the same way. Look for the Pokémon she describes in her question, which should be in the surrounding area, and then report to the professor for the next question.\nQuestion\nAnswer\nWhere To Find The Pokémon\n1. What winged Pokémon has a round body and adorable eyes?\nRowlett\nFor this Pokémon, head back to the entrance of the Southern Ruins to find Rowlett perched on top of a couple of rocks.\n2. What Pokémon has a blocky body, impressive jaws and will shock you if you touch it?\nCharjabug\nCharjabug can be a little difficult to spot due to its coloring, but luckily it's on the ground directly in front of where Rowlett is from the first question. However, keep in mind you will need to receive the second question before interacting with Charjabug will count, so you won't be able to get Rowlett and Charjabug in one go.\n3. What Pokémon is soft and fluffy all over?\nEldegoss\nAt the top of the hill, Eldegoss can be found near the door to the ruins. Interacting with Eldegoss will complete the last quiz question for this specific Quiz Professor.\nIn the story's third chapter, Detainee Pikachu, the Quiz Professor, will be found near an alley on 2nd Avenue. As usual, her Toucannon should be easy enough to spot, and just like the two previous times, she will have three questions pertaining to Pokémon in the area, all of which Pikachu can speak to, but despite the voice acting featured in Detective Pikachu Returns, players will not be able to listen on these conversations as Pikachu will verbalize his side.\nQuestion\nAnswer\nWhere To Find The Pokémon\n1. What aromatic Pokémon has a beautiful flower blooming on its head?\nLilligant\nHead over to the main street, and Lilligant can be found perfectly blending in near the entrance of the flower shop on the corner.\n2. What Pokémon has fluffy fur around its neck, loves to stay clean, and lives as it pleases?\nDelcatty\nLuckily, Delcatty can be found right near the flower shop where Lilligant was found. Delcatty is a little further off to the corner, but as said before, players will need to return to the Quiz Professor after interacting with Lilligant and then go look for Delcatty.\n3. What Pokémon can sense emotion via the protrusion on its head and prefers secluded spaces?\nHatenna\nIn order to find Hatenna, head back to the police station parking lot on 2nd Avenue and Hatenna can be found hanging out in one of the parking spaces.\nDuring the Bamboo Forest chapter, players will encounter the Quiz Professor for the last time, as she will not be present for the final chapter of Detective Pikachu Returns. The Quiz Professor and her Toucannon will be found near the entrance to the Bamboo Forest. She will have her final three questions prepared to reference new Pokémon in the area.\nQuestion\nAnswer\nWhere To Find The Pokémon\n1. What Pokémon bites and eats anything it comes across?\nDeino\nDeino can be found back on the main street of the Bamboo Borough, in front of the pizza place.\n2. What sharp-eyed Pokémon keeps watching from above for anyone suspicious?\nNoctowl\nNoctowl will be found in the Bamboo Forest, off to the right, sitting on top of one of the direction signposts.\n3. What agile Pokémon have leaves growing on its arms and head?\nGrovyle\nGrovyle is further down in the Bamboo Forest. Head down the path to Charcoal Kiln to find Grovyle hanging out along the path.\nAfter the encounter in Memories of Bamboo Forest, players can proceed on to the final chapter of Detective Pikachu Returns, but the Quiz Professor will not make another appearance. There is no significant reward specifically for completing all the Quiz Professor's questions, but it is a fun additional task that allows players to see more Pokémon during their playthrough.\n"}

Before he joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe as part of Loki season 2's cast, Quan had an important part to play in a past Marvel movie. The actor now stars as the vibrant O.B. opposite Tom Hiddleston's Loki and Owen Wilson's Mobius M. Mobius in the Disney+ series, but his previous Marvel role was very different.\nOn Twitter, an old video from the set of 2000's X-Men shared by @MarveIFacts showcases the Loki star's role as a stunt choreographer for the Marvel film.\nIn the video, Quan can be seen with Hugh Jackman's stunt double, teaching the Wolverine actor the choreography of one of his scenes as the Marvel mutant for the film. So far, Loki season 2's story has not demanded Quan to put his stunt expertise to use, but the season has only begun.\nQuan's role in Loki season 2, as part of one of the MCU's best TV shows, is the perfect pay-off to his career. While the actor has only appeared as O.B. in one episode of the series so far, he brought along with him the energy that has become expected from Quan with every role. More than that, Quan's Loki season 2 role interestingly harkens back to the actor's career in a key way.\nQuan's Loki season 2 role is the perfect mix of his two best characters. The MCU series deals with a sprawling multiverse story, setting up many important elements for Marvel Studios' wider Multiverse Saga. Quan's role as O.B. in Loki season 2 connects with the movie that led to his Best Actor Oscar win, Everything Everywhere All At Once. The movie also told a multiversal story, with Quan playing several different versions of the same character across the film's expansive and heartfelt plot.\nAdding to that, O.B. is the head of the Time Variance Authority's \"Repairs and Advancement\" department, serving as the inventor of all the technology at the TVA. That connects to one of Quan's most famous roles, as Data from The Goonies was also a prolific inventor despite only being a kid. As an inventor responsible for the technology of the organization that keeps the multiverse in line in the MCU, Quan's Loki season 2 role serves as the perfect payoff to his career.\nSource: @MarveIFacts/Twitter\n"}
{"title": "8 Best Motivity Weapons In Lies of P", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:28", "text": "Motivity weapons are tied to Pinocchio's strength in Lies of P, with the best ones offering some mobility or some of the highest damage in the game.\nMotivity is essentially your strength stat in Lies of P, which scales to certain weapons that can deal some of the best damage in the game as Pinocchio levels up. While many tools of this type are heavy, slow items that take a long time to swing at enemies, there are some that make up for this risk. Fable Arts and different traits can make or break certain Motivity weapons you discover throughout your journey in Krat.\nWhile you could compare Motivity weapons by the Physical Attack value of the tool's blade and handle combinations, you have to consider other factors like Weight, Abilities, and Durability. The most OP Motivity builds in Lies of P rely on weapons that have a balanced spread of every attribute. For example, a weapon with low Durability has to be repaired multiple times in combat, so the high damage may not be worth the extra effort.\nSome of the best weapons in Lies of P cannot be used until you level up Pinocchio using Ergo from fallen enemies. Some tools are also created from Rare Ergo given by bosses, which can only be crafted with the treasure hunter Alidoro.\nOne of the earliest weapons for Motivity you can find in Lies of P is the Krat Police Baton, which can be a tool that Pinocchio uses for surprisingly quick attacks. The Blade on the Baton lets you gather your Strength together for a big forward slashing attack. Upgrading this weapon lets you deal a ton of damage to early-game enemies, taking most of them down in one to two hits with this charged strike.\nRelated: 10 Best Upgrades To Get First In Lies of P\nMeanwhile, the Handle may be the best part of this weapon, giving you increased damage temporarily on your next attack to make up for this tool's lack of Fable Arts. The customization of different weapon Blades and Handles makes this Baton part extremely useful. You have the ability to buff the damage value of almost any other tool whose Blade you'd prefer to use as you reach new areas in Lies of P.\nThe Greatsword of Fate is given to Pinocchio if you choose the Path of the Sweeper: Strength Combat Memory at the beginning of the game. This weapon doesn't need to be replaced for a long time, since its Handle ability named Absolute Defense can be good at any stage of Lies of P. Using this trait allows you to automatically Perfect Block an incoming attack instead of finding the right timing manually.\nAs a result, the Greatsword of Fate is the perfect weapon for those learning how to use a Motivity build's slower attacks and guarding. While this tool also does not have Fable Arts, there's no denying the sword's utility against early enemies such as the Parade Master or the Scrapped Watchman boss in Lies of P.\nThe first boss weapon here is the Holy Sword of the Ark, crafted through the King's Flame Fuoco boss in Lies in P. This tool has two Fable Arts like most special equipment, named Patient Smash and Alter. The Patient Smash ability lets you gather your strength into one strong hit while Alter transforms the blade into a longer weapon that consumes less Stamina.\nThis weapon is simple yet highly effective in Lies of P, giving you an alternate attack from Patient Smash when transformed from the Alter Fable Art. This gives you the chance to adjust to multiple types of enemies, similar to the switch mechanics seen in titles like Bloodborne.\nThe Noblesse Oblige is a Large Blunt weapon with Fable Arts that let you have offensive and defensive advantages in equal measure. The Ergo Release ability consumes Ergo in exchange for more damage, while Endure lets you temporarily withstand enemy strikes. These traits let this weapon have some of the highest, albeit Ergo expensive, damage in Lies of P that enemies can't stagger you out of while the other Fable Art is active.\nThe Frozen Feast weapon deals with a Motivity tool's greatest weakness with the Liberate Fable Art, which increases your attack speed as you instantly release the sword in Lies of P. This effect can stack up to four times, giving you far more swings to hit enemies than you usually would. The Single Slash Fable Art lets you gather your strength for a devastating forward slash attack as well, targeting enemies that might be outside your reach.\nThose looking for an elemental Motivity weapon should look no further than the Coil Mjolnir Hammer, which comes equipped with the Absolute Defense Fable Art like the Greatsword of Fate. This gives you some defensive ability when wielding this cumbersome tool, but this weapon's true benefit comes from the Thunderstrike Fable Art. This trait in Lies of P lets you strike downward in a massive Area of Effect (AoE) attack that electrocutes many enemies at once.\nThe Thunderstrike ability of the Coil Mjolnir Hammer also imbues the weapon with Electric Blitz, giving all your basic attacks a boost of electricity for a short duration of time.\nThe Big Pipe Wrench represents the ideal Motivity weapon, dealing the highest damage from almost any tool Pinocchio could wield in Lies of P. The Blade Fable Art is Patient Smash, which you can hold down the button for during your attack to deal unrivaled destruction to your enemies. The Payback Swing is the Wrench's other Art from the Handle that gives you a strong forward slash that has more power after guarding an enemy's strike.\nWhile it may not seem like the Bone-Cutting Saw has the best damage or even the best speed, it is perfect for Motivity builds in Lies of P for covering an unexpected limitation of Strength-based weapons. The Saw has the longest reach of any Motivity tool, which typically require you to get incredibly close to an enemy before attacking. This long blade gives you the opportunity to instead strike as enemies are approaching you, rather than the other way around.\nThe Fable Arts on the Bone-Cutting Saw are excellent two, with the Endure trait letting you absorb hits from enemies temporarily. That Handle ability pairs well with the Link Chop Blade Fable Art, which gives you a strong downward swing that gains more power for the more bars of Fable you spend. The extended range of this weapon for this attack makes it the best for Motivity in Lies of P, capable of hitting many targets in a single strike.\n"}
{"title": "10 Best Finesse Weapons In Baldur's Gate 3", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:28", "text": "Baldur's Gate 3 has plenty of weapons to suit any character, but for players looking for finesse weapons, here are some of the very best. \nThere are a variety of weapon options in Baldur's Gate 3, all offering different damage types to suit different play styles. One of the more versatile is the finesse weapon; these melee weapons use Dexterity as the primary stat rather than Strength, often allowing them to be dual-wielded. These weapons are perfect for rogues, rangers, and bards as well as classes who don't traditionally use a weapon such as spellcasters.\n[Warning: The following article contains minor spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3.]\nIt is important to check if a character is proficient in using finesse weapons before giving them one in BG3. Characters can use weapons and armor they are not proficient in but will not be able to use them as effectively. Proficiencies can be checked on the character sheet tab for all Baldur's Gate 3 companions, and there will be a list of all the weapons and armor that the character is proficient in. As finesse weapons use Dexterity rather than Strength, it also makes sense to check that it is the higher of the two scores.\nRelated: \"An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas\": Baldur's Gate 3 Review\nThe Dancing Breeze is a very rare glaive which can be bought from Exxvikyap in Rivington General. This two-handed weapon deals 120+2 slashing damage and gives any character using it extra reach, which is great for using its Whirlwind Attack. With Whirlwind Attack, once per short rest, the character can spin themselves and the glaive around, striking all nearby enemies.\nA great Act One finesse weapon is the Githyanki Shortsword, which can be found either after battling the githyanki patrol or on a githyanki corpse in the Mountain Pass. The shortsword does 1d6 piercing damage with a chance to deal an extra 1d4 psychic damage if the target has less than 50% of their hit points. Wielding two of these not only looks very cool but can also quickly finish off wounded opponents.\nStillmaker is a very rare dagger found in a cave during the quest \"Solve the Open Hand Temple Murders\" at the beginning of Act Three, with this Baldur's Gate 3 loot well hidden in a hole. While it doesn't do a massive amount of damage, 1d4+7 piercing, it comes with the spell hold person. Hold person is a fantastic crowd control spell, but when used by a rogue, it will guarantee sneak attack damage as well as make all other attack critical hits.\nSpeedy Reply is an awesome early-game scimitar that can be found on a dead caravan agent on the Risen Road, directly north of the Blighted Village. It deals a decent 1d6 slashing damage and has the feature Nimble Attack. Nimble Attack will give the wielder momentum for two turns when they hit an enemy with Speedy Reply. Momentum increases that character's speed, making it easier for them to move around the battlefield.\nThe Adamantine Scimitar is one of three weapons that can be created at the Adamantine Forge in Grymforge and is the only finesse option. This rare blade does 1d6+1 slashing damage and ignores resistances against slashing damage. But the best feature of the Adamantine Scimitar is Diamondsbane, which means that any hit with this weapon is an automatic crit.\nDown in the Underdark, close to the Selune Temple, there is a blade embedded in the rock; this is the rare longsword Phalar Aluve. A character will need to pass either a Strength or Religion check to get the sword from the stone, but if they pass, the party will have a great finesse weapon. Phalar Aluve does 1d10+5 slashing damage, but its best feature is the Singing Sword ability.\nOnce per short rest, the wielder can choose to either buff their allies with Sing or debuff enemies with Shriek. Sing gives all allies within 6 meters +1d4 on attack rolls and saving throws that use Charisma, Wisdom, or Intelligence. Shriek debuffs all enemies in the same radius with -1d4 to their saves and deals out 1-4 thunder damage to them as well.\nThe Duellist's Prerogative is a legendary rapier found in Act Three by completing the quest \"Save Vanra.\" The rapier does 1d8 piercing and 1d4 necrotic damage, and if used solo with nothing in the character's off-hand, will allow the wielder to crit on a 19 as well as gain an additional reaction per turn. This comes in hand with the blade's other feature, which allows the wielder to deal additional necrotic damage on a hit by using their reaction.\nRelated: Baldur's Gate 3: 10 Hardest Secrets & Hidden Things To Find In Act 3\nThe Duellist's Prerogative also has two more features: Challenge to Duel and Dueller's Enthusiasm. Challenge to Duel is a spell the wielder can gain, which does exactly as it sounds, challenging an enemy to attack only the caster and inflicting bleeding on them. Dueller's Enthusiasm is the rapier's special action, letting the wielder use their bonus action to make an additional melee attack if they are not dual-wielding.\nThe Sussur Dagger is one of three weapons that can be forged when completing the quest \"Finish the Masterwork Weapon\" in Act One. The dagger gives +1 to attack and damage rolls as well as dealing 1d4 piercing damage. However, what makes the Sussur Dagger special is that it will Silence enemies on a hit, making it especially effective against enemy spellcasters.\nCrimson Mischief is one of two excellent finesse weapons obtained by defeating Orin near the end of Baldur’s Gate 3. Crimson Mischief is a legendary shortsword that deals 1d6+2 piercing and 1d4 necrotic damage but can inflict more damage on targets if they have fewer than 50% of their total hit points left. When used in the wielder's main hand, Crimson Mischief deals an extra seven points of piercing damage on attacks made with advantage. However, when used as an off-hand weapon, the shortsword allows the wielder to add their ability modifier to the damage, making it fantastic in the hands of a rogue.\nBloodthirst is the companion weapon to Crimson Mischief and also provides different benefits depending on whether it is the main hand or off-hand weapon. Bloodthirst also comes with Improved Critical, which reduces the number needed for a critical hit by one, and best of all, this effect can stack. This legendary dagger comes with the cantrip true strike and will inflict vulnerability onto enemies on a hit, doubling all piercing damage done to them. If Bloodthirst is used as an off-hand weapon, it casts true strike onto enemies who miss with their attacks, giving the wielder an advantage on their next attack roll against that enemy in Baldur’s Gate 3.\n"}

Season 5 Won't End With A Cliffhanger Following Cancellation, Promises Showrunner", "date": "2023-10-09 11:00:49", "text": "Magnum P.I. season 5 won’t end on a cliffhanger, as showrunner Eric Guggenheim promises it works as a series finale, but with a few caveats.\nMagnum P.I. showrunner Eric Guggenheim promises that season 5 won't end with a cliffhanger, revealing that it works as a series finale. The popular reboot of the Tom Selleck action series, which Jay Hernandez and Perdita Weeks lead, recently returned to NBC with its last ten episodes. The previews for Magnum P.I. season 5 part 2 hinted at a major announcement for Thomas Magnum (Hernandez) and Juliet Higgins (Weeks), but the show won't end unresolved.\nIn comments to TVLine, Guggenheim addresses the end of Magnum P.I. The showrunner dismisses the possibility of making edits or bringing back familiar faces, once the SAG-AFTRA strike ends. Guggenheim makes clear that it's not the ending for the reboot that he would've wanted. But he stresses that the last episode \"absolutely works\" as a series finale without the need to make changes. Guggenheim's quote is below:\n“I actually think it’s quite satisfying. I’m really proud of the finale.“There are a couple of threads left dangling that would have been picked up in a Season 6, but I didn’t want to end on a cliffhanger. If I’m being honest, I guess I wanted to play it safe. Too many shows have gotten burned with cliffhangers.”\n“Is it how I would choose to end the show? No. But if it has to be the last episode, I think it absolutely works as a [series] finale. So no, there’s no reason to go back and recut or reshoot.”\nMagnum P.I.'s cancellation was determined because the deals for the cast expired on June 30. NBC's Universal TV, which produces the reboot alongside CBS Studios, had to decide whether to extend those deals or end the series altogether. Of the three options available to the network - which were renewing season 6; extending the deals; or ending the reboot - NBC decided to cancel the show, given that the writers strike (and actors strike that followed) made it unclear when production could resume. Of course, since then, the writers strike has ended, and the actors remain in negotiations for a fair contract.\nMagnum P.I. season 5 has delivered well for NBC, though it represented a decline from its CBS numbers. Taking into account the show's delayed, non-live viewing, the reboot averages about 5 million viewers. That represents a 30 percent decline in total viewership from its time on CBS and a 43 percent slide in the coveted 18-49 age demographic. It should also be noted, however, that Magnum P.I. season 5 part 1 aired on Sundays after reruns which could have affected its performance.\nRelated: Magnum P.I. Reboot's 10 Biggest Changes To Tom Selleck's Original Series\nThe end of Magnum P.I. could also be traced back to the coming contraction in original, scripted programming. 2022 reached a high of 599 scripted originals, which does not take into account animated shows. It also leaves aside non-US series. It's expected that number will decline to around half in the coming years, as studios and streamers develop fewer programs. In that context, at the very least, it's good that the reboot won't be leaving its audience with unresolved questions.\nSource: TVLine\nAbdullah Al-Ghamdi joined Screen Rant in 2019.

Spoilers ahead for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5\nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5 features an unexpected cameo, and showrunner David Zabel teases how it sets up future narratives. As Norman Reedus' iconic role as Daryl Dixon continues his adventures in France, he gets an unexpected call from back home. While the message was distorted by static, it is clear that it is Melissa McBride's voice as Carol, and she is informing her longtime friend and ally that someone \"came back.\"\nHearing Carol's voice is a big treat for The Walking Dead fans, who have followed her and Daryl's story in the mothership series. McBride was actually supposed to be a co-headliner in the spinoff, and hearing her voice in The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5 somehow makes up for that missed opportunity. Aside from her cameo, however, her garbled message is also a big topic of conversation among fans, and according to Zabel in an interview with EW, it launches a new story in the expanding universe, saying:\nWell, it is important to what her ongoing story may be, and it is important in terms of what we were thinking is going on in Carol's world at that moment. It's also not what the audience expects or anticipates, if they're anticipating something. So it will ultimately prove to be surprising. But that's all based on the idea that we're going to play out that story.\nPreviously billed as a limited series, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 2 was ordered before the show even premiered. This means that Daryl's arc across the pond will likely not be resolved in the looming finale. With Daryl situated away from Alexandria, Carol's message is expected to set up another of The Walking Dead spinoffs, and it is best poised as the launching pad for the much-anticipated The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live.\nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5 didn't really share any other clue as to who Carol may be referring to, leaving Daryl and viewers wondering. However, considering Rick and Michonne's impending return to the universe, it seems like the perfect opportunity to tease what comes next after the Reedus-led show wraps up its freshman year. Either of them is a great candidate for the tease, and they also fit Zabel's tease about launching a brand-new storyline.\nRick and Michonne aren't the only candidates for the mysterious person that Carol is talking about. Morgan Jones coming back to Alexandria opens up an intriguing narrative since it ties Fear the Walking Dead to what's happening back in Alexandria. Otherwise, it could also be Dwight — Daryl's arch-nemesis and former member of The Saviors. Considering his ties to The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon's hero, it makes sense that Carol thinks that his comeback is noteworthy to Daryl.\nSource: EW\n"}
{"title": "&quot;Pay Attention&quot;: Wheel Of Time Season 2 Ending's Rand & Elayne Moment Addressed By Showrunner", "date": "2023-10-09 11:29:35", "text": "The Wheel Of Time showrunner Rafe Judkins underlines the importance of a seemingly small season 2 finale moment between Elayne and Rand.\nSpoilers for the Wheel of Time season 2 finale\nThe Wheel Of Time showrunner Rafe Judkins underlines the importance of a seemingly small moment between Elayne and Rand. In the chaos of the Wheel of Time season 2 finale, amid the questions of who lived and who died, in addition to lingering questions about season 3, it might have been easy to overlook the moment when Elayne (Ceara Coveney) saves Rand (Josha Stradowski) by healing his wound. It's a small but significant development that's tucked away in a very busy finale.\nBut while discussing Wheel of Time's season 2 finale in an interview with Collider, Judkins didn't hesitate to highlight the importance of the Elayne and Rand interaction when asked. Judkins makes reference to The Little Mermaid, naming Rand as \"Prince Eric.\" The showrunner also stresses that the relationship is one that's worth paying attention to, specifying the way the scene plays out for those that may not be familiar with the books. The full quote is below:\nIt’s a very brief moment, but Rand and Elayne, I call it The Little Mermaid moment. He’s bleeding out, clearly, dying…\nJUDKINS: He’s Prince Eric.\nAnd then there’s this beautiful face. It feels like sowing the seeds of that relationship and what it’s going to come to mean. How important was it for you to get that ball rolling in terms of connecting Rand to this person who he hasn’t even met until now?\nJUDKINS: We really wanted to flag for the audience that this is a relationship to pay attention to. So having her heal him of this wound that can’t be healed is a way to cement right away for the audience, “These two have a connection to each other, and I’m paying attention to what’s going on with the two of them.” The way he sees her, the way that she comes into the scene, it all hopefully is signaling to an audience that’s not familiar with the books that there’s something to really pay attention to there — because there is.\nThe Wheel of Time is already confirmed at Prime Video, delivering a strong performance on Nielsen's streaming charts that suggests the adaptation could stick around for a few more seasons to come. Given that sort of assurance, the show is making the choice not to rush one of the storylines that book readers are very familiar with.\nIn the Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson books, Rand and Elayne have several big moments that could provide the streaming hit with a lot of ammunition. But building the pairing more gradually, through glances and camera movements, and a relatively more muted scene in a hectic finale, means the show is choosing to let their story unfold at a pace that may make the milestone moments all the more rewarding.\n The scene could well be a teaser of what's ahead in The Wheel of Time season 3 and beyond. Rand looks at Elayne, and the way he looks at her, the way the shot lingers, points to an importance that will pay off later. Thankfully, with the show already renewed, and its future looking fairly secure, the couple has now officially taken a fleeting but immense first step.\nSource: Collider\nAbdullah Al-Ghamdi joined Screen Rant in 2019.

{"title": "The Best Swords In Assassin’s Creed Mirage (Ranked)", "date": "2023-10-09 11:31:26", "text": "The best swords in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage will keep Basim prepared for any situation or trouble he might unexpectedly find himself in.\nThere are ten swords in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, all of them with slightly different abilities. Basim will not be using his weapons quite as much as Bayek or Kassandra, but he will still occasionally have need of them. It is important to find a sword that will be useful in every situation as when combat does happen it is quite often a surprise to everyone.\nThere are both swords and daggers available to Basim, and he uses a combination of them to parry and attack enemies. Combined with the outfits in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, they will determine how Basim fights when forced into open combat. Here are the best swords in the game, ranked from worst to best including the swords available for purchase in the Animus Store.\nThe rankings are based on the stealth gameplay mechanics Assasin's Creed: Mirage favors, as this game encourages Basim to stay in the shadows and only fight openly when necessary. As this is not often, the rankings reflect that he will not often find himself fighting large numbers of enemies for an extended amount of time.\nRelated: Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s Best Armor Is A Huge Disappointment\nThis sword's ability, On the Edge, states that “When Basim’s health is lower than 50%, light attacks deal 30% damage.” While this is a decent ability when relevant, Basim isn’t often in open combat in this game, as this game favors stealth mechanics over open combat.\nWhen he is in open combat, he is not often at low health enough for this to make a difference and there are better abilities for dealing with low health in general.\nThe Hidden One Sword can be found in a Gear Chest in the Wilderness, and the Venomous ability poisons an enemy on every 5th hit, which is a decent ability, but often the enemies fall within 2–3 hits. The synergy is not as good as it could be, and Basim is not fighting many enemies at once very often unless something has gone quite wrong. Even then, it is usually easier to fall back and find a way to surprise the enemies again with stealth, rather than continuing to fight.\nThe first of the weapons players must pay for on the list, the Jinn Sword may not be worth the price. The Weakness ability only affects enemies with afflictions when they are hit, dealing an extra 50% damage to them. Applying an affliction without directly killing the enemy, unless it was with a Tool, does not happen often, while there are other blades that can deal an extra 50% damage more often.\nThe Demon Claw must also be paid for in the Animus store, and its ability, Burning Blade, can apply fire to attacked enemies and, if they are already burning, attacking them will set their weapons on fire for 10 seconds. This edges out the Jinn Sword in that it can apply a status to the enemy, and it is best paired with the Dagger that comes with it in the store. And setting enemies on fire at least looks cool, even if it is not relevant all the time.\nRelated: Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Where You Know Roshan’s Voice From\nThe Lightning Sword comes with the Thunderstruck ability that deals 50 Lightning Damage to four nearby enemies every third attack. The added bonus of this ability is that it is not necessarily to the enemy Basim hit, so it can be used to whittle down the number of guards nearby.\nThat being said, if Basim finds himself surrounded by more than four active enemies, it is likely past time to disengage and regain stealth and decrease your Notoriety.\nStrike Back states that, “After a Perfect dodge, the next attack deals 50% damage.” This is much more relevant more often, as enemies often have moves that cannot be parried and Basim will have to dodge at the right time to attack the enemy successfully anyway. This sword and the next sword on the list feel about the same in practice, but this ability cannot be triggered quite as often.\nThe first blade Basim will receive is also a very useful one, as the Sharpened Blade Ability gives the next attack 50% damage after a successful parry. This can be relevant with every hit, and often enemies are killed by this damage. This is a very reliable weapon, and it is one of the best sources of that extra 50% damage. It edges out the Zanj Uprising Sword due to the fact that it triggers after any successful parry, while the previous one has to be a Perfect Dodge to trigger.\nThis is purchased with the Deluxe Edition of Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, Healing Sand Ability being the best out of the pay-to-play blades, although not quite as good as its Dagger counterpart. This ability states that “Killing an enemy while time has slowed down regenerates 30% health.”\nThis makes it good for dangerous situations as it can regenerate Basim’s health, and it can be triggered more often. While Basim should not find himself in low health often, often open combat is the result of a failed assassination or pickpocketing attempt, meaning that he could well need the extra health.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed Mirage: How To Find & Use Mysterious Shards (Nehal's Calling Quest)\nThis sword is found by completing the “Weapons Dealer” contract in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, and the Chain Reaction ability makes it so that, “Every consecutive attack deals 5% damage, up to a maximum of 50%.” This can stack quite nicely, and it starts rewarding the player for hits right away, instead of requiring another factor to trigger. It is also relatively easy to acquire, and there is no real-world money that has to be spent to acquire it.\nThis is unlocked by collecting enough Mysterious Shards to unlock it in the Chamber in the Calling Quest. The Blood Price ability lowers Basim’s Maximum Health while wielding the blade but increases his damage with every hit by 50%. As combat is triggered less often overall, the lower health should not be too detrimental for Basim, and it pairs exceptionally well with The Samsaama Dagger also found in the Chamber, which can heal Basim. Basim can then take out enemies much faster and heal himself if necessary along the way, making this the best Sword in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage.\n"}
{"title": "Marvel's Fantastic Four: Release Date, Casting Rumors & Updates", "date": "2023-10-09 11:47:29", "text": "The MCU is bringing a new version of the Fantastic Four as part of its Multiverse Saga, and here's what you need to know about this reboot.\nThe Fantastic Four are finally joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe as part of the Multiverse Saga, and here’s everything there is to know about this reboot. The more the MCU expands, the more opportunities emerge to bring more Marvel Comics characters to life, as well as to give a new chance to characters whose previous adaptations weren’t exactly a success. The Disney/Fox merge now gives Marvel the chance to use popular characters from Fox’s Marvel movies to make them part of the MCU multiverse, and among them are the Fantastic Four.\nThe Fantastic Four got their first film adaptation in 1994, in a project that has become infamous as it was never released, and their proper big-screen debut didn’t happen until 2005. Directed by Tim Story, Fantastic Four told the team’s origin story and got a sequel two years later, titled Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. The team got the reboot treatment in 2015 in a movie simply titled Fantastic Four and directed by Josh Trank. Unfortunately, Fantastic Four was a massive critical and commercial failure, but the team is getting one more chance, now as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and here’s what’s known so far about the MCU Fantastic Four reboot.\nRelated: 10 Lessons The MCU Fantastic Four Can Learn From The 2015 Movie 8 Years On\nOn October 6, 2023, Fantastic Four director Matt Shakman provided some information about the movie and its place in the MCU in an interview with Collider. Shakman revealed that shooting is still expected to begin in 2024 - most likely in the spring - and discussed the movie's base of operations, Pinewood Studios, where a selection of major series have been created, both within and outside the superhero genre.\nAccording to the director, the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strikes have not led the project to a standstill, as work is instead being done with effects and production design, allowing the world of Fantastic Four to be built while other aspects are not possible to be taken further forward. Most exciting, the director also described the project as \"unlike anything you've seen before, and certainly unlike anything at Marvel that you've seen before.\"\nThe Fantastic Four were confirmed to arrive at the MCU in 2019, during Marvel’s panel at San Diego Comic-Con. In December 2020, Jon Watts was announced as director, though in April 2022, he stepped down to take a break from directing superhero films after helming the MCU’s Spider-Man trilogy. During the 2022 D23 event, Matt Shakman was confirmed as the new director of Fantastic Four, and at the time of writing, the project is scheduled for a May 2, 2025 release, meaning the Fantastic Four will join the MCU during the final chapter of the Multiverse Saga.\nMost of the MCU’s Phase 5 and what has been revealed of Phase 6 so far have gone through various changes due to production delays, narrative restructures, and the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. What hasn’t changed, however, is Fantastic Four kicking off the MCU’s Phase 6, which might seem like a late introduction for such a big and popular team, but it makes sense within the MCU’s narrative. Fantastic Four will skip the team’s origin story and will introduce them as an active team, and they are believed to be set up as a big multiverse presence for either Avengers: The Kang Dynasty or Avengers: Secret Wars, so it makes sense that their movie is the one that marks the beginning of the end of the Multiverse Saga.\nMarvel is taking its time to find its Fantastic Four actors - especially in light of the current strikes - even though it already introduced one Reed Richards variant in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, played by John Krasinski. Although Scarlet Witch killed this variant, Krasinski’s casting was a major fan service moment that is widely expected to be repeated, but Krasinski has already revealed he had no discussions with Marvel about playing Reed Richards again - though, of course, this could be something that changes down the line.\nVarious rumors have emerged about who will be cast in the MCU’s Fantastic Four, with some of them quickly debunked, such as Jack Quaid being cast as Johnny Storm/Human Torch. At the time of writing, the biggest casting rumors surrounding the MCU’s Fantastic Four reboot are Matt Smith and Adam Driver for Reed Richards, Margot Robbie and Vanessa Kirby for Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn for Johnny Storm, and Daveed Diggs for Ben Grimm.\nHowever, all of these are just rumors shared by “insiders” and leakers without solid sources and information to back them up, though some of these actors have done their best to neither confirm nor deny meeting with Marvel. With Fantastic Four planned to start filming in London in 2024, the Fantastic Four director revealed that although he could not disclose much due to the strikes, \"once that's resolved, there'll be a plan at that point, but I can't say too much. There will be an announcement at some point! I know that the internet is very excited to find out, and I'm excited to share it. I just can't do it yet.\"\nMarvel is well-known for keeping details about its movies a secret until the very last minute, and in the case of its Fantastic Four reboot, it seems to be especially careful with casting and plot details. As mentioned above, it has been confirmed by Kevin Feige himself that the MCU’s Fantastic Four won’t be an origin story, but that’s all that’s known about the plot so far. Fantastic Four’s villain hasn’t been revealed either, so predicting the film’s story is a lot trickier than it seems. However, Fantastic Four is believed to be key in setting up the Multiverse Saga’s crossover events The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars, so the movie could involve a Kang variant, with some theories pointing at Rama-Tut being the villain to defeat.\nOf course, many rumors and theories point at Fantastic Four introducing the MCU’s version of Doctor Doom, more so as this villain has a key role in the Secret Wars comic book storyline. Plot details about Fantastic Four surely won’t be revealed until the movie’s release date is close, and even then, many details will remain a secret as there surely will be some twists and turns that are best kept under wraps until the movie is released.\n"}

While Superman was the hero to start the DCEU, Aquaman will be the one to close out the franchise later this year with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. One of the things that was initially lined up for the December movie was a cameo by Affleck's Batman, but it is now not getting used at all, according to reports. However, it appears this part of the Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom story was repeating an attempt by the original Aquaman movie.\nIn new concept art revealed by Ed Natividad, who worked on Aquaman as a conceptual vehicle designer and is a concept artist for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Affleck's Batman was going to show up alongside the DCEU Justice League during the battle against Ocean Master. In an earlier draft of Aquaman, Ocean Master and the three kingdoms would have had a fight inside a city, which can be seen below:\nIn the early versions of the Aquaman 2018 script, Ocean Master commands the 3 Kingdoms to join him in the invasion of the surface world. He is met with resistance from the JL.\nRELATED: Aquaman & the Lost Kingdom Cast & DC Character Guide\nAs exciting as it would have been to have seen the Justice League in Aquaman, it was the wiser decision to cut them all out. For starters, this was Arthur Curry's first solo movie, after Warner Bros. had spent years trying to get this project to happen. Having other superheroes in Aquaman would have taken away some of his spotlight, which would have damaged the larger story between Arthur and Ocean Master.\nIt's also worth remembering that Aquaman came out after Justice League in 2017, with the team-up film becoming one of the most controversial movies for the DCEU timeline. Not only was it a box office disaster, but Justice League became a bigger nightmare in terms of the controversies surrounding Joss Whedon's reshoots when he took over for Zack Snyder. As such, having the Justice League in Aquaman so soon after the 2017 installment was likely a risk that Warner Bros. didn't want to take in the end.\nIt's ironic that after the attempt in Aquaman, DC tried to have another cameo by Affleck's Batman in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, only for it to get removed altogether. However, the circumstances are different in this case, as the Aquaman sequel is coming out right after The Flash, which has left the fate of Affleck's Batman up in the air, making a subsequent appearance in the DCEU only likely to confuse audiences. Hopefully, the creative struggles that Aquaman and other DCEU movies faced will not be carried over into James Gunn's DC Universe when it starts in 2024.\nSource: Ed Natividad\n"}

So it's really setting that up, but it's also setting up a world in which it's a little bit of a kiss to World Beyond, because in World Beyond there was a little bit of a suggestion that there were different kinds of walkers in France. And so we kind of dug into that a little bit in terms of how and why they are different, and how they could be a good foil and a good new opponent for Daryl. So that's really what that's about, and it plays out fully in the finale.\nThe faster, stronger zombie Daryl will face in the season finale was created by the Pouvoir, but there are still many unanswered questions surrounding zombie variants. The Walking Dead: World Beyond post-credits scene features a murdered character reanimate as a variant. This indicates there are certain variants that can arise naturally, meaning there is much more history to them than the Pouvoir's experiments.\nWhile Daryl will likely escape the arena and continue on his journey to the Nest with Isabelle and Laurent, that doesn't mean the danger of variant zombies is over. As encounters with Burners have proven, variants created by the Pouvoir can be found throughout France. It's likely Daryl and his group will encounter even more dangerous variants in their final push toward the Nest in the season finale.\nThe variants could also be tied to hints that Laurent is immune to the zombie virus. Perhaps something transpires that makes Genet or Codron realize Laurent could truly be key to stopping the zombies once and for all. However, it's yet to be confirmed if the circumstances of Laurent's birth mean he is immune. For now, it seems The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon finale will be highlighting the dangers of the variants, perhaps revealing more of their history in the process.\nSource: EW\n"}
{"title": "Grand Admiral Thrawn's Creator Would Have Told A Very Different Ahsoka Story", "date": "2023-10-09 12:00:28", "text": "Grand Admiral Thrawn has finally debuted in live-action thanks to Ahsoka, though Thrawn's creator Timothy Zahn would have done things differently.\nWarning! This post contains SPOILERS for Ahsoka\nGrand Admiral Thrawn made his live-action Star Wars debut in the new Ahsoka Disney+ TV show. As seen in Ahsoka's finale, the Imperial leader also made his epic return to the known galaxy after years spent in exile. While Thrawn's original creator would have done things differently, it can be argued that author Timothy Zahn and Lucasfilm's Dave Filoni see the Grand Admiral himself differently as well.\nHaving been created by Timothy Zahn in the early 90s for the Thrawn trilogy of novels beginning with Heir to the Empire, the powerful Grand Admiral was brought back into the established Disney canon by Filoni for the Star Wars Rebels series as well as in new canonical books from Zahn himself. Surprisingly, it seems Zahn would have likely depicted Thrawn's exile differently than was seen in Ahsoka, having confirmed as much during a 2021 panel (quote courtesy of @eleventhirtyate):\n\"The question was what I would do to bring Thrawn back after nine years of vanishing... It seems to me that what we need to do is set up some kind of reluctant buddy thing between Thrawn and Ezra. The way I see it is that Thrawn persuades Ezra that there are worse things out there even than the Empire. The Empire has an all bunch of Rebels fighting against it; this is something that you and you alone can help us defeat. So, if Thrawn can persuade Ezra to work with him, reluctantly, probably, but I think that that would be the basis for the story. Think back to... one of my favorite examples of this is the tv show \"White Collar\": they don't really trust each other, but they work well together. So I think it would be something of that same flavor. Ezra would never be quite trusting Thrawn, looking for \"what angle is he playing, what he is trying to get me to do that I shouldn't be doing.\" At the same time, Thrawn is, \"I need your assistance; how do I get this from you without making you bolt.\" So there is a lot of interesting byplay. And, of course, you can bring people like Eli Vanto to talk to Ezra. \"Yes, I was an Imperial; now I am working with these guys because I recognize that there are more dangerous things out there as well.\" So there is a whole bunch of interesting dynamics that you can put together.\"\nWhile the idea of Thrawn and Jedi Ezra Bridger reluctantly joining forces is compelling, it seems to be predicated on how Zahn views the Grand Admiral (compared to Filoni).\nRelated: Ahsoka Ending Explained In Full\nClearly, Zahn's approach to Thrawn would have been quite different. Firstly, there's the justifiable assumption that Thrawn and Ezra were exiled to the Unknown Regions following the series finale of Star Wars Rebels. After all, these comments were two years before Ahsoka's twist regarding Peridea and its existence in another galaxy entirely. This is why Zahn mentions Eli Vanto, Thrawn's greatest ally as he rose through the ranks of the Imperial Navy who became an Imperial liaison with Thrawn's people the Chiss (while Thrawn himself continued serving the Empire).\nIn Zahn's books, Thrawn is far more of a quasi-heroic figure, having viewed the Empire prior to his exile as a necessary evil to protect the Chiss from various threats in the Unknown Regions (many of which were established by Zahn himself). In that light, convincing Ezra to form an alliance in the face of new threats beyond the Empire makes sense. However, Filoni seems to view Thrawn as more of an outright villain seeking to claim leadership of the Empire following his return in Ahsoka's finale. Ironically, this seems to be more in line with Zahn's original Legends characterization for Thrawn from Heir to the Empire, because the author's portrayal changed gradually as he increasingly fell in love with the character he had created. It's ironic that there are now technically two contrasting interpretations of Thrawn in Star Wars canon.\nSource: Twitter\n"}
{"title": "John Wick 5 Has Much Bigger Keanu Reeves Problem Than John's Death", "date": "2023-10-09 12:00:28", "text": "John’s death in John Wick: Chapter 4 is a problem that needs solving in the next film, but there’s another, bigger problem that needs solving too.\nThe end of John Wick: Chapter 4 sees the franchise's main character succumb to his wounds, and though the next movie will have to figure out how to bring John back, their bigger problem is what they will do after that. John Wick is a neo-noir action franchise that first began in 2014, and has since spawned three sequel films, with more on the way. Starring Keanu Reeves, John Wick is a beloved franchise that has cemented itself among the greats, however, the latest movie's ending could be a major roadblock for the franchise's future.\nReleased in 2023, John Wick: Chapter 4 follows Wick as he takes his fight against the High Table to a global scale, searching for the most powerful criminals around the world. The film's final battle includes John taking on the High Table's The Marquis in a duel, that proves to be bloody even before their guns are drawn. At the end of John Wick: Chapter 4, John successfully kills The Marquis, but ultimately dies afterward. It isn't uncommon for action heroes to die before their story is complete, so the real question that remains is this: how will John Wick continue after his resurrection?\nRelated: 8 Signs John Wick 5 With Keanu Reeves Will Happen (Despite Chapter 4's Ending)\nThough it isn't confirmed that John Wick will bring its beloved protagonist back to life, if they do, there will be stipulations. First and foremost, if the franchise kills then revives John Wick, that means that they can never try to kill him again. This is because audiences will no longer trust that a death is truly a death. If John can be resurrected once, why couldn't he be resurrected every time? Even if the franchise does kill John Wick for good in a later movie, it would feel unsatisfying to an audience that has already seen him \"die\" once before.\nAlong with the fact that a second John Wick death would be unbelievable, it would also be boring. Killing a character is quite an extreme, and now that John Wick has gone there once, it would be repetitive to try and go there again. No matter how much the film tries to switch things up, ultimately, the end result would be the same. John Wick's death was sad in John Wick: Chapter 4, and it is almost a guarantee that if it were to happen again, it would be much less sad, and would automatically make audiences think he was coming back again like the first time.\nNow that John Wick has essentially played its single \"kill John Wick\" card, this raises questions about how the franchise will end. Typically, an action franchise can end with a bang if it kills off its main character, and more often than not, these deaths will be followed by resurrections that are hinted at in end credits scenes or final shots. John Wick obviously can't end the franchise like this because they will have already done it before. So, how can the John Wick franchise end without killing or resurrecting John Wick?\nEnding the franchise with John living isn't the worst thing in the world. It certainly isn't as dramatic as death, but it would likely make for a happier ending that could satisfy audiences in a variety of ways. If John succeeds in taking down the High Table, and then lives to see another day, that would certainly call for celebration. Furthermore, if John is able to return to a life of normalcy, that could be a pleasant ending as well. Really, the best thing the franchise can do if John survives is giving him exactly what he wants. Therefore, John and the audience will be satisfied.\nUltimately, John Wick may have killed off John too early. The franchise creator, Chad Stahelski reportedly has ideas for the franchise up until John Wick 9, and if this becomes a reality, then John's death will definitely feel premature in the grand scheme of things. The main concern is that the franchise won't be able to top killing off the main character. And as previously mentioned, once a franchise uses the death card, they really shouldn't use it again. Therefore, John's death in John Wick: Chapter 4 leaves many questions as to where the John Wick franchise is headed, and whether it will be any good.\n"}
{"title": "Vegeta Is A Lot More Like Goku Than He Will Ever Admit", "date": "2023-10-09 12:00:28", "text": "Despite the fact that Vegeta and Goku are famous rivals in Dragon Ball canon, the Saiyan Prince is way more like Kakarot than he would like to admit. \nVegeta and Goku are two of the most iconic rivals in anime history, and while it’s true that their rivalry has become one of respect, brotherhood, and mutually-assured progression, it’s still a rivalry nonetheless. Vegeta craves his own glory and significance apart from Goku, despite spending much of his time in Dragon Ball canon standing in Goku’s seemingly ever-present shadow. However, as essentially confirmed in Dragon Ball Super, Vegeta’s actually a lot more like Goku than he will ever admit.\nThe two Saiyan warriors first crossed paths in the earliest days of Dragon Ball Z, back when Vegeta was still evil and wanted to kill all life on Planet Earth. After Vegeta found redemption by aligning himself with the Z-Fighters against Frieza, he started to use Goku as someone he could compare himself to while he trained solo. While this method yielded amazing results - including Vegeta unlocking a state beyond Super Saiyan before Goku - he found that training this way kept him perpetually behind Goku. So, after Vegeta’s existential freak-out in the form of becoming Majin Vegeta during the Majin Buu Saga, he accepted his role as Goku’s training partner. However, Vegeta never lost that edge that makes him crave superiority over Goku, and to be more than just a carbon-copy of his Saiyan rival. Unfortunately, it’s for this reason that Vegeta would assuredly find it upsetting that he is - in fact - very similar to Goku, and in more ways than just their power levels.\nIn Dragon Ball Super chapter 76 by Akira Toriyama and Toyotarou, Vegeta admits that he failed to perfect Hakai (otherwise known as Destruction) because he couldn’t be the callous, unfeeling, power-hungry man he was at the start of his Dragon Ball career. In using Hakai, one essentially wills something out of existence, destroying every aspect of it entirely. Therefore, one must be unwavering in the mindset of total destruction, especially in terms of whatever person or object they want to destroy. To have that mindset, one has to be pretty callous, and Vegeta found that he’s just not anymore - and Goku discovered something similar a few chapters earlier.\nIn Dragon Ball Super chapter 25, Goku tried to use Hakai against Zamasu, as he figured that was the only way to eliminate this beyond-god-tier villain. However, because Goku is pure of heart, the attack had little effect. While it’s true that Zamasu mounted a number of defenses against anything these Saiyans could have thrown at him (which is why it took Zeno to finally put him down), the line of logic created with Vegeta’s explanation of his shortcoming can be backtracked to Goku’s failure in using Hakai as well. This means that throughout all that time during Dragon Ball Z while Vegeta was watching Goku and trying to attain his level of power, he picked up something from the Saiyan hero that he didn’t mean to: goodness.\nVegeta went from being a literal destroyer of worlds - someone who would kill those closest to him like it was nothing - to a cosmic fighter of evil and protector of the very planet he once threatened. No longer was he this unfeeling agent of evil, but instead - like Goku - is someone who’s relatively pure of heart. While his actions in later DBZ and throughout Dragon Ball Super confirm this alone, there’s no better side-by-side comparison than Goku and Vegeta’s respective failures in utilizing Hakai, as that proved Vegeta is more like Goku than he’ll ever admit.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "1 Loki Character Secretly Sets Up The MCU's Reset After Avengers 6", "date": "2023-10-09 12:00:28", "text": "The season 2 premiere of Loki hints at a potential post-Avengers 6 plot twist for the MCU thanks to the introduction of one TVA character.\nWarning! This post contains SPOILERS for Loki season 2, episode 1The Loki season 2 premiere introduces a new character that will undoubtedly play a key role throughout the season - and might well also set up the future of the MCU. Played by Academy Award-winning actor Ke Huy Quan, Ouroboros is introduced in the Loki season 2 cast as the head of the TVA’s Repairs and Advancement department. The fact that O.B. seems to be the only employee of the TVA who hasn’t had their memory wiped already establishes him as someone to watch out for, and the fact that he wrote the TVA guidebook means he knows the ins and outs of the TVA better than anyone.\nBesides the fact that O.B.’s character is clearly essential to the TVA, the whole meaning behind his character could actually be Loki season 2 hinting at the greater future of the MCU, in the same way Loki season 1 ending unveiled much about the franchise's multiverse. Ouroboros’ name is obviously a reference to the ancient Greek symbol of a snake eating its own tail, often a symbol for the cycle of life, death, and rebirth - which may be a nod to a possible future MCU plot point.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Episode 1 Ending Explained\nThe image of a snake eating itself can represent the idea of all time being an inevitable circle. Time may work differently in the TVA, but Ouroboros’ presence could be a hint that the cycle will catch up with the TVA regardless, or even the greater MCU. With the MCU’s new era being called the Multiverse Saga, it makes sense that everything that has transpired in Loki thus far is hinting toward another multiversal war. Considering that Kang the Conqueror will be the big threat, the upcoming war is sure to draw parallels to the first.\nStarted by Kang and fought between his variants, the first multiversal war ended in the creation of the TVA and most importantly, the Sacred Timeline. To this day, any timeline that diverges from the Sacred Timeline is destroyed, and this could be a hint at the result of the Multiverse Saga’s war. The most probable outcome of Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret War would be one timeline coming out on top as the new Sacred Timeline of sorts, and it might not be the MCU’s original Earth-616 universe doing so.\nHaving the concept of the multiverse for the upcoming Avengers films is the perfect chance for Marvel to reset the MCU. After all is said and done in the Multiverse Saga, the MCU has the opportunity to conclude Earth-616’s arc and set up another universe. This universe may feature Marvel characters that are already established to audiences, but resetting the MCU may put their stories back at square one. Representing the ouroboros’ idea of life, death, and rebirth, O.B.’s presence is a hint at an MCU reset that could work to the franchise’s advantage.\nThe theme of repetition is clearly present in both the Loki series and Loki himself as a character. As the God of Mischief, Loki has always been about playing tricks. He’s known for constantly switching to the side that will benefit him most, and his brother Thor has been on the receiving end of Loki’s constant loop of betrayal and loyalty. With how many times he’s cheated death, he lives in a state of repetition that has only intensified since arriving at the TVA considering Loki’s already been pruned twice.\nLoki season 2, episode 1 even uses the motif of repetition as a storytelling device, most notably in O.B.’s introduction scene. After Loki time-slips into the past, the conversation with O.B. is played out back-to-back with Mobius’ in the present. The repeated conversation creates memories for O.B. in real time, showing how influential the time cycle can actually be. It also might not be a coincidence that the biggest example of repetition happened with Ouroboros, the character that literally represents time and life as a cycle.\nOuroboros is sure to play an even bigger role beyond the first episode of Loki season 2, especially looking into the deeper meaning of what he represents. His symbolism of time as a cycle may come into play in the MCU’s upcoming multiversal war, even giving an opportunity for Marvel to reset the franchise. Considering how a reset of the MCU could take the franchise into a new direction after all these years, O.B.’s secret setup may be more crucial than meets the eye.\nNew episodes of Loki release every Thursday at 6pm PT / 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Honkai: Star Rail - Jingliu Character Ascension (& Materials)", "date": "2023-10-09 12:00:28", "text": "Fully Ascend and level Jingliu and her Traces to unlock her full powers as a DPS in Honkai: Star Rail. Here are all the required materials.\nFarming the materials for Jingliu’s Ascension in Honkai: Star Rail is an important step in taking the DPS character closer to her full potential. Jingliu was first introduced as a character and Jing Yuan’s former master in a short promotional video, but later appeared in the game itself as an NPC that follows and then challenges Yanqing. Jingliu became available as a playable character in Honkai: Star Rail 1.4, along with Guinaifen and Topaz. She is a 5-star character who uses Ice in combat and follows the Path of the Destruction. Jingliu has a unique gameplay kit, which sees her drain the HP of her own allies.\nWhile Jingliu plays a risky game by pulling HP from her party, this is compensated for in more damage output against her enemies. Even with the high risks she may pose, Jingliu has the potential to be one of the strongest DPS characters in Honkai: Star Rail, provided that she is given the proper build and team comp. Of course, the first step to worry about is gathering the proper materials to pass the Ascension thresholds that limit Jingliu from being leveled to 80 immediately, so that you can max her out and unlock all of her powers. This also includes farming for her Traces, the name for her abilities.\nRelated: Honkai: Star Rail - Lynx Character Ascension (& Materials)\nThe first set of items that you will need to farm for Jingiu’s Ascension is Immortal Scionette and its evolutions, Immortal Aeroblossom and Immortal Lumintwig, respectively. These items have been available in the game since launch, so you may already have a few lying around in your inventory.\nIf not, you will need to farm this item family from varied Abundance Spirits, Mara-Struck Soldiers, Aurumaton Gatekeepers, Disiciples of Sanctus Medicus, and even the Ascended in Honkai: Star Rail. Most of these creatures are primarily found all across the Xianzhou Luofu maps, such as Cloudford, but they can also be encountered in the Simulated Universe.\nYou can and should use the Synthesizer to transform 3x Scionette into 1x Aeroblossom and 3x Aeroblossom into 1x Lumintwig. As you progress through the Ascension levels, rarer materials are needed, so using lower-quality ones to great what is required is a vital part of the Ascension process. The Synthesizer should later be used for Jingliu’s Traces as well.\nWhile not too many are actually needed for the Ascension process itself, it is wise to farm a surplus of Immortal Scionette and its evolutions. This is because you will need a lot more for Jingliu’s Traces. Her skill tree fully unlocks after getting her to level 80, but while you are already farming these items, try to get more. The second set of items needed for Jingliu’s Ascension is Gelid Chitin. This item is an Ascension-exclusive item and can only be obtained from a Stagnant Shadow challenge in Honkai: Star Rail. To obtain it, you will need to travel to Luofu’s Cloudford map.\nThere, you will encounter Stagnant Shadow: Shape of Icicle. Beating this challenge will drop a few copies of Gelid Chitin. As a total of 65x Gelid Chitin is needed for Jingliu’s complete Ascension process, you will likely need to run this battle a few times. For reference, this is the same Stagnant Shadow needed for Yanqing’s Ascension in Honkai: Star Rail, so if you have already leveled the 5-star Hunt character, you may have a few leftovers. The table below lists all the materials needed for each of Jingliu’s Ascension levels, as well as the rewards for completing the Ascension:\nJingliu Ascension Materials & Rewards In Honkai: Star Rail\nLevel Ascension\nMaterials\nRewards\nLevel 20 Ascension\n \n \nLevel 30 Ascension\n \n-\nLevel 40 Ascension\n \n \nLevel 50 Ascension\n \n-\nLevel 60 Ascension\n \n \nLevel 70 Ascension\n \n-\nTotal Materials\n \n \nThe exact amount of each material may vary a bit as this is based on other 5-star characters' needs and leaks shared by Eurogamer, though the materials themselves are correct.\nOther than that, you will need a total of 308,000x Credits for the entire process – this is not too large an amount, especially when compared to the amount required for Trace leveling. The Ascension process for Jingliu may take a few days, as there is also a daily limit on Trailblaze Power in Honkai: Star Rail, the resource you use to challenge Stagnant Shadows and other activities in the game. Regardless, this is the easiest part of the process, as leveling her Traces will be a lot more time-consuming due to the sheer number of resources you will need to collect.\nAfter completing the Ascension process, you can comfortably start farming materials for Jingliu’s Traces in Honkai: Star Rail. This is the most troublesome part of maxing out a character, other than farming Relics and hoping for one with the best stats to actually drop. Immortal Scionette and its evolutions, Immortal Aeroblossom and Immortal Lumintwig are needed for her Traces as well.\nDifferent from her Ascension, however, a much more demanding amount is required: you will need 41x Immortal Scionette, 56x Immortal Aeroblossom, and 58x Immortal Lumintwig. This is why you should go ahead and farm a surplus when gathering for the Ascension.\nAs the level of Jingliu’s Traces increases, so does the quality of the items she requires. Using the Synthesizer to craft what you need is the best way to optimize your gains. This is also true for the second group of items needed for her abilities, the Blades in Honkai: Star Rail.\nThe Shattered Blade, Lifeless Blade, and Worldbreaker Blade are demanded in huge quantities, so you will not only need to farm a lot but start transforming lower-quality materials into higher-quality materials. Although they can be obtained from World Shops and the Embers Exchange Store, the best source for these items is the Calyx (Crimson): Bud of Destruction.\nYou will likely need to challenge this domain several times in order to get all that is needed. For higher-level Traces, you will need a special item called Regret of Infinite Ochema. A total of 12x is needed, so you do not need to farm these incessantly. They drop from Phantylia in Honkai: Star Rail. Nevertheless, given there is a cap on weekly boss challenges, it may take some time to gather all 12x Regret of Infinite Ochema. The table below lists all the materials needed to max out Jingliu’s Traces:\nJingliu Trace Materials In Honkai: Star Rail\nImmortal Scionette\n \nImmortal Aeroblossom\n \nImmortal Lumintwig\n \nShattered Blade\n \nLifeless Blade\n \nWorldbreaker Blade\n \nRegret of Infinite Ochema\n \nTracks of Destiny\n \nCredit\n \nThe high-leveled Traces will also require some Tracks of Destiny. A total of 8x is needed to max out Jingliu. These can be obtained from special events, the Simulated Universe, Nameless Honor, and the Embers Exchange Store. The process of powering through all of Jingliu’s Ascension thresholds and then maxing out her Traces is one that demands some time and dedication, but one that is worthwhile as Jingliu is one of the most menacing DPS characters in Honkai: Star Rail so far.\nSource: Eurogamer\n"}
{"title": "Starfield Makes You Friends With The Worst Parent In The Multiverse", "date": "2023-10-09 12:00:28", "text": "Among Starfield’s companions, one is very charismatic, but his treatment of his daughter makes it clear that he is a cosmically unfit parent. \nIn Starfield, players will spend time with several members of Constellation — the society of spacefaring explorers — but one member stands out for all the wrong reasons, thanks to terrible parenting skills, which are possibly the worst in the multiverse. The cowboy hat-wearing Sam Coe is one of the most distinct companions in Starfield, thanks in part to his anachronistic appearance but more so due to his daughter, Cora Coe. Cora is the archetypal precocious youth, a 12-year-old girl with knowledge well beyond her years. Sam repeatedly endangers Cora throughout Starfield’s story, making him an unfit parent, before committing the most profound act of child abandonment possible.\n[Warning: This article contains spoilers for Starfield's ending.]\nSome may think Sam is one of Starfield’s best companions, thanks to his charm and the complexity of his backstory. Though Sam may be likable, his insistence on bringing his preteen daughter along on dangerous missions already renders his parenting skills suspect. Perhaps the developers thought the dialogue exchanges with Cora on the ship added energy and character development to Sam’s missions. Sam does not bring Cora into the field to dodge gunfire, but she could be onboard for spaceship battles outside the atmosphere of planets. Whatever value Cora’s presence might bring to the game’s storytelling, few players can ignore the fact that Sam is putting his child in danger.\nRelated: \"An Instant Classic\": Starfield Review\nNot every Constellation member acts as a field agent, as several remain behind at the Constellation Lodge on New Atlantis. Vladimir generally stays at The Eye, the space station from which he locates the sites where the player uncovers additional powers. Cora could have interacted with the player and her father during visits to the Lodge, but Starfield has Sam insist she accompany him on missions. This already casts Sam’s parenting skills in a poor light, but it is Starfield’s endgame that provides the most damning evidence. Bringing Cora on away missions is at least a way to keep her close, but Sam ultimately abandons her profoundly.\nPlayers who speed towards Starfield’s ending or complete it after exploring myriad side quests eventually learn the secret of the artifacts and discover the method to reach Unity at the center of the universe. Breaching Unity allows a human to become a Starborn, a process in which their physical body is destroyed and reconstituted in an entirely new universe. There are no “family packages” allowed when becoming a Starborn. Each person is separated from everyone they know and love in exchange for the chance to explore another reality. Sam not only elects to enter Unity himself, he allows his 12-year-old daughter to do the same.\nBy the final stages of Starfield’s main story, Sam is fully aware that being a Starborn is dangerous. The eternal feud between The Hunter and The Emissary carries over into other dimensions. Starborn compete for relics and the powers that are housed in the mysterious temples. Additionally, they are left as a lone individual in a universe that has no place for them. Their alternate self might be alive or dead, and they might meet doppelgängers of their friends and family, but these are not the people they knew, in truth. By becoming a Starborn, Cora is thrust into an unfamiliar universe, abandoned by her father due to relentless curiosity.\nThe desire to explore the unknown and decipher the universe’s mysteries is the driving force of Constellation, and a goal shared by Sam and Cora. Sam views The Unity, and the universes that lie beyond it, as the ultimate mystery, a truly unexplored frontier. If Sam had struggled with his desire to see what lies on the other side, before finally deciding to stay to raise his daughter, it could have been a powerful resolution to his character arc. Even a decision to pass through The Unity, leaving his daughter for other members of Constellation to raise her, would have been selfish, but Sam’s mistakes went much further.\nRelated: How To Recruit Every Companion & Crew Member In Starfield\nCora may have been willing to part ways with her father to become a Starborn, but she is still a 12-year-old child. Entering The Unity is irreversible, and given the limitless permutations of the multiverse, the chances of the original Sam and Cora ever crossing paths again are infinitesimal. Sam chose his passion for exploration over his love for his daughter and essentially cast her adrift in an unfamiliar universe without anyone at all to support her. For the player, Starfield’s New Game Plus continues the story, but for Sam and Cora, it is the end of their relationship as father and daughter.\nCasting Cora as a preteen may have been a mistake since this parting might have played out as less uncomfortable with a more aged Sam and Cora. The theme of a parent letting their child go out into the world, trusting they did everything they could to impart life lessons, could be a poignant ending to the story of the Coe family. No matter how intelligent she might be, Cora is still 12. She may devour books and have an expansive skill set for her age, but she is not prepared to face life alone, much less a life marooned in an unknown dimension.\nPlayers who complete multiple journeys through The Unity, exploring a series of permutations of reality, may encounter an adult, Starborn Cora. If they allowed Sam to die in Starfield’s High Price To Pay mission, she will be hellbent on getting revenge on the protagonist whom she blames for her father’s death. In a reality where Sam has died, Cora might have pursued The Unity on her own as an adult. In any universe where Sam lived, he should have spent more time with his daughter before parting ways eternally through a trip into The Unity. Given the choice between his curiosity and his responsibilities, Sam made the wrong call.\nThe poor storytelling of Starfield may have made Sam’s negligence less evident than it should have been. While a more cinematic approach could have improved characterization, some may have a negative experience with the narrative since the game always prioritizes non-linear gameplay over character development. The trope of underage heroes going into battle is fairly commonplace in JRPGs and other less grounded stories. Starfield attempts to present a realistic universe closer to the hard sci-fi of Star Trek than the space fantasy of Star Wars. Taking a child into dangerous situations is already troubling, but Sam hurts Starfield with his abandonment of Cora in the multiverse, souring the ending.\nDerek Garcia is a Game Feature Writer for ScreenRant.

Known for playing hunky characters, Phillips has already appeared in several pieces of iconic queer media, and his identity is very much a part of his burgeoning career. Despite his playing several notable \"Himbo\" characters, Phillips has also shown a diversity in his roles that speaks to his abilities as a true performer.\nAfter making a few appearances in various short films and background spots on shows like Madame Secretary, Phillips landed his first major role in 2022, and it came in a feature film no less. Joining the cast of Fire Island plucked Phillips out of relative obscurity, and he has already played a host of great characters in the years since. Though he has yet to return to the big screen, his TV work has allowed him to broaden his horizons and be so much more than a set of muscles.\nRELATED: How Fire Island Compares To Pride & Prejudice \nCanceled after only one season on Netflix, Partner Track was nothing special, but it didn't allow Phillips to get more air time. The series follows lawyer Ingrid (Arden Cho) who tries to climb the ladder and become a partner at a prestigious New York law firm. Phillips appeared in six episodes as Hunter Reed, a meathead lawyer who gets advantages over Ingrid because he is a man. Though the series was a flop, Zane Phillips was funny in nearly every scene that he stole.\nJoining the Vampire Diaries spinoff Legacies in its fourth and final season, Zane Phillips was tapped to play an entirely original character that is unlike any of his other credits so far. The series follows a new generation of characters in Mystic Falls who must protect it from a host of supernatural goings-on. As Ben, Phillips imbued the demi-god with a rare stroke of humanity, and though Ben's Legacies villain twist was poorly executed, it gave the up-and-comer a chance to have layers.\nThe queer rom-com Fire Island adapted the classic novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen but with a decidedly modern twist. In the film, a group of queer friends meet for their annual trip, but find their bonds tested like never before. In his first major role, Phillips was tapped to play the rakish Dex who had a somewhat villainous side. Of the character, Phillips said in an interview with Pop Culturist that if things \"had been different along the way, this could have been who I was\" showing the young actor was more than capable of finding bits of himself in the character, even if it was unpleasant.\nRELATED: Fire Island's Main Characters Ranked By Likability\nOnce again returning in a Netflix original series, Zane Phillips' turn in Glamorous has been his most distinct to date. In the show, Marco (Miss Benny) lands the job of a lifetime working for a legendary makeup mogul which inspires them to revolutionize the industry. When speaking about the show to Man About Town, Phillips summed it up as \"a joyous expression on what it means to be queer in life, in work and in relationships\", while his character of Chad offered him yet another multi-layered persona to sink into. Chad struggles to understand Marco's identity but grows from a villain to an ally.\nDalton is a freelance writer, novelist, and filmmaker from Orlando Florida.

{"title": "WWE Backlash 2023: Bad Bunny's Fight, Cody Rhodes Vs. Brock Lesnar & Everything To Know About The Event", "date": "2023-10-09 12:00:28", "text": "WWE Backlash 2023 brought all the high-flying intensity and dramatic storylines expected of a wrestling PPV event. Here's the rundown of the matches.\nWWE Backlash 2023 was an exciting and action-packed thrill ride featuring some classic wrestling stars like Brock Lesnar as well as newcomers like rapper Bad Bunny. WWE Backlash is a PPV wrestling event that began in 1999. It was originally set up as a replacement for the \"In Your House\" PPV shows which were held between the major WWE pay-per-views: Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, King of the Ring, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series. The original \"gimmick\" of the series was that it was a \"backlash\" to the flagship WrestleMania event and held the post-WrestleMania position from inception until 2010, when it was canceled for Extreme Rules, only to be renewed in 2016.\nAs one of the main WWE PPV events, Backlash consistently has some of the most exciting matches of the year between wrestlers fighting to keep their belts, upstarts looking to make names for themselves, and former stars hoping to get back in the spotlight. WWE Backlash 2023 is the 18th Backlash event and features notable wrestlers from Bianca Belair to Austin Theory to Cody Rhodes. Kayfabe, high-flying stunts, and some important storylines round out the highly regarded WWE Backlash 2023.\nRelated: Reason Why Cody Rhodes Entered The Royal Rumble At No. 30 Revealed\nWWE Backlash 2023 aired on May 6, 2023, just over a month after WrestleMania 39. The event took place at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot in San Juan, Puerto Rico, making it only the second time a Backlash event has taken place outside the continental United States, the first being in 2004 when the event played in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The wrestling event was available for PPV but Peacock and the WWE Network subscribers could also stream the matches, just as they can any Backlash events.\nThe event opened with Bianca Belair defending her Raw Women's Championship belt from Iyo Sky. It was an aggressive match between the two women and even though Sky was the challenger, there were moments when the crowd was clearly actively rooting for her against Belair, turning her from a babyface into something approaching a heel. However, even the crowds' reaction and the surprise appearance of Sky's team Damage CTRL could not stop Belair. The veteran wrestler performed her signature Kiss of Death finisher to break Becky Lynch's record of 400 days with the belt.\nThe second bout of WWE Backlash 2023 saw Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins up against Omos. Before the match even began, the Nigerian giant Omos kicked Rollins in the chest to set the tone. It was one of Omos' best bouts who, notoriously, has often had slow ones, and the 7' 3\" wrestler seemed energized by the crowd. Omos got a huge choke slam on Rollins late in the match, but the smaller wrestler was able to land multiple Stomps, including one from the top rope that gave him the win.\nAustin Theory, Bobby Lashley, and Bronson Reed fought in a Triple Threat match for the United States Championship match. Like so often happens in Triple Threat matches, two of the wrestlers paired up for a careful truce to take out the stronger one. Theory fought Lashley and Reed together who continually broke up each other's pin attempts, but eventually, it was each man for himself. As the defending champion, Theory was set up to win, but Reed received audible crowd support throughout the night. Theory ended up tossing Lashley out of the ring and pinning Reed to retain his title.\nThe SmackDown Women's Championship featured current belt holder Rhea Ripley and Zelina Vega, WWE's only female wrestler of Puerto Rican descent. She strode into the arena wrapped in a Puerto Rican flag to the cheers of the crowd. The match looked to be ending quickly, with Ripley easily picking apart Vega, but a second wind by the challenger almost saw her mount a comeback. However, Ripley's signature Riptide slam ended the match and the fighter kept her title. In a great moment of national pride, Vega received a standing ovation from the Puerto Rican crowd for her performance.\nOne of the most talked-about elements of WWE Backlash 2023 was that Puerto Rican-born rapper and actor Bad Bunny was slated to commentate, and when it was announced he would actually be fighting Damian Priest, excitement grew even more. The pair fought in a \"gimmick\" San Juan Street Fight that saw Bad Bunny with a shopping cart, weapons being used, and even some moments taking place in the stands, leading to an eventual win for Bad BUnny.\nBad Bunny's interest in wrestling is well known, and he has even been announced to play luchador crimefighter \"El Muerto\" in an upcoming Sony movie. Just hearing the crowd's reaction to Bad Bunny and his own entrance music makes this fight a must-watch.\nRelated: 5 Wrestlers With Great Acting Careers (& 5 Who Failed)\nWWE Backlash 2023 featured an exciting six-man tag team match between fierce foes the Bloodline and Sami Zayn, Kevin Owens, and Matt Riddle. The Bloodline (Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, and Solo Sikoa), a villainous family team with a lot of infighting, are always fun to watch, particularly with how Sikoa often seems on the outside looking in during these matches, hesitating to high-five or hug his teammates. Throughout the match, Sikoa argued with the Usos leading to some mistakes, but he redeemed himself in the end, flying in under the ropes and performing the Samoan Spike on Riddle to win the match.\nThe main title fight of WWE Backlash 2023 came between Cody Rhodes and Brock Lesnar who only recently returned to televised wrestling. Rhodes and Lesnar clearly had a bone to pick with each other when Rhodes hit Lesnar with a piece of the announcer's table, a steel chair, and the steel steps before the match even started. When the match officially did begin, Rhodes immediately hit Lesnar with two of his high-flying drop-kicks, the Disaster Kick. On Rhodes' third attempt, Lesnar countered him with the always painful-looking German Suplex.\nRhodes and Lesnar traded moves until Lesnar tackled Rhodes into a corner of the ring with an exposed turnbuckle, causing him to bleed profusely. Fortunately, the match only lasted a little longer after. Lesnar got Rhodes in a Kimura pin, but Rhodes flipped him over to win the match. Lesnar left the ring looking visibly annoyed with his injury, but he did provide an excellent ending to WWE Backlash 2023.\n"}

Their leader, who would come to be known simply as Pinhead, fast became counted among the likes of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers.\n Working primarily behind the camera, actor and director John Krasinksi followed up his smash hit sci-fi horror thriller A Quiet Place with an even more ambitious sequel that further explored his post-apocalyptic world overrun by ruthlessly effective alien monsters that hunt by sound.\nPart II expands both the scope and the cast of what looks to be a successful cinematic franchise with bigger action sequences and star Cillian Murphy joining the ensemble, setting up an even grander third installment.\n A visceral horror film that's full of gore and brutality, The Descent has stood the test of time thanks in large part to its well-drawn characters and emotional performances. The all-female cast shuck many of the norms of the genre for a monster movie that holds nothing back but still finds ways to be subtle with its subplots and relationship dynamics.\nThe story sees a group of thrill-seeking friends become trapped within an uncharted cave system, soon discovering that a horrific presence hunts them in the dark. It's an unforgivingly intense ride, but an undeniably enjoyable one for fans who need their horror to have a little extra kick.\n Set in a sleepy Korean community in the country, The Wailing follows a comically incompetent cop as the local people begin to experience a wave of bizarre and violent murders with inexplicable motivations. Signs point to a mysterious Japanese man who arrived in the area not long ago but nothing is certain in this twist-filled horror story.\nThe effortlessness with which the movie switches between physical comedy and supernatural horror is impressive within itself, not to mention its gorgeous scenery and cinematography, making it a unique experience and a modern must-watch.\n This classic horror comedy mixes together surreal body horror with quintessential 80s humor when an American tourist is attacked by a werewolf and begins a bloody journey of transformation.\nBursting with creativity, the Oscar-winning effects of make-up maestro Rick Baker make An American Werewolf in London an undeniable top dog within the niche of werewolf movies.\n Adapted from the novel of the same name by Lionel Shriver, We Need to Talk About Kevin revolves around the complex relationship between a mother and her worryingly antisocial son.\nJumping back and forth through time, the most horrific reveals are saved for last, but the palpable sense of dread is kept high all the way through. The audience knows from the beginning that Kevin's actions have led to something truly unforgivable, with his deeds automatically reflecting on his mother. The film is a fearless exploration of postnatal feelings of anxiety, but they're delivered in such a way that anyone can relate to them.\n This crowd-pleasing zombie movie has opened doors for many into the wider world of South Korean cinema and breathed new life into a genre that had appeared to be played out.\nPassengers aboard the titular train fight hordes of the undead while dealing with a feast of the kind of relatable-yet-culturally-distinct drama that South Korea has become so famous for the world over. As either a viewer's first Korean film, zombie film, or both, Train to Busan is a great choice.\n Nowadays, the idea of zombies and the undead has exploded into the world of Hollywood. From films to TV series, zombie films have grown to the point of becoming overused and cliched, with many forgetting where they came from.\nBack in 1968, the late great George A. Romero released what was his debut film, Night of the Living Dead, a masterpiece of horror that for the first time, brought the undead to life on the big screen. With simple yet effective effects and storytelling, Night of the Living Dead will remain a pinnacle of the horror genre for generations to come.\n An eerily beautiful and chillingly sinister take on the tropes of vampire fiction, Let the Right One In mixes coming-of-age romance with intermittently brutal violence when a young boy forms a bond with a girl who harbors a dark secret.\nBoth daring and original, this widely-acclaimed Swedish film demonstrates the range of diversity that subscribers can expect from the best horror movies on Amazon Prime Video.\n To this day the only horror movie to win Best Picture at the Oscars, The Silence of the Lambs offers viewers often-imitated but still unmatched levels of drama and disturbing thrills as Jodie Foster's young FBI trainee hunts a serial killer with the help of the devilishly intelligent murderer Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter.\nHopkins' performance as Lecter, whilst not the first interpretation of the character to be seen on the big screen, became the yardstick by which all murderous masterminds in movies would be judged, making this a certifiable must-see.\nNEXT: The 10 Best Psychological Thriller Movies On Amazon Prime Video \nColin McCormick is a Senior Writer with Screen Rant and has been a proud member of the team since 2019.

{"title": "&quot;Being A Jedi Feels Inaccessible Sometimes&quot;: Ahsoka Star Explains Why Sabine Is Such A Relatable Jedi", "date": "2023-10-09 12:08:24", "text": "Now that Ahsoka has made Sabine Wren a Jedi, star Natasha Liu Bordizzo has outlined why the Mandalorian is such a relatable Force wielder.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka.\nAhsoka episode 8 officially made Sabine Wren a Jedi, with star Natasha Liu Bordizzo explaining why the Mandalorian is so relatable after her huge journey. Ahsoka began with an unexpected plot twist from the ending of Star Wars Rebels after revealing that Sabine had begun Jedi training under Ahsoka's tutelage after the former show ended. This led many to wonder if Sabine would become Force-sensitive, something that the most recent Star Wars Disney+ show certainly hinted at before Ahsoka's ending and finale confirmed Sabine's Force powers.\nRelated: Sabine Wren Is Officially A Jedi Now\nAfter this huge reveal, Sabine actress Natasha Liu Bordizzo was featured exploring her character's journey on Star Wars' YouTube channel. The video, recorded before the SAG-AFTRA strikes, features Bordizzo delving deeper into Sabine's psyche in Ahsoka, from her relatable struggles with accessing the Force to her imperfect choices that give her character a sense of realness. Bordizzo also explains that \"there's so much about being a Jedi... that feels inaccessible sometimes\" and highlights this as a core reason why Sabine's Ahsoka journey worked so well.\nStemming from Bordizzo's comments, it becomes even more clear why Sabine's character in Ahsoka is more relatable than other Jedi. Since the beginning of the Skywalker Saga, especially in the prequel trilogy, so many Jedi were portrayed as ethereal Force beings who rarely showed emotion and always did what was right. What made characters like Luke Skywalker and Rey Skywalker different concerning the original and sequel trilogies respectively is that they were not raised as Jedi meaning their more human personalities helped them become relatable main characters.\nWith Sabine, the same can be said with Bordizzo commenting that Sabine has not \"achieved this transcendent state.\" Even more so in Sabine's case though, she is not someone inherently gifted in the Force as Luke and Rey were. Bordizzo points out that Sabine has to struggle to become a Jedi, something shown at length in Ahsoka. This makes her much more relatable than the Star Wars character with inherent gifts and abilities and makes Sabine in Ahsoka come across as much more human, elevating her character as a result.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are now streaming on Disney+.\nSource: Star Wars\n"}
{"title": "Pixar's Strategy Change Is A Worrying Sign For The Studio's Upcoming Sci-Fi Movie", "date": "2023-10-09 12:11:26", "text": "Pixar is looking to change its film strategy moving forward, and while this might be a good thing long-term, it could be detrimental to its new movie.\nPixar is known for crafting beautiful stories that have an impact on audiences across all demographics, but as the studio reevaluates its strategy moving forward, it could be creating a disaster for its upcoming sci-film, Elio. While Pixar has seen immense success over the past decades, the studio's ability to continue dominating the animation space has been questioned after some missteps. Lightyear, for example, was deemed an absolute box office failure, and Elemental's box office debut numbers were low after poor marketing on Disney's part. This has led the studio head to address how Pixar will be making changes moving forward in order to ensure future success.\nChief Creative Officer Pete Docter explained how Pixar will change in the wake of Elemental. He wants to take another look at projects currently in the works to ensure that the films are in line with the values and ideas that have allowed them to connect with audiences on such a deep level in the first place. While it may make sense in the future for the studio to return to simpler storylines and create fewer worlds with abstract characters that are harder for younger audiences to connect to, it'd make the most sense to put this re-shift on hold and not make any changes to Pixar's upcoming movie Elio.\nAlthough Pixar reevaluating its content strategy moving forward might be a smart move, it doesn't make much sense to change Elio at this point. The information revealed about the movie has already garnered a lot of positive attention, as it's exciting that this is a new Pixar story that is not another remake. In order for Pixar to make good on their plan to return to their simpler roots, there would have to be major changes made to Elio, a movie that seems to be quite different from their classic films like Toy Story and Finding Nemo.\nPixar changing anything major with Elio at this point could actually prove negative, as audiences may feel a great deal of disappointment after looking forward to the original storyline, and that might hurt the movie's success. It would create the same exact problem that Elemental faced, with the marketing materials not matching the film's real story and causing box office numbers to not be up to par with their previous releases.\nThe biggest problem that Elemental faced during its opening was that audiences did not have a clear understanding of what the film was about. This was due to poor marketing on Disney's part, as the initial trailers and teasers focused on the fact that Element City had residents who fell into different categories based on their elements. There was little shown about the actual storyline, including it being based on stories of immigration and having a Romeo and Juliet type of relationship. This led to Elemental having one of the lowest Pixar debuts of all time.\nElio has already done a much better job at marketing, fixing Elemental's major mistake. Viewers can clearly tell what the movie is about from the trailer. The promotional materials clearly convey that the film is going to be about a young boy named Elio who is transported across the galaxy when he's thought to be the ambassador of Earth. Since the trailer is clear, audiences have enough information to make an informed decision whether they want to watch it, which was not the case for Elemental. Considering Elio is off to a strong start, the studio should refrain from changing anything.\nIf you asked Aleena Malik at any point in her life what her passion was, she would confidently tell you it was writing.

{"title": "10 Ways The MCU Has Already Set Up The Perfect Thor 5 Story", "date": "2023-10-09 12:20:26", "text": "Thor 5 is rumored to be in development at Marvel Studios, and several brilliant storylines have already been set up for Thor's next MCU adventure.\nMarvel Studios has already set up several perfect storylines for the rumored Thor 5 in the MCU. Despite the disappointing reception to 2022's Thor: Love and Thunder, Chris Hemsworth was confirmed to be returning to the MCU as Thor, the Asgardian God of Thunder. Hemsworth has portrayed Thor since 2011's eponymous Phase 1 project, and went on to become a founding member of the Avengers and one of the MCU's most important heroes. He is currently the only superhero to receive four solo feature films in the MCU, and recent rumors suggest that Marvel Studios may be putting Thor 5 into development, potentially redeeming Thor after a troubling Phase 4.\nAlthough Thor 5 hasn't yet been confirmed by Marvel Studios, the potential sequel has become a hot topic of discussion, particularly after recent comments from director Taika Waititi. Waititi suggested that the Thor 5 villain could be even stronger than Thor: Ragnarok's Hela, but the consensus among fans - and Chris Hemsworth himself - is that Thor 5 will need to change the tone of the MCU's Thor franchise, avoiding the comedic mistakes of Love and Thunder. This suggests that Thor could embark on a darker adventure in Thor 5, and though the details of this are currently speculation, Marvel Studios has already set up several potential storylines for Thor's next sequel.\nThor: Love and Thunder introduced a new hero to the MCU who could have the power to replace the God of Thunder. Gorr the God Butcher's daughter, Love, was resurrected by Eternity in Love and Thunder, and seemingly returned imbued with Eternity's own abilities. Portrayed by India Hemsworth, Love was adopted by Thor in Love and Thunder, implying that, when he returns, she will follow suit. Thor 5 could give Love a chance to show off her ambiguous powers, and could set her up as a new cosmic superhero in the MCU, potentially allowing her to fill her adoptive father's shoes should Thor 5 be Chris Hemsworth's final project.\nFollowing its release, Phase 5's Secret Invasion became one of the MCU's lowest-rated projects, but the Disney+ series did set the stage for some major storylines to unfold in the MCU's future. As well as establishing a massive Skrull presence on Earth, Secret Invasion ended with Dermot Mulroney's President Ritson declaring war on extraterrestrial species living on Earth, which could encompass the alien residents of New Asgard. Ritson is set to be replaced by Harrison Ford's President Ross in Captain America: Brave New World and Thunderbolts, but this crusade on Earth's alien inhabitants could continue into Thor 5 and beyond.\nBoth Thor and Tom Hiddleston's Loki have seen major character developments during their MCU careers, with the latter seeing the most transformation in his Multiverse Saga series, Loki. While the events of Loki are set separate from the MCU's main continuity, it's very likely that Marvel Studios is gearing up the God of Mischief to return to the MCU proper and reunite with his brother. The version of Loki returning to the MCU's main timeline will be unrecognizable to Thor, but it would still be great to see Thor and Loki reuniting to embark on an adventure together, and Thor 5 is the perfect place for this to occur.\nOver the course of his MCU journey, Thor has jumped from team to team: he joined the Avengers, traveled with the Guardians of the Galaxy, and formed the Revengers in Thor: Ragnarok. Thor: Love and Thunder saw him try to form a new team of gods in the MCU after making his way to Omnipotence City. This could have teased the debut of the God Squad, a Marvel Comics team comprised of powerful god-like characters. With the introduction of Natalie Portman's Mighty Thor, Brett Goldstein's Hercules, and Tessa Thompson's Valkyrie needing serious development, Thor 5 could finally bring together the God Squad.\nMonster-turned-hero Beta Ray Bill has been rumored to be coming to the MCU for several years, with this speculation only rising after a statue of his head was glimpsed on the Grandmaster's tower in Thor: Ragnarok. In Marvel Comics, Beta Ray Bill is the first character outside the Norse pantheon capable of wielding Mjolnir, Thor's enchanted hammer, so he could be introduced to the MCU as a replacement for the God of Thunder. He usually wields Stormbreaker in the comics, which has been Thor's weapon of choice since Avengers: Infinity War, so the foundations are already in place for Thor 5 to finally debut Beta Ray Bill in the MCU.\nMarvel Comics' Thor: Disassembled was a pivotal storyline for the God of Thunder, featuring Thor battling a variety of villains in an effort to prevent Ragnarok from destroying Asgard. While pieces of this storyline have already been adapted for the MCU, Marvel Studios can alter it slightly to feature returning Thor villains, without retconning their fates from previous MCU projects. Thor's MCU villains have often come under scrutiny for not being developed, so this could be the perfect opportunity to give Malekith, Hela, and Gorr the God Butcher more screen-time. Avengers: Disassembled also ends with Thor's death, so this could be a beautiful swansong for Chris Hemsworth's hero.\nIn recent years, Marvel Studios has been exploring the concept of the afterlife in much more detail, introducing the Ancestral Plane in Black Panther, the Duat and the Field of Reeds in Moon Knight, and Rocket's afterlife in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Thor: Love and Thunder also provided the first real look at the Norse afterlife of Valhalla, as Jane Foster finds herself there after dying in battle as the Mighty Thor. Reuniting with Idris Elba's Heimdall, Foster's appearance in Valhalla teased a major storyline in Marvel Comics in which she returns from Valhalla as a Valkyrie, so this could be explored in Thor 5.\n2027's Avengers: Secret Wars is expected to be adapted from Marvel Comics' destructive crossover storyline, 2015's Secret Wars. This event saw the multiverse destroyed by an incursion, with fragments of several surviving realities being brought together in Battleworld. Battleworld's police force was the Thor Corps, a group of Thor variants from a multitude of universes. If Chris Hemsworth is set to leave the MCU after the Multiverse Saga, debuting the Thor Corps would create a powerful exit for Thor, and introducing them in Thor 5 could begin to set the stage for Secret Wars. This could also be used to debut a new version of Thor for the MCU's future.\nPerhaps the most obvious storyline for Thor 5 would see the return of Brett Goldstein's Hercules, who was introduced in Thor: Love and Thunder's mid-credits scene. This scene saw Russell Crowe's Zeus send his son, Hercules, on a mission to eliminate Thor and strike fear into their followers once again. Hercules is an incredibly powerful hero in Marvel Comics, but was originally depicted as an antagonist to Thor, so this would perfectly fulfill Waititi's wishes to have a villain more powerful than Hela in Thor 5. Hercules' current absence in the MCU is jarring, so this formidable character needs to return soon, and become a more permanent fixture in the MCU.\nThor: Love and Thunder wasn't the only Phase 4 project to receive criticism. Chloé Zhao's Eternals is also regarded as one of the more disappointing projects of Phase 4, and this mixed reception has left sequels to both projects in jeopardy. One way to solve this problem could be to combine Thor 5 and Eternals 2 into one epic crossover project, potentially adapting Marvel Comics' Celestial Saga, which saw Thor battle the Eternals and the Celestials. This could be a great way to continue all these characters' stories, without putting too much pressure on them to carry an entire MCU project alone.\n"}

For eight seasons, Heady portrayed the sometimes villain, sometimes hero Cersei Lannister. Though Heady was already well-established as an actor before Game of Thrones, her role as Cersei remains iconic, despite the series ending in 2019. Arguably, it is now what she is best known for.\nLuckily, Lena Heady has the chance to redefine herself as she returns to the screen in Beacon 23. The science fiction show is based on a short story series of the same name, written by Hugh Howey, and is set to be released in November 2023. It follows Heady's character Aster and Stephan James' Halan as they become trapped at the end of the known universe. Though their lives become entangled, trust cannot be easily given, leading to a tense story filled with mystery and danger. Considering Heady's experience with playing morally gray characters, it should be no surprise that her character Aster is the most suspicious character of all.\nRelated: Game of Thrones: The Real-Life Inspirations Behind Cersei Lannister\nLena Heady's Beacon 23 role is the perfect follow-up to the end of Game of Thrones because of the apparent similarities between Cersei and Aster. According to Beacon 23's description, \"James’ keeper begins to question whether Aster is friend or foe as her ability to disguise her agenda and motives could make her a formidable opponent.\" This definitely makes it clear that Aster isn't the hero that many main characters are, and in fact, she could be the source of villainy throughout the series. But also, with so little to go on, it could be that Aster is simply misunderstood, which ironically also aligns with Cersei in some ways.\nWhile some actors benefit from taking roles that are vastly different from what they've previously done, Heady's role as Aster being similar to Cersei is actually a good choice. Since audiences are already familiar with Heady's impressive performance as Cersei, it will be more exciting and gratifiying for them to see her in a similar state rather than in something entirely different or opposite. Ultimately, Aster harkens back to Cersei's nefarious characterization, but is distinct enough to not be repeating what viewers have already seen before.\nAnother great aspect of Aster being similar to Cersei is that it will subvert expectations. Game of Thrones fans may watch Beacon 23 and immediately see connections between Cersei and Aster. From there, they will assume that Aster is the bad guy. However, if Aster turns out to be more heroic than she originally seems, then this will come as an exciting shock to viewers. Heady's previous role with give them expectations that she will then subvert. Overall, Heady's Cersei fame will be put to good use, as it hypes up her newest role and gives audiences ideas that will make the series all the more entertaining.\n"}
{"title": "Adele Warned Jennifer Lawrence Not To Do Sci-Fi Movie With Chris Pratt", "date": "2023-10-09 12:20:27", "text": "Jennifer Lawrence recalls English singer/songwriter Adele warning her against taking the doomed role in the 2016 sci-fi movie Passengers.\nThe Jennifer Lawrence Passengers movie might not have played out like it did if she had listened to English singer/songwriter Adele's warning not to appear in the critically denounced sci-fi romance. Lawrence was already a bona fide star, with her role as Katniss Everdeen in the adaptation of The Hunger Games and in the X-Men movies. Even before this successful leap into the mainstream, at just 20 years old Lawrence was nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for her performance in the chilling thriller Winter's Bone. \nWith Hunger Games garnering both critical and commercial success, Lawrence was set to break out into further Hollywood in what was touted to be an excellent career. With an overall shift from movie stars being the draw for audiences to popular proven properties, she became one of the few Hollywood stars that fans would flock to see. Of course, it is rare for any actor to be able to entirely avoid criticism or commercial failure at some point in their career, and Lawrence did find herself on the receiving end of less favorable reviews for the widely forgotten spy thriller Red Sparrow and even a Razzie nomination for her role in Darren Aronofsky's polarizing Mother!\nRELATED: The 50 Best Movies Of All Time\nOne of Lawrence's regrettable on-screen performances was alongside Chris Pratt in Morten Tyldum's Passengers. In an interview, Lawrence said she could feel her fans' distress at some of the films she had taken part in. When asked what films made her feel that way, she responded with Passengers and shared the advice Adele gave her before accepting the role (via The New York Times).\n\"Passengers,’ I guess. Adele told me not to do it! She was like, ‘I feel like space movies are the new vampire movies.’ I should have listened to her.”\nWhile Jennifer Lawrence was becoming a massive movie star, Adele was becoming one of the bestselling musical artists on the planet. With only a two-year age difference between them, they became fast friends and were there for each other when they needed advice. They were also there for each other when it came to having a good time. This was evident by a night out on the town that Lawrence mentioned in her interview with the NYT. The two decided to go out to a club called Pieces, without a VIP section or bodyguards. What resulted was a night documented online by people who whipped out their phones to film the two ladies partying with the masses.\nRELATED: Every Jennifer Lawrence Movie Ranked From Worst to Best\n Passengers remains a title that sticks out sorely from the actresses' relatively well-regarded resume. The film itself was widely criticized for raising an ethical dilemma taken by Pratt's character but exploring it too broadly for the film to maintain any real substance. Pratt's Jim wakes Lawrence's Aurora from a hibernation pod so that he does not have to live out his remaining years on a doomed off-course spacecraft alone, hiding his receipt that he opened the pod. Shaping this problem of truth and solitude, or deceit and companionship, into a hollow romance, in which Aurora is never given particularly deep characterization or soul.\nIt also closed Passengers' story with a contrived happy ending, in which the protagonists save everyone on the ship and share a future together, leaving the film with a sour critical reception. Insufficient thematic exploration and watered-down CGI spectacle aside, what likely infuriated Lawrence fans about Passengers the most was how little the actress was given to do. Even though criticisms of her being slightly wooden in the role are at least somewhat justified, it is hard to deny that Aurora's characterization gave Lawrence little to fashion into a memorable performance.\nLawrence's career trajectory suggests how quick Hollywood is to lose interest in some of its stars. Immediately after Passengers flopped, Lawrence made mother!, which was an experimental Darren Aronofsky movie that left many viewers cold, and then Red Sparrow, a spy thriller that received mixed reviews at best. Dark Phoenix not only ended up as a low point for Fox's X-Men movies, but it killed off Lawrence's Mystique, ending her run with the franchise at that point. The good news is that things have been looking up for the actor lately.\nLawrence's career has hardly stagnated in recent years, her role in Adam Mckay's Don't Look Up showing she still fits in just fine around other A-List names like Leonardo DiCaprio. She also had a critically acclaimed performance in Causeway and took on a broad comedy role in No Hard Feelings in 2023. It's important to remember that even with a few flops, Lawrence is an Oscar-winning actress and likely still has plenty in the tank for upcoming roles. Though, whether she'll ever fancy another forage into sci-fi is perhaps a more skeptical matter.\n\n"}
{"title": "Every Jujutsu Kaisen Arc Ranked From Worst to Best", "date": "2023-10-09 12:31:26", "text": "After being serialized for over 5 years Jujutsu Kaisen has a variety of arcs, all of which are great but some of which are better than others.\nWarning! Contains major spoilers for the Jujutsu Kaisen manga!\nJujutsu Kaisen is currently one of Shonen Jump's most iconic battle manga, standing alongside the likes of My Hero Academia and One Piece. This is partially due to how long it has been serialized, spanning multiple intense arcs. Now that the manga is officially in its end game, it seems a perfect time to compare these storylines and see which Jujutsu Kaisen arcs are the best.\nOf course, as fans know, no Jujutsu Kaisen arc is abjectly terrible. They all feed into the manga's overall narrative in interesting ways and often are filled with innovative fight scenes. Mangaka Gege Akutami is a master at constructing the plot of the series simultaneously on a micro and macro level, which leads these arcs to all be incredibly satisfying even if they may not measure up to the best moments the series has to offer. However, some storylines stand out as being a cut above the rest with the best of them being one of the best Shonen manga arcs ever. These are all of Jujutsu Kaisen's arcs ranked from worst to best.\nAs the first storyline after the Shibuya Incident, the Itadori's Extermination arc had some big shoes to fill but largely can't maintain the same standard of quality as its predecessor. This isn't to say it's all bad. The aftermath of the Shibuya Incident is fascinating and tragic to witness and the reintroduction of Yuta is superb. But the lack of any major fights in this arc really holds it back.\nWhile the Death Painting arc has two great fights, that's pretty much all it has going for it. The arc does introduce the concept of Cursed Wombs, which would become important later on when Choso became more of a character, so it's far from filler. However, the brevity of the arc also works against it, making it one of the more forgettable storylines in the series. But forgettable isn't bad, with moments like Itadori and Nobara's dual black flash really standing out. It just doesn't compare to the later storylines the story would tackle.\nThis may be a controversial pick but the Fearsome Womb arc deserves it. Being the first arc of the main series the Fearsome Womb arc has a lot of exposition to do, and luckily it does it well, setting up the world of sorcery and curses quite nicely while also introducing the main characters of the series. It also fears the first fight between Gojo and Sukuna as well as Yuji's shocking \"death\". However, like the Death Painting arc it is too short to make a lasting impact on the audience beyond hooking them on the story. Still as an opener goes, few series could do better.\nThe Culling Game has been one of the most controversial arcs in Jujutsu Kaisen history. It features some of the highest highs the series has to offer like Sukuna possessing Megumi and the fight between Hakari and Kashimo, but it also drags. Focusing on each colony individually meant that certain characters weren't featured for a very long time and made many of the new characters and fights feel inconsequential. However, the arc may read better on a reread after the series is over as the Culling Game may have set up ideas that haven't actually paid off yet.\nThis arc is kind of a weird one given it isn't really part of the main series, instead serving as a prequel focused on Yuta Okkotsu. Its events are very important for the series as a whole featuring the culmination of Geto's plans and his death at the hands of Gojo. It also shows a variety of characters before their introduction in the main series like Gojo, Maki, Panda, and Inumaki. Its greatest strength however is telling one relatively self-contained story about Yuta's growth as a character, which makes it more fulfilling than some of the other arcs on this list.\nThe Gojo's Past arc is another arc taking place before the events of the main series, except this time the chapters were released as part of Jujutsu Kaisen's regular serialization. It follows Gojo and Geto's high school years as they take on a mission to protect a young girl before she gets assimilated by the immortal sorcerer Tengen. Unfortunately their mission fails due to the actions of one of Jujutsu Kaisen's coolest villains Toji Fushiguro, causing the arc to be incredibly tragic. Just like in the Cursed Child arc, this storyline is satisfying on its own due to it being relatively disconnected from the main plot, which elevates it above many arcs on this list.\nThis arc should probably rank lower on this list for a variety of reasons. Yuji and Megumi's quest to recruit Hakari for the Culling Game is relatively boring, and the arc is pretty short overall. However, this arc also features Maki's awakening and the incredibly cathartic slaughter of the Zenin clan, which is one of the best parts of the entire series. Sure that sequence is a bit rough around the edges as Gege didn't have time to polish it up before release. But the sheer emotional weight and epic scale of the destruction make up for that and make Perfect Preparation a top-tier Jujutsu Kaisen arc.\nThis arc is one of the most tragic and twisted arcs of the series, which perfectly set the tone for the later arcs to come. The arc does a great job at establishing Mahito as a twisted villain with a personal connection to Yuji. Also Yuji's friendship with Junpei is touching and his horror upon their death at the hands of Mahito leads to one of the coolest panels in the entire series. Adding Nanami's introduction along with the multiple fights against Mahito that hinted at how cool Jujutsu Kaisen battles can be makes this easily one of the best arcs in the series despite how early into the manga it comes.\nThis arc features an incredible expansion of Jujutsu Kaisen's cast of characters by introducing the sorcerers at the Kyoto school. This includes some fan favorites such as Miwa and the hilariously lovable Todo. Not only this but it features some epic fights both between the sorcerers themselves and against the Disaster Curse Hanami who infiltrates the event. In addition to the high-octane fights it also takes the time to show off fun interactions between the high school students such as in the baseball game that takes place after Hanami is defeated. This arc truly has everything that makes Jujutsu Kaisen special which makes it a top 3 arc.\nPutting this arc so high up on this list may be premature given it is still ongoing. However, the Gojo vs Sukuna fight alone was one of the best things Jujutsu Kaisen has ever done and every chapter after that has just carried forward the story's momentum. Many fans were understandably upset at Gojo's shocking death, but even they can't deny that it served to make Sukuna one of the most threatening Shonen villains of all time. Seeing the rest of the cast scramble to try and defeat him after Gojo's death just hammers that point home further and makes this unpredictable arc feel simultaneously hopeless and exciting. As the culmination of the entire series this deserves a place at the top of the list.\nWhile the current Shinjuku Showdown arc could eventually dethrone it, the Shibuya Incident currently stands as the best arc in Jujutsu Kaisen. The arc forever changed Jujutsu Kaisen's status quo and its revolutionary nature changed Shonen manga forever. It also featured some of the best and most chaotic fights in the series with each battle bleeding over into the other ones and creating a beautiful whole. As the culmination of everything that came before it, the Shibuya Incident is in equal measure tragic and cathartic, creating one of the best Shonen arcs of all time.\nAs Jujutsu Kaisen races towards its conclusion, this ranking may change depending on how the final arcs of the series turn out. But no matter how the series concludes, the greatness of these arcs leave a lasting legacy that is sure to influence the next generation of Shonen manga. Even Jujutsu Kaisen's worst arcs have great moments and its best arcs show why it is one of the best modern Shonen series out there.\nBen Sockol has been writing articles for the comics section of Screen Rant since early 2022.

{"title": "Why Rings Of Power's LOTR Canon Problems Will Be Much Worse In Season 2", "date": "2023-10-09 12:31:26", "text": "The canonical problems with The Rings of Power will be more difficult to solve in Season 2. Here's why Amazon's fantasy series is in danger.\nThe Rings of Power has been suffering from some canonical problems pertaining to J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, and they're likely to be much worse in season 2. The first season of Amazon's high fantasy series, based on the novels set in Tolkien's beloved Middle-earth, was already divisive among serious fans. Not only did it take liberties with the Lord of the Rings timeline by condensing it, but it also positioned certain celebrated characters, which are separated by hundreds of years in Tolkien's works, actively in the same events.\nWith its high budget, strong performances, and attention to detail, Rings of Power is Amazon's best fantasy series so far, but it remains to be seen if it can maintain its momentum going into season 2. Issues surrounding the legal rights to Tolkien's work that would provide context for some of the most important events in Middle-earth, as well as certain creative differences, present unique challenges. At a time when fans have their pick of series with The Wheel of Time and House of the Dragon, The Rings of Power season 2 will need to be its strongest so far.\nThe Rings of Power's first season largely took place in the Second Age which, although outlined in The Silmarillion, acted more like appendices. Amazon did not procure the rights for the bulk of the material, which granted the streaming giant a lot more creative leeway but at the same time angered certain die-hard devotees of Tolkien's works. The overarching story for The Rings of Power's second season is naturally going to be more restricted the closer it gets to important events such as the forging of the One Ring, Sauron's war with the Elves, and the Fall of Numenor.\nA lot of source material exists for these monumental moments in The Lord of the Rings canon and timeline which is helpful to make the series authentic, but presents its own issues. For one thing, there is an increased potential for contradictions and plot holes that will alienate and anger Tolkien purists. For another, any drastic changes to certain key events could create issues when linking up to either Tolkien's books or Peter Jackson's beloved Lord of the Rings trilogy of movies.\nSince The Rings of Power timeline has had to be so condensed, with events that should have taken place hundreds of years apart occurring at the same time, there's been a vocal outcry from the fans. If The Rings of Power season 2 stays canonical, this should alleviate some of the division among the fandom, but it's a promise that will be hard to keep. Given how many deviations and drastic changes to original details in season 1, it's going to be particularly tricky to stay true to canon while at the same time filming a season that appears to flow organically from its predecessor.\nThe Rings of Power new Mordor origins and the foundation of Mount Doom create figurative and literal fissures in the foundation of the series. Having Celebrimbor and Isildur alive at the same time doesn't just condense the timeline, it risks making Tolkien's world-building seem small and rushed. The sprawl to Middle-earth, as well as its complexity, are two of its most daunting and revered qualities, and they will hopefully be maintained as The Rings of Power goes forward, particularly in regards to the Dwarven kingdoms, which have been a series highlight so far.\nNot being able to draw from The Silmarillion has proven to be one of the most frustrating aspects of The Rings of Power. Amazon may only use what's in The Lord of the Rings and its appendices, which has made telling a canonically correct Second Age story difficult without contradicting Tolkien's established lore. Tolkien's Estate never put the rights to The Silmarillion up for sale because as far back as the late '60s, when Tolkien sold the rights to The Lord of the Rings originally to the Saul Zaentz Company, they had \"matching rights\" to it, and possibly The Unfinished Tales\nAmazon didn't approach the Estate to purchase the rights, rather, the Estate explored options for a potential buyer for The Lord of the Rings TV rights. To circumvent the \"matching rights\" issue created by Tolkien's sale of The Lord of the Rings film rights to the Saul Zaentz Company, they granted the potential buyer access to more content through direct consultation. As a result, the Estate had the ability to have much more influence over shaping Tolkien's continued stories in Middle-earth with The Rings of Power than either The Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit trilogies.\n"}

The Prophets are one of the Star Trek franchise’s most enigmatic species; a non-linear, non-corporeal race residing in the Bajoran Wormhole. They are powerful beyond belief, but in Star Trek #12, readers learn that one member of the Theseus’ crew possesses an intellect far beyond the Prophets.\nIn Star Trek #12 – written by Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly and drawn by Angelu Unzueta – as Captain Sisko fights Kahless on the Klingon homeworld, he has a vision of the crews of the Theseus and Defiant, working to harness the power of the Bajoran Orb of Creation.\nHis narration offers deep insight into each character – including T'Lir, the Theseus’ science officer, who Sisko calls a “genius with a mind beyond even the Prophets’ comprehension.”\nRelated: These Two Characters Are Star Trek's Newest, Greatest Odd Couple\nProving Sisko’s point, T’Lir is instrumental in unleashing the Orb of Creation’s vast power to defeat Kahless in Star Trek #12, the climax Star Trek's crossover event, \"Day of Blood.\" T’Lir is one of the most exciting additions to the Star Trek universe. Created for IDW’s flagship Star Trek title, T’LIr is the first non-binary Vulcan featured in the franchise. Readers have seen tantalizing glimpses of T’Lir, and there is clearly more to them than meets the eye. They refer to themselves as “T’Lir, a Vulcan of Starfleet” and they seemingly have superpowers. The mystery of T’Lir has played out across Star Trek’s first year, adding another layer of intrigue to the story.\nWhile Trek fans wait to learn exactly who T’Lir is, Sisko drops a surprising revelation about them in Star Trek #12. To be smarter than one of the Bajoran Prophets is a huge deal. The Prophets exist outside of space and time, in a realm called “the Celestial Temple,” another name for the Bajoran wormhole. The Prophets created the immensely powerful Orbs, each representing a facet of existence. T’Lir helps crack the Orb of Creation, using their great intellect to learn the Prophets secrets, in order to stop Kahless. They successfully harness the Orb’s powers, showing their incredible intelligence, and playing a pivotal role in the conclusion to \"Day of Blood.\"\nT’Lir has shown themselves to be perhaps the smartest member of the Theseus’ crew, rivaling even Data. T’Lir has shown they grasp concepts and theories on the cutting edge of 24th-century science–and beyond. This no doubt owes to their mysterious, possibly cosmic nature, and leaves fans wondering if T’Lir, in their true form, would be a match for the Prophets or other god-like beings like Q. There is so much more to T’Lir to be discovered and as Star Trek enters its second year, more will certainly be revealed. T’Lir has already proven themselves the smartest person in the Star Trek franchise, even more than Sisko.\nStar Trek #12 is on sale now from IDW Publishing!\nShaun Corley is a freelance writer currently residing in the mountains of Appalachia.

While he does not debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Miles Morales is doing quite well in the animated Spider-Verse. Miles traverses many different universes in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse; however, one of the universes that the character didn't visit was responsible for one of the movie's most surprising and exciting scenes, which has now been made more mind-blowing.\nOn Twitter, Preston Mutanga, the animator behind Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse's LEGO sequence, revealed that he has just turned 15.\nThe LEGO scene was one of the best parts of the movie, with the toy Spider-Man having great dialogue with Oscar Isaac's Spider-Man 2099. The scene's inclusion in the film was already surprising, but the fact that the person in charge of the exciting moment was none other than a kid makes it even more shocking. Mutanga was hired after he recreated the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse trailer in LEGO.\nRelated: Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse Credits Tease Explained & Beyond The Spider-Verse Setup\nAs shown by Mutanga's role in the movie, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse — and the whole Spider-Verse franchise — is only the major success it is because of the effort of countless talented crew members. By having talented people with specific roles, such as Mutanga handling Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse's LEGO sequence, the Spider-Verse franchise managed to keep its sprawling multiverse story unique and diverse, aiding Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse's cast to deliver the best performances possible.\nHowever, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse's delay — with the movie getting removed from Sony Pictures' release schedule — reveals a problem to the franchise. Recently, a Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse report claimed the production had bad working conditions. According to the report, over 100 people working on the second movie in the Spider-Verse franchise left the film due to poor working conditions, such as constant revisions — above the usual level — and animators having to work 11 hours a day every week for more than a year.\nThe Spider-Verse franchise has become so popular due to its rich characters and thrilling story, but most of all due to the artistry displayed in each frame of both Spider-Verse movies so far. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse managed to improve on the original animated film's innovative visual style, taking things to the next level. That was only possible due to Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse's crew being extremely talented and having a clear love for the Spider-Man mythos. Hopefully, the trilogy's final movie being delayed allows the film's crew to have healthy working conditions, resulting in Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse being even better than Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.\nSource: Preston Mutanga/Twitter\n"}

The movie makes references to plenty of other films in the franchise, especially with the return of Shawnee Smith as Amanda.\nNow, Josh Stolberg has revealed a cut scene from Saw X that would have taken viewers back to a scene from Saw VI.\nThe scene would have featured John torturing someone with a tank full of piranhas, who would be revealed as an insurance salesman working for William Easton. This scene would have added another reference to the latest film, tying every entry in the franchise together more tightly.\nSaw VI and Saw X are connected thematically, as both entries involve John seeking revenge against those who took advantage of his cancer diagnosis. However, both stories are also tied to each other's events. In Saw VI, it's revealed William did not help John in his attempts to pay for an experimental cancer treatment in Norway. That treatment ended up being the scam featured in the latest film, revealing how both stories are connected to one another.\nIf the Saw VI flashback had happened, it would have more directly showcased how the newest movie was using established plot points to fit it into the timeline. Since Saw X may not be the final movie, a future installment could more directly showcase how both movies are connected.

{"title": "20 Hilarious Quotes From Dumb And Dumber That Are Still Funny Today", "date": "2023-10-09 12:40:28", "text": "Dumb and Dumber may not be the smartest comedy movie in the world, but it has some great lines that fans are still quoting today. \nThe best Dumb and Dumber quotes still have fans laughing nearly 30 years after it was first released. Dumb and Dumber hit the big screen and changed the comedy world forever with a hilarious and silly story of misadventures and a strangely endearing friendship. Lloyd Christmas (Jim Carrey) embarked on a quest with his best friend Harry Dunne (Jeff Daniels) in search of true love. Audiences loved director Peter Farrelly's celebration of two guys lacking in brain matter while embracing the spirit of adventure. It also gave rise to a ton of timeless Dumb and Dumber quotes that inspired an endless eternity of memes.\nThe movie saw Jim Carrey at the height of his popularity in the 1990s and added in a normally straight-guy actor in Jeff Daniels to ham it up throughout the running time. While the film had a prequel and a sequel, neither came close to the brilliance of the original, which launched the Farrelly brothers into comedy movie superstars. Even the brothers, who went on to make movies like There's Something About Mary and Me, Myself & Irene, couldn't reach the level of hilarious quotes that this debut movie delivered in its 106-minute running time.\nRELATED: The 50 Best Movies Of All Time\nThe casting idea of Nicolas Cage as Harry in Dumb and Dumber is certainly interesting, there is no denying that Jeff Daniels is perfect for the role. Whereas Jim Carrey's Lloyd is a loud and manic dim-wit, Harry is more of a buffoonish manchild which can be almost charming at times. When first meeting Mary Swanson, the two start talking about dogs and Harry reveals the unusual breeding he did with a bulldog and a shih-tzu and that they called it a \"bull-s***.\" The way Harry laughs and takes such glee in his own stupid joke is what makes it such a funny moment.\nWhile Joe Mentalino (Mike Starr) hitches a ride with Harry and Lloyd, he knows he's in for a ride with a pair of dumb individuals. However, he may have underestimated just how dumb these two are. For example, at one point, in one of the best Dumb and Dumber quotes of them all, Lloyd asks Joe, \"Hey, you wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world?\" Now, thanks to Lloyd, you can still hear to this day the occasional \"EEEEEEEEEEE!\" screech. It was one of Jim Carrey's most annoying moments in movies.\nIt is interesting to consider that the adventures of Harry and Lloyd might make for a movie that could work as a television show. This becomes apparent within the first few minutes of Dumb and Dumber when Harry and Lloyd both lose their jobs and start searching for new ones, suggesting they bounce from job to job quite regularly. It is also not just that they are incompetent in their jobs, but also that they don't seem to have any motivation to work. After returning from a day of job hunting Harry complains that there are absolutely no jobs available anywhere with Lloyd scoffing at the idea that 40 hours a week is not a reasonable request. Watching a show based on their frequent job searches would be a lot of fun.\nHarry makes this wacky comment about a physical map while the duo drives. What's surprising about Harry's ridiculous comment isn't the fact he has no clue the map's measurements are scaled down, it's more that he has any semblance of an idea about how to use a map. While people born after 2000 have likely never used a real map, this remains one of the best Dumb and Dumber quotes because Harry takes it that one step further in his ignorance. Even people using GPS know that the distance shown is not real.\nWhen thinking of heartthrobs from the '90s, people think of Brad Pitt, John Stamos, or George Clooney. However, there is one who thinks he stands above the rest - Lloyd Christmas. The man believed he knew how to let the ladies know he was single and ready to mingle. He also knew that he couldn't come across as desperate when wanting to pick up a woman. This led to him telling his buddy Harry one of the best Dumb and Dumber quotes, saying, \"I’m going to hang by the bar. Put out the vibe.\" The funny line is made better by Jim Carrey's performance.\nWhen Lloyd was working as a driver, he decided to throw out his own icebreaker to a client. However, not even Lloyd realizes how dumb he sounded delivering one of the best Dumb and Dumber quotes in the movie. In the movie itself, the scene just gets dumber and dumber when Mary Swanson (Lauren Holly) asks Lloyd how he figured it out. This is when Lloyd showed he wasn't as dumb as most people might believe. \"Well, I saw your luggage. Then when I noticed the airline ticket I put two and two together.\"\nThe early sequence of Lloyd dropping Mary off at the airport is one of the many Dumb and Dumber scenes that still make audiences laugh. It culminates with the hilarious image of Lloyd heroically running down the jet way to deliver Mary's briefcase only for the plane to already be gone and Lloyd to fall out onto the runway. As funny as it is, it may not be an unusual occurrence for Lloyd. When Harry asks how his day was, Lloyd responds, \"Not bad. Fell off the jet way again.\" The idea this happens so often that it is barely noteworthy makes the whole idea that much funnier.\nLloyd is clearly not the brightest, evidenced by this mixup of similar sounding countries. When it comes to Lloyd and his best Dumb and Dumber quotes, he not only got them confused but looked like a complete idiot to everyone when he did so. When Lloyd found someone who was from Austria, he decided to try to mimic their dialect. However, he yelled out \"g'day, mate. Let's put another shrimp on the barbie,\" which is a way to mock an Australian dialect. Of course, only person mocked here was Lloyd.\nWhile Lloyd is the kind of person who thinks he can \"vibe\" by the bar and the women will come to him (they don't), Harry is a lot less secure in his willingness to approach women. When he does at that same party, he delivers one of the best Dumb and Dumber lines but does it in a completely innocent manner. When Mary (Lauren Holly) is standing alone, Harry walks up and says \"nice set of hooters you got there.\" While she was taken aback, he was actually talking about a pair of owls she was looking at in a cage.\nThe first half of Dumb and Dumber is one of the great road trip comedies that allows for endless hijinks with Harry and Lloyd on the open road. As with most road trip comedies, there is a scene with the duo being pulled over by the police. While the actual scene with the cop offers one of the many gross-out gags in the movie, the biggest laugh comes from Harry's response to the cop telling him to pull over. It is hard not to laugh at the idea of Harry assuming the cop has his lights and siren on and pulls up to their window just to ask Harry about his fashion choices.\nTo the people of Boston, Cam Neely will always be a hockey legend, finishing with such a historic hockey career. For everyone else outside Massachusetts and the hockey world, he's simply known as Sea Bass. It's a cameo a select group can fully appreciate, but anyone who's seen Dumb and Dumber knows Sea Bass for spitting in Harry's burger after getting hit in the head with a salt shaker. As Sea Bass approaches Harry and Lloyd's table, one of his friends yelled out one of the best Dumb and Dumber quotes. And it still holds up today in pretty much any setting.\nRELATED: Every Jim Carrey Movie Ranked Worst To Best\nThe best Dumb and Dumber quotes are quick. A few seconds at most. This one lasts about 12 seconds, yet still remains one of the greats from Dumb and Dumber. Jeff Daniels has been in some impressive roles through the years, branching well outside of comedy. However, this could be his greatest moment as an actor, ever. For the first time, it actually feels like Harry is about to lose it on Lloyd. Nine seconds into what feels like a father scolding his son, audiences were reminded exactly how dumb Harry is. \"Just when I think you couldn’t possibly be any dumber, you go and do something like this… and totally redeem yourself!\"\nLloyd started off this with a question for Mary. He asked, \"What do you think the chances are of a guy like you and a girl like me... ending up together?\" Harry and Lloyd had come a long way to find Mary and let her know how he feels. When she said the chances are \"not good,\" he asks, if that means one in a hundred chance. She said it was more like one in a million, and this made Lloyd happy. He smiled and said, \"so you're tellin' me there's a chance\" before letting out a cheer. The line is so funny that it has gone on to become a popular meme.\nHarry and Lloyd routinely got the wrong end of the stick, especially when it came to cultural references. When deciding on a plan for meeting Mary Swanson, Lloyd relies on an overabundance of confidence, even if it leaves him looking dumber than ever before. A strumpet is a female prostitute, which is a far cry from his intended cultural reference regarding the inviting of guests in for tea and crumpets, where the original saying came from. Much like the Austrian confusion, it proves that Lloyd is always sure he has a great one-liner, even when he has no clue what he is talking about.\nAlready down on their luck and out of work, Harry and Lloyd reached their breaking point when two thugs spied them in a case of mistaken identity. Before exiting their home, the thugs left a little parting gift in the favor of a dead bird whose head they twisted off. The two hapless friends returned home to find the dead bird in the cage, and it was the straw that broke the camel's back. After Jim Carrey's Lloyd delivered one of the best Dumb and Dumber quotes, it was the final excuse they needed to do a cross-country tour to Aspen in search of greener pastures, and in search of Lloyd's love of his life.\nPlenty of younger viewers might not understand the meaning of this quip, and this was even the case back in 1994. Lloyd trolls the diner waitress with this question, calling her Flo, causing Harry to fly into a fit of hysterical laughter. The quote references the 1976 sitcom Alice, starring Linda Lavin as a diner waitress named Alice Hyatt. She had a feisty red-haired co-worker at the diner played by Polly Holliday named Florence Jean \"Flo\" Castleberry. With them constantly calling her over as \"Flo,\" it was a joke that almost no one understood outside the pair.\nWhen Lloyd catches Harry going on dates with Mary Swanson after promising to set the two up on a date, his world shatters. Rather than confront Harry about his two-timing, Lloyd decides to wait it out and see how his former best friend will react. After asking Lloyd why Mary would want to meet him at a bar at 9 a.m. instead of 9 p.m., Lloyd offers up a pitch-perfect response that betrays his own shallowness and empty-headed views on life. In one of the best Dumb and Dumber quotes, he just assumed something incorrect about her.\nDrowning his sorrows at the bar after thinking Mary Swanson stood him up, Lloyd waits to no avail. Finally, the bartender gives him the address where Mary is staying so that he can go meet her there. Excited beyond belief, Lloyd prepares to rush out of the bar before spotting a framed picture of the Apollo moon landing. Evidently, not one to keep up with current events, Lloyd yells out America's greatest triumph to a confused crowd. In one of the best Dumb and Dumber quotes, Lloyd proved that he knows almost nothing outside his own personal bubble.\nThe later Dumb and Dumber movies never reached the heights of the original making the sequel and prequel feel unnecessary. It is especially true when looking back on the ending of the first movie and seeing how perfectly it left these two characters. After failing to find their fortune and love with Mary Swanson, Harry and Lloyd are hitchhiking along the highway when a fan full of bikini models stops and says they are looking for assistants to help lotion them up. Harry points them to the next town to look for available men.\nAs the bus pulls away, Lloyd finally realizes Harry's mistake and waves them down again, giving them more accurate directions. The fact that the friends were presented with their happy ending but were too dim to recognize it is a perfect place to leave these two -- blissfully ignorant together.\nCarefully budgeting for their cross-country adventure to Aspen, Harry and Lloyd stop off to pick up a few items for the trip. Harry notices Lloyd eating some snacks which he believes were not part of the budget. When Lloyd mentions that he raised $25 bucks by selling a few things to a blind kid named Billy, Harry becomes suspicious. Eventually, Lloyd spills the beans, admitting that he sold Harry's dead bird Petey to Billy before fleeing the city. When Harry reminds Lloyd that Petey no longer has a head, the former assures him that he took care of it in a horrifying Dumb and Dumber moment.\n\nColin McCormick is a Senior Writer with Screen Rant and has been a proud member of the team since 2019.

{"title": "Why Seinfeld Season 1 Only Has 5 Episodes", "date": "2023-10-09 12:50:25", "text": "Seinfeld is a classic TV sitcom that ran for nine seasons through the '90s, but the show's first season only consists of five episodes.\nFor a show about nothing, Seinfeld has certainly made a substantial stamp on the public consciousness ― so it's a surprise that the classic '90s sitcom initially had so few episodes, with just five allocated to season 1. As well as boosting comedian and future Bee Movie star Jerry Seinfeld's career, the comedy broke the formulaic mold of TV comedies, providing characters that were less corny and focusing on their mundane and absurd conversations. While some parts of Seinfeld are hard to watch now, for the most part, its lack of moral lessons and character growth is refreshing, elevating the show to one of the best ever made.\nThe sitcom follows a fictional version of Jerry Seinfeld, along with his friends Elaine and George, and his neighbor Kramer. The plotlines of Seinfeld tie into the comedian's observational humor, showing the absurd incidents and meandering conversations that give him his material. Seinfeld's stand-up segments on the show provide a more original structure too, even if scornful references to \"airplane food\" jokes persist among the show's critics. Despite this originality, though ― as well as breaking out a strong cast, including comedic heavyweight Julia Louis-Dreyfus ― Seinfeld ​​​​​​season 1 is only five episodes long.\nRelated: Seinfeld Cast & Character Guide\nWhen Seinfeld was created in 1989, Jerry Seinfeld was a stand-up comedian, with a pivot to sitcoms being a risk. He and Larry David pitched the show to NBC as The Seinfeld Chronicles. The pilot did badly, though, with test audiences unimpressed by the supporting cast, and bemused by the undramatic plot ― in this case, about Jerry trying to read a woman's \"signals.\" Even getting five episodes was a struggle. Seinfeld wasn't picked up at all until TV boss Rick Ludwin canceled some of his projects to fund four more episodes. As reported by The Chicago Tribune, \"without Ludwin, there would have been no Seinfeld.\"\nThe show is now considered one of the all-time classics, spawning iconic pop culture moments such as Festivus and the Soup Nazi, but these elements came after the first and worst of Seinfeld's nine seasons. In addition to initially having a much clunkier name, Seinfeld's pilot episode was also missing Elaine. Seinfeld season 1 as a whole has a 76% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes, compared to the perfect 100% sustained from season 2 through season 5. The sitcom needed time to find its voice and try out different plot structures, and luckily that tiny inaugural run of five episodes gave it a good grounding to then begin doing so.\nNBC's reluctance to extend Seinfeld past one episode proved to be unfounded. The first season attracted solid ratings ― particularly episode 2, \"The Stake Out,\" which follows Jerry hanging out by a woman's office to get her name and number after missing the opportunity at a party. The Wrap reports that Seinfeld season 1 was the 17th most-watched show at the time, enough to secure it a renewal. Season 2 was longer, spanning a more conventional 12 episodes. This let the show really come into its own, as the second season was funnier and more well-formed, putting Seinfeld on the path to becoming the pop culture colossus it remains today.\nSources: The Chicago Tribune, The Wrap\n"}
{"title": "&quot;Wipe The Blood Off My Floor&quot;: Emily's Fair Play Closure Explained By Director", "date": "2023-10-09 12:59:27", "text": "Director Chloe Domont explains the closure that Phoebe Dynevor’s Emily achieves at the end of Fair Play, Netflix’s new erotic thriller.\nWarning! Spoilers ahead for Fair Play.\nThis article contains discussion of sexual assault.\nFair Play director Chloe Domont explains Emily's final moments in the movie and how the character achieves closure. After premiering earlier this year at Sundance and earning strong reviews, Fair Play was finally released at the beginning of October on Netflix. The erotic thriller stars Bridgerton's Phoebe Dynevor as Emily and Solo: A Star Wars Story's Alden Ehrenreich as Luke, two analysts at the cutthroat hedge fund whose relationship begins to violently deteriorate when one of them receives a promotion.\nFollowing its release on Netflix last week, Domont now breaks down the Fair Play ending in a recent interview with Elle. The director explains the significance of Emily telling Luke to clean his blood off her floor and leave, detailing how the moment intersects with Luke's own arc after she cuts him with the kitchen knife and forces him into submission. Check out Domont's full comment below:\n“We’ve seen her go back to him before, and so I wanted to just tee up the audience to believe, ‘Oh my God, is she going to go back together with him again? Is this going to be a moment where they just both submit to a life of pain and dysfunction?’ \n“As you’re sitting with that, then she undercuts him with the [line], which is, ‘No, I’m actually done with this, and I’m done with you.’ It’s almost like she holds him for the last time, and once she does that for the last time, it’s a light switch. She’s now past it, and she’s out, and that’s it.\n“This is a man who refuses to accept this submissive role…but as soon as she forces him into submission, that’s when he’s able to release it all.”\nRelated: 15 Best Erotic Thrillers\nWhile Luke and Emily start Fair Play as a happy couple, things quickly go downhill after Dynevor's character is promoted to a leadership role that Luke thought he was going to get. Over the course of the film, Luke's jealously boils over, unearthing far more than just his competitive professional edge. Luke refuses to accept his own shortcomings as a person and genuinely believes that the only conceivable reason she would earn the promotion over him is if she was sleeping with their boss.\nAfter a screaming match in which Emily tells Luke the truth – that not only was he not considered for the promotion, but that their boss actually hired him as a favor to a friend and hopes that he quits – Luke truly goes off the rails. Still, he can't accept Emily's version of events. The anger and resentment building within him eventually culminates with a scene in which he violently sexual assaults Emily in a restaurant bathroom, a physical manifestation of the abuse and manipulation he's subjected her to throughout the film.\nFair Play's ending confrontation sees Emily reclaim a position of power, shutting down Luke's manipulation and exerting her own dominance after the sexual assault. Genuinely afraid for his life, Luke collapses to his knees and finally accepts his own failures, apologizing and pleading that he will do anything to make Emily feel okay after his actions. Only after Luke has reached a state of total submission has Emily achieved her goal, her justice, with Fair Play's final scenes hammering home just how these two characters will be totally changed moving forward.\nSource: Elle\n"}
{"title": "Martin Scorsese Explains How Lily Gladstone Became The Heart Of Killers Of The Flower Moon", "date": "2023-10-09 13:00:27", "text": "Killers of the Flower Moon counts on Lily Gladstone's Mollie for its heart, and filmmaker Martin Scorsese breaks down why she was so integral.\nWhile Killers of the Flower Moon may focus on the villainous actions of William K. Hale (played by Robert De Niro) and his associates, Martin Scorsese's latest epic also calls for empathy and understanding for the Native Americans who suffered at their hands. Based on David Grann's nonfiction book of the same name, the movie follows the murders of several members of the Osage Nation in the 1920s and the systems that allowed the killers to continue unabated for so long. Lily Gladstone, who plays Mollie Burkhart, has emerged as a standout both due to her character's resilience in the face of tragedy and her own powerhouse performance.\nWhile at a global press conference for the movie, Screen Rant asked Scorsese about the importance of Lily Gladstone's character in Killers of the Flower Moon and how he worked with her to achieve the right balance. The acclaimed director then explained how his take on the story grew from spending time with the Osage people and building on the very real yet complicated love story between Ernest (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and Mollie, as well as how Gladstone contributed to making her character more of a focus. Read his full answer below:\nMartin Scorsese: The key to Mollie that I discovered from visiting and spending some time with the Osage in Pawhuska and Gray Horse [is that] a lot of the people still are related to many of the people in the story. A lot of the families still still exist, of course. Rather than victimization — to make it simplified, so that we can accept that because we've seen that, and it makes it less threatening to those of us in power, so to speak — [I wanted] to actually get to the person.\nAnd the person was interesting to me, because not only was she a resistor, as they called her; a person who was resisting the new ways, which were destroying the culture. But she also was very sharp; very intelligent. And the key was that she was actually — from what I understand — in love with Ernest, and he was in love with her. They have this love story, and yet he is helping other people kill her sisters. He may be poisoning her; all of this going on. We were fascinated by how they stayed together. Not necessarily why they stayed together. In love, there's no why. That's we wanted to explore; the love and the trust, the betrayal and then still the love until finally she has to leave him. She left him after the trial in reality. That's our story. The heart of the story was her. That developed that way, all the way through.\nLily kept adding. She had a good relationship with Leo. I think you could see it in the scene where he's driving the cab, and she's in the backseat, and she's saying things in Osage. He says, \"I don't know what you just said, but it must be Indian for handsome devil.\" She starts laughing; that's a total improv. And that really hit it — from that moment on, they took off, trusting each other, working together, and enjoying each other too.\n Killers of the Flower Moon intentionally follows the perspective of the murderers, but Mollie's proximity to them highlights the senselessness of their actions even more. She and Ernest fall in love even as he plots with his uncle to destroy her family for the sake of their oil rights, which requires Gladstone to thread a thin line between being gullible to his charms and being a strong and savvy woman in her own right. Scorsese's insight into the relationship between Gladstone and DiCaprio's characters is part of what makes the movie stand out beyond its depiction of an American travesty.\nRelated: Killers Of The Flower Moon: Release Date, Trailer, Cast, Story & Everything We Know\nFurthermore, Gladstone is tasked with being one of the sole Native American viewpoints in a story about atrocities committed against the Osage Nation. Although Killers of the Flower Moon improved its Native representation after script revisions, Gladstone is still the primary personal connection between the white settler scam artists and their victims. The pain she endures as her sisters die one by one is magnified by the fact that the only person she can trust is her husband, whom the audience knows is the very person perpetrating the unconscionable acts against her family.\nGladstone recently wowed audiences in Fancy Dance, where her impeccable performance shed light on the harsh reality faced by many Native women. In Killers of the Flower Moon, she is once again able to give voice to a previously silenced population and bring an overlooked story to the forefront. De Niro and DiCaprio may be the names audiences know when they enter the theater, but Gladstone will be who they remember when they leave it.\n"}
{"title": "Marvel's Original Plan For The Skrulls Was Repeatedly Upset By Legal Problems", "date": "2023-10-09 13:00:27", "text": "Before the MCU’s Phases 3, 4, and 5 delved deeper into the Skrulls, Marvel had another plan for the aliens that was constantly ruined by legal issues.\nBefore Secret Invasion offered a showcase for the green, shape-shifting Marvel aliens, the MCU had a different plan for the Skrulls that was repeatedly upset by legal issues. Throughout the MCU's Infinity Saga and the beginning section of the Multiverse Saga, the Skrulls have only been focused on with any real detail in two projects. The first of these was Captain Marvel, the 2019 film centered on the titular heroine navigating the complex politics of a Kree-Skrull war before figuring out the latter people were simply displaced refugees whose image had been shattered and skewed by the propaganda of a tyrannical empire.\nThis then led to Secret Invasion, a continuation of Captain Marvel's story that continued explaining Marvel Comics’ Skrulls differently. In the show, the Skrulls were still searching for somewhere to call home. This time, the story centered on Nick Fury battling against Gravik, a radicalized Skrull hellbent on taking Earth as his home due to decades of false promises, displacement, and overall oppression by the people of the cosmos. While promising, the execution of Marvel's Secret Invasion fell flat and would have been improved if Marvel's original plans for the Skrulls that were crippled by legal problems had come to fruition.\nWhile the MCU may have plans for Secret Invasion's lingering plot threads in upcoming Marvel Disney+ shows, it is worth exploring the set-up for the story to get to the heart of Marvel Studios' initial plan. Surprisingly, the first tease of the MCU's Skrulls came as far back as 2013. After the successful release of 2012's The Avengers, Marvel TV began developing a spin-off TV show with Avengers director Joss Whedon on board. This idea spiraled into Marvel's Agents of SHIELD, a show that ran for seven seasons and essentially established its own continuity that has led to the long debate of whether Agents of SHIELD is Marvel canon.\nDespite this debate, the MCU show's earlier seasons were certainly deemed so with strong connections to movies like The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Interestingly though, Agents of SHIELD's first season held connections to the Skrulls, therefore linking to 2019's Captain Marvel rather than the aforementioned projects that were released in a similar time frame in 2013. These connections were first teased in Agents of SHIELD season 1, episode 4, \"Eye Spy.\"\nIn this episode, the story sees the titular agents travel to the Todorov Building, a research facility in Belarus. As they enter, a chalkboard can be seen adorning one of the sets. On this chalkboard, an alphabet is written in Skrull language that was taken directly from Marvel Comics. This proves to be the first canonical reference - canon status of the show notwithstanding - to the Skrulls in the MCU, proving just how far back Marvel Studios began setting up the green, shape-shifting aliens of the universe.\nAfter this fun MCU Easter egg linked to the Skrulls in Agents of SHIELD, Marvel Studios began implementing other ways to foreshadow the alien race in the MCU. That said, these numerous plans fell through concerning legal issues surrounding the rights to the Skrulls and their usage. Before 20th Century Fox was acquired by Disney, the studio co-owned the rights to several Marvel Comics characters with Marvel Studios. Some of these included the likes of Quicksilver - explaining why the speedster appeared in both Fox's X-Men franchise and Avengers: Age of Ultron as two different versions - and Scarlet Witch.\nAnother of these co-owned Marvel properties was the Skrulls, meaning either 20th Century Fox or Marvel Studios could utilize the alien race on film. That said, some individual members of the Skrull race were wholly owned by 20th Century Fox including a major Skrull character named KI'rt, the original Super-Skrull. Given that Secret Invasion dealt with the concept of Super-Skrulls, setting this idea up between 2013 and 2019 - the latter year being when Disney could begin using Fox-owned properties after the acquisition - would not have been possible.\nIn light of this impossibility, several MCU plans to include the Skrulls fell through due to the legal issues involved with tying the aliens into an overarching story. While the Skrulls in a broader sense could have been included in various Marvel projects, they could not have been tied to any larger story given that Skrull characters with any import from Marvel Comics were owned by another studio. This meant that, despite the first tease of the Skrulls coming in 2013 with Agents of SHIELD, no other Easter eggs, references, or connections to the aliens amounted to anything until 2019's Captain Marvel after the Fox-Disney merger had taken place.\nAs is known from the state of Marvel Studios' Phase 5 of the MCU, these legal issues were completely resolved after the acquisition of 20th Century Fox by Disney. This meant that Super-Skrulls and other major storylines involving the aliens could finally be used as evident with 2023's Secret Invasion. That said, the show was a disappointment to many due to its low production value despite an inflated budget, lack of consequences, absence of wider MCU connections, and the waste of the premise that promised a big storyline for the Skrulls like the comic run of the same name from Marvel Comics.\nConcerning the poor reception of Secret Invasion, the original Skrull plans that fell through for Marvel between 2013 and 2019 could have improved, and even saved, the Phase 5 show centering on the shape-shifters. Initially, it was thought that the Skrulls would be the villains of 2012's The Avengers with some merchandising even featuring the aliens before the film's release. However, this proved not to be the case with director Joss Whedon offering his reasoning for the Chitauri being the villainous army invading New York under Loki's rule in an interview with Entertainment Weekly.\nHowever, the Skrulls being the primary villains of Phase 1 of the MCU alongside Loki would have benefited Secret Invasion by setting up their warmongering ways. While the MCU eventually chose a different direction with the Skrulls in Captain Marvel, perhaps the set-up of some Skrulls being bloodthirsty invaders while others are simply displaced refugees almost 10 years before Secret Invasion could have provided more context to the Phase 5 story. Furthermore, an interview with IGN in 2017 confirmed that James Gunn, writer-director of the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy, had plans for the Skrulls in his first two MCU films.\nGunn confirmed that he has always had a fondness for the Skrulls and their Marvel Comics stories when he was asked about Captain Marvel's usage of the alien race. Gunn stated that he had looked at ways to use the Skrulls in the first two Guardians movies that \"didn't work out for one reason or another.\" The cosmic connections between the Guardians films and Captain Marvel could have provided some backstory and history of the Skrulls before their introduction in the latter film, subsequently aiding how they were used in Secret Invasion and improving that show as a result.\nFinally, the last failed plan for the Skrulls was connected to another 2019 film: Spider-Man: Far From Home. The Skrulls were used to an extent in this film though not as centrally as Captain Marvel when it was revealed that Nick Fury and Maria Hill had been Skrull impostors throughout the entire film. This certainly conceptually teased Secret Invasion and the idea that any Marvel character could be a Skrull, though was not focused on in any major way that had much relevance to Far From Home's plot.\nRelated: Marvel Did Secret Invasion Already 7 Years Ago And It Was Way Better\nIn an interview with Variety, Spider-Man: Far From Home's writers Erik Sommers and Chris McKenna confirmed that early versions of the film's script involved the Skrulls much more heavily than the final product. This was dropped by director Jon Watts in an attempt to reduce the amount of plot twists featured in the project. This was later further detailed in an interview with Collider when McKenna and Sommers stated that, in very early drafts of the film, the main villain Mysterio would have been a Skrull character.\nThis plot twist, and the general idea of including more Skrulls in a way that affected the plot, would have definitely improved Secret Invasion. While again, the reveal of Fury and Hill as Skrulls adequately teased the concept of Skrull impostors on Earth, the lack of relevance the reveal had on the plot was a misfire. If a Skrull impostor had an integral impact on Far From Home's plot, the idea of Secret Invasion's anxiety-inducing impostor story would have been enhanced. Unfortunately, none of these plans from Marvel made it to film or TV, proving Secret Invasion's weaknesses and the impact legal issues had on the Phase 5 TV show.\n"}
{"title": "The Blair Witch Project's Filming Conditions Sound Scarier Than The Actual Movie", "date": "2023-10-09 13:00:27", "text": "In addition to its found-footage format, the authentic feel of The Blair Witch Project can be attributed to the movie's disturbing working conditions.\nThe 1999 release of The Blair Witch Project was a game-changer for horror cinema, but the behind-the-scenes story of its production and filming conditions is scarier than the movie itself. The Blair Witch Project helped to set a trend with found footage movies, inspiring a new wave of popularity for the horror subgenre. At the time, the found footage concept was so unique that audiences believed The Blair Witch Project was a true story.\nThe Blair Witch Project follows three film students who disappear after heading into a Maryland forest to film a documentary on the titular local legend. The movie is told through the students' camera footage, and it was filmed with a Hi8 camcorder and a 6mm camera, giving it a realistic POV feel as the found footage format effectively immerses viewers in the experience. However, The Blair Witch Project's authentic feel is as much due to the actors' experiences behind the scenes as the footage itself.\nRelated: Blair Witch Project Ending Explained - All Your Questions Answered\nThe production of The Blair Witch Project was a harrowing experience for its cast. To achieve authenticity, directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez sent inexperienced actors into the wilderness to fend for themselves. According to Vice, the actors camped out for eight days with minimal guidance while filming. They were given GPS trackers to locate shooting spots and provided limited food rations to provoke irritability. The filmmakers intentionally made noise in the woods at night to increase the actors' fear and exhaustion. Directors escalated their interference throughout the eight days, which is evident in the increasing impatience and desperation seen in the film.\nIn order for The Blair Witch Project to be genuinely terrifying, the film needed to come across as authentic. To achieve this, the filmmakers required amateur actors to immerse themselves in their roles fully. To further enhance the realism, the actors' real first and last names were used in the film. It was important that these actors were new to the film industry and unrecognizable. Their lack of experience also contributed to a more authentic performance, as they had no basis for comparison. Overall, their inexperience played a crucial role in creating the realistic appearance of the film, which led to it becoming a phenomenal hit at the box office.\nRelated: Every Blair Witch Project Movie Ranked, Worst to Best\nOne of the most influential horror films of the 20th century, The Blair Witch Project inspired movies such as Paranormal Activity, REC, and V/H/S. Due to its success, The Blair Witch Project released a sequel in 2000, and a remake of the original was made in 2016. These subsequent films failed to capture the authenticity and chilling essence of the original. Although some of the filming tactics used may seem extreme and even cruel, it is evident that the directors recognized the significance of eliciting authentic reactions and emotions from the actors. Whether or not the filmmakers went too far is open to debate, but the outcome was undoubtedly flawless.\nSource: Vice\n"}

In spite of abandoning the controversial RPG-style gameplay of the past several entries in the Assassin's Creed franchise, Assassin's Creed Mirage maintains an impressive array of customization options - most significantly in the character aesthetic department. Though the latest installment in the series has a limited supply of unique outfits and costumes when compared with previous installments, the developer has evidently elected to value quality over quantity as the vast majority of Assassin's Creed Mirage's apparel options are exceptionally well-designed - though, inevitably, some are so much better than others.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nSet in ninth-century Baghdad, Assassin's Creed Mirage is a relative tour de force and a remarkable return to the franchise's long-lost glory; although it is not perfect, it certainly rectifies many of the mistakes of past games. A core component of any Assassin's Creed game is the ability to customize the protagonist's appearance - and in this department, Assassin's Creed Mirage really shines. The apparel customization options available to the player fall into two categories — outfits and costumes — though outfits offer Basim Ibn Ishaq invaluable perks, the game's numerous costumes should not be overlooked as they are visually excellent.\nRelated:Assassin's Creed Mirage Ending Explained (In Detail)\nThe Sand Outfit is only available in-game as part of the DLC that comes as part of the Deluxe Edition of Assassin’s Creed Mirage - a fact made even more disappointing by its inclusion of the valuable perk Second Chance. A perk ensures that Basim can survive a lethal hit per combat and temporarily slow down time once during a battle. The outfit is visually interesting, with white pants, tan leather riding boots, and an effortlessly stylish loose-flowing long fabric tied around Basim's waist. Whilst the outfit lacks significant abdomen coverage, it does contain wrist guards and a leather strap over the shoulder and chest.\nComing with perhaps the greatest perk of any outfit in Assassin's Creed Mirage, Silent Blade, the Initiate of Alamut outfit, although the apparel Basim wears from the start of his time as an Assassin, is one of the coolest outfits in the game. The Initiate of Alamut outfit is dominated by a two-tone full-body light-fabric gown which, although airy, appears to be well tailored to Basim's body. Beyond this, the outfit features a matching shawl and near-ubiquitous dark leather boots, wrist wraps, and waist protection. Even if this understated aesthetic does not impress, the perk certainly will, as it lessens the noise emitted by Basim during assassinations.\nRelated: \"What [Players] Loved First\" - Simon Arseneault On Assassin's Creed Mirage\nObtaining the Hidden One Outfit is fairly easy; it is located on the roof of the Shurta Headquarters in the Round City, which, although heavily defended, should not pose an insurmountable challenge. The outfit is not the most cohesive of designs; however, it is thematically appropriate given the setting. Featuring a shawl scarf concealing Basim's head and obscuring his face, as well as ornately designed greaves and gauntlets, the outfit of the Hidden One is visually interesting. The highlight of the design, however, is the complex belt/waist protection, which is reminiscent of a number of classic Assassin's Creed designs.\nAlthough costumes are purely cosmetic and lack any innate perks or abilities, some costumes, such as the Treasure Hunter Costume, certainly make up for this. Obtained by completing the \"Dervis’ Shop\" side quest, the Treasure Hunter Costume appears as though it would be a perfect choice for someone searching for treasure in a desert. With a long-flowing, light-fabricated tunic, and matching shawl scarf, as well as added protection for the shoulders, wrists, waist, and legs, the Treasure Hunter Costume is thematically perfect for a desert environment. Although subtle, it is one of the coolest costumes in the game.\nThe costume of a scholar in the House of Wisdom, the Scholar Costume, is the perfect choice for an assassin planning on masquerading as a man of learning. This ornately designed costume features a robe similar to a short Mufti, with an intricate arab-eqsue design. Beyond this, it also contains a thick waist wrap and a shawl tied in a manner reminiscent of a turban. The composition of this design is stunning; every component compliments the rest, resulting in an elegant yet battle-ready design. The Scholar Costume is obtained after completing the side quest given by Al-Jahiz's in which Basim locates a number of lost books.\nThe outfit of a Zanj rebel is possibly the most complex to locate and acquire in Assassin's Creed Mirage - it is also a time-consuming process to upgrade. Despite this, the aesthetic certainly justifies the effort of obtaining it. The Zanj Uprising outfit is cosmetically simple but a perfect look for the medieval sandy setting. It is dominated by what appears to be a single piece of fabric that is manipulated into a shawl that extends down Basim's body all the way to his knees. Accompanying this is a vibrant red waistband and a golden scarf descending from the waist - overall, this is a very satisfying composition.\nAlthough it comes with a disappointingly poor perk in Lick Your Wounds, the Abbasid Knight Outfit is one of the better cosmetic options in Assassin's Creed Mirage. The outfit, although perhaps cumbersome for an assassin, features a long white tunic, as well as an ornately designed brass Cuirass, helmet, greaves, and a pair of gauntlets. The combination of light-flowing fabric and sturdy metal armor is a perfect metaphor for the agile yet powerful Basim — beyond this subtextual analysis, the design is simply brilliant and undoubtedly one of the coolest in the latest installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise.\nThe attire of a merchant who comes from the Far East can be purchased from Shopkeepers for 500 Dirham after beginning the quest “Baghdad Bound.” The Far East Merchant Costume is one of the most elaborate in Assassin's Creed Mirage; despite its colorful and complex design, it remains elegant rather than gaudy. This ostentatious costume features a stunning color palate of various layered fabrics, as well as large and pointed shoulder plates. Beyond bold, this design is also intricate and a clear demonstration of attention to detail — as clearly on display with its belt, which contains a coin purse and a number of measuring instruments.\nAlmost undoubtedly the coolest outfit in Assassin's Creed Mirage, the Rostam Outfit is, in lore, the outfit of a legendary hero. This reference to Rostam, a legendary hero from Persian Mythology, is a brilliant instance of Ubisoft paying homage to the culture they built the game around. Unlocked after completing \"The Marked Coins\" contract, the Rostam Outfit is mostly modest yet beautiful, with a few particular highlights that make it so fantastic. Although mostly a gray tunic with a matching shawl scarf, the Rostam Outfit is elevated tenfold by the tiger pelt waist accent and the stunning brass left shoulder guard, which features the grotesque visage of a mythological beast.\nAlthough Assassin's Creed Mirage should be praised for its inclusion of excellently designed thematically appropriate outfits and costumes, undoubtedly the coolest apparel in the game is the homage to Ezio Auditore da Firenze's outfit from arguably the greatest Assassin's Creed game - Assassin's Creed 2. The Master Assassin Costume, though not a perfect reproduction of the iconic outfit, is exceptionally well-designed and a visual reminder of Assassin's Creed Mirage remaining in touch with its roots. Whilst there is a plethora of excellent outfit and costume customization options in Assassin's Creed Mirage, the Master Assassin Costume is undoubtedly the coolest.\nBased in the United Kingdom, Luke Horwitz is a graduate student in English Literature and Arts at the University of Oxford, having earned a BA in Music from the University of York."}
{"title": "Alabasta Eclipsed - One Piece's Wano Ending Overshadows the Series' Most Tearful Moment", "date": "2023-10-09 13:00:27", "text": "One Piece's most emotional arc ending has been surpassed by the new Shogun of Wano's touching declaration, which was more earned than Vivi's.\nWarning: spoilers for One Piece episode #1078\nThe One Piece anime's ending of Wano managed to be even more emotional than Vivi's Alabasta sendoff. Wano saw Pirate Emperors Big Mom and Kaido vanquished. The land's citizens no longer needed to live under the brutal conditions they'd been subjugated to for decades. Luffy and his allies have previously saved kingdoms, but even the tearful goodbye to Alabasta's Princess doesn't compare to the emotions felt after Wano was reclaimed.\nThere have been more than a few heavily emotional arcs throughout One Piece's story. One of the most moving scenes that sticks in many fans' minds is Vivi's decision not to leave Alabasta after Crocodile's defeat. At that point, Vivi had been a prevalent member of the crew throughout several of the anime's early arcs. The drama of that decision, the Marine's pursuit, and the recently quelled Civil War helped make the end of the Alabasta arc incredibly moving for many viewers. However, author Eiichiro Oda has made that ending feel like it was on training wheels compared to the emotions that came after Kaido's defeat in the latest anime arc.\nRelated: One Piece's 25 Best Arcs, Ranked\nMany plot threads built up for years across several arcs finally paid off in episode #1078 of One Piece. Characters like Momonosuke and Kin'emon were introduced as far back as the Punk Hazard arc, which aired in 2013. Since then, Luffy and his crew made significant enemies of two of the world's most powerful pirates, Big Mom and Kaido. As the Straw Hat Crew closed in on Kaido's base of operations on Wano, the once beautiful home of the samurai seemed a lot different from how Luffy's companions remembered it. For over 20 years, Wano's lands had been stripped and poisoned while its citizens endured one of One Piece's most disturbing fates.\nOne of One Piece's least likable characters, Kurozumi Orochi, worked to transform Wano into a weapons factory for Kaido's Beast Pirates. Citizens were made into slaves, starvation was rampant, and Orochi found a way to make things even worse for the hungry people of Wano. Kaido's defective artificial Devil Fruits were fed to the starving citizens, which permanently harmed their brains, causing them only to be able to express joy. The cruel tactic stripped the people of all of their emotions even while their family members were murdered in front of them. Alabasta's citizens did not have to endure such atrocities for 20 years.\nWhile the anime has yet to have the Straw Hats leave Wano, episode #1078 beautifully concluded a horrific journey for the citizens of Wano with a triumphant and well-earned declaration. Momonosuke, the rightful Shogun of Wano who was thought long dead, appeared before his people to reveal that both Kaido and Orochi had been defeated. The touching speech ensured that after 20 years of suffering, the citizens would now be able to eat, drink, and live as they pleased, once again under a ruler who loves their country and its people.\nThe conclusion of the Alabasta arc is a fan-favorite for many good reasons. After becoming entangled with Vivi, Luffy and his crew were on a crash course with the notorious criminal syndicate Baroque Works and its cunning leader, the Warlord of the Sea, Crocodile. The villain manipulated the country's citizens with unnatural droughts and stroked tensions to cause a Civil War, all in his mission to find one of One Piece's ancient weapons that ended up being on Wano instead. Because Crocodile was such a compelling villain, finally watching Luffy take him down was rewarding in itself. Still, the arc's ending is highly regarded for more than its final battle.\nAfter saving Alabasta, the Marines granted the Straw Hats higher bounties, prompting the crew to flee the country before being captured. Thankfully, the Straw Hats were able to make it to their ship, which was being protected by the shape-shifting Baroque Works agent Bon Clay. He was willing to help because Luffy's crew had formed a strong friendship with him before finding out he worked for Crocodile. He felt the bond was so strong that he sacrificed his freedom to distract the Marines for the crew despite only being friends with them briefly. While that gesture was moving, it merely warmed up viewers' tear ducts for Vivi's moment.\nPrincess Vivi was given the choice to continue traveling with the Straw Hats, but it was a difficult decision between that and helping rebuild the country she worked so hard to save. She ultimately decided to stay behind, but her touching speech expressed her overwhelming gratitude and hope that, despite her decision, she was still regarded as a friend of the crew. Under the eye of the approaching Marines, the Straw Hats could not risk proving their connection to Alabasta's Princess. So they each brandished the Xs on their arms toward Vivi as the audience heard Luffy's words, \"No matter what happens, this thing on our left arm is the sign of our friendship!\"\nThere is little debate that Vivi was a more likable character than Momonosuke, which helped Alabasta's ending hit its emotional high. Still, Momo's journey to eventually become the Shogun of Wano was more traumatic for him and his people. After learning about the betrayals, Oden's life, and the story of Kin'emon and each of the Nine Red Scabbards, the desire to see Orochi dead and Wano free mounted to high levels that Alabasta did not.\nSince Wano was the longest arc, there was a lot of time devoted to showcasing the brutal hardships and cruelty its people endured, so when Momonosuke presented himself as the new Shogun that would usher the land into a new dawn, tears erupted from both his people and One Piece viewers. While both endings were fantastic and tear-jerking, Oda has improved his writing skills over One Piece's 24 years of publication to make Wano's plight as miserable as possible, so when its happy ending did come, it felt much more impactful. Time will tell if One Piece will be able to deliver an ending even more impactful than Wano's in its final saga.\nWatch the latest episodes of the One Piece anime on Crunchyroll and Funimation.\nSource: Crunchyroll Collection (1,2,3) /YouTube\nJason Hon is a Game Reviewer, Anime/Manga News Writer, and content creator behind the Mega Manga Mondays Podcast and the Comedic Gaming YouTube Channel Honzy and Friends!

{"title": "20 Best Horror Movies To Watch With Friends", "date": "2023-10-09 13:00:28", "text": "Horror fans looking to have a Halloween bingefest with friends should check out scary movies like The Blair Witch Project and Get Out.\nHorror fans might love to get a good scare alone, but sometimes, it's better to find horror movies to watch with friends. Those who truly love the genre can say that nothing scares them, but it's definitely a little unnerving to watch a scary movie while home alone - especially at night or with the lights off. The best horror movies to watch with friends are familiar slashers or a fresh story that invites discussion. Sometimes a horror movie is best enjoyed in the company of friends who can laugh at a horror comedy or discuss the meaning and characters afterward.\nHorror is such a huge genre with so many subgenres that there can be a lot to discuss. That might mean a B-movie known for an outlandish plot, or it might mean watching a horror film from another country to see how it differs from the mainstream. Those who love horror will also love to watch more meta horror movies with friends to recognize the different tropes of the genre. Modern horror has definitely taken a more meta approach to slashers since the 1990s, but there is still a wealth of horror movies to watch in a group out there.\nRELATED: The Best Horror Movies Of All Time, Ranked\nSome people want to watch horror movies with their friends so that they’ll have someone around when the movies get a little too scary to handle. Others want friends around so they can dissect the movies and discuss what makes them great (or what makes them so bad they’re good). Killer Clowns From Outer Space falls into the latter category.\nThe movie didn’t get great reviews when it was released in 1988, but it’s become a cult classic. It features a group of alien creatures that look like clowns attempting to invade Earth. Nearly all the effects in the movie are practical, making it unique among modern horror, and the unique premise gives the movie some fascinating visuals. A sequel has also been stuck in development since the movie first hit theaters.\nGrabbers is less of a typical slasher or psychological horror and more like a classic monster flick. It’s an Irish film set on a remote Irish island, allowing the story to truly be immersed in the setting.\nHorror events are set off when dead whales start washing up on shore. The local police officer in charge, who happens to be an alcoholic, isn’t all that interested in events, but his new partner is. The two have to team up when it becomes apparent that tentacled monsters are responsible and are now attacking the residents. Surprisingly, the way to battle the monsters seems to be getting really drunk since alcohol is toxic to them. That solution creates a hilarious take on a B-movie horror plot as the characters have to keep their wits about them to battle the monsters while they’re drinking as much as they can.\nIf a group of friends are getting together to watch horror movies, it seems impossible to not take a look at Scream. The 1996 movie is what pushed a meta take on horror in the slasher genre as more fans became aware of the tropes the movies used to tell their stories. Scream uses those tropes incredibly effectively.\nSidney (Neve Campbell) and her friends are attacked by a killer who becomes known as the Ghostface in the first installment of the franchise. If horror fans want to really have a meta-fest for the slasher genre, they should stick with Scream and watch its five sequels. Each sequel evolves with the conventions of the genre, pointing out how slashers change and influence pop culture. They make for great discussion starters.\nRELATED: Most Iconic Ghostface Quotes\nModern Japanese horror that managed to cross over to American audiences includes movies like The Grudge and The Ring. House, however, is a more classic Japanese horror film with a much more surreal take on the genre.\nA group of Japanese girls end up in a country house and have to fight off evil spirits. The visuals in the movie are incredibly unique, and it’s got a great combination of nightmare-like horror as well as comedic elements to lighten the tension It’s definitely a fun ride for horror fans who want to expand their horizons outside the typical US movies.\nIt’s well known that slasher flicks all have a “final girl” that survives to the end. Some of the most famous final girls in pop culture are those in horror classics like Halloween (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Scream (Neve Campbell). The Final Girls takes that idea of an actress being known for her horror status as a final girl and creates a new meta take on horror.\nIn the movie, a young woman (Taissa Farmiga) and her friends attend a fan screening of a horror film her mother is known for while she’s still grieving the loss of her mom. The group finds themselves unwittingly sucked into the events of the movie and trying to survive the 1980s horror tropes it involves. It’s both hilarious and heartfelt and a love letter to horror fans that will allow a group of horror-loving fans to discuss all the ways it examines the genre.\nSince Hereditary is one of the most popular horror movies of the past few years, many horror fans will recommend that friends watch it together, but Don't Look Now might be a more unique option for fans of the genre.\nThere are many movies that inspired Hereditary, including Don't Look Now, and a group of friends could watch both movies for an entertaining and terrifying night in. The movie follows the story of Laura and John, who are grieving the loss of their daughter Christine. They meet people in Venice who say that they can help them contact her spirit. Both movies are about ghosts, religion, and family.\nRELATED: 10 Best Horror Movies About Grief\nHost is also a great pick for a horror movie to watch with friends. Chief among the reasons is because it's not too long of a movie. Horror movies that drag on for too long can have difficulty holding the attention of a group that might do more talking and less watching.\nThere's a lot to discuss with Host, as the main characters talk on Zoom and start realizing that something evil is happening. The movie is relatable as a group who is staying in touch virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic and the friends start being killed by a spirit. Because so many people relied on Zoom to work and stay connected in 2020, it's definitely a modern horror movie that will resonate with the audience.\nIn the 2007 movie [Rec], a journalist named Ángela learns about something awful happening in an apartment building and goes to cover the story. It turns out that the people living there have been taken over by demons and turned into what seem to be zombies.\nIt's a great take on the found footage subgenre of horror. While some horror fans will find it fun, others will find it genuinely frightening. A group of horror fans will definitely have both in the mix, making it a great horror movie to watch with friends who might all get something different out of the movie.\nRELATED: The 10 Best Found Footage Movies, According To Letterboxd\nA movie night with friends calls for a story that is pure joy to watch and also includes some funny moments, which is when a fun horror comedy movie is in order. Horror fans and people who prefer comedies will both love this story of how college students believe that Tucker and Dale are going to hurt them, and the duo is clueless about what to do next.\nIt's also best to watch this movie with some of the group of friends not already familiar with Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil. That way, at least some of the group won't know what to expect, making it particularly fun for them, but just as fun for those who already know the story to see their reactions.\nThe Blair Witch Project is definitely a movie that inspires a great discussion as people can talk about how it was marketed as a true story of students staying in the woods and filming themselves finding a supernatural presence. It's one of the movies that ushered in found footage in the 2000s.\nIt makes for a great discussion among friends watching horror as well as taking a look at other projects inspired by it. Even the teen series Dawson's Creek did an episode inspired by the movie in which the friends went to an island that was said to be haunted.\nA Nightmare On Elm Street is a staple of teen horror movies. It's the kind of horror movie that even those who aren't overly familiar with the genre might enjoy. If a group of friends are getting together to watch horror movies, and they aren't all horror fans, A Nightmare On Elm Street is a good place to start.\nIt's a creative story that still employs a lot of the teen slasher tropes, allowing for a great introduction to horror. While Freddy Krueger kills a lot of people, A Nightmare on Elm Street is still a fun and enjoyable horror movie that works well whether someone is a huge fan of the genre or not.\nWhile some people in a friend group might love terrifying horror movies, others might want something a bit more entertaining than scary. That's where The Legend Of Boggy Creek comes in.\nThe movie is actually similar to the legend of Bigfoot and other cryptids. It's a slower paced horror movie with a little campiness to it instead of violence. Like The Blair Witch Project, this movie says that it really happened and that the Fouke Monster, who is like Bigfoot, is real. Just the discussion of whether the cryptid exists could make for fun party talk.\nThe Cabin in the Woods would be a great horror movie to watch with friends. It's a meta take on the horror genre, but one in which the tropes are turned on their heads. There are also a ton of Easter eggs for fans of the horror genre and for fans of Joss Whedon's earlier work.\nRELATED: 10 Things You Didn’t Know About The Cabin In The Woods On Its 10th Anniversary\nFriends can chat about the wild reveals in this movie, the astonishing monsters, and how some characters can spot the evil in the seemingly picturesque cabin and others have no idea what's about to happen. It's great to watch The Cabin in the Woods with other fans of scary films as everyone can discuss their favorite character and who they are rooting for the most.\nWhile there are some great slasher movie franchises, there are also some stand-alone films that have made a big impression. You're Next is one of those standalone movies.\nIt makes for a great horror movie to watch with friends because it combines many of the best elements of the slasher genre into a unique story. It's the kind of horror movie that makes the audience really root for the main character, but it also features plenty of jump scares and funny moments that will keep the audience watching. Fans will like seeing how Erin handles the scary situation that's in front of her as she goes to her boyfriend's family reunion and discovers killers in animal masks.\nLoan officer Christine (Alison Lohman) sees her life become a horrifying ride when a woman wants more time to pay her mortgage and Christine says no. The movie is incredibly intense and keeps people guessing, which makes it a good choice to watch with a group of people who can discuss it afterward.\nFor horror fans who have already seen the movie, they'll surely have an interesting discussion about the theory that Christine isn't actually in the middle of a horror story, but hallucinations induced by an eating disorder. Theories like that one that allow horror fans to see past the scary moments make for fascinating takes on beloved stories.\nCoherence has a mystery that would be great to unpack with other people after watching, as several friends enjoy dinner together and the power goes out. The characters are certain that something is off here, and they end up being right.\nA dinner party is a perfect setting for a scary movie as the characters are expecting a calm gathering, and instead get quite the opposite. The movie maintains a good, unsettling tone, and it's fun seeing how it reveals its secrets. Horror fans can try to guess what's happening, which would make it even more entertaining.\nSince many horror fans count Get Out as a favorite, it would be compelling to watch it knowing what danger Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) will be in when he visits his girlfriend's parents. Friends can talk about the well-crafted film and the clues that are present throughout the story, as it's clear that something is wrong from the moment that Chris and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) are seen driving through the country.\nThere will definitely be differences in discussion between those who have already seen the movie and those who haven't. A group of friends who haven't all already seen it might be hard to find considering the movie's popularity though.\nReady Or Not is definitely a good pick for a group looking for a horror film that manages to feel both terrifying and also light-hearted. Grace Le Domas (Samara Weaving) is forced to play a lethal game of hide and seek with the family that she married into just hours before, and while she can be killed, the movie maintains a sense of humor.\nTyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin directed both Ready or Not and Scream (2022) and both films show their humorous and vibrant approach to the horror genre. Grace may be in danger, but the family is so silly that it's hard not to laugh and know that she will be okay.\nWhile Skeleton Key, starring Kate Hudson, might seem a bit corny, it's perfect when people are looking for a lighter kind of horror movie that isn't going to be disturbing. Caroline Ellis (Hudson) begins working at a dilapidated mansion as she's an aide, and she learns of a paranormal ritual that is connected to the house.\nRELATED: 10 Kate Hudson Movies, Ranked (According To Rotten Tomatoes)\nThere are a lot of supernatural movies, but this one is distinct as it involves hoodoo, and while some horror fans might say that this is an unrealistic film, others will enjoy sitting back and going on this journey with Caroline.\nDirected by Yeon Sang-ho, Train to Busan tells the tale of people taking a train journey when zombies appear, and it makes for a great horror movie to watch with friends - especially before it gets its American remake.\nThe train setting makes Train to Busan stand out when compared to other films about the apocalypse, and since the characters are stuck, that brilliantly makes the stakes higher. Audiences will root for the characters and friends can discuss how they can escape. Discussions of what friends would do in a similar situation are certainly something horror fans can enjoy while watching any of these movies.\nAya Tsintziras is a Senior Writer at Screen Rant who enjoys writing about TV and movies.

The two characters had lost their entire culture and their history, but despite them going through a similar trauma, they didn't go through the same trauma. Only recently has Superman finally admitted that he vastly underestimated the trauma that Supergirl experienced as a teenager whose entire world was ripped away by disaster.\nSuperman finally realizes just how much he underestimated Kara's trauma in Superman: Lost #7 by Christopher Priest, Carlo Pagulayan, Jason Paz, Lee Weeks, Jeromy Cox, Elizabeth Breitweiser, and Willie Schubert. Superman has been lost in space for decades and hasn't been able to find his way back to Earth. With no other choice, Superman ultimately settles down on a planet and starts a new life.\nUnfortunately, this new planet - which Clark calls 'Kansas' - isn't stable, and begins to collapse, just like Krypton did. Witnessing this event, and the loss of his new home, has given Clark a whole new view of Kara's trauma and strength - something he expresses in the issue's flash-forward to his life when he finally returns to Earth.\nRelated: Supergirl Just Redefined Her Name in the Darkest Way\nOne of the major things that has defined Superman's character is being the \"last son of Krypton.\" Superman was originally meant to truly be the last Kryptonian without any real tangible connection to his past. His entire culture and people were only a faint idea to him, not even a memory. While it's certainly traumatic to lose such a major part of oneself, Clark always managed to deal with it due to the fact he was disconnected from any real experience of Krypton.\nHowever, because Supergirl was a teenager at the time, she remembers her family, friends and culture, and even saw much of the planet's destruction. Clark admits he failed to appreciate this, and acknowledges that he's never given Supergirl credit for being a world-class hero while also processing such enormous loss.\nAfter having lived on the planet Kansas and seeing it be destroyed, losing friends and family that he was unable to save, Superman finally understands what Supergirl went through. Clark is currently trying to deal with the trauma he's experienced, and struggling to resume his former life of heroism. Going through the same process of recovery that Supergirl has needed is changing Clark's perspective, and he feels foolish to have considered himself her mentor when he had so much to learn himself.\nIf he's able to get through his immediate malaise, his bond with Kara will only grow stronger, as for the first time Superman actually understands the burden Supergirl has shouldered while still dedicating her life to others.\nSuperman: Lost #7 is on sale from DC Comics on October 10th!\n"}
{"title": "Why Sean Connery Quit James Bond After 5 Movies (Then Quit Again)", "date": "2023-10-09 13:11:27", "text": "Sean Connery played the iconic spy James Bond across seven movies, but he famously quit the franchise twice throughout his film career.\nSean Connery received high acclaim for his work in the James Bond franchise, but his love/hate relationship with the main role is also well-known and led to him famously quitting the gig twice. The James Bond franchise has been part of the movie industry for over 60 years, and Connery was the first actor to bring its eponymous character to the big screen. He's also still considered by many fans to be the best 007 of all the actors who have played James Bond.\nThere are seven James Bond movies starring Sean Connery, six of which were official franchise installments made by EON Productions. He first left the series after five movies and decided he was done with the 007 role. After the sixth James Bond movie flopped, Connery changed his mind and agreed to come back for Diamonds Are Forever. He then hung up his tuxedo again before returning a decade later for a non-EON movie as James Bond.\nRelated: Every James Bond Movie Ranked From Worst To Best\nBy the time the James Bond franchise had reached its fifth movie, You Only Live Twice, Sean Connery had become bored with his famous role. The actor had become synonymous with James Bond by this point, and he was worried about being typecast in future films. Connery was also fed up with the fame and pressure that came with playing such an iconic character. During the filming of You Only Live Twice, he was hassled by photographers and pursued by unrelenting fans, which only angered him further.\nConnery also didn't have a good relationship with the James Bond franchise's producers and was not happy with his salary of $750,000 plus 25 percent of merchandising for the fifth film. He made it known to EON Productions, the company in charge of the franchise, that he wanted a $1 million salary for the sixth movie. When his request was refused, Connery decided he was done with the James Bond role, and he was replaced by George Lazenby for 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service.\nAfter the critical and commercial failure of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, it was clear that the James Bond franchise was in trouble. George Lazenby left the role after his sole appearance as lead of the franchise, and recasting Bond was up in the air. Producers decided to ask Sean Connery to return for the next film, offering him a salary of $1.25 million to re-star in the franchise. Totally won over by this offer, Sean Connery agreed to return as James Bond in 1971's Diamonds Are Forever. He used his salary from the film to establish the Scottish International Education Trust.\nDiamonds Are Forever proved to be a turning point for the James Bond franchise and gave hope for more movies. But despite being offered a salary of $5.5 million to reprise the role again, Sean Connery turned down Live and Let Die, which instead debuted Roger Moore as James Bond in 1973. Connery made it clear that after playing 007 six times, he’d had enough, telling the screenwriter that his \"obligation to play James Bond\" had to end at some point. \nConnery gave his successor, Roger Moore, his approval and labeled him “the perfect Bond” to carry on the James Bond franchise. Yet one decade later, Connery made one more return to the part of James Bond, this time for an unofficial, non-canon 1983 installment, which competed against Moore's own Bond movie of the same year. That final Connery Bond movie's title, Never Say Never Again, perfectly reflected the actor's tumultuous relationship with the James Bond franchise throughout his career.\nEidhne Gallagher is a Movie and TV Features Writer, living in Ireland.

Isabelle and Laurent are also in danger, as Genet wants to use Laurent to bring the Union of Hope under her rule.\nSpeaking with Entertainment Weekly, Zabel hinted that The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season finale will feature new information about Daryl's past not previously seen in the franchise. He also indicated the episode will feature many shocking moments by its end. Check out what Zabel had to say below:\nI'm so proud of the season finale. The season finale has it all. It has drama, it has tenderness, it has intense action, it has heroism, it has difficult moral choices. It excavates some of Daryl's past — some of which we're familiar with, but some of which is new information that we learn about him that refers to a lot of the things that the fans of the show will remember about his relationship with his brother and his family.\nSo it's a full payoff to the larger story of this epic journey through France, but it's also a full payoff to the intimate story of Daryl as this reluctant hero trying to just get back home. And it ends with a couple of moments that are pretty jaw-dropping.\nDaryl's past has been explored in the franchise before, with his spinoff in particular making many references to the abuse he suffered at the hands of his father when he was a child. It's likely this will be explored more in the season finale, given its prominence in the show so far. Since even The Walking Dead series finale revealed new information about how Merle forced a younger Daryl to give blood for money, it makes sense for more of Daryl's past to be unearthed in his titular show.\nThere are plenty of other plot developments likely to be addressed in the series finale as well. It appears Daryl, Isabelle, and Laurent will find a way to continue their journey to the Nest, all while being pursued by Codron. However, it's unclear whether or not the group makes it, or if something untoward happens beforehand.\nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 5 also set up Carol's return while teasing a character from The Walking Dead came back to the Virginia communities. Whoever returned, it appears they will be integral to the story in the future, likely being revealed in season 2. With many ideas to focus on, it appears the season finale of Daryl's spinoff will be full of action, adventure, and mystery.\nSource: EW\n"}
{"title": "1 Karate Kid Song Was Originally Written For Rocky 3 (& Replaced By The Franchise's Biggest Hit)", "date": "2023-10-09 13:20:28", "text": "A huge score for The Karate Kid almost appeared in Rocky 3. Here's how the Rocky movie almost missed out on its biggest hit in the franchise.\nOne song from The Karate Kid was originally written for Rocky III, but it was replaced by the boxing franchise's biggest hit. Rocky III debuted in 1982 and saw a slightly more weary Italian Stallion (Sylvester Stallone) begrudgingly get in the ring with the younger, more antagonistic Clubber Yang (Mr. T) at the same time that his friend and mentor Mickey suffers a fatal heart attack. The Karate Kid, which would be released in 1984 and introduced the world to Ralph Macchio's plucky karate student Daniel and his sensei Mr. Miyagi's wise quotes, was in the early stages of development and didn't yet have a hook song to grab the audience.\nAt the time, it wasn't out of the ordinary for songs to be written by composers whose entire career consisted of optioning them to film studios during production without specifying how they would be used. Songs that might not have fit the tone or plot of one movie could be perfect for another, and so they were interchangeable. In the case of Rocky III, this song wouldn't have been appropriate, but it was perfect for The Karate Kid, and it was replaced by one that would eventually be arguably the biggest hit of the entire Rocky franchise, showing just how big a role chance plays in the process.\nThe signature song \"You're The Best\" by Joe Esposito was originally written for Rocky III prior to becoming attached to The Karate Kid. Sylvester Stallone passed on the song at the same time that The Karate Kid was in development, and it ended up fitting the tone of the film much better. While both films are about persevering in the face of obstacles and training hard to overtake adversaries, \"You're The Best\" doesn't really have the same bite as the song that Stallone eventually chose as the standout track on the Rocky III soundtrack.\nInstead of \"You're The Best,\" Stallone chose \"Eye Of The Tiger\" by Scorpion instead, which went on to become a huge hit. With its relentless guitar rifts and marching time signature, it was the perfect song to help Rocky \"go the distance\" and get in the ring with Mr. T's Clubber Yang. The film version of \"Eye of the Tiger\" is the demo, while the completely finished version appears on the soundtrack. While the theme song for Rocky 3 is technically \"Gonna Fly Now\" by Bill Conti, \"Eye Of The Tiger\" is definitely the song fans associate with not only the film, but the entire Rocky franchise.\nSomething similar happened again when Karate Kid 2's song was a Rocky IV reject. Peter Cetera's \"Glory of Love\" was originally going to be included in the film that saw the Italian Stallion go up against Ivan Drago, but it was passed over because it didn't fit Rocky triumphing against insurmountable odds. The soundtrack included James Brown's \"Living in America\", as well as \"Burning Heart\", and particularly John Caffery's \"Hearts on Fire,\" which provided the rousing anthem that played during Rocky's training sessions prior to the greatest fight of his career. \"Glory of Love\" became one of the biggest hits of The Karate Kid franchise.\n"}
{"title": "Martin Scorsese Considers Whether Barbie & Oppenheimer Helped Save Cinema", "date": "2023-10-09 13:26:32", "text": "Martin Scorsese, who recently made comments about the concerning state of Hollywood, ponders Barbie and Oppenheimer's role in saving cinema.\nDirector Martin Scorsese debates whether Barbie and Oppenheimer helped revive cinema. Both released on July 21, Barbie and Oppenheimer’s simultaneous release was the biggest film event of 2023. Coined “Barbenheimer,” the concurrent release was helpful for both films; Barbie became the top grossing film of the year, coming in at a $1.4 billion gross, whereas Oppenheimer boasts a still-impressive $939 million worldwide box office gross.\nRelated: Why It Took Oppenheimer 6 Weeks To Beat Barbie At The Box Office\nScorsese pontificates on Barbenheimer’s role in saving cinema in a recent interview with Hindustan Times. In his interview, Scorsese admitted that he has yet to see either film, but has a respect for multiple members of their creative teams. In terms of the “combination of Oppenheimer and Barbie,” Scorsese believes that it was somewhat of a unique “perfect storm” as one could not have two more different films “work together” and gain such intertwined traction in the cultural zeitgeist. Ultimately, Scorsese thinks that “the most important thing is that people went to watch these in the theatre.” Check out the full quote from Scrosese below:\nI do think that the combination of Oppenheimer and Barbie was something special. It seemed to be, I hate that word, but the perfect storm. It came about at the right time. And the most important thing is that people went to watch these in a theatre. And I think that's wonderful.\nI haven't seen the films yet. I love Chris Nolan's work. Margot Robbie, I must say, started with me from The Wolf of Wall Street. Rodrigo Prieto (cinematographer), after finishing Killers of the Flower Moon, went on to shoot Barbie. So it's all in the family (laughs).\nThe way it fit perfectly - a film with such entertainment value, purely with the bright colours - and a film with such severity and strength, and pretty much about the danger of the end to our civilisation - you couldn't have more opposite films to work together. It does offer some hope for a different cinema to emerge, different from what's been happening in the last 20 years, aside from the great work being done in independent cinema. I always get upset by that, the independent films being relegated to ‘indies.’ Films that only a certain kind of people would like. Just show them on a tiny screen somewhere.\nThe director’s Barbie and Oppenheimer comments come after Scorsese recently spoke out about the need to “save cinema” from franchised superhero content. In this statement, Scorsese even pointed to Nolan as a way out of the “manufactured content” through a distinctive creative voice. These Barbenheimer comments add a layer of nuance to Scorsese’s cinema death fear. Scorsese is not averse to all mainstream content, but rather films that the director finds are shallowly produced and are not “giving you” anything genuine as an audience member.\nThis is not to say that Barbie and Oppenheimer’s successes are free from flaws. As has been pointed out, Hollywood has arguably taken the wrong message away from Barbie and Oppenheimer's successes. Since Barbie, Mattel has announced the development of numerous other toy-related films, including Polly Pocket, Hot Wheels, and Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em Robots. Considering Barbie’s landmark achievement of being the highest grossing female-directed film of all time, this toy-film obsession post-Barbie feels off base.\nOn an industry level, Barbie and Oppenheimer may not have caused the healthiest reaction from Hollywood. But as Scorsese alludes to, the Barbenheimer phenomenon did do something vital, which is bringing people back to the cinema in droves. Post pandemic, this revitalization has been especially important as theaters have been suffering for the past three years. Hopefully, those who returned for Oppenheimer and Barbie will continue to see the value in the theater and help the box office throughout the rest of the year of the movies.\nSource: Hindustan Times\n"}
{"title": "Frasier Reboot Reviews Are In — Does It Live Up To The Original Sitcom?", "date": "2023-10-09 13:29:02", "text": "Ahead of Kelsey Grammer's full return as the beloved elitist therapist, Frasier Crane, the reviews for the Frasier reboot have now been released. \nThe reviews for the Frasier reboot are in. In a few days, Kelsey Grammer will officially return as the elitist, but lovable therapist, Frasier Crane on the small screen. His comeback takes place almost two decades after he ended his stint in Seattle and hoped to start a new life with Charlotte in Chicago. Despite being both a critical and commercial success, getting the Frasier reboot off the ground was actually no easy feat, so it's curious if Grammer and co.'s efforts to bring the show back are worth it.\nAs the embargo lifts for Paramount+'s Frasier reboot, reviews from various outlets have now been released. Grammer is praised for easily slipping back into the shoes of his most iconic character. However, while it does a great job of evoking nostalgia, other elements of the new show simply don't live up to its predecessor.\nIt's quite a handicap, but Grammer knows the good doctor well, and he slips back into the role as easily as Frasier might don a bespoke Armani suit. The actor's exceptional charisma keeps this new Frasier afloat for now, but the five episodes made available for review reveal underlying issues that indicate it will not be an exception to the revival rule.\nKristen Baldwin, EW\nInstead of trying to reinvent the wheel of a legendary character, “Frasier” 2.0 leans toward everything that made the ’90s sitcom such a staple — not only of the era, but of the fabric of television as a whole. If fans are looking for something new, they won’t find it here, but there is something so charming about dusting off and polishing up a past relic that makes it as refreshing as you remembered it. And yes, Frasier wears jeans and Allbirds in the series because people can evolve, even if they don’t change completely.\nAramide Tinubu, Variety\nFilmed in front of a live studio audience, “Frasier” 2.0 rekindles the joy brought on by cunningly constructed lines delivered with perfect timing and attitude. This broadcast sitcom approach has withered since its late 20th century glory days, but such artificial artfulness can still satisfy in the streaming era.\nBob Strauss, Datebook\nUnlike the wretched reboot of Sex and the City, Frasier’s team has managed to update the comedy’s situation, incorporate Frasier’s greater age and its different challenges and diversify its casting without apparent strain. It feels like an organic progression rather than something flung together by a frightened committee.\nLucy Mangan, The Guardian\nThe fact that there is something to enjoy in this return to the Craniverse is testament to the joys of Cheers and Frasier, not to mention Grammer’s effective turn in the lead role. Little may remain other than a title and an endearing snobbery, but, just like Theseus’s ride before it, the spirit of Frasier remains intact. Not quite seaworthy, perhaps, but just about afloat.\nNick Hilton, Independent\nMuch as you’d expect from a decade-old shoe you’ve dug out the back of a cupboard, however, the new Frasier sometimes feels a little dated. The comedy and pacing is very ’90s sitcom, the laugh track even more so. But here’s the thing about nostalgia: It’s addictive AF. And so, once you get into the swing of it, we suspect you’ll be very glad that Frasier’s back in the building … even if it’s a different building in a different city. Cheers.\nKayleigh Dray, AV Club\nIn the Frasier reboot, Frasier moves back to Boston to fix his fractured relationship with his grown-up son, Freddy. Despite their rather great relationship in the original show, they apparently had a falling out in recent years, although it's unclear what it is about. Despite being already financially stable, Frasier appears to be taking a job at Harvard, where he reunites with his old friend, Alan Cornwall. Daphne and Niles' son, David will also be a regular player in the series. \nThe majority of the original characters will be absent in the Frasier reboot. David Hyde Pierce and Jane Leeves were invited to return as Niles and Daphne, but both turned down the project. Meanwhile, Bebe Neuwirth's Lilith and Peri Gilpin's Roz Doyle are confirmed to make cameos. Finally, in light of John Mahoney's passing in 2018, the new show is expected to pay homage to Martin Crane, especially since it will once again tackle a difficult father-and-son relationship. \nRelated: Frasier Recap: 10 Things To Remember Before The Reboot\nGiven the success of the original Frasier, the reboot has its work cut out for it. It's difficult to compete with its predecessor, particularly with its writing and ensemble. However, the fact that reviews are mostly good, although not great, should already be considered a win for the people involved. At the very least, it doesn't taint the original series' legacy. \nSource: Various (see links)\n"}

Dark Horse Comics’ new Masters of the Universe: Forge of Destiny follows He-Man’s earliest days as well as his first run-ins with the evil Skeletor. In issue two, Skeletor heads to the island nation of Anwat Gar, and obtains a new weapon of unimaginable power, and not even He-Man may be able to stop him.\nMasters of the Universe: Forge of Destiny #2 is written by Tim Seeley and drawn by Eddie Nunez. Evil Lyn has secured an artifact called the Phlogista, which she refers to as “the most powerful ancient artifact in all of Eternia.” She covets it for herself and just as she reaches out to touch it, Skeletor arrives. Evil Lyn shows him the Phlogista, but he is unimpressed. She tells him that it is a magical metal that can be shaped to the user’s will. Skeletor is still not sold, but Evil Lyn informs him the Phlogista has ensured peace between the forces of Grayskull and Anwat Gar “simply by existing.”\nMasters of the Universe is set on the distant world of Eternia, a land where science and magic co-exist, which has led to the creation of some truly awesome weapons. He-Man’s sword, the magical weapon he uses to transform, is but one example. Some of these weapons are more science-based, including many of the vehicles He-Man and the Masters of the Universe use, such as the Attack Trak or the Dragon Walker, both of which are also featured in this issue. Yet all of these weapons seemingly pale in comparison to the Phlogista.\nThe issue only hints at the power of the Phlogista. Skeletor takes it and quickly departs. He is not seen for the rest of the issue, meaning readers will have to wait to see it in action. Yet what readers do learn about it is enough to establish that the Phlogista is not to be trifled with. According to Evil Lyn the metal can shape itself to whatever the user desires, meaning it could be changed into a variety of weapons. The only limit would be the user’s imagination. The most telling hint at the Phlogista’s power is that its mere existence ensures peace between two hostile territories.\nRelated: He-Man & Thundercats' Official Crossover Settled Whose Weapons are Better\nAnd now this weapon, a doomsday device, has fallen into Skeletor’s hands. Ironically, he does not seem impressed with it, at least on a surface level. Evil Lyn tries to caution him on its power, but he brushes her off. Previous issues of Forge of Destiny have established that Eternia has an equilibrium, and Skeletor as an outsider does not understand it, hence the reason he is doomed to fail in his plans of conquest. Because the Phlogista is an Eternian artifact, this may be the only saving grace for the Masters of the Universe, as its most powerful weapon now stands revealed.\nMasters of the Universe: Forge of Destiny #2 is on sale now from Dark Horse Comics!\nShaun Corley is a freelance writer currently residing in the mountains of Appalachia.

{"title": "The 10 Greatest And Strangest Horror Movie Crossovers Ever", "date": "2023-10-09 13:30:27", "text": "Horror movie crossovers have dominated B-movie horror for generations, but not all crossovers were created equal. Some are brilliant, others are not.\nHorror movie crossovers have been produced for decades, but often vary wildly from the brilliant to the plain bizarre. While some have been met with critical acclaim, it is often the movies with seemingly the silliest premises and questionable critic reviews that are successful and spawn highly prosperous franchises. Nevertheless, horror crossovers have been a cinematic staple for years.\nThe horror genre has routinely sought to pair off iconic villains for an epic, spooky showdown. Beginning in early Hollywood with the Universal Classic Monsters, the trend has become a global phenomenon. From Frankenstein to Godzilla, most major horror icons have appeared in some form of crossover movie, some of which have endured longer than others.\nRELATED: Every Canceled Horror Vs. Crossover Movie (& Why They Didn't Happen)\n1942's Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman might be the first horror movie crossover ever. It depicted Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolfman consulting a descendant of Dr. Frankenstein, before invariably encountering the Monster. It was originally intended for Chaney to play both roles, having starred as the Monster in Son of Frankenstein, after Boris Karloff's retirement from the role. Interestingly, the part went to Bela Lugosi - who turned down the role of Frankenstein's Monster in the first Frankenstein movie. Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman is a fairly solid crossover, but its greatest feature is seeing two iconic horror actors share the screen.\nFollowing the success of Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman, Universal Pictures released a series of \"Monster Rally\" films. The next was 1944's House of Frankenstein, which was quickly followed in 1945 with House of Dracula. House of Dracula featured Lon Chaney Jr. reprising his role as the Wolfman and John Carradine's second performance as Count Dracula. While its predecessors adequately justified combining Universal's iconic monster, House of Dracula offers a rather flimsy premise. It depicts Count Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, and the Wolfman, each seeking a cure for their monstrous afflictions from a mad professor and a hunchback nurse. It is arguably the strangest and weakest of Universal's Monster Rally movies.\nTwo cult classics collided in 2015 when the bizarre crossover Lake Placid Vs. Anaconda was released by Syfy. After both Lake Placid and Anaconda received somewhat positive reviews, each series produced three sequels which garnered a cult following - largely because of their laughably poor CGI. This culminated in Lake Placid Vs. Anaconda, which sees an anaconda and a genetically modified crocodile escaping a laboratory to a nearby lake, where a group of sorority girls are partying. Unsurprisingly, the two behemoths battle, but not before gobbling up a few scantily-clad women. This quirky crossover also features a delightful performance from horror legend Robert Englund as mercenary Jim Bickerman.\nThe giant animal subgenre reached new heights in 2009 with Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus. It was produced by the independent film company behind the Sharknado franchise, The Asylum. The Asylum is known for movies that lean fully into the so-bad-it's-good horror subgenre, which often enjoyed a cult following despite swathes of negative reviews. Indeed, Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus delivers precisely what it promises, two monstrously large, and unrealistic, CGI sea creatures battling, as a slew of hapless humans are caught in the middle. Amazingly, Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus spawned three sequels and established a Mega Shark franchise.\n2021's Godzilla vs. Kong portrayed two giants of cinema in conflict, but King Kong and Godzilla have actually been brawling since 1962. They first met in King Kong vs. Godzilla, and, despite facing each other multiple times since, this encounter remains a particular highlight. In fact, King Kong vs. Godzilla was so popular, that Japanese production company, Toho, released dozens of subsequent crossovers, some of which included multiple Kongs or even several different versions of Godzilla. Known as Toho's Kaiju universe, other crossovers have included the brilliant 1964 Mothra vs. Godzilla, right through to the strange, more recent renditions, like 1993's Godzilla vs. Mechgodzilla II.\nDespite starring Lon Chaney Jr. as a zombie called Groton, 1971's Dracula vs. Frankenstein is hailed as one of the worst movies to depict either monster. This is largely because the movie originally didn't feature either of them, and they were added to the plot after production had begun. As a result, their appearances are surreal and incongruous with the rest of the movie, which predominately seems dictated by opportunities to display female nudity. Dracula vs. Frankenstein would likely now be considered an exploitation movie, which is particularly evident by the fact that it is now distributed by trash-horror powerhouse, Troma Entertainment - the creators of The Toxic Avenger.\nOne of the strangest crossovers in horror movie history started as an April Fools' joke in 2015. It teased a crossover between the revered Japanese horror franchises Ringu and Ju-on (The Ring and The Grudge), proposing a clash between the movies' infamous villains. Audiences, however, were enthusiastic, and Sadako Vs. Kayako was released just 14 months later. While both the terrifying villains are highly regarded in their original movies, Sadako Vs. Kayako was comically inept at maintaining their legacy. Their performances were more akin to their Scary Movie parodies than the original Ringu or Ju-on, and it's unclear whether this is by accident or design.\nPossibly the most iconic horror showdown ever saw two slasher legends do battle in Freddy vs. Jason. Despite its lukewarm reception, Freddy vs. Jason has endured, and the performances delivered by the titular villains remain a highlight in each franchise. Robert Englund triumphantly returned to his most famous role as A Nightmare On Elm Street's Freddy Krueger, depicted here manipulating Friday the 13th's Jason Voorhees to torment the latest Elm Street children. Released in 2002, Freddy vs. Jason kick-started the modern horror crossover movement, leading to a string of imitations, and hopes of a sequel entitled Pinhead vs. Freddy vs. Jason.\nThe strangest horror crossover ever is surely the surreal horror comedy, Gingerdead Man vs. Evil Bong. Comedy horror luminary, Charles Band (known for Ghoulies and Re-Animator) combined two of his B-movie franchises, pitting the Gingerdead Man against Eebee, the evil bong. The former is a gingerbread recipe mix combined with the ashes of a dead serial killer, while the latter is a sentient, malevolent bong that ensnares stoners. It is exactly as weird as it sounds, but the impressive visuals and masterful balance between horror and comedy have garnered a huge cult fandom and led to the Gingerdead Man appearing as the primary antagonist in each subsequent Evil Bong movie.\nFollowing Freddy vs. Jason's success, two more horrifying villains clashed in 2004, in the horror movie crossover Alien vs. Predator. As a team of scientists investigates a mysterious alien pyramid, they find themselves caught in the crossfires of an ancient battle between the Xenomorphs of the Alien franchise, and the titular trophy hunters from the Predator movies. It is widely regarded as the greatest modern horror crossover, receiving favorable reviews, spawning an actualized sequel with Alien vs. Predator: Requiem, and further sequels within their respective franchises. Where some horror crossovers certainly fell flat, Alien vs. Predator truly demonstrated the potential of the horror subgenre.\n"}

Expend4bles finished its third weekend at the box office, and has maintained a sufficiently disappointing take home throughout.

The third-weekend takeaway also hits home just how extreme Expend4bles box office drop has been, as it was already reported that Expend4bles experienced a 69% drop for its second weekend. As a high-budget blockbuster and fourth entry in a major franchise, it is somewhat shocking that the movie can barely hold onto a $1 million gross less than a month into its theatrical run.\nThese box office trends cement Expend4bles as the lowest-performing film in The Expendables series. The series had already been trending downward before Expend4bles, for The Expendables 3 took home a somewhat-disappointing $214 million at the worldwide box office throughout its entire run, making it the lowest-grossing in the series before Expend4bles. Long gone are the days when The Expendables 2 brought the series $314 million.\nCouples with Expend4bles atrocious reviews, the box office fate does not bode well for the future of The Expendables franchise. While Expend4bles direct Scott Waugh has talked optimistically about future story opportunities, Expend4bles’ flop tells a different story. Not even able to beat out the Sanderson Sisters, Expend4bles may just have sealed a gloomy fate for the end of The Expendables franchise.\nSource: Box Office Mojo\n"}
{"title": "Cobra Kai Season 5 Confirmed The Sad Truth About Johnny Lawrence’s Story", "date": "2023-10-09 13:41:26", "text": "Cobra Kai season 5 made several intriguing developments in its overarching storyline but also revealed a sad truth about Johnny Lawrence's narrative.\nAs Cobra Kai season 5 sets the stage for the series' season 6 end game, a sad truth about Johnny Lawrence's story comes to light. Many factors contributed to Cobra Kai's success. However, the primary reason why the spin-off/reboot series works so well is that it has a solid reason to exist. According to reports, Ralph Macchio received pitches for several Karate Kid reboot and spin-off ideas. However, he declined them because they added little to no heft to the existing movie series' stories. Cobra Kai, however, was an exception because it not only complemented the original movie series' existing narrative but also showed the potential to create its own identity.\nBy making Johnny Lawrence an equally important character as Daniel LaRusso, Cobra Kai took the franchise in a refreshing direction. As a result, Johnny Lawrence, who was perceived as Daniel's evil bully in the original movie, became one of the most beloved characters in the franchise. William Zabka, too, deserves credit for adding new comical and emotional layers to Johnny Lawrence's characterization with his acting forte. However, despite making these subversions in its initial seasons, Cobra Kai is starting to reveal a tragic truth about its own limitations and Johnny Lawrence's overarching storyline.\nRELATED: Ralph Macchio's Reason For Returning As Daniel LaRusso After Almost 30 Years Is Exactly Why Cobra Kai Works\nCobra Kai was initially flipping the conventions followed by the original Karate Kid movies and unfolding from Johnny Lawrence's perspective. Unfortunately, it has not been doing the same in its recent seasons. To instill nostalgia in the long-term viewers of the franchise, Cobra Kai introduced characters like Chozen and Mike Barnes as Daniel's allies while marking the return of villains like Terry Silver. However, given how none of these characters were a part of the first Karate Kid movie, which featured Johnny Lawrence as one of its two main characters, the show has clearly started focusing on Daniel's side of the story instead of walking through Lawrence's rite of passage.\nJohnny Lawrence's overarching storyline has also gradually stagnated over time. Although the show has made some intriguing developments in his narrative by highlighting how he has gone from being an alcoholic loner to a family man, his characterization has hardly made any progress in the last couple of seasons. Lawrence's whole season 5 arc primarily revolved around him struggling to keep a job, which reinstated that he has not come too far since his season 1 story. Even though the show has been named after his karate fighting style, Cobra Kai, like the Karate Kid series, has gone back to emphasizing how the Miyagi way is the right way.\nEven when it comes to his relationship with Robby, Lawrence continues making the same mistakes in season 5. For instance, he lies to Robbie about the purpose of the Mexico trip and still has not wholeheartedly apologized to his biological son. While Lawrence's story arc barely progresses in season 5, Daniel LaRusso goes through a significant catharsis. After being an angry, resentful man throughout Cobra Kai season 5, Daniel realigns himself with Mr. Miyagi's philosophies by learning how \"everything be better\" when \"whole life have balance.\" This clearly made LaRusso season 5's main character.\nIn its initial seasons, Cobra Kai was more about Johnny Lawrence and Miguel than Daniel and every other character. Daniel, in fact, was portrayed as somewhat of an anti-hero in Cobra Kai season 1 who could not stand the idea of Johnny Lawrence doing better in life by teaching kids karate. The show even tried portraying Cobra Kai and its \"strike first, strike hard, no mercy\" philosophy in a neutral light by highlighting how it helped characters like Eli and Miguel fight their bullies and insecurities. This allowed Lawrence to truly shine as a sensei, paving the way for him to redeem himself.\nMiguel's All-Valley win further reinstates that Cobra Kai's primary focus was to flip the character beats set by the Karate Kid movies. John Kreese's introduction as the show's villain also played a crucial role in emphasizing that the series is about Lawrence since Kreese was a demon from his past. Although Daniel also perceived Kreese as his enemy, Johnny Lawrence had more of a love-hate relationship with his sensei, initially making him a vulnerable target for Kreese's manipulations.\nHowever, after Kreese ended up in prison towards the end of Cobra Kai season 4, the show hardly had anything more to add to Johnny Lawrence's narrative. Owing to this, Johnny Lawrence got demoted to being a secondary protagonist in Daniel LaRusso's Cobra Kai season 5 story. Considering how Johnny Lawrence and his role as a karate sensei is a mere subset of the Miyagi Do dojo after season 5 and Cobra Kai has been established as the dojo for the show's villains, it seems unlikely that Cobra Kai season 6 will promote Lawrence to his main character status from the earlier seasons.\nSince Daniel LaRusso's story and his dynamic with Mr. Miyagi set the foundation of the franchise's Miyagi verse, it is understandable why Cobra Kai had to eventually drift its focus back on the bona fide karate kid. While it is still commendable how Cobra Kai retconned the good vs. bad approach of the original series and took a more balanced approach towards portraying rivalries, most of the franchise's initial Karate Kid arcs were tied to Daniel LaRusso. Therefore, to maintain the sense of nostalgia that made the Netflix series so popular in the first place, Cobra Kai had to bring back players from LaRusso's past.\nJohnny Lawrence only appeared in the first Karate Kid movie, leaving the show with a limited pool of backstory to work with. Despite the decline in the franchise's quality after the second movie, Daniel remained the main character for three Karate Kid movies, leaving immense room for the franchise to expand his narrative in many new directions in Cobra Kai. However, even though it made narrative sense for Johnny Lawrence's storyline to take a backseat in Cobra Kai's recent season, it is hard not to hope that season 6 will balance his screen time with Daniel LaRusso's and give him the well-rounded redemption and closure he deserves.\n"}
{"title": "The Bear Season 2's Worst Story Repeats The Show's Most Common Supporting Character Failure", "date": "2023-10-09 13:50:25", "text": "As great as The Bear is, it has a common problem with its supporting characters, and the worst story in season 2 takes that problem too far.\nThe Bear season 2 introduces Claire (Molly Gordon), a childhood friend of the Berzatto family, but she repeats the biggest problem with the show's supporting characters. The hit FX series follows Carmy (Jeremy Allen White), a well-respected chef who has worked in some of the world's best restaurants, as he attempts to turn his deceased brother's Chicago Italian beef sandwich shop into a fine-dining experience. Season 2 of The Bear introduced several new recurring roles, and these additions to The Bear cast of characters includes Luca (Will Poulter), Donna (Jamie Lee Curtis), Tiffany (Gillian Jacobs), and many others.\nOne of the key characters introduced in season 2, however, is Claire, a childhood friend of the Barzatto's whom Carmy used to have a crush on. When they meet in a grocery store, he forgets Claire's name, or at least pretends to. Following that, Carmy gives her a fake number, which also speaks to his self-destructive nature. However, after persistence, Claire becomes a part of Carmy's life, and they begin a serious relationship, something that Carmy certainly needs. Nevertheless, while it's great to see Carmy in a better place, Claire's position on the show repeats a tired The Bear supporting character trend.\nRELATED: 10 Unpopular Opinions About The Bear\nIn The Bear, all the love interests are just foils for the dramatic main characters. Carmy, Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), and Sugar (Abby Elliott) are all chaotic and short-tempered, and they find it hard to handle the stress that comes with financial burdens and running a kitchen. However, their other halves all provide them with a much calmer space and are ultimately stress relievers, but they're nothing more. Sugar's husband, Pete (Chris Witaske), is earnest and does everything he can to appease Sugar, even if the Berzatto family doesn't like him. Before his divorce, Richie was a lot more relaxed and almost a different person when around his wife, Tiffany (Jacobs).\nJust like those characters, Claire doesn't have much personality other than simply being calmer than Carmy. The Bear season 2's finale interestingly flips the dynamic on its head, as Carmy, while frustrated and locked in The Bear's kitchen freezer, says a number of insulting things about Claire that he doesn't mean. Claire overhears, then says goodbye to Carmy and leaves the kitchen before the credits roll. If Claire and Carmy get back together in The Bear season 3, the show will only double down on the tired romantic dynamic. While audiences want Carmy to be happy, Claire serves no other purpose than to settle the chef's nerves.\nRelated: 10 Most Unrealistic Things About The Bear\nThough The Bear season 3 story faces the challenge of overcoming this tired romantic dynamic, there's a clear way to fix it. Throughout two seasons, a romantic relationship between Carmy and Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) was subtly teased. This relationship could be totally different from the other couples and ex-couples on the show, as both Sydney and Carmy work in the kitchen, which could explore new dynamics. While part of what makes Carmy and Sydney's relationship in the first two seasons great is that it's a platonic boy-girl friendship, which is rarely seen, there's no doubt that the groundwork has been laid for an exciting romance, whether it works out or not.\nCurrently splitting his time between Madrid and Chicago, Stephen Barker has been a staff writer at Screen Rant since 2020.

{"title": "What Happens To The Continental’s Characters Before John Wick Movies", "date": "2023-10-09 14:00:29", "text": "The Continental did little to bridge the gap between the show and John Wick, begging the question of what happened to each character in this period.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for The Continental episode 3.\nThe Continental's ending still takes place almost four decades before the John Wick movies, raising the question of what happens to each major character between the two installments of the franchise. When The Continental was announced as a prequel to John Wick, it was expected that the show would tie heavily into the latter franchise given its popularity. In some ways, the Peacock series does exactly this.\nFrom exploring how Winston Scott took control of the titular establishment to the coming together of him and Charon after their close bond was set up in the John Wick films, The Continental's ending adequately explains various elements of the film series it precedes. This is done through various John Wick Easter eggs in The Continental, yet surprisingly the series ends with a large section of the timeline between it and John Wick left unexplored. As such, many have been wondering what happens to the show's various characters in the period between The Continental and 2014's John Wick, especially those who do not feature in the latter films.\nRelated: 10 Unanswered Questions About The World Of John Wick After Its Prequel\nConcerning the main character of The Continental, Winston Scott's journey between the show and John Wick is fairly easy to plot for those familiar with the Keanu Reeves films. In the 35–40 years between The Continental and John Wick, Winston simply spends his time solidifying his position as the manager of the New York Continental. The Continental's ending showcased Winston killing the High Table's Adjudicator in a shocking scene. This scene was in place to show Winston's defiance of the High Table, yet also to establish his alliance with the organization.\nKilling the Adjudicator sent a message; Winston is now here to stay in The Continental and the High Table can either ally with him as they did with Cormac - the former manager Winston took control of the hotel from - or face the consequences of opposing him just as Cormac and the Adjudicator did. As evident by the John Wick films, the High Table opts for the former with Winston holding his position as the proprietor of the eponymous hotel right up until John Wick begins.\nAnother main player in The Continental's cast of characters was Charon, the hotel's concierge played by the late Lance Reddick in the John Wick movies. In The Continental, Charon was shown as the assistant to Cormac before he allied with Winston and aided the latter in his siege of the hotel. Much like with Winston, the events of Charon's life between The Continental and John Wick are left unexplored aside from the fact that he eventually becomes the hotel's concierge. That said, some context clues from Charon's story in The Continental can provide some more specific hints about Charon's life between the two projects.\nA big aspect of Charon's character in The Continental was his wish to bring his father to New York from Nigeria. Cormac used this desire to control Charon which was a turning point for his character once Winston pointed out that Cormac never intended to aid Charon or his family. As of the end of The Continental, Winston is in charge of The Continental with Charon as his ally. As such, it can be inferred that Charon's father is eventually relocated to the United States by Winston to reunite the father and son between the series and John Wick before Charon becomes the concierge of the New York Continental.\nLou and Miles are two new characters for The Continental in that they did not appear or were not mentioned in the John Wick films. Given the almost 40-year gap between the two projects, their journey specifically between the two is shrouded in mystery. Winston and Charon at least have end-points that are highlighted in John Wick, yet Lou and Miles are completely devoid of any story elements in the John Wick films meaning much of their story is left to interpretation.\nLike Charon though, there are some elements of The Continental that can provide potential insight into their journey. For one, Lou's rivalry with the boss of the Chinese mafia is left mostly unresolved. After destroying her dojo, the mafia boss is not featured again in The Continental meaning Lou likely takes revenge against him between the series and John Wick. Concerning the duo together, The Continental episode 2 featured a scene that could hint at a hidden role they have in the John Wick films.\nThe hidden role hinted at in The Continental is the Sommelier from John Wick 2. In the latter film, Wick is sent to the Sommelier in the hotel who provides the iconic hitman with a variety of weapons and ammo. In The Continental episode 2, Winston promises that should they aid him in taking The Continental from Cormac, Lou and Miles will be responsible for providing the hotel with guns and ammunition. This hints that Lou and Miles were responsible for creating the Sommelier position of the establishment and could explain their combined journey between The Continental and John Wick: setting up the hotel’s gun-running organization.\nAnother character whose ending is left frustratingly unclear in The Continental is Yen, Frankie's wife. The Continental episode 3 provides a satisfying enough culmination of Yen's story with the character being provided with the best fight scenes in the show while also getting revenge for Frankie's murder by killing the assassin who conducted it. That said, the ending montage of The Continental provides shockingly little regarding what happens to Yen between The Continental and John Wick.\nGiven that Yen is never mentioned in John Wick, the most likely outcome of Yen's journey is that she returns home to Vietnam. The Continental episode 2 established that she was pushed into being a suicide bomber in the Vietnam War before Frankie found her and the two fled to the United States. While this could provide Yen with some hesitation to return home, she could have stayed in New York for a while before returning to her home country now that Frankie is dead. Aside from this potential outcome, the rest of Yen's story between The Continental and John Wick is left entirely to interpretation.\nGene Jenkins is another original character introduced in The Continental, a sniper who is friends with Miles and aids Winston in his attempt to capture the titular hotel. As is the case with Lou, Miles, and Yen, Gene is not mentioned in any of the John Wick movies meaning his timeline between The Continental and its sequel films is also unclear. However, more so than Yen, Gene's story provides some hints as to what follows his journey in The Continental.\nFor one, Gene is an older man. This means that he likely passed away in the 40 or so years between The Continental and the John Wick films. Regarding what happened between The Continental and his death, Gene likely settled down with the woman whose apartment he sniped from in The Continental episode 3. The episode established a romantic connection between the two and set up a date at the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens for Gene and the unnamed woman, hinting at their life together between the show and John Wick.\nThe final character originally created for The Continental and part of its main cast is KD. The Continental ended with KD killing Cormac out of revenge for her family who were killed by Winston on the orders of Mel Gibson's villainous hotel manager. As seems to be common for most Continental characters, her time between the show and John Wick is left unspoken given her absence from the latter franchise. Given her murderous ways and skirting of NYPD rules, KD is likely fired from the force after The Continental and could move away from New York, explaining her absence in John Wick.\n"}

In fact, it's so dangerous, it may be something Storm's faction will forever regret unleashing.\nIn a preview of Al Ewing and Yıldıray Çınar's X-Men Red #16, the mutant warrior War strikes Port Prometheus. It's the latest loss in the battle for Arakko (formerly Mars), in which Storm's resistance forces are fading fast. However, amidst the attack, Syzya of the Smoke retrieves a terrifying weapon - the Uranos Trigger.\nFor months now, Marvel has been teasing that Storm can only win the Genesis War by deploying an \"ultimate weapon\" - now, fans know it's the device the mutants acquired in the aftermath of Marvel's Judgment Day crossover - the Uranos Trigger.\nRelated: X-Men: Nightcrawler's Deadly New HOPESWORD Power - Everything You Need to Know\nIf used, the Uranos Trigger will unleash Thanos' uncle Uranos for one hour. When Uranos last visited Arakko, he devastated the planet, killing 98% of all mutants in a fifty-mile radius of his attack, including Magneto himself. After Uranos' attack, the Eternals (who had unleashed him against Arakko while under Druig's leadership) gave the mutants the weapon that had been used against them as a gift. Uranos is a wildly powerful individual and also has some of the most advanced weaponry in existence sealed away in hidden dimensional vaults only he can access. However, if Storm does use the weapon, his targets will put up a fight worthy of the disgraced Eternal.\nRecently, the Arakki mutant Genesis arrived on the planet, and began seizing control of the civilization while under the influence of the demonic god Annihilation. Storm's resistance group - including Nova, Sunspot, and a variety of Arakko's strongest mutants - have been fighting her ever since, but with little hope of victory. Now, however, they have the ability to unleash what equates to a god of war against their enemies. Unleashing Uranos would likely wipe out Genesis' forces, but with any sliver of time left, Uranos will surely turn on his handlers.\nSyzya of the Smoke may have just handed victory to Storm, but little is known about the heroic mutant. A member of the nation's ruling Great Ring, even Magneto noted her similarities to Nightcrawler: her demonic appearance, prehensile tail, and teleportation powers that create a puff of purple smoke. Given Nightcrawler's father Azazel is a truly ancient mutant, there's a high chance Kurt has many siblings he doesn't know about, and giving him a sister would tie into Marvel's recent attempts to expand his lore as the new Uncanny Spider-Man. It's likely the upcoming X-Men Blue: Origins - coming November from Si Spurrier and Wilton Santos - will settle the relationship between Syzya and Kurt, as the issue promises to reveal the hidden truth of Nightcrawler's origin.\nHowever, whether she's Nightcrawler's sister or not, Syzya just handed Arakko's resistance the ultimate weapon to beat Genesis - if the ragtag group of freedom fighters and former X-Men actually dare to use it.\nX-Men Red #16 is available from Marvel Comics.\n"}
{"title": "Only One Pokémon is Actually True Evil, & It's Not One Fans Would Expect", "date": "2023-10-09 14:00:29", "text": "A Pokémon acting on its own evil desires became a menace in the Pokémon anime, and it proves how terrifying a truly evil Pokémon would really be.\nIn the Pokémon anime in general, there aren't really many evil Pokémon, but rather Pokémon that do evil deeds because their trainers demanded it of them. A few episodes of XY, however, do away with that excuse, by introducing a Pokémon that's pure evil, and the result is absolutely terrifying to think about.\nIn the episode \"A Conspiracy to Conquer!\", Team Rocket falls victim to a mysterious woman going by \"Madame X\" and her Pokémon, Malamar, which hypnotizes them and controls their actions. Meowth escapes and gets help from Ash and the gang, but slowly everyone except for Meowth and Ash fall victim to the Malamar, giving it half a dozens humans and all their Pokémon at its bidding. Things get even worse, however, when it's revealed that Madame X is actually Officer Jenny--and she's being mind controlled, too. Malamar itself was the mastermind behind this evil scheme, and it promptly escapes, ready to continue its plans to conquer the world.\nThe Malamar in the episode is clearly very intelligent to be capable of coming up with such a plan, and its psychic powers seem equally impressive, given how many people it was able to control at once. Malamar is a rare example of an evil Pokémon that's not being influenced in any way, and simply acting on its own desires. Malamar actually goes on to appear later, returning in \"Facing the Grand Design!\", where it has teamed up with two other Malamar to brainwash scientists into creating a dangerous weapon. The Malamar, however, actually manage to escape in this episode as well, but don't show up again--meaning there's still world-conquering evil Pokémon out there.\nMalamar never explains its motivations for wanting to take over the world; it seems to simply think that it can and should. While it's possible that Malamar is out for vengeance in some way, like Mewtwo, it doesn't appear to have a particular target in mind. Their extremely high intelligence might suggest that they were experimented upon, although by who or why is a mystery. It's worth noting that this evil nature doesn't apply to all Malamar; in the second episode where it appears, some friendly Inkay and Malamar help to foil the evil Malamar's plans.\nFortunately, evil Pokémon seem to be pretty rare, but given the sheer number of wild Pokémon in the world, there must be many more out there. The powers that Pokémon wield, even those who aren't Psychic-types like Malamar, have a lot of potential for destruction. Even a few evil Pokémon that wish harm on humans could cause massive amounts of strife and suffering with their abilities. Perhaps defeating evil-minded Pokémon is a task that falls to Legendary Pokémon, many of which are said to maintain balance and peace. Regardless, there are still at least three terrifyingly smart and powerful evil Pokémon out there, free to act as they wish... and Ash might not be there to stop them next time.\n"}

{"title": "Prisoners Ending Explained: Does Loki Find Keller?", "date": "2023-10-09 14:00:30", "text": "Prisoners was released in 2013, by acclaimed director Denis Villeneuve, and has a complex mystery at its center. Here is the film’s ending explained.\n\nThe Prisoners ending adds to the highly complex and dark nature of the detective-thriller from Denis Villeneuve. The film tells the gut-wrenching story of a family Thanksgiving dinner that ends with two young girls disappearing. The film's central two characters, Keller Dover and Detective Loki played by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal respectively, are then taken on a complex ride as both try to figure out the mystery through their own means, leading to the unforgettable Prisoners ending.\nKeller Dover, the father of Anna, one of the missing children, goes to a dark place in Prisoners, even kidnapping and torturing a person of his own, Alex Jones, in his search for answers making it a gripping movie about moral dilemmas. Eventually, Dover finds out that Alex Jones is actually Barry Milland and was kidnapped by his \"mother\" Holly Jones, who has taken Keller's daughter and her friend Joy. Prisoners' ending sees Keller left in a pit beneath Holly's house after Loki exposes Holly and saves Anna. Prisoners reaches this endpoint through a series of twists and turns and leaves its ending purposely ambiguous\n.\nRELATED: The 50 Best Movies Of All Time\nOne of the biggest questions the Prisoners ending leaves is why Holly Jones, played by Melissa Leo, and her husband prior to his disappearance were kidnapping children in the first place. While Prisoners does answer this, the film's complex emotional story can allow certain aspects to become lost beneath the hard-hitting way the movie is presented. Also, as Holly is introduced early in the film, things that are revealed about her when she is \"innocent\" in the eyes of the audience can be forgotten once the reveal of her true nature comes to light.\nThroughout the film, it is revealed that Holly and her husband adopted Alex Jones, played by Paul Dano of recent The Batman fame, after the death of their own son to cancer. Throughout the film, Alex is shown to be intellectually disabled, having the IQ of a 10-year-old. It is revealed that this disability comes from the trauma of his own kidnapping by Holly, with her reasoning revealed to Keller later after he figures out Holly's crimes. Holly reveals to Keller that, in revenge against God for allowing their son to die of cancer, she and her husband began kidnapping children of Christian families so that these families would feel a similar crisis of faith that they felt.\nThis war on God was carried out over decades with Alex Jones being one victim. Another victim is also revealed throughout the film, a man named Bob Taylor, played by superhero movie regular David Dastmalchian. Anna and Joy are just two of Holly's latest victims, as the Dovers and Birchs are two Christian families. Despite her husband's disappearance, Holly continued their \"war\" by kidnapping the two children and sending Keller and his family, alongside the Birchs, down their own crisis of faith.\nLeading to the Prisoners ending, Dano's Alex Jones is one of the central characters in some harrowing ways. Firstly, his intellectual disability puts him as one of the film's red herrings, with Alex often making comments that seemingly implicate him in Anna and Joy's kidnapping such as telling Keller: \"They didn't cry until I left them.\" This causes Keller to torture Alex throughout the movie. However, the film reveals that Alex was not involved in the actual kidnapping of the girls, he was only present due to living in the same house as Holly.\nAs Alex, often considered one of Paul Dano's best roles and movies, is a kidnapping victim of Holly's himself and is played off as her adoptive son, he was present in the house when Anna and Joy were taken. Before this, Alex took the girls for a joyride in his RV through seemingly innocent means due to his 10-year-old mental state, and the girls were only taken by Holly after returning to Alex's house. This is why Alex says the line to Keller, which the latter wrongly believes proves his guilt. In reality, Alex was also a victim and his trauma and mental disabilities put him on the wrong side of a grieving father.\nAnother of Holly's kidnapping victims is Bob Taylor. In the film, Taylor is used as another red herring who breaks into the Dovers' house, is found with Anna and Joy's clothes covered in blood, and confesses to the kidnappings before committing suicide. In the scene in which Prisoners, directed by sci-fi movie master Denis Villeneuve, reveals that Holly was responsible for the kidnapping, it is also revealed that Taylor was a former victim of the Jones' that actually escaped, and Holly forgot he existed until he appeared in the news. Taylor, suffering from similar trauma from his experiences as Alex, began emulating his memories of his own kidnapping by Holly and her husband.\nAs Mr. Jones was obsessed with mazes, Taylor's traumatic childhood caused his own mind to break, and become obsessed with them himself, explaining the writing on the walls of his home. Because of Taylor's mental state, it can be argued that he was fantasizing about kidnapping children to emulate Mr. Jones. This explains the seeming plot hole of why he would implicate himself, despite not participating in the kidnapping of Anna and Joy himself.\nOne other plot point is the investigation of Father Dunn by Loki, similarly ranked amongst Jake Gyllenhaal's best performances alongside Dano’s. In the film, Loki visits a local priest and finds a decomposed body in his basement. The priest reveals that the man confessed to killing 16 children in a war against God, resulting in the priest killing the man in retaliation. The man whom the priest killed is later revealed to be Mr. Jones with Holly under the impression that her husband disappeared. However, the maze necklace on the dead body is the same as the one worn by Mr. Jones in an image in Holly's house, with her motivations for kidnapping revealing the connection between the Father and the Jones'.\nWith the majority of the movie's mysteries being answered, the Prisoners ending of the film is left ambiguous. The main way this is done is through Keller Dover's fate, which continues the film's depiction of real-life horror scenarios. At the end of the film, Keller is left in the pit beneath the Jones' pick-up truck for days after Loki saves Anna from Holly. The very last scene in the film sees Loki standing defeated in front of Holly's house, hearing a faint whistle that is being blown by Keller in the pit. Loki shrugs the sound off, before hearing it again and seemingly going to investigate before the film cuts to black.\nWhether Loki saves Dover is left to the audience's interpretation which will no doubt sit differently with some fans. Such an ending with a big unanswered question can frustrate audiences, but Prisoners is a dark and gritty movie that would have felt odd with a definitive happy ending. The Prisoners ending as it stands carries the grim feel of the movie but gives a faint glimmer of hope in the end as well.\nRELATED: 12 Best Movies Like Prisoners\nOne of the lingering questions of Prisoners is what Dover's fate could have been whether Loki did or did not save him. If Loki does not save him, the likelihood is that Dover dies in the pit. Dover was shot by Holly in the leg, and broke that same leg upon falling into the pit. These injuries would be difficult to survive, especially in the cold, unsanitary conditions of the pit. It is likely that Dover blowing the whistle is his last attempt at being saved. Similarly, if Loki does save Keller, it is likely he is arrested for his kidnapping and torture of Alex earlier in the film.\nThe ending of Prisoners, in terms of the final scene and its overall reveals tie together the themes of the movie that director Denis Villeneuve intended. One of these themes is the film's title which has often been subject to debate. The ending of the film sees Loki and Keller, the two protagonists, facing the consequences of becoming prisoners themselves. Dover became a prisoner of his own grief by sacrificing his humanity to find his daughter, which leads him to the pit at the end of the film. Loki also becomes a prisoner to the case due to his obsession with finding the girls, and manages to escape the prison by saving Anna.\nAnother of the film's themes is also faith and religion. The families whose daughters go missing are Christian families, which links to Holly, her husband, Patrick Dunn, and God himself. Holly and Mr. Jones can be seen as the films \"devil,\" waging their war against God. Loki, whose character has many religious tattoos, can be seen as God's \"angel\" who defeats the devil. Dover also fits these religious themes as God's follower who loses his faith and sacrifices his humanity through his kidnap and torture of Alex. The end of the film can be seen as Dover asking God for help, with Loki as the angel potentially saving him, freeing both of the prisons that Prisoners lends its title to.\nThe Prisoners ending is a haunting and thrilling way to end this intense story and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski knew that was the right conclusion. In an interview (via Buzzfeed) Guzikowski spoke about how he enjoyed the ambiguity of the ending, even if he believes what follows is inevitable. Compared to the more explicit version that was shot, he says, \"I like it much better being ambiguous. Even though you assume that's what's probably going to happen, I like that there's a small chance that he's not going to get him out of there for whatever reason.\"\nInterestingly, when it was pointed out that there was no way the determined Detective Loki would not investigate the noise further, Guzikowski suggested Loki might decide to leave Keller there rather than simply miss him. It is a disturbing thought that makes the ending all the more compelling and would certainly reframe Jake Gyllenhaal's character as more villainous than the hero he is in the final version. Even without that ending, Prisoners is a dark movie with a fitting and Guzikowski is thankful it could remain that way, \"It's definitely a testament to Alcon, the producers on the movie, sticking by the script and not wanting to make it into something it wasn't.\"\nThe Prisoners ending might have worked due to its ambiguity, but it almost had a much more definitive conclusion. The Prisoners alternate ending plays out very much the same way as the official ending up until the point that Loki hears the whistle again. This leads to him removing the car that is blocking Keller's hole and Loki is able to find Keller still alive within it. The alternate ending was not planned by the filmmakers but rather an insistence from the studios in case audiences didn't like the uncertainty of the planned ending.\nThe alternate ending proves that the Prisoners ending that audiences got works just fine. Though the extended final scene gives closure, it proves that the reveal that Loki saves Keller doesn't actually add anything to the movie and the ending is more memorable if that question lingers. The alternate ending also further confirms the filmmakers' intention with what the ending means.

{"title": "All 10 Adventure Time Seasons, Ranked Worst To Best", "date": "2023-10-09 14:20:27", "text": "With 10 seasons under its belt, Adventure Time has had its ups and downs. Here's how every season ranks — from worst to the best of the best.\nEvery Adventure Time season sent its protagonists, Finn and Jake, on plenty of thrilling, comical, and moving escapades, with highs and lows across 283 episodes. While Pendleton Ward's fantasy series is by and large considered one of the best and most influential animated programs of the last decade, some of Adventure Time's 10 seasons were better than others. The show grew from a simple yet strange concept: Finn the human (Jeremy Shada) and his best bud Jake (John DiMaggio), a dog with shape- and size-shifting powers, find themselves adventuring across the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo to help its denizens with problems both (universe-altering) big and small.\nIn addition to the world-building, the Adventure Time characters, from the bumbling Ice King (Tom Kenny) and the guitar-strumming Marceline the Vampire Queen (Olivia Olson) to the science-obsessed Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch) and her anthropomorphic candy citizens, are also incredible. As the series progresses, it grows from one-off, self-contained episodes into something much more complicated and cosmic. That's all part of what made viewers fall in love with the Emmy and Peabody Award-winning series — and why it remains a cult hit over a decade after its premiere. Here are allAdventure Time seasons, ranked from worst to best.\nWithout a doubt, Adventure Time season 6 marked a tonal shift for the series. For some viewers, it was an exciting change, but, for others, it missed the mark. Given the mixed feelings on season 6, it ranks a tad lower than other seasons of the hit series. While it started strong with episodes like \"Wake Up\" and \"Escape From the Citadel,\" it largely trades the series' signature offbeat humor for more philosophical musings and world-building lore. That's not a bad thing, but other seasons of Adventure Time balance the serious and the comic more deftly.\nThe chapter that started it all, Adventure Time's first season gives very little indication as to where the series will lead in its later arcs. Nonetheless, its quirky characters, offbeat humor, and memorable world-building helped establish a solid foundation on which to build. Composed largely of self-contained episodes, it's difficult to compare season 1's goofy-forward offerings with the more complex, ponderous narratives later seasons of Adventure Time achieve, but it's still a \"mathematical\" watch in what would become one of the best Cartoon Network shows.\nIn its ninth season, Adventure Time delves into another multi-episode arc with its eight-part \"Elements\" narrative. In it, Finn and Jake have to undo the elemental magic that's transformed the Land of Ooo into a dystopia. Other key episodes include \"Three Buckets,\" the season 9 finale that sees Finn's grass-made double questioning his identity and existence, as well as \"Ketchup,\" a BMO-centric gem.\nAn ever-goofy Finn grows up a bit more in season 2 and that's reflected in the series' writing too, which trades juvenile humor and silly slang terms invented by Finn and Jake for more character-driven stories. For starters, a teenage Finn grapples with his feelings for Princess Bubblegum, while characters like Marceline become much less one-dimensional. Even Ice King, who was a bumbling villain in the first outing, becomes more human, leaving his ineffectual villainy on the sidelines while he confronts his loneliness.\nMost memorably, Adventure Time season 8 features a multi-episode miniseries of sorts, \"Islands,\" that delves more deeply into Finn's past. After encountering a robotic craft of foreign origin, Finn, Jake, and Susan (another human) set sail for a far-off civilization. There, they learn more about Susan (a.k.a. Kara), and Finn meets his mother. After so many episodes, it's nice to get some answers about Finn's origins, but season 8 is about more than \"Islands.\" Other stand-out episodes include the informative \"Broke His Crown\" and the surprisingly compelling \"Normal Man.\"\nIn its final season, Adventure Time takes big swings, all to wrap up its cosmic, over-arching narrative while giving its characters proper send-offs. In season 10, Princess Bubblegum confronts her villainous Uncle Gumbald in the fight for Candy Kingdom; Finn faces off against a darker version of Fern; Marceline makes peace with her frustrating father, Hunson; and Betty sacrifices herself to the entity GOLB, the embodiment of chaos and disorder, to save Simon. Plus, season 10 contains the four-part series finale, \"Come Along with Me,\" and introduces the intriguing duo Shermy and Beth — the spiritual successors to Finn and Jake of the future.\nAdventure Time season 4 is all about relationships — and humor. Not only does Finn get closer to Flame Princess, but the fourth season also features the episode where Tree Trunks and Pig overdo their PDA, making everyone uncomfortable. Memorably, Adventure Time season 4 also boasts several experimental chapters, like \"Five Short Graybles\" and \"BMO Noir,\" as well as some character-driven, backstory-revealing episodes, like \"I Remember You,\" which delves into Marceline and Ice King's (a.k.a. Simon's) painful, shared past in a solid season of what can be considered one of the best animated shows of all time.\nSeason 3 of the series features tons of classics, from \"Hitman\" and \"Holly Jolly Secrets\" to the first episode centering on Adventure Time's Fionna and Cake, Finn and Jake's gender-swapped counterparts. One of the season's most memorable episodes, \"What Was Missing,\" teases Princess Bubblegum and Marceline's romantic history for the first time. In retrospect, Adventure Time season 3 is so successful because it excels at balancing humor and heart — crucial backstory, and one-off fun.\nFor fans of Marceline (and, by extension, the slow-burn rekindling of Marceline and Princess Bubblegum's romantic relationship), Adventure Time season 7 is an instant favorite. The season's eight-episode story arc, \"Stakes,\" centers on Marcie, who asks PB to cure her of her vampirism. No longer wanting to be immortal, Marceline allows Bonnie to extract her vampire essence, but, of course, complications arise. Bolstered by music penned by Rebecca Sugar (Steven Universe), season 7 hits some of the series' emotional highs, all while maintaining its signature humor and surreality.\nTwice the length of any season before it, Adventure Time's fifth season boasts a whopping 52 episodes. Based on sheer volume alone, season 5 has a little something for every Adventure Time fan, from \"Simon & Marcy\" to \"Root Beer Guy.\" For some viewers, it's where the series jumped the shark, trading its goofiness for ever-growing, ever-complicated Adventure Time lore-related episodes. Still, for most diehards, season 5 only deepens Adventure Time's appeal and cements its now-enduring legacy.\nNominated for an LA Press Club National Arts & Entertainment Journalism Award in 2022, Kate is a freelance entertainment writer and editor.

Debuting in September, Daryl Dixon sees Norman Reedus' titular character washing ashore in France where he's not sure why he's there or even how he arrived at his destination. Eventually, he's enlisted to take care of Laurent (Louis Puech Scigliuzzi), a boy who is believed to be destined for greatness. Created by David Zabel, the six-episode AMC series also features an ensemble that includes Harry Potter alum Clémence Poésy and sees Melissa McBride reprise her role as Carol Peletier.\nAs reported by Variety, AMC has confirmed that The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon now has the biggest premiere in the history of the AMC+ streaming service. This puts it ahead of The Walking Dead: Dead City, which achieved the milestone back in June. Daryl Dixon is also on track to become the most-viewed season of any show in the history of AMC+. Dead City and Daryl Dixon will return for season 2.\nFor ratings, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 4 achieved new highs both in terms of viewership and the adults in the 25-54 demographic. Counting the Nielsen Live+3 numbers, the spinoff hit 1.1 million with its fourth installment. That includes 392,000 viewers in the aforementioned demographic. But the Norman Reedus-led drama is not only a success in terms of its audience, it's also received positive reviews across the board.\nDespite the fact that some have noted similarities to HBO's The Last of Us, the spinoff has been called the best Walking Dead show in years. On Rotten Tomatoes, Daryl Dixon boasts a 90% approval rating based on 35 reviews. But the specific details are more significant, showing that the AMC series has an average rating of 8.1/10. That means, of those who reviewed the show, many came away with a strongly positive impression.\nRelated: The Walking Dead's Daryl Dixon Cast & Character Guide\nThe audience rating is similarly high, sitting at 87%. Reedus receives a lot of credit as the name of The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon, but the overall quality indicates a potential long-term path for the veteran zombie adaptation, provided that it can combine a compelling narrative for familiar faces that audiences already know quite well. That seems to be the selling point of the France-set saga, with how it freshens up a long-running franchise.\nSource: Variety\nAbdullah Al-Ghamdi joined Screen Rant in 2019.

Where can each version be streamed?\nFrasier is one of the most iconic sitcoms of all time, and its reboot is one of the most highly anticipated shows of 2023, so where can each version of Frasier be streamed online? Spun off from Cheers, Frasier revolves around Kelsey Grammer’s neurotic psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane. In the original series, Frasier moved from Boston to Seattle and reluctantly allowed his estranged father Martin to live with him, which led to a heartwarming emotional reconnection across 11 critically acclaimed seasons. The reboot sees Frasier moving back to Boston to reconnect with his own estranged son, Freddy.\nThe third series to feature Dr. Crane in a key role is shaping up to be one of the hottest shows of the year. Although Grammer is the only cast member from the original series in the main cast of the reboot, the reboot is bringing back the original show’s classic multi-camera format. But it isn’t being broadcast on a traditional TV network like its predecessor; the Frasier reboot is a streaming exclusive that can only be watched on a certain streaming service.\nRELATED: Frasier's Reboot Answers The Original 19-Year-Old Cliffhanger Mystery\nThe Frasier reboot can be streamed on Paramount+. The series will premiere on October 12 with two episodes – episode 1, “The Good Father,” and episode 2, “Moving In” – after which new episodes will debut on the service weekly. Both Frasier’s new streaming home and its original network home, CBS, are owned by the same media conglomerate (formerly known as Viacom, now known as Paramount Global), so Paramount+ is keeping Dr. Crane in the family. The reboot’s first season will consist of 10 episodes, concluding its run on December 7.\nAll 11 seasons of the original Frasier series are available to be streamed on Hulu. The series is also available on Paramount+, where the new reboot will be airing, but only eight of the show’s 11 seasons are available to stream on there. To watch the entire series for the cost of a streaming subscription, Hulu is the best place to go. But it can also be bought or rented elsewhere.\nBesides Hulu and Paramount+, there are other streaming services where the original Frasier series is available to buy or rent. Seasons 1 through 11 are available to stream with a Prime Video membership until October 31. The last two seasons can also be purchased on Prime at a cost of $18.09 for season 10 and $19.99 for season 11 (or $2.99 per episode). All 11 seasons are available to buy on Google Play at a cost of $14.99 per season. The entire series is also available to buy on iTunes at a cost of $24.99 for all 11 seasons.\n"}
{"title": "Everything We Know About The Zeffo, The Ancient Aliens Who Once Ruled Star Wars' Galaxies", "date": "2023-10-09 14:30:26", "text": "Throughout a few Star Wars properties, a race of beings known as the Zeffo has been mentioned. Here is everything we know about the ancient species.\nDifferent sects of the Star Wars franchise have included mention of an ancient race known as the Zeffo which once ruled the galaxy; here is everything we know about the species. The Zeffo, or Zeffonians, were first introduced to the Star Wars franchise through the 2018 video game, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Since then, they have been mentioned in novels and comics connected to the game with even an Easter egg coming in Ahsoka linking to the ancient aliens.\nRelated: Ahsoka Episode 6 Ties Star Wars' Future To An Unexpected Story From 5 Years Ago\nBesides Ahsoka's Star Wars Zeffo reference, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has provided the most information about the Zeffonian race in the franchise. While upcoming Star Wars movies could further explore the ancient aliens, it seems unlikely given the mysterious disappearance of the species within the galaxy. With that said, here is everything Star Wars has provided concerning information on the Zeffo from their origins to their time in the galaxy and their mystifying absence.\nIn Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, it was explained that the Zeffo was a Force-sensitive race. Like the brief tidbits of information provided about Yoda's race, most Zeffonians held an inherent connection with the Force. The Zeffo were also incredibly ancient with their origins in the Star Wars galaxy dating back tens of thousands of years even predating the Jedi Order. In Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, it was established that the Zeffo were a peaceful race that referred to the Force as \"Life Wind\" with those capable of wielding the Force the best consisting of the Zeffonian version of the Jedi Order.\nThese powerful Zeffonian Force wielders were named Sages, something that features at length in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, In that game, it was revealed that three of the most powerful Zeffo Sages in the species' history were buried across the Star Wars galaxy on differing planets. These three Sages were named Eilram, Miktrull, and Kujet. The former two Sages were buried on the Zeffo homeworld. Eilram's tomb was situated in the halls of the Great School on Zeffo and was adorned with drawings of the Wroshyr Tree on Kashyyyk signifying the Zeffonian's fondness for the planet.\nMiktrull was buried in another tomb on Zeffo, hanging high above an abyss with various candles lighting the tomb. Kujet, however, had his tomb situated on Dathomir. At one point, Kujet ruled the Zeffo alone with his palace being located on Dathomir, explaining why the planet served as his resting place.\nGiven their connection to other planets, the Zeffo had colonized various different worlds across the Star Wars galaxy and beyond. From the planets the Zeffo inhabited in the Mid Rim to the Outer Rim territories and Zeffo itself, the race had a wide-reaching grasp on the ancient Star Wars galaxy. As such, here is every Zeffonian planet in the Star Wars franchise both in the prime galaxy and beyond.\nThe most obvious planet the Zeffo colonized was their home world of Zeffo. This is the primary location of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. The planet contains the tombs of Eilram and Miktrull as well as a vast array of other Zeffonian structures that prove the wide-reaching culture of the Zeffo and explain why they had such an impact on the wider galaxy.\nWhile Zeffo is the main planet shown to have housed Zeffonian culture in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Bogano is the first visited in the game that hints at Zeffonian involvement in the galaxy. The entire crux of the game is to enter a vault on Bogano built by the Zeffo to access a Holocron containing a list of Force-sensitive children across the galaxy. The various Zeffo structures on Bogano hold a strong connection to the Force as a result and provide hints for the game's main character, Cal Kestis, to travel to other Zeffo-controlled planets of old.\nOne of these planets in question is Dathomir. Before the introduction of the Zeffo, Dathomir was primarily known as the home of the Nightsisters, Star Wars' race of witches. However, Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order revealed that Kujet was buried on the planet of Dathomir amid his giant palace. Kujet once ruled the Zeffo after the deaths of Eilram and Miktrull as a ruthless, dark-side practitioner with Dathomir as his seat of power.\nWhile there is no evidence of the Zeffo colonizing Kashyyyk, it has been made clear that the race often frequented the Wookiee homeworld. Sage Eilram was known to have a strong connection with the Wookiees as evidenced by his tomb featuring a mural of the Wroshyr Tree from Kashyyyk. At this tree, Cal finds a hologram leading him to Dathomir and linking the two Zeffo-infused planets together.\nOne of the more interesting links between Star Wars canon and the Zeffo is the reference to the species in Ahsoka. Ahsoka included a second Star Wars galaxy as it was largely set on the planet of Peridea. In Ahsoka episode 6, runes can be seen on a fortress situated on Peridea reading \"Praise Kujet ruler of all, may his reign last,\" proving that Kujet, the Sith Zeffo Sage, had ruled over Peridea at one point in his life.\nThis Ahsoka Easter egg seems to provide evidence that Kujet ruled over the Nightsisters at one point. Another interesting retcon of the Star Wars galaxy found in Ahsoka was that the Nightsisters originally hailed from Peridea both explaining their strange culture and also their different utilization of the Force through Magick. The Nightsisters eventually left Peridea using the Purrgil to settle on the planet of Dathomir.\nAll of this proves that Kujet seemingly ruled over the Nightsisters. His name is mentioned on Peridea as a ruler with whoever inscribed the runes hoping for his reign to last. It would make sense then for Kujet to move to the main Star Wars galaxy alongside the Nightsisters with both settling on Dathomir, the home of the Nightsisters in modern Star Wars and the place of Kujet's palace.\nAfter the deaths of Eilram and Miktrull, Kujet began leading the Zeffo as a dark, ruthless, Sith Zeffonian. This was seen as the beginning of the end of Zeffonian dominance in the Star Wars galaxy. Kujet's dark reign resulted in a once-peaceful race becoming corrupted to the point where they faced extinction upon Kujet's death. This led to the remaining Zeffo vowing to disappear into the Unknown Regions, hoping to find peace once more among the stars.\nRelated: Ahsoka May Have Solved A Massive Disney Star Wars Mystery About Who Came Before The Jedi\nThis was explored in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. In that game, a recording can be found in which a Zeffonian is heard explaining this plan to travel into the Unknown Regions after Kujet's demise:\n\"I offer this record of our civilization to those who will follow. Despite our wisdom and technological achievement, we face extinction. Dogma blinded us to the path of balance and gradually we allowed our pride to corrupt us. The greater control we sought, the further we fell into ruin. I lead the remnants of my people into the great unknown, hoping that we finally find peace.\"\nThis could prove that the Zeffo left the Star Wars galaxy. After their disappearance into the Unknown Regions, the Zeffo were never seen again. Now that Ahsoka has established the idea of neighboring galaxies and even that the Zeffo once resided in one, the ancient Star Wars race may have simply disappeared into another galaxy to find peace after their corruption at the hands of the dark side of the Force.\n"}

Contains spoilers for Wonder Woman #1!The public image of Wonder Woman is cratering, and the world is turning against her. A heartbreaking cover reveals how the DC hero is turning from a beloved icon into a hated enemy - while her mission hasn't changed, Diana is now considered a supervillain by the American public.\nDC Comics has revealed what it has lined up for December, and there are a lot of goodies for fans to enjoy. The Titans-centric \"Beast World\" crossover continues to change the DC Universe in unexpected ways while Batman / Santa Claus: Silent Knight sees the Dark Knight and Saint Nick team up to save Christmas. Meanwhile, Wonder Woman's new era sees the Amazing Amazon fighting hatred and bigotry against her people.\nWith the world losing trust in the Amazons, Wonder Woman takes a moment to grant the wish of a dying boy and gives him the perfect day. Meanwhile, the Sovereign constricts his grip on the government. Will Wonder Woman be able to hold out hope as the world around her grows darker?\nThe solicitation for Wonder Woman #4 reveals that the ire brewing across the nation for the Amazons is hitting Wonder Woman hard, even as she tries to give a dying child the most perfect day possible. Despite Diana's best intentions, the vitriol against Amazons is getting worse. Daniel Sampere's cover shows a mural of the beloved hero is being defaced with graffiti. The image of Wonder Woman has been crossed out with a giant 'No' symbol as hurtful phrases such as \"Traitor\", \"Get Out!\", and \"Amazons go home\" are spray-painted onto the legend.\nWonder Woman might be one of the most beloved heroes around, but in an instant, public opinion started to turn against the leading DC figure's heritage. After an Amazon murdered nearly 20 men in a bar, the United States government reacted by creating an anti-Amazon task force and expelling every Amazon from American soil. Though not everyone believes Amazons are to be feared, enough paranoia has begun running rampant through the country and allowed hatred, bigotry and violence towards Amazons to flourish.\nEven Wonder Woman, a hero who has defended America, Earth, and the larger DC Universe numerous times over the years, is not free from the prejudice that's spiraling out of control. While the uneasy feelings are being stoked by major players with their own anti-Amazon agendas, it's unfortunate to see average people swayed by the hysteria that's boiled over in an instant. Diana has fought and bled for friends and enemies alike, all in the name of love and peace. But despite her years of service to the world, its people are turning on her, a sign of the dark new direction of the DC Universe.\nThanks to the actions of Insomnia in Knight Terrors, the reputation of DC heroes isn't faring very well, with many becoming afraid of what heroes are capable of. Wonder Woman may have not been responsible for the rogue Amazon's actions, but it's certainly not helping Diana fix her image in the public eye. Wonder Woman is seen by many as the best of the best and one of the most trustworthy and honorable heroes. If the public is losing faith in Wonder Woman, what hope do any other heroes have for regaining the trust of the world? Right now is the worst possible time for Diana's relationship with the public to sour, and if nothing changes, the world may stop trusting heroes altogether. Fans can get their hands on Daniel Sampere's cover when Wonder Woman #4 releases on December 19th.\n"}

The rise of the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 2008 and increasing competition from DC and Sony's Spider-Man franchises have made it so comic book movies are frequently some of the most popular films each year. 2022 was no different, as nine superhero movies were released from various existing cinematic universes and a few new attempted franchise starters. This does not even take the various superhero TV shows releasing on network television and streaming services into account, which are set to extend the DC and MCU release timeline respectively.\n2023's superhero movies represent more examples of how the genre is changing and evolving as time goes on. MCU Phase 5 kicked off in full force with three highly anticipated sequels, two of which end current trilogies.

The team also will fight the villainous High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) and Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), with the latter becoming a part of the new Guardians roster, finally capitalizing on the character's introduction in 2017.\nThe first of Sony's 2023 superhero movies was Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, which debuted in theaters on June 2. The sequel to Sony's surprise animated hit Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse retains writers Phil Lord and Chris Miller but brings in a new trio of directors with various experience in the genre.

He has to go from plans for world domination with his Minions to making sure his new daughters are tucked in for bedtime. The movie is fun, funny, and heartwarming.\nWatch on Netflix\nClassic Power Rangers shows are known for being pretty campy, but that’s part of the charm. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once And Always is the 30th anniversary special made for Netflix which manages to combine that campiness of the original series while still having depth and drama for a modern audience. The original Power Rangers lineup from 1993 reunites to take on a familiar threat while one of their children discovers their secret identity as a Power Ranger. It’s perfect for adults who grew up watching the series and their kids who might be watching the modern Dino Fury and Cosmic Fury series on Netflix.\nWatch on Netflix\nOne of the best family movies on Netflix is one of the newest Adam Sandler offerings for the streamer. Most of the Sandler family unites in roles in the movie which chronicles the Bat Mitzvah of his daughter’s friend. When she and her best friend fight right before the rite of passage, it puts a damper on their celebration. The movie is a great coming-of-age story that isn’t an animated or superhero feature that the entire family can enjoy.\nWatch on Netflix\nSet in the 1500s, this animated feature focuses on the mythical story of the city of gold in South America. Two con artists who live in Spain win a map to the city of El Dorado and decide they’re going to get one big score by using it. Their road to El Dorado is plagued with missteps and misadventures. In the end, the two revel in the adventure they share - whether they end up with gold or not - and have a taste for more adventure. The movie is gorgeously animated and the Kevin Cline and Kenneth Branagh are truly hilarious in their roles. Some of the more mature jokes will go over kids' heads, but will definitely make adults chuckle.\nWatch on Netflix\nThere’s always something great when the kids have to save the adults. That’s part of what makes the Spy Kids franchise so popular and Sky High a beloved Disney Channel Original Movie. We Can Be Heroes, from Robert Rodriguez, is a sequel to The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in the vein of Spy Kids, only the kids have the superpowers of Sky High. The story follows a group of kids who have to save the day when all the grown-up heroes in the world are in trouble. It’s a great look at what the world of Sharkboy and Lavagirl has become and another case where adults who saw the original movie when they were younger will love sharing this one with their kids.\nWatch on Netflix\nInspired by a trilogy of novels, A Babysitter’s Guide To Monster Hunting takes the idea of the monsters under the bed and in the closet and brings them to life. When a teenager (Tamara Smart) is tasked with babysitting the son of her mom’s boss, she witnesses a trio of small monsters abducting him. She discovers that the monsters she used to have nightmares of when she was a little girl are actually real. She’s recruited by a secret society of babysitters, all whom have had their own run-ins with the Boogeyman, and all who are tasked with protecting kids from monsters. It’s a great way to show kids that there’s no reason to be afraid of the monsters under the bed.\nWatch on Netflix\nNot all the best family movies on Netflix are animated or about things that are out of the ordinary. Here, Skater Girl is easily a story that could have been plucked from reality. Set in India, the story follows a young girl who falls in love with the sport of skateboarding. Unfortunately, the adults in her small town don’t approve of all the kids skateboarding everywhere. When an adult who brought skateboarding to town wants to build a skate park, the conflict between the rebellious skateboarders and the more traditional adults comes to a head.\nWatch on Netflix\nAwesome of the best family movies on Netflix are also classics. The Karate Kid might not be for the youngest of family members, but it will certainly appeal to older kids and their parents, especially if they’re already familiar with Cobra Kai, the sequel series to the Karate Kid movie franchise. Ralph Macchio stars as Daniel LaRusso as he moves to a new town, faces off against a bully, and is taught to defend himself and enter a karate competition. If the family enjoys the movie, there are more sequels and Cobra Kai to enjoy after finishing.\nWatch on Netflix\nCasper is one of the most beloved family Halloween movies of all time, but it can really be watched at any point in the year. Christina Ricci stars as Kat, a young girl who moves into a haunted house with her father (Bill Pullman) because he works as a professional ghost hunter. While she has trouble fitting in at school, she finds a new friend in Casper (Devon Sawa), the ghost of the boy who used to live in the house. While there are plenty of comedic antics in the movie, it also tugs at the heartstrings as Kat deals with her grief over losing her mother, and even gets a chance to see what Casper could have been like if he was living alongside her.\nWatch on Netflix\nWhen Finding Ohana became available to stream, it was quickly marked as one of the best family movies on Netflix as it earned a lot of comparisons to family classics like The Goonies. The movie follows a group of kids in Hawaii as they search for treasure when they’re moved to Hawaii to help an older relative. Finding Ohana focuses on the bond between friends and family as they go on an unbelievable adventure.\nWatch on Netflix\nRELATED: New On Netflix This Month\nAnimated movies can be dismissed as children’s fare, but movies like Puss In Boots: The Last Wish prove that animation is as much for adults as it is for kids. The animation of the movie itself is gorgeous, but it’s the story that will capture the hearts of kids and adults alike. It features Puss in Boots angling to restore his lost eight of nine lives by finding a Wishing Star. As he embarks on the emotional adventure though, he learns to value the one life he has left and even meets Death for a duel. It was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature.\nWatch on Netflix\nThis Netflix original movie features Jennifer Garner and Edgar Ramirez as parents who decide, for one day, to not tell their children “no.” It’s in an effort to help the family bond, for the mom and dad to trade off on disciplinary actions, and for the kids to understand just why their parents don’t allow them to do whatever they want. The movie manages to accomplish all those things while taking the audience on a fun ride through $40 ice cream sundaes, carwashes with the windows down, and a huge music festival. The movie also stars Jenna Ortega as the oldest daughter of the family is Wednesday fans are looking to see her in a slightly sunnier role.\nWatch on Netflix\nWith the voices of Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake as trolls on a musical adventure, it’s hard to imagine that anyone wouldn’t enjoy what Trolls has to offer. Poppy (Kendrick) and Branch (Timberlake) are polar opposites, but they have to team up to save their friends when their home is invaded. They’re very much in an odd-couple situation as Poppy is an eternal optimist and Branch is overly cautious. That’s what makes their adventure so fun to watch. If the family enjoys the movie, Netflix also offers a streaming series and a holiday special following the characters.\nWatch on Netflix\nOne of the best family movies on Netflix is also one of the best Christmas movies on the streamer. This animated story is Netflix’s take on a classic holiday feature, giving the audience an origin story for Santa Claus. Nicholas is tasked with finding a mythical village called Elfhelm, and when he does, the village is what inspires him to create Christmas Day celebrations. The movie might be a little cheesy for older kids, but it will definitely bring the family together if they’re looking for a holiday movie to enjoy.\nWatch on Netflix\nDisney’s animated Peter Pan might be available on Disney+, but the live-action Hook is currently available on Netflix. It gives the audience a look at what might happen if Peter Pan decided to grow up instead of remain a boy in Neverland forever. Complete with Robin Williams as Peter, Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell, and Dustin Hoffman as Hook, the movie has an impressive cast and infectious spirit that makes it a great successor to any adaptation of Peter Pan. It’s definitely a movie adults can share with their kids.\nWatch on Netflix\nThough the 1990s saw a live-action adaptation of Roald Dahl’s Matilda (which is also on Netflix), a Broadway musical adaptation of the book followed. This version of Matilda adapts the Broadway musical fantastically. Featuring Emma Thompson as the villain and Alisha Weir as the titular Matilda, the movie stands out from the previous adaptation thanks to its impressive musical numbers. The cast has fantastic chemistry and Weir earned several award nominations in England and Ireland for her work in the movie.\nWatch on Netflix\nThe Christmas Chronicles is one of Netflix’s earliest takes on an original holiday movie, and it’s easily one of the best family movies on Netflix. In it, children conspire to kidnap Santa Claus, played fantastically by Kurt Russell. The kids wind up having to assist Santa with delivering his gifts, giving them a great Christmas adventure and the audience a pretty cool Santa. Kurt Russell’s Santa is definitely unique among the many Santas that exist in pop culture. If the family enjoys the movie, there’s also a sequel on Netflix with Goldie Hawn as Mrs. Claus.\nWatch on Netflix\nSeeing Jason Momoa stepping into a family-friendly movie feels a little odd at first, but he is the best part of Slumberland. Slumberland follows a little girl — Nemo, played by Marlow Barkley — who lost her father and ends up entering a portal to Slumberland, the world in which dreams exist. She meets the eccentric outlaw Flip (Momoa), a man-goat hybrid and notorious con artist, and the pair set out on an adventure to fun her father. The inventive setting and Momoa's performance help to make this Netflix original a charming tale, with enough action and suspense to entertain both adults and kids of around 8 and up. Younger viewers may find some scenes scary given Slumberland's fantastical elements (such as Flip's sharpened teeth), but outside this Slumberland is guaranteed to deliver for a difficulty-free family movie on Netflix.\nWatch on Netflix\nA family movie on Netflix that'll engage viewers in the 5-6 age range, as well as older kids and adults, is Lyle, Lyle Crocodile. Like Hop, the fun of Lyle, Lyle Crocodile comes from having a talking CGI animal thrown in with the bemused characters and watching the hilarity ensue. The live-action adaptation of a children's book about a singing crocodile could have been a big miss, so it is impressive that Lyle, Lyle Crocodile ended up as charming as it is. The movie follows the titular crocodile who lives with a family in New York City, helping to make their lives better. It is a silly yet fun ride with a surprisingly committed performance from Javier Bardem, clearly having a lot of fun in the movie.\nWatch on Netflix\nAs far as family movies on Netflix that are part of existing properties go, few belong to as recognizable a household name as Goosebumps — and the 2015 movie starring Jack Black is nothing if not a celebration of source material. Bringing R.L Stine's beloved children's horror book series to life was no easy task, but Goosebumps found a clever way to handle the material. The movie follows a group of youngsters who meet R. L Stine (Black) and accidentally unleash the horrors from his books. Goosebumps features a notably committed comedic performance from Jack Black, and spiritually taps into the legacy of classics like Jumanji and Ghost Busters. Younger viewers may struggle with the horror elements of Goosebumps, but parents with kids between the ages of 7-9 have reported getting thumbs-ups and no nightmares. This is definitely a family movie on Netflix which, provided the youngest viewers present have a proclivity for Halloween and all things spooky, will be enjoyed by adults as much as the kids.\nWatch on Netflix\nRELATED: Best Coming-Of-Age Movies On Netflix\n\nMatt Berger is a writer, comedian, actor, Paddington enthusiast, and Corgi dad.

{"title": "What The Cast Of An American Werewolf In London Has Done Since 1981", "date": "2023-10-09 14:40:28", "text": "In 1981, An American Werewolf in London awed audiences with its horrifying and gory premise, but over thirty years later, what is the cast doing now?\nSince its release in 1981, An American Werewolf in London has become a classic in the horror genre, and for good reason, but now that more than thirty years have passed, some viewers may be wondering, what happened to the cast of this iconic film? An American Werewolf in London tells the story of best friends David and Jack who go on a backpacking trip in England that goes horribly wrong when the men are attacked by a wolf. Jack is killed, but David only sustains a few injuries that quickly snowball into something more sinister, as David begins having visions and discovers that he might just be a werewolf.\nAn American Werewolf in London earned much of its success from the unique way in which the popular werewolf movie was tackled. It wasn't just a straight horror, but instead was a scary horror comedy movie. These genres might seem to directly oppose each other, but in actuality, this mix of terrifying and clever made the movie stand-out. Another major aspect of the film that led to its success was its makeup and special effects. The scene in which David first becomes a werewolf is iconic, and arguably, changed special effects in the horror genre forever. These aspects, plus the cast's amazing performances, made for an all around terrific film.\nRelated: 10 Things You Didn't Know About An American Werewolf in London\nThe lead actor of An American Werewolf in London is David Naughton, playing the role of the man-turned-werewolf, David Kessler. Naughton is really the face of the film, and David's tragic story is one that is full of ups and downs that are both horrifying and absurdly comedic. After this film, Naughton continued acting, appearing in projects like Makin' It, My Sister Sam, and Granite Flats. Notably, Naughton's film career has remained firmly in the horror genre, and he continued to appear in horror films until 2017. Ultimately, An American Werewolf in London was a massive part of Naughton's career, and it clearly affected the projects he worked on afterward.\nThough his character isn't alive for long, Jack Goodman is arguably the second most important character in An American Werewolf in London. Jack returns to haunt David after his death, revealing to him his new werewolf identity and urging David to cut off the bloodline, so that he can be free. He is played by Griffin Dunne. Following his role as Jack Goodman, Dunne went on to become an established and successful actor, director, and producer. He has worked on popular projects like This is Us, Ocean's 8, Practical Magic and The French Dispatch, however his biggest role outside An American Werewolf in London is the 1986 film After Hours.\nOf the main An American Werewolf in London cast, Griffin Dunne is the actor that is still the most active. Dunne's most recent work includes a 2023 movie entitled Ex-Husbands in which he is both executive producer and actor. Additionally, Dunne has a new television series on the horizon called The Girls on the Bus, which has no release date as of yet. Plus, Dunne has appeared in a variety of popular series of the time including Succession, Billions, Search Party, and The L Word: Generation Q. All in all, Griffin Dunne seems to be far from retiring from Hollywood, unlike many of his An American Werewolf in London costars.\nDespite the horrors David is facing, he still manages to find love in An American Werewolf in London with a kind-hearted nurse named Alex Price, played by Jenny Agutter. Unlike her costars, Agutter began acting as a child, and had already achieved moderate success before An American Werewolf in London. Before the film, she won both an Emmy and a BAFTA award. Furthermore, Agutter is known for her work on the British franchise The Railway Children, which she worked on most recently in 2022. Though she has appeared on-screen often since 1981, Agutter's best known projects include The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and Call the Midwife.\nLike Griffin Dunne, Jenny Agutter is still present in the acting world. She has most recently appeared in the 2022 film The Railway Children Return, and also, still appears on the BBC series Call the Midwife, which she has been a part of for all twelve seasons. Although much of Agutter's work is rooted in the British film and television landscape, she has made quite a name for herself both in England and the U.S.\nAfter David and Jack are attacked by the werewolf, Inspector Villiers tells David they were attacked by \"an escaped lunatic,\" however, David disagrees. For the rest of the film, Villiers lingers around David as he comes to terms with his new identity, until unfortunately, the inspector sees a tragic fate at the end of An American Werewolf in London. Inspector Villiers is played by Don McKillop. While McKillop began his career in television, with appearances in series like Doctor Who and Sutherland's Law, his final project after An American Werewolf in London was a 1982 TV movie called Walter. During his acting career, McKillop also worked as a metalwork teacher.\nAt the age of 94, John Woodvine has appeared in countless stage shows, television series, and movies, including An American Werewolf in London, where he played Dr. J.S. Hirsch. Dr. Hirsch cares for David after the attack, but becomes suspicious of him due to his refusal to accept that he was attacked by a human. Hirsch investigates, going to the Slaughtered Lamb where David and Jack were attacked, but before he can solve the mystery, David is out of control. Following An American Werewolf in London, Woodvine appeared in projects such as Wuthering Heights, Persuasion, Vanity Fair, and The Crown. Woodvine's biggest achievements are likely concerning his theater roles.\nDespite his very brief appearance, Frank Oz's involvement in An American Werewolf in London must be mentioned. The famed puppeteer, actor, and director plays Mr. Collins. Collins visits David in the hospital and tells him that his parents have been notified of what happened. After, he complains to Dr. Hirsch that today's youth don't appreciate anything. Oz's career had already begun before An American Werewolf in London, and only blossomed further after the film. Oz is best known for his portrayals of the Muppets and Yoda in Star Wars. After 1981, he continued portraying these characters in various films along with performances in Monsters Inc., Inside Out, and Knives Out.\n"}
{"title": "MCU Phase 4 Director Reignites MCU Vs. DCEU Debates", "date": "2023-10-09 14:40:28", "text": "The debate regarding the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the DCEU continues as one of the MCU's Phase 4 directors chimes in on the two franchises.\nThe never-ending debate about the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the DCEU continues after director Mohamed Diab, who worked on Moon Knight in Phase 4, gives his thoughts about the two gargantuan superhero franchises. Even before they were major Hollywood movie franchises, there has always been a rivalry between the DC and Marvel audiences. Whether it is about which has the stronger superheroes, the better storylines, or the best rogue's gallery, there are plenty of aspects that can be debated about when it comes to DC and Marvel.\nIn terms of the DCEU and MCU, the latter has had a more stable success since its launch in 2008 compared to the former, which began in 2013. One of the elements that have been heavily criticized about the DCEU movie timeline is the general tone set by Zack Snyder's movies, and Moon Knight director Mohammed Diab reflected on these sentiments in an interview with Arabic Marvel (translated via The Cosmic Circus). After discussing the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Phase 4 director opened up about why he prefers the MCU as opposed to the DCEU, while also sharing his admiration for James Gunn and what he will do with the new DC Universe:\nI know that some people don’t like James Gunn, but I see him as a great artist who will do great work. Frankly, I didn’t like the past period. The last film, [Zack Snyder's] Justice League, was significantly better than the first version, but in the end, Snyder’s work in all the movies he made didn’t appeal to me. I liked James Gunn’s films much more. I think he’s a much greater artist and a very clever writer, and he will do excellent work for DC. I hope people won’t just criticize him because if he loses the DC audience, he’s done. But he is an artist, and he will create wonderful things.\nRELATED: How To Watch the Marvel Movies In Order (By Release Date & In Order Of MCU Timeline Events)\nEven with the DCEU almost over, there will always be discussions about which is the stronger superhero franchise. Despite the MCU having a bigger financial success, there are still elements where the DCEU has thrived. For example, it took them less than five years to get a solo female superhero movie with Wonder Woman, while Marvel Studios took way longer for Captain Marvel to happen. However, at the same time, the MCU has shown that having a plan and sticking to it works, whereas the DCEU has fumbled repeatedly when it comes to that aspect.\nUltimately, the MCU and the DCEU - and soon the DC Universe - will need each other's success in order to continue growing. The discussion about superhero fatigue has become a bigger topic this year in light of a lot of box office struggles. The comic book movie genre isn't the problem, but more so the type of stories that the studios are choosing to tell, meaning that perhaps they need to switch things up in terms of what heroes and villains they choose to adapt for the big screen.\nIt will definitely be interesting to see how Gunn's DC Universe holds up against the MCU when it starts, especially as he was one of the filmmakers to bring success to Marvel Studios during his tenure. In the case of the MCU, they still have the Multiverse Saga going on, with some of the bigger projects yet to come, which may add more hype to their long-term game. Time will tell if the MCU and DC Universe will have the same rivalry in the coming years, as more movies continue getting released.\nSource: Arabic Marvel (translated via The Cosmic Circus)\n"}
{"title": "Francis Ford Coppola Reveals His Review Of Martin Scorsese's Killers Of The Flower Moon", "date": "2023-10-09 14:41:01", "text": "The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, a longtime friend of Martin Scorsese, has nothing but kind words to say about Killers of the Flower Moon.\nMartin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon receives praise from fellow legendary director Francis Ford Coppola. A contemporary of Scorsese, Coppola is the director of copious iconic films, including The Conversation, The Godfather trilogy, and Apocalypse Now. Scorsese has since become equally as prolific, and will release his latest 3.5 hour epic, Killers of the Flower Moon, on October 20.\nCoppola sings Killers of the Flower Moon’s praises in a recent post on Instagram. Alongside the trailer for Killers of the Flower Moon, Coppola alerted followers that his “longtime friend” Scorsese “has a new film coming out this month.” Check out his post, below:\nCoppola had nothing but nice things to say about both Scorsese and Killers of the Flower Moon. Of the film, Coppola wrote that Killers of the Flower Moon “delivers on every level.” Coppola even went so far as to call Scorsese “the world’s greatest living filmmaker.”\nAs Coppola mentions, he and Scorsese have been friends for decades. Having long supported each other’s work, Coppola even offered Scorsese the chance to direct The Godfather: Part II, which Scorsese famously turned down. Thus, this Killers of the Flower Moon praise is touching coming from someone so close to Scorsese.\nRelated: Why Killers Of The Flower Moon Took 6 Years For Martin Scorsese To Make\nGiven Coppola’s filmmaking prowess, his Killers of the Flower Moon comments also go a long way in predicting the critical success of the film. Already, Killers of the Flower Moon has set itself apart through its stated portrayal of the Osage tribe. Rather than make the film a white-centric narrative, Scorsese chose to put actress Lily Gladstone, who plays a woman of the Osage tribe, at the heart of Killers of the Flower Moon. Combined with a promising Killers of the Flower Moon trailer, this fact cements the film as one of the most culturally important films to come out of Hollywood this year.\nFurthermore, Killers of the Flower Moon has the opportunity to fill a massive box office voice this fall. As Dune: Part Two’s delayed release date leaves the fall 2023 theatrical scene looking more sparse, Killers of the Flower Moon has the potential to drive up IMAX revenue as audiences look for other options. Thus, Killers of the Flower Moon could become both a box office and critical darling upon its rapidly-approaching October release.\nSource: Francis Ford Coppola / Instagram\n"}

Now the debut of the sequel, Den of Thieves 2: Pantera is imminent.\nDen of Thieves drew praise in particular for its Keyser Söze-like twist when Butler’s Big Nick realized that Jack Jr’s Donnie wasn’t the borderline-unwilling participant in a plot to rob the Federal Reserve he first appeared. It was revealed at the end of Den of Thieves that Donnie was, in fact, the mastermind behind the entire heist. Den of Thieves 2: Pantera will pick up after the first movie, with Big Nick traveling to Europe to bring Donnie to justice once and for all.\nSignificant casting news for Den of Thieves 2: Pantera arrived on August 1, 2023 (via Deadline).

It was revealed on announcement that both Gerard Butler and O’Shea Jackson Jr. would be reprising their roles as Big Nick and Donnie Wilson.

{"title": "Every Way Sam Raimi's Canceled Spider-Man 4 Plans Live On In Other Movies", "date": "2023-10-10 18:00:26", "text": "Sam Raimi was originally set to direct Spider-Man 4, which was canceled, but at least several of the director's ideas live on in other Marvel movies.\nSam Raimi's canceled Spider-Man 4 lives on since many of the director's ideas for the film made their way into The Amazing Spider-Man movies and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Raimi and Tobey Maguire's partnership was not meant to end with the controversial Spider-Man 3, as the director and Peter Parker actor were originally going to return for Spider-Man 4. The movie was canceled after Raimi pulled out of Spider-Man 4 due to the studio's constant requests, as he did not want to go through a repeat of Spider-Man 3's problems. Despite never happening, several Spider-Man 4 ideas live on in all the Spider-Man movies that came after Raimi's exit.\nFollowing the end of Raimi's time with the Spider-Man franchise, Sony rebooted the character on the big screen with Andrew Garfield playing Peter Parker in two The Amazing Spider-Man movies. The actor was then recast with Tom Holland taking on the role of the MCU's version of Spider-Man, with Marvel Studios and Sony co-producing the MCU's Spider-Man films. Holland will return for his own Spider-Man 4, reaching the milestone that Raimi never did. Several details from Raimi's Spider-Man 4 have become known over the years, and they reveal that many of the director's ideas live on in other Spider-Man movies.\n Related: Every MCU Spider-Man Movie Ranked\nSpider-Man 4's Vulture would have been terrifying, with the character meant to be the movie's main villain. Before departing the project, Raimi had cast John Malkovich to play the Vulture. Spider-Man 4 storyboard artist Jeffrey Henderson revealed that Malkovich's Vulture would have been \"a private contractor\" who \"didn’t leave anything but bones behind\" after he was done. The Vulture ended up being the villain of the MCU's Spider-Man: Homecoming, with Michael Keaton's version of the character also being a private contractor who was quite violent. Keaton's Adrian Toomes was as menacing as Raimi's ideas for the character describe him, with Keaton's car scene with Holland's Peter Parker perfectly showcasing that.\nSpider-Man 4 almost had Angelina Jolie play the Vulture's daughter. While Jolie debuted as Thena in the MCU's Eternals, the actress was Raimi's choice to play the Vulture's daughter. Jolie's character would have become the Vultress — an original supervillain for the movie — after her father's death. Vulture's daughter's role before that was described as \"an accomplished executive representing a venture capital firm that was trying to buy the Daily Bugle.\" Spider-Man: Homecoming ended up giving Keaton's Vulture a daughter in the MCU, though it was Spider-Man comics character Liz Allan, a high school student and not an executive like Jolie's character, repurposed for the role, leading to a shocking reveal.\nRaimi's Spider-Man movies set up the Lizard to debut in his full glory, which could have happened in Spider-Man 4. After Dylan Baker had appeared as Dr. Curt Connors in Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3, the character would have transformed into his evil monster form in the canceled Spider-Man 4. While that never came to pass, the Lizard, played by Rhys Ifans, ended up being the villain of The Amazing Spider-Man, going up against Garfield's Spider-Man after Raimi's film was canceled and Sony decided to reboot the franchise with a more modern take.\nWhile promoting his first MCU director gig, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Raimi confirmed Bruce Campbell could have played Mysterio in Spider-Man 4. According to the director, he had planned a few possible cameo roles for Campbell to continue their ongoing partnership in Spider-Man 4, with Raimi revealing, \"[Mysterio] was one of the possibilities.\" Jake Gyllenhaal ended up playing Mysterio in Spider-Man: Far From Home, with the villain making his live-action debut. Gyllenhaal delivered a magnetic performance as Mysterio, with the villain dying at the end of the film, but leaving behind a video that revealed Peter Parker was Spider-Man to the world, completely changing the hero's life.\nSpeaking with Vulture in 2013, Raimi revealed that Anne Hathaway was set to play Felicia Hardy, known as the anti-hero Black Cat, in Spider-Man 4. Hathaway's Black Cat could have become as much of a fan-favorite as her Catwoman was in The Dark Knight Rises, with Raimi saying, \"I loved what she was doing with the auditions for Spider-Man 4.\" Then, 2014's The Amazing Spider-Man 2 saw Felicity Jones play Hardy in a minor role as Norman Osborn's assistant. Jones never became Black Cat due to The Amazing Spider-Man 3 being canceled, and the planned Silver & Black film getting stuck in development hell ended her chances to suit up.\nMaguire's return as his version of Peter Parker in the MCU's Spider-Man: No Way Home teased what happened to his character after Spider-Man 3. Maguire's Peter revealed that he managed to make his relationship with Kirsten Dunst's MJ work despite it being hard. Details from Raimi's idea for Spider-Man 4's Peter and Mary Jane relationship have since emerged, and the two would have broken up for at least part of the film before likely finding their way back together like had happened during Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy. Maguire's line in Spider-Man: No Way Home backs that up, with Raimi's versions of Peter and MJ still together years after Spider-Man 3's events.\nThere are many reasons Raimi's Spider-Man 4 could have been great, and one of them is the movie's opening montage. It has been revealed that Spider-Man 4 would have begun with Maguire's Spider-Man defeating smaller villains before going up against the Vulture and the Lizard, and one of them was the Prowler. Donald Glover played Aaron Davis in Spider-Man: Homecoming, then reprised his role in the animated Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, this time appearing as a fully realized Prowler variant. The Spider-Verse franchise uses the Prowler in a much bigger role than Spider-Man 4 would have, as the villain is the uncle of the franchise's main hero, Miles Morales.\nAnother villain that Maguire's wall-crawler would have stopped in the opening montage of Raimi's Spider-Man 4 would have been the Shocker. Two versions of the character made their way into the MCU's Spider-Man: Homecoming. Logan Marshall-Green played the film's first Shocker, Jackson Brice, who was accidentally killed by Keaton's Vulture after threatening to expose his crimes to Vulture's family and the police. Bokeem Woodbine's Herman Schultz, the main version of Shocker from Marvel Comics, then assumed Brice's role, being dubbed the new Shocker by Adrian Toomes.\nSpider-Man 4's opening montage would also have included the Rhino. The character ended up debuting in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, with Paul Giamatti's character using a mechanical Rhino suit that was a major departure from the Rhino's physical transformation from the comics. The Rhino's silhouette was then seen in Spider-Man: No Way Home when all the characters that knew Peter Parker was Spider-Man across the multiverse were getting pulled into the MCU. Now, the Rhino is set to debut in his full glory in 2024's Kraven the Hunter, with Alessandro Nivola playing a comic book-accurate version of the Rhino, which brings another of Raimi's Spider-Man 4 ideas fully to life.\n"}
{"title": "Star Trek: Picard Eliminated Starfleet’s 3 Biggest Enemies From 3 Quadrants", "date": "2023-10-10 18:00:26", "text": "Over the course of its three seasons, Star Trek: Picard effectively put an end to three of Starfleet's greatest enemies from 3 quadrants.\nAfter the events of Star Trek: Picard, the United Federation of Planets no longer has to worry about three of its biggest enemies from 3 quadrants of Star Trek's galaxy. Over the course of Picard's three seasons, Admiral Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) faced his past demons both literally and figuratively. Not only did he grapple with the traumas of his childhood, but he also faced off against some of the Federation's greatest enemies for the last time. The Romulans, the Changelings, and the Borg have been enemies of the Federation since their introductions, but by the end of Picard season 3, all of these threats have been neutralized.\nThe United Federation of Planets primarily governs over the Alpha Quadrant, while the Romulan Star Empire were a threat from the Beta Quadrant, the Borg hailed from the Delta Quadrant, and the Dominion ruled the Gamma Quadrant. Star Trek: Deep Space Nine saw the Federation engage in an all-out war with the villainous Dominion led by the Changelings. Since their introduction in Star Trek: The Next Generation, the Borg have proven to be one of the most dangerous enemies the Federation has ever faced. All three of these enemies have caused numerous problems for Starfleet over the years, but Star Trek: Picard saw these threats from three different quadrants come to an end.\nRelated: Star Trek Picard Cast & Character Guide: All 3 Seasons\nStar Trek: Picard season 1 dealt with the fallout from the destruction of the planet Romulus from their sun going supernova as established by J.J. Abrams' Star Trek 2009 movie. The supernova resulted in millions of Romulans killed or turned into refugees. Although Starfleet initially helped to evacuate the Romulans, after synths attacked Mars in 2285, Starfleet scaled back their aid with the evacuation. The destruction of Romulus effectively ended any threat the Romulans would pose to the Federation and even made them temporary allies. The Federation appears to be safe from any major enemy in the Beta Quadrant in Picard's early 25th century.\nIn Star Trek: Picard season 3, the Changelings from the Gamma Quadrant joined forces with the Borg from the Delta Quadrant to Borg Queen to assimilate Starfleet and destroy the Federation. The Borg/Changeling plot culminated with a devastating attack at Starfleet's Frontier Day celebration, but Admiral Picard and the USS Enterprise-D crew managed to stop it and save the galaxy yet again. With the destruction of the evil Borg Queen and her Borg Cube, the Borg Collective has effectively been eliminated as a threat. Starfleet also began rooting out the Changelings still hiding undercover, ending any lingering threat from the remnants of the Dominion. Starfleet's triumph at the end of Picard season 3 simultaneously put an end to the Federation's greatest threats from the Delta and Gamma Quadrants.\nSince Star Trek: Picard put an end to most of the threats from Star Trek: The Next Generation and DS9, any future Star Trek projects should create new enemies. If the proposed Picard spin-off Star Trek: Legacy gets the green light, it will likely follow Captain Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) and her crew aboard the newly rechristened USS Enterprise-G. As Starfleet continues to move into the 25th century, they will explore farther and farther out into the galaxy. This could lead to encounters with any number of previously unknown alien species, some of which are bound to be hostile.\nBased on the post-credits scene in Star Trek: Picard season 3's finale, Q (John de Lancie) will also play a role in Star Trek: Legacy, as he seems to have taken a particular interest in Picard's son, Ensign Jack Crusher (Ed Speleers). In TNG, Q was responsible for introducing the Federation to the Borg, so it's entirely plausible that he could introduce the Enterprise-G to an entirely new foe as a test for Jack and the rest of the crew. With modern technology and CGI, the creative team behind Star Trek: Legacy, if it happens, has the potential to create a new, truly alien enemy to take the place of the three classic Star Trek villains who were neutralized in Star Trek: Picard.\n"}

Molly, 48, is a single mom of two girls who was first seen in 90 Day Fiancé season 5. Molly's marriage to Luis Mendez ended in divorce within a few months, but she didn't give up on her search for love. She met New York cop Kelly via her DMs. She began dating him in 90 Day: The Single Life season 1. Slowly, things evolved into a serious relationship. Kelly ended up retiring and moved to Georgia to be closer to Molly.\nBut the plan backfired, leading to the couple's split in November 2022. Molly and Kelly were broken up when they came to 90 Day: The Last Resort. They left the resort single as therapy failed to resolve the trauma they had. According to Instagram blogger Merry Pants, Molly is reportedly now dating someone new all over again.\nThey posted a selfie of Molly with a bearded man who seems to be known as \"The Prison KingPin.\" There were several other photos of the man seemingly from his wedding. The blogger claimed that the man Molly is seeing is a \"married man.\" He appears to have married his \"longtime sweetheart,\" with whom he also shares a child, within a year of being released from prison.\nThe blogger claimed the man went to Florida to continue the rest of Molly's stay with her once Kelly left the resort in January 2023. Since then, Molly and her rumored boyfriend have been spotted together on numerous occasions throughout the year. They were spotted together in September 2023. It is alleged that Molly met the \"Prison KingPin\" at the Atlanta women's expo in late 2022. Molly is the founder and owner of a lingerie store called LiviRae Lingerie. She was still together with Kelly at the time.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nInterestingly, Kelly had something to say about his ex-girlfriend's reported new relationship in the Instagram post's comments section. \"Dang girl! A jail bird and he’s married? @kellykb2022 sure dodged a bullet with this girl,\" a fan wrote while tagging Kelly. Kelly chose to reply to the fan, writing, \"I sure did!! I'm shock[ed].\" Kelly and Molly didn't end the relationship on a good note. The split happened after Molly's daughter Olivia Hopkins accused Kelly of allegedly choking and slamming her during an altercation. Olivia filed a report about the incident in February 2023. Kelly soon had a warrant out for his arrest, but it was recently dismissed.\nKelly blamed Molly for taking him on 90 Day: The Last Resort, even though she didn't love him. Molly blamed Kelly for making promises he couldn't keep. They both admitted that the relationship had run its course. Kelly knew he and Molly didn't stand a chance. Perhaps he already knew about the new man in Molly's life. Molly and Kelly had hugged goodbye when they parted ways. Despite the week of progress they made with the couples' therapy at the resort, there was no saving Molly and Kelly's doomed relationship.\n90 Day: The Last Resort airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EDT on TLC.\nSource: @Merrypants/Instagram\n"}

The four-part series takes a deep dive into the previously unknown thoughts and sentiments of international celebrity David Beckham. Beckham rose to fame from his skills on the soccer field before also becoming a model and eventually the co-owner of the MLS team Inter Miami. Under Stevens's thorough direction, Beckham opens up like never before in this must-see docuseries that is compelling even for non-soccer fans.\nDavid Beckham's soccer career spanned twenty years, playing for two of the most coveted Premier League franchises in history, Manchester United and Real Madrid. Beckham also played for five years for LA Galaxy in an effort to popularize professional soccer in the United States. Over fifteen years later, the best player in the world Lionel Messi has followed in David's footsteps, playing for Inter Miami and single-handedly gaining the interest of the Western sports world that is widely overtaken by American football, basketball, and baseball. Fisher Stevens plays an integral role in Beckham mostly behind the camera, but here is where you might already know him as either a prominent actor or director.\nRELATED: 10 Most Shocking Reveals In The David Beckham Netflix Documentary\nFisher Stevens is arguably most recognizable today from his recent portrayal as Hugo in the critically acclaimed HBO series Succession. In Succession, Stevens's Hugo acts as a loyal servant to the Roy family empire with a vested interest in how the chips fall in the final season. Stevens, 59, has been a professional actor since 1981, making his first prominent appearance in the 1986 sci-fi movie Short Circuit as Ben. During his more than 40 years of acting, Stevens has also been featured in Friends season 1, episode 13 as Roger, as well as an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia in season 4.\nOn the other side of the camera, Stevens has garnered critical acclaim for his directorial and producing efforts. He was a producer on the 2009 documentary film The Cove, which won an Academy Award for Best Documentary, Feature. The Cove raised awareness of shocking occurrences of animal abuse and captivity regarding wild dolphins in Taiji, Japan. Stevens has also produced several other humanitarian and oceanic documentaries such as Mission Blue, Racing Extinction, and Before the Flood. He was also the Executive Producer of Tiger King.\nAccording to Esquire, Stevens jumped on board for the David Beckham documentary through the recommendation of Leonardo DiCaprio, whom he had worked with on Before the Flood. DiCaprio also knew that Stevens was a big soccer fan and believed that he would be a perfect fit for Beckham. Stevens was filming Succession at the time he was considering directing Beckham and received encouragement from Succession writers/producers Jesse Armstrong and Tony Roche. Beckham and Stevens met and agreed to work together, particularly because Stevens wasn't British or overly aware of the soccer player's personal history. The end result is Beckham, streaming now on Netflix.\nSource: Esquire\n"}
{"title": "Gen V Pays Off A Brilliant Deep-Cut The Boys Easter Egg Over 1 Year Later", "date": "2023-10-10 18:10:27", "text": "This The Boys season 3 easter egg was a year in the making, but has now finally paid off with the release of the franchise spinoff, Gen V. \nAlthough Gen V is only now airing on Amazon Prime Video, its predecessor The Boys already set up for the spinoff series in season 3 with this brief easter egg. Gen V is the latest show to come from the greater The Boys franchise, which follows a world in which superheroes, or supes, are both celebrity and hero alike, and plenty of darkness hides behind their facades. Meanwhile, Gen V's supes are college-age and attending the legendary Godolkin University, but once again, they must uncover the secrets their superiors don't want them to know.\nFor some, Gen V might seem completely unconnected from The Boys, apart from the fact that they take place in the same universe. Before Gen V aired, it was difficult to find an actual connection between the shows. However, in The Boys season 3, there was a true link that set up Gen V, even if it was brief. This moment, which came early on in the season, is tiny, but it confirms that The Boys set up Gen V, and furthermore, that the shows are much closer to each other than previously thought.\nRelated: Did Homelander Go To Gen V's University Before The Boys?\nThe Boys season 3 gives audiences a sneak peek at Marie Moreau with a brief Gen V easter egg. It occurs in season 3, episode 2, when Hughie visits a group home for powerful children, the Red River Institute. Those who have watched at least one episode of Gen V may be familiar with this name, but back when The Boys season 3 first aired, no viewer could have seen the connection. Luckily, it made itself clearer when Hughie searched Red River's databases, and one particular profile came on screen: Marie M. aka Marie Moreau. Though the cameo is brief, both her name and her picture appear in the database.\nBack when Gen V was far from being released, this easter egg may have gone completely unnoticed. However, at that point Jaz Sinclair had already been cast as Marie, therefore, the cameo was definitely purposeful and planted for the most observant of fans to notice. And now, as Gen V hits screens, this easter egg is finally paying off. This is a somewhat awesome feat, as the easter egg was so tiny and quite literally a year in the making, but now it all makes sense. It proves that The Boys set up Gen V, and that in the future, the two shows could be even more connected.\nApart from setting up Gen V long before its release date, this easter egg also connects Marie directly to the main series. While Gen V has many cameos and references to The Boys, their worlds are still quite separate. However, because Hughie stole data from the Red River Institute, that means he has Marie's file. This gives The Boys an opportunity to bring Marie into the series, but it could also have serious consequences in Gen V, as Marie hides the truth of what happened to her parents. No matter how it plays out, Marie is decidedly linked to The Boys, and this connection could explode at any time.\n"}
{"title": "Chucky Executive Producer Alex Hedlund On Setting Season 3 In The White House", "date": "2023-10-10 18:10:53", "text": "Chucky season 3 executive producer Alex Hedlund discusses the inspiration for the White House setting and the legends surrounding the building.\nChucky follows Jake Wheeler, his best friend turned boyfriend Devon Evans, and their friend Lexy Cross, who continually attempts to take down Chuck after Jake accidentally purchases the doll without realizing it's been possessed by the spirit of a serial killer. The third season promises to be the most terrifying yet, with Chucky making his way to the White House. Now embedded with the first family, he terrorizes them and the rest of the White House, continuing his murderous ways and lust for power.\nChucky was created by Don Mancini, who has helmed the Chucky franchise since the beginning. The series is a sequel to the seventh film, Cult of Chucky, continuing the story of the possessed and murderous doll. In Chucky season 3, Jennifer Tilly, Zackary Arthur, Bjorgvin Arnarson, Alyvia Alyn Lind, and Fiona Dourif all reprise their roles, with Brad Dourif also returning as the voice of Chucky. Devon Sawa joins the cast as a series regular, with Sarah Sherman and Kenan Thompson also making appearances.\nRelated: Chucky Creator Confirms Talks Of Potential Horror Monster Crossover\nScreen Rant spoke with executive producer Alex Hedlund about the third season of Chucky. He shares what inspired them to set this season in the White House and how the infamous Overlook Hotel from The Shinning was an important influence. Hedlund also breaks down why they wanted to focus on the family aspect instead of centering the season on the geopolitics that go on in the White House.\nScreen Rant: The reason I love this time of year is because of Chucky. I didn't think anything could top last season. It was wild, genre-bending, and so meta. And this season has a darker agenda. How does your team increase the scare level this season ?\nAlex Hedlund: So, everything starts with Don. Don and the writers. They get into the room and they just jam on these amazing ideas. It's so much fun to sort of hear what they come up with and how ideas take shape. The idea of the White House came from Don when we were wrapping up season two. He pitched it and I was like, \"Oh, that's really interesting.\" I had so many questions and he started talking about it like it was the Overlook Hotel and the more and more that he talked about it, particularly all of the lore and the ghost stories that actually inhabit the White House, and nobody talks about that stuff.\nBut there are all these little factoids and little myths and stuff of legend that kind of make its way into the show. That authenticity is important, but just the idea of looking at the White House, not as any political statement, but it's a creepy old house. There's a lot of history. There's a lot of secrets. It's like the perfect setting for a place to drop Chucky into because it's sort of a source of unlimited power and protection. That ability to not only be in someplace that is seemingly impenetrable from the outside world, but also to keep people in who can't get out, it is like this perfect setting that wrapped in this big high concept idea.\nIt is like a chamber piece with this family that's really unknowingly trapped inside with this killer doll. And that dark agenda is really going to play out. Particularly in the second half, which we're really excited to get back to shooting and hopefully releasing sometime in early 2024. Very much TBD, though.\nThis season's described as The Shining meets House of Cards with Chucky at the center of it. Can you talk about some of the things we're going to explore? Even in the first episode, there's a little nod to the house being haunted. How much research did you guys do on that side of the White House that we don't usually get to see?\nAlex Hedlund: There was an incredible amount of research and all of the credit goes to Don and the writer's room for really doing their homework. There's no other way to put it. There was so much to dig into, not only... One, all of the ghost stories and the myths and the history and all of these little... The stuff of legend. It was really, that was all kind of the juicy stuff. But then Don and the writers also had to sort of contend with the protocols and really trying to get everything as accurately as possible when it comes to, what is it like in the residence? What is the protocol for the Secret Service? In the case of a power outage, what is the protocol? All of that was required extensive research.\nSo all credit again goes to Don and the writers who had to work on a really expedited time schedule because we had to beat the potential writer strike. So they worked their asses off to get us all the drafts before that deadline. And the fact that they didn't sacrifice any of the quality, and they maintained the level of character, and just the great Chucky mischief, and just the added homework on top of it was pretty remarkable. So I just want to give them as much credit as possible because it sounds a lot easier than it is, but when you dig into how is this going to function, and particularly not over indexing on the process or this day-to-day politics of it all.\nThere's been so many great shows, like West Wing, that really paint a picture of what that workplace looks like. And we wanted that to really be feathered more into the background so that we could focus on the family dynamics and really show this is a family that is struggling with grief, with loss, and obviously in the public eye. So it makes healing all the more challenging. And I think that was really exciting because it made it feel much more emotional and that there was something you could grasp onto.\nWhereas if it was a little too... If the storylines were all about geopolitics and world leaders and other things, there's not the same entry point. But again, with that said, all of the writers and Don really had to have a firm understanding of what that backdrop was. It was nice to just be a bystander in the benefit of all their research.\nOne thing I also love about this show is it doesn't hold back. Every single week I watch Chucky is almost like a cinematic experience. Even in this first episode with Secret Agent Teddy's death, which was brutal and gory. Can you talk about how Chucky continues to push the boundaries of horror on TV?\nAlex Hedlund: Yeah. I think that it all starts with Don who really wants to, I don't want to say reinvent the show every season, but there is certainly a kind of anthological component to every season. It should feel close-ended, but ideally it is a continuation of the character storylines and whatever Chucky is doing, but never repeating himself or making it obvious that we're going along with some kind of a formula. And I think when it comes to the gore and pushing those kills and the great sort of Chucky mischief, the White House, it's like you lean into the opportunity there.\nAnd it's one of those moments where just sort of talk about Teddy's death and then some of the other kills that are upcoming, part of it is just like what hasn't been done before, or what is a wild idea, or here's a setup and what is the most audacious kill possible? So there's so many different ways that it gets approached, but certainly the idea of making the White House setting as a pressure cooker. And for one example, without giving away too many spoilers, episode four is going to be this giant Halloween gala at the White House, and it's sort of tradition now to always have a Halloween episode.\nSo this blowout is just a means of just making the biggest party that we've seen in the series thus far. And also wanting to have a high body count when you have that many partygoers as well. There's definitely some fun things to be had in that episode, and I think just wanting to make sure that we're dining out on all those opportunities as possible.\nI'm a huge WWE fan and last season you guys made one of Liv Morgan's dream come true by having her killed off by Chucky in a brutal death scene. Any more WWE superstars on Chucky's hit list? And have you guys had any other requests from any other celebrities that want to get killed by Chucky?\nAlex Hedlund: Well, no WWE superstars this season. Liv was so sweet last season, and we were glad to kill her. It was our pleasure certainly. When it comes to this season, especially the first four episodes, there are some great cameos. There are some great legacy characters that will show up. There has been some outreach, and I think without giving away too many spoilers, a few of our SNL stars, Keenan Thompson and Sarah Sherman, they will factor in quite well in terms of the canon of this series. Put it that way.\nIn Chucky's unending thirst for power, season 3 now sees Chucky ensconced with the most powerful family in the world — America's First Family, inside the infamous walls of the White House. How did Chucky wind up here? What in God's name does he want?\nCheck back for our other Chucky season 3 interviews here:\nNew episodes of Chucky season 3 air Wednesdays at 9/8c on SYFY.\n"}

They said \"I do\" at the altar. Here's where each pair stands today.\nMarried at First Sight season 9 featured four couples, but not everyone is still together today. The show launched in 2014, and its relationship experts have always attempted to create successful marriages by matching couples through various assessments and questionnaires. The cast members meet for the first time to say \"I do\" at the altar and attempt to build lasting relationships once they've tied the knot.\nWhile MAFS has produced some successful marriages over its 15 seasons, over half have sadly ended in divorce. Only a handful of unions resulted in marriages that still stand today. This has led to frustration with the experts' choices in recent seasons. Season 9 premiered in 2019 and featured four pairs of newlyweds from Charlotte, North Carolina, and is considered one of the best MAFS seasons of all time. Have any of the couples stayed together?\nRelated: Why Married at First Sight's Stacia Asked Nate for A Divorce\nIris and Keith had several issues in their marriage, one of the biggest being their lack of compatibility. Iris was a virgin who was reluctant to be intimate with Keith. While Keith had no problem being patient and understanding with his new wife, he felt frustrated with Iris's immaturity.\nOn Decision Day, Iris wanted to remain married, but Keith admitted wanting a divorce. During the season 9 reunion, Iris wanted to work things out, but Keith was not interested in reconciling. Iris and Keith remain divorced in 2023.\nElizabeth and Jamie were certainly considered an odd match by MAFS fans, and many thought that they would surely divorce on Decision Day. Between Elizabeth's bold personality and Jamie's sharp tongue, the couple frequently argued over the little things. Surprisingly, Elizabeth and Jamie agreed to stay married at the end of season 9.\nWhile the MAFS alums remained married for four years, they chose to file for divorce in July 2023. According to US Weekly, Jamie claims Elizabeth walked out on him after copious fighting. Elizabeth isn't currently ready to talk about the divorce.\nUnlike Elizabeth and Jamie, Deonna and Gregory were considered a successful match and became the fan favorites of season 9. Deonna was a shy and conservative operations manager, and Gregory was a confident 32-year-old who owned a math tutoring center. Deonna and Gregory's compatibility arose from their differences, and their marriage brought out the best in both. Naturally, Deonna and Gregory said \"Yes\" on Decision Day and have been happily married ever since. After announcing their first pregnancy in 2020, Deonna gave birth to their son Declan in February 2021.\nOf the four MAFS season 9 couples, Amber and Matthew easily went down in history as the worst. Amber had a tough past and abandonment issues, but Matthew exacerbated his new wife's concerns by treating her feelings and opinions nonchalantly. Matt was even accused of infidelity, which he didn't exactly deny. Amber and Matthew separated on Decision Day and have no plans to get back together after Married At First Sight.\nSource: US Weekly\nMichelle Konopka Alonzo is a writer with a BA in English Language and Literature from the University of Central Florida.

The formerly married couple took jabs at each other online after their split, while Maurice was enjoying life with his new girlfriend, Mandy. It was hard to watch Maurice and his new girlfriend, as Jessica was raising their son, Ma'Liq Wayne Gipson, all by herself. According to Maurice, however, Jessica is a bitter ex-wife who prevented him from seeing his child.\nMany viewers were rooting for Maurice and Jessica during Love After Lockup season 3. Maurice, an LA native, was hoping to change his life for the better. In turn, Jessica was looking forward to building a future with Maurice, and starting a family. The only issue was the reluctance that Jessica's family expressed over her relationship. Alas, after enough begging, Maurice was able to win Jessica's father over, and even got his wife pregnant. Unfortunately, after welcoming their son in 2020, the pair hit turbulence, and ultimately parted ways. This sparked a nasty battle on social media.\nRelated: Why Love After Lockup Fans Think Gabby's Mom Was Right to Suggest Annulment\nMaurice came under fire after a woman by the name of Mandy confirmed her romance with him. In a screenshot captured by Starcasm, Mandy shared a shirtless picture of Maurice while teasing their courtship. \"Missing my baby, can't wait to be back in your arms,\" Mandy wrote over Maurice's photo. The WeTV star followed up by re-posting it, and told his new girlfriend to stop asking him if he missed her. Meanwhile, Jessica was sharing photos with their son, and Maurice was absent. To make matters worse, he appeared to be playing a stepfather role to his new girlfriend's daughter, while his ex-wife Jessica raised their son by herself.\nIn a series of Instagram Story posts, Maurice and Mandy hinted at tying the knot, while Jessica insinuated that Maurice might get arrested if he married two people. After being asked why he left Jessica as a single mom, Maurice claimed that she'd been preventing him from seeing his son because of her bitterness over him moving on. It has been reported that Maurice's arrest in early 2021 restricted him from leaving California. As a result, the Love After Lockup star Jessica has been in Las Vegas raising their baby boy, while Maurice has found a new love interest. Most recently, a fan, Ok-Vacation1941, captured a screenshot of an alleged text message conversation that Jessica shared online.\nThe alleged texts indicated that Maurice wanted Jessica to be more understanding, and claimed that Mandy was jealous of Jessica over money. Maurice posted videos on his Instagram, where he defended Mandy and their relationship. He was arrested multiple times in 2022, and is currently awaiting trial on several serious charges. Jessica from Love After Lockup may be better off raising their son alone.\nMore: Love After Lockup: Britney Explains Why She Wanted First Hug From Ray\nSources: Starcasm, Ok-Vacation1941\nJeroslyn is a Writer, Creator, and Correspondent in the Los Angeles region.

{"title": "American Made Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-10 18:20:08", "text": "American Made dramatizes the stranger-than-fiction story of drug-smuggling pilot Barry Seal but ultimately builds up to an alarming ending. \nAmerican Made recreates the dramatic true story of Barry Seal, a commercial pilot who smuggled pile-loads of million-dollar drugs, only to become a DEA informant and then meet an unfortunate end. Tom Cruise reunited with Edge of Tomorrow filmmaker Doug Liman to play Seal in the 2017 biopic. Earning positive reactions from critics and audiences alike, American Made had its fair share of creative liberties, but it still did a faithful job of exposing the behind-the-scenes politics of the drug trade in the 1980s. While Seal did make a fortune out of his high-profile drug operations, he was just a part of the more complex bigger picture.\nThe American Made ending exemplifies the socio-political realities of the era by not only delving into Seal’s untimely death but also the steps that the American government took in its aftermath. From Moby’s goosebumps-inducing “Extreme Ways” establishing a Bourne movie tradition in The Bourne Identity to John Newman’s rousing ballad “Love Me Again” closing Edge of Tomorrow, Doug Liman’s best movies end with iconic tracks. American Made is no exception as its climatic events play in the backdrop of The Heavy’s power anthem “What Makes A Good Man.” Even though the song is a 2012 release, the ending reveals some era-defining moments of the' 80s.\nAfter years of flying stealth-heavy missions for the CIA and later smuggling drugs for Pablo Escobar’s Medellin Cartel, Barry Seal is at his wit’s end by American Made’s third act. Following a desperate attempt to crash-land a plan to evade arrest from the DEA, Seal gives himself up to the authorities. In the tradition of classic crime movie finales like the ending of Goodfellas or The Wolf of Wall Street, Seal willingly gives up his information and contacts to the DEA in exchange for protection. For his illicit operations, the ever-smiling aviator is still punished. Serving his sentence of 1,000 hours of community service, all seems to be fine for Seal.\nThis is, of course, until he gets mysteriously shot dead. The American Made ending suggests that the cartel had him murdered for revealing sensitive information to the DEA. More or less, this is the general theory that is accepted to explain Seal’s death even as conspiracy theories on the Internet suggest that his murder might have been orchestrated by the CIA itself. In fact, Seal’s widow Deborah DuBois Seal even told The Daily Mail in 2017 that the US government didn’t do much to protect her husband after he came clean as an informant. She adds that even she doesn’t know who exactly might have been behind Seal’s assassination.\nEven though the CIA’s involvement in hiring Barry Seal subsequently became public knowledge, American Made suggests that the secret agency immediately destroyed all evidence connecting it with the infamous aviator after he was murdered. While there is no concrete evidence to support how the CIA hid such evidence, it is probably standard agency protocol to hide all connections after a major drug supplier like Seal died. Even before he got involved with the Cartel, the CIA’s instructions to Seal to conduct aerial surveillance over Central America were always meant to be a hushed-up affair. However, it must be noted that Monty Schafer, the CIA officer who recruited Seal, was fictional.\nWhile Domhnall Gleeson’s character Monty Schafer wasn’t real and was just created to represent the collective state of CIA at the time, Monty’s actions at the very end of American Made are of utmost importance in American history. Moments after Barry Seal’s death, an elated Monty is found suggesting to his seniors to fund the Nicaraguan right-wing militant group Contras through all the funds that the Agency can secure by selling American firearms in Iran. This strategy did work as a perfect way to replace the funds that were otherwise raised by Seal’s constant drug-smuggling operations. Hence, within just a matter of seconds, American Made hints at the Iran-Contra scandal.\nTo make the ending more realistic, the final seconds also feature actual archival footage of then-President Ronald Reagan and then-Vice President George Bush being questioned about claims of America arming Iranian terrorists to wage war elsewhere in Latin American countries. Both leaders are shown dodging journalists’ questions even though it’s left for the viewer to deduce what actually happened. By now, it’s common knowledge that the Iran-Contra affair was an effort by the Reagan administration to oust the left-leaving government in Nicaragua at a time when the Cold War was still in effect. As for Barry Seal, he was unfortunately just a pawn who was forgotten after his death.\nBarry Seal’s wife Lucy is played by Sarah Wright in American Made, the character being a dramatized version of Seal’s third wife Deborah DuBois Seal. The final scene of American Made features Lucy and her three children resettling in Baton Rouge where she works as a waitress. Following her husband’s death, it’s clear that she picked up a job at a fast-food restaurant to make ends meet. This is in stark contrast with the upscale life she led earlier, thanks to Seal’s million-dollar missions. But as the camera zooms in on an expensive-looking bracelet on Lucy’s wrist, the ending suggests that maybe, she hasn’t parted from all her wealth.\nThe real-life fate of Deborah Seal was similar as she told The Daily Mail that she and her children had to struggle financially following her husband’s death. In the same interview, she also revealed that she had actually crossed paths with Barry first when she was working as a waitress. It’s only an ill-fated irony that the American Made ending finds Deborah’s on-screen version Lucy picking up a waitressing job. It’s unclear how much Deborah Seal paid by the movie’s producers to secure the rights to her husband’s life story, but she did add that she had been living only a modest life for the past few decades.\nSome of Tom Cruise’s best movies have offered introspective critiques of the military and the government. Born on the Fourth of July, A Few Good Men and Lions for Lambs are some cases in point. One way or the other, American Made continues this tradition for Cruise, and it exposes how America’s militaristic hegemony can influence global geopolitics at a concerning level. Doug Liman doesn’t rely on any preachy discourse to criticize the corruption behind the drug trade as the ending of American Made shows, the director crafts an entertaining yet alarming attempt to satirize the inner workings of an infamous secret agency.\nShaurya Thapa is an Indian freelance journalist who mostly dabbles in writings on cinema, music, and human interest features.

{"title": "Ocean’s 11 Prequel With Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling Will &quot;Do Right By The Franchise,&quot; Promises Producer", "date": "2023-10-10 18:20:13", "text": "The Ocean's Eleven prequel starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling will \"do right by the franchise,\" promises producer Josey McNamara. \nOcean’s 11 prequel producer Josey McNamara promises to \"do right by the franchise.\" The 2001 film, which followed an elaborate casino heist and featured a star-studded cast, was followed by two sequels, Ocean's Twelve and Ocean's Thirteen, and an all-female spinoff, Ocean's 8. In May 2022, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were cast to lead an Ocean's Eleven prequel movie and now, after the beloved Barbie movie became a billion-dollar success, their reunion is even more anticipated. However, the project has been progressing slowly due to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.\nDuring a recent interview at the BFI London Film Festival, GamesRadar+ caught up with McNamara to talk about the long-gestating Ocean’s 11 prequel movie. Though he couldn't reveal much, the producer promised the prequel will \"do right by the franchise.\" He also praised Robbie and Gosling's chemistry together and teased that there could be even more collaborations between the two. Read his full comments below:\nI can’t really say much, but I think we’re just trying to do right by the franchise. I’m excited for people to experience it when it’s ready... [Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling] are wonderful together. The more projects even outside of that we can have them do would be amazing.\nThe Ocean's Eleven prequel will be directed by Jay Roach, who revealed some interesting details about the project in an interview earlier this year. The movie is set in Monte Carlo in 1962, seemingly at the Monte Carlo Casino, which should be the target of the heist. Though Roach promised the Ocean's Eleven prequel will continue the franchise identity of heist movies, the director also said \"it’s very much a love story.\"\nOn the Ocean's Eleven prequel, Robbie will also be reuniting with Roach, who previously directed her in Bombshell, the movie that earned her a second Oscar nomination after I, Tonya. Like his producer, the director is also excited to see Robbie and Gosling reunite after Barbie, calling them a \"powerful, powerful duo.\" The Ocean's Eleven prequel is produced by LuckyChap Entertainment, the same production company behind Barbie that Robbie started with her husband Tom Ackerley to focus on female-led stories.\nThe director's description of the Ocean's Eleven prequel as \"a love story\" caused some unease. Steven Soderbergh’s Ocean's trilogy and the all-female reboot are heist movies in the classic sense, and don't feature much romance at all. In turn, a love story would be a serious departure for the franchise, but perhaps it makes sense to play up this element considering Robbie and Gosling's sizzling chemistry. Despite this departure, the producer is promising to do right by the franchise, though only time will tell how the Ocean's Eleven prequel turns out.\nSource: GamesRadar+\n"}
{"title": "The Exorcist: Believer VOD Release Date Revealed (& It's Before Halloween)", "date": "2023-10-10 18:26:56", "text": "The Exorcist: Believer's digital release date has been revealed, and it will come in just in time for viewers to catch it before Halloween.\nThe Exorcist: Believer’s digital release date is revealed, and it is coming soon. From director David Gordon Green, The Exorcist: Believer is the most recent entry in the Exorcist franchise, which takes on a new story within the world of the original 1973 movie. The sequel has been met with largely negative critical reviews but fared decently well at the box office during its opening weekend.\nNow, The Exorcist: Believer’s digital release date has been revealed by Discussing Film. The Exorcist: Believer will be available digitally starting on October 24.\nThe Exorcist: Believer’s VOD release date will give viewers a chance to catch the sequel right before Halloween. This date also means that The Exorcist: Believer will have just 18 days, including three weekends, exclusively in theaters before becoming digitally available.\nThe Exorcist: Believer has had a complicated run so far in theaters. While The Exorcist: Believer has been critically panned, the latest entry has seen moderate financial success, coming in on top of the domestic box office during its opening weekend. Still, The Exorcist: Believer fell just short of its projected $30 million opening weekend box office predictions, taking home $26.5 million. This also meant that The Exorcist: Believer vastly underperformed Green’s 2018 remake of Halloween, showing its weakness in comparison to the previous reboot.\nIt is somewhat surprising that The Exorcist: Believer would be booted to digital release that soon after its release. Even at the $26.5 million mark, the sequel has almost made back its $30 million production budget. Thus, with more time exclusively in theaters, The Exorcist: Believer could have the opportunity to grow its revenue as the spooky season gets into fall swing.\nRelated: The Exorcist: Believer Ending Explained\nThere are many reasons why Universal Pictures might want to shift The Exorcist: Believer to a digital release, including encouraging audiences to rent the movie before Halloween. However, it will also not be the first horror film to shift to digital that quickly this year, as The Nun 2 also received a digital release date less than one month apart from its theatrical release. Between The Nun 2 and The Exorcist: Believer, it seems shorter theatrical runs are a rising trend for horror this year.\nSource: Discussing Film\n"}
{"title": "Ezra Bridger's New Lightsaber Color Shows He's Become The Opposite Of Luke Skywalker", "date": "2023-10-10 18:30:27", "text": "Ezra’s new lightsaber color in Ahsoka is the opposite of what Luke Skywalker’s is, and this speaks to their differing roles in the New Jedi Order.\nWarning! This article contains SPOILERS for the Ahsoka finale.\nIn the Ahsoka finale, Ezra Bridger constructs a new blue lightsaber that foretells what his role will be in future Star Wars projects. Initially, Ezra refused to take back his old lightsaber from Sabine Wren in Ahsoka episode 7. Instead, he employed a unique fighting style against Shin Hati and Thrawn’s Night Troopers. By combing his faith in the Force with hand-to-hand combat, Ezra expertly held his own against a slew of enemies. However, despite insisting the Force was all he needed, his duty as a Jedi demanded him to wield a blade once more in the Ahsoka finale.\nEzra’s new lightsaber hilt holds a lot of personal significance for him. Not only is his emitter related to the one Kanan Jarrus used in Star Wars Rebels, but Ezra’s new lightsaber color represents a return to his roots. His first lightsaber in Rebels season 1 was a blue blade with a blaster attachment, and was later destroyed by Darth Vader on Malachor. This prompted him to craft a green lightsaber, now belonging to Sabine Wren. The fact that Ezra’s new lightsaber is blue shows that he’s come full-circle as a Jedi, however, it’s change in color may also hold a much deeper significance according to Star Wars Legends.\nRelated: 8 Jedi Who Changed Lightsaber Color In Star Wars Movies & Shows\nStar Wars Legends traditionally saw Jedi Guardians with blue lightsaber, while Jedi Consulars often possessed green blades. In the original trilogy, Luke Skywalker changed from a blue lightsaber to a green lightsaber. But in Ahsoka, Ezra does the opposite. When Ezra used his green lightsaber, it represented his thirst for knowledge within the Force. However, he gradually took on the role of a Jedi Guardian by the end of Rebels, given how he fought with the Rebellion against Grand Admiral Thrawn.\nAt the end of Rebels, Ezra gives up his green lightsaber and sacrifices himself—much like a Jedi Guardian would—in order to save Lothal and his friends from the Empire. His realization of his change as a Jedi may have even driven him to give up his green saber, knowing it no longer represented his path as a Jedi. Only in Ahsoka is he able to craft himself a blue lightsaber once more, as it now aligns with his current role in the galaxy. Despite his exile on Peridea, Ezra has never stopped fighting Thrawn, proving himself a true Jedi Guardian by putting his combat skills to use.\nBased on Ezra’s blue lightsaber, he is now one of the foremost Jedi Guardians in The New Republic Era. Having joined up with Hera Syndulla, he will continue to fight against the threat of Thrawn’s Resurgent Empire. Meanwhile, Luke’s green lightsaber indicates he’s taken on the role of a Jedi Consular, and has mostly withdrawn from the fighting in the galaxy. While Luke studies the lore behind the Jedi and seeks to rebuild the Order, Ezra stands at the forefront of the battle against Thrawn and wishes to defeat him once and for all.\nDespite lightsaber color meanings being relegated to Legends, Star Wars Canon continues to operate based on the idea of Jedi Consulars and Jedi Guardians. For example, at the end of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Rey attempts to give Luke Skywalker back his blue lightsaber. Essentially, she is asking him to take up the role of Jedi Guardian once more and protect the galaxy from the First Order. But while Luke adamantly rejects taking up a blue lightsaber and fighting for the Resistance, Ezra Bridger gladly takes up a saber once more to fight for the New Republic.\nRelated: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nHistorically, the Jedi Order relied upon both Consulars and Guardians in order to function properly. Even in the Clone Wars, the Order needed Consulars like Yoda to remain near the Temple and train the next generation of Jedi, while also relying upon Guardians such as Obi-Wan and Anakin to protect the peace on the front lines. There needs to be strong Jedi in both roles, or else the Order will cease to exist. In the New Republic Era, the Jedi need both roles filled more than ever.\nIf Ezra Bridger doesn’t step up to his role as a Jedi Guardian against Thrawn, then Luke’s Jedi Temple on Ossus would be threatened. Similarly, if Luke gave up his role as a Consular and joined the fight against Thrawn, the Jedi Order would cease to proliferate for a time. Instead, both Ezra and Luke—without even knowing each other—work in tandem to protect the galaxy and guide the next generation of Jedi. Both of them are crucial for the future of Star Wars in the New Republic Era, and Ezra’s new lightsaber color in Ahsoka is only the first hint of what’s to come for his character.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka now streaming on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Haunted Mansion’s Tater Tot Payoff Hit Much Harder Than Expected", "date": "2023-10-10 18:30:27", "text": "The end of 2023's Haunted Mansion features a cat named Tater Tot, which has a much deeper meaning and encapsulates the movie's main theme.\nDisney's 2023 movie Haunted Mansion is primarily a horror comedy, but its Tater Tot payoff packs a surprising emotional punch. Based on the Disney theme park attraction of the same name, the movie wasn't well-received critically, garnering only a 37% score on Rotten Tomatoes, yet it has become a huge audience pleaser. Haunted Mansion is full of dazzling special effects, has a fun New Orleans setting, and features a great ensemble cast with great chemistry. By all accounts, the 2023 release is a huge improvement on Disney's 2003 The Haunted Mansion movie starring Eddie Murphy.\nLaKeith Stanfield plays Ben Matthias in the Haunted Mansion cast, and the character is an astrophysicist turned tour guide who helps Gabbie (Rosario Dawson) with a ghost problem in her New Orleans mansion. Ben is hard-up and depressed after not working much following the death of his wife, Alyssa, who was a ghost tour guide herself. This led to Ben's fixation with the supernatural. While Haunted Mansion is a wacky comedy full of slapstick humor, there's a lot of heart at the center of the film, and the cat named Tater Tot in Haunted Mansion's final scene is a perfect example of that.\nRELATED: Everything We Know About Haunted Mansion 2\nIn the Haunted Mansion ending, after the crew has defeated the Hatbox Ghost, Ben returns home to his New Orleans house where he finds a seemingly stray cat. Ben looks at the collar and sees the cat's name: Tater Tot. That might seem like a totally random name for a cat, but it's actually a reference to Ben's deceased wife, Alyssa. It's established in flashbacks that Alyssa not only loved tater tots, but they were her favorite snack, a fact by which Bruce Davis (Danny DeVito) is particularly taken aback. However, the name isn't just a coincidence, Tater Tot has a lot more meaning and encapsulates the movie's underlying theme.\nHaunted Mansion is ultimately about grief, as the whole movie concerns Ben still mourning his deceased wife while fighting off the ghosts in the titular location. As a result, the cat at the end of the movie can be seen as a ghost wink and a sign from Alyssa in the afterlife. Ben essentially became a paranormal tour guide to be close to Alyssa after her death, despite being skeptical of the paranormal. When Harriet (Tiffany Haddish) realizes that the dead can communicate with the living, that gives Ben hope that he can speak to Alyssa again, which is also how the Hatbox Ghost manipulates him.\nWhile Ben doesn't get to speak to Alyssa again, he chooses to believe that the cat is Alyssa speaking to him through a ghost wink, whether it really is her or not. The cat could also be seen as a sign that Alyssa has given her blessing for Ben to move on. After adopting the cat, Ben then visits the mansion where he reunites with Gabbie, who is also widowed, and helps Ben through the grieving process throughout the movie. The Haunted Mansion ending hints at a future romance between Ben and Gabbie, and that wouldn't have happened without Tater Tot showing up at Ben's front door.\nCurrently splitting his time between Madrid and Chicago, Stephen Barker has been a staff writer at Screen Rant since 2020.

Stewart's new autobiography, \"Making It So: A Memoir,\" delves into the legendary actor's life and his time in the X-Men and Star Trek franchises. Of course, Stewart has plenty of stories about his years playing Captain Jean-Luc Picard on TNG and Star Trek: Picard, the third season of which saw Picard reunite with Michael Dorn's Worf and the rest of the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation.\nAs reported by SlashFilm, Patrick Stewart writes in \"Making It So: A Memoir\" about how Michael Dorn's Worf gained an unflattering nickname from none other than Commander Will Riker himself, Jonathan Frakes. Stewart's recollection comes from how Dorn's Worf was often the last character who was filmed on the bridge of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Read the quote below:\nPoor Michael Dorn, as Worf, was always the last character with dialogue to stay in uniform, because he had to stand in front of his security panel at the very back. What's more, he had to stay in his ridged, heavy Klingon makeup, which took hours to apply and had inspired Frakes's nickname for him: Turtlehead.\nAnother Worf-inspired running joke arose on Star Trek: The Next Generation that was inspired by the Klingon's famed volatility, which bled into real life. Read the quote from Patrick Stewart's memoir below:\nMichael's character, Worf, was also the basis for one of our cherished inside jokes. Worf is a Klingon who prides himself on his self-discipline – but precisely because he is of the warrior Klingon race, he can't help but occasionally lose his temper and fly into violent rages. Thanks to this disparity, we began using the term 'Worfland' to describe any situation where things were spiraling out of control or one person was in a bad mood and therefore emotionally unpredictable. 'Look out, it's Worfland!' became our shorthand for Proceed with caution.\nRelated: Star Trek: The Next Generation Cast & Character Guide\nWorf may unavoidably be a \"Turtlehead,\" but the noble Klingon made a spectacular return in Star Trek: Picard season 3. Captain Worf teamed up with Commander Raffi Musiker (Michelle Hurd) to uncover the Changeling threat to the galaxy before he reunited with his crew mates from the USS Enterprise-D. Michael Dorn gave a career-best performance as Worf, who balanced his propensity for killing with a newfound Zen, and he delivered both stirring action scenes and hilarious one-liners with equal aplomb.\nWorf holds the distinction of appearing in more episodes of Star Trek than any other character, a feat that will likely never be equaled. It's impossible to argue Worf is the greatest Klingon character in Star Trek history, and Michael Dorn would like to return if Star Trek: Picard's proposed spinoff, Star Trek: Legacy, happens. Michael Dorn has taken fans to \"Worfland\" since his first appearance in the premiere of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and hopefully, the Klingon hero's adventures aren't over yet.\nSource: \"Making It So: A Memoir\" by Patrick Stewart, SlashFilm\nJohn Orquiola is Screen Rant's Star Trek Beat Editor, Senior Features staff writer, and interviewer."}

Rick and Morty burst onto screens in 2015, immediately securing itself a place among the most popular adult animations ever, and is now approaching its seventh season on the air. Prominent animations such as The Simpsons have seen feature-length films added to their franchises, but Rick and Morty could be the first to take the live-action after-animation route since the Scooby-Doo series.\nAdult Swim is also ready for a live-action remake, releasing live-action Rick and Morty concept clips to the web in 2021 with Christoper Lloyd and Jaeden Martell portraying the grandfather and grandson duo. The animated show has recently been surrounded by further speculation of a live-action remake, although the Rick and Morty movie confirmation is hoped for in the near future. If it does happen, the release of a cast list will be highly anticipated by audiences, and it's worth noting that there are many big names who could slip into the Rick and Morty universe with ease. For Beth Sanchez: mother, wife, heart surgeon, and disappointed daughter, there are many stars who'd be a perfect casting choice.\nSarah Chalke currently plays Beth in Rick and Morty, lending her voice to the animation for the last six seasons. Chalke has already made quite an impact in the acting world and is best known for her sitcom roles, including Elliot Reid in Scrubs and Stella Zinman in How I Met Your Mother. Not only would she have the same voice as Beth, but Chalke also closely resembles Beth's appearance and knows the character better than any other actress could, which makes her an ideal casting choice.\nBest known for the comedic roles of Claire Dunphy in Modern Family and Virginia Venit in Happy Gilmore, Julie Bowen would be a good consideration for the role of Beth Sanchez. Bowen was nominated for multiple Emmys for playing the multitasking, high-strung matriarch in Modern Family, elements that would be useful in portraying Beth. It's also worth noting Bowen's career is littered with voice acting credits and so her talents could be used to easily replicate Beth's specific diction.\nRelated: Casting Morty Smith In A Live-Action Rick & Morty Remake: 9 Actors We'd Love To See\nKaitlin Olson is best known for her role as Dee Reynolds in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. The show is the longest-running live-action American sitcom ever, making Olson one of the most prominent female sitcom actresses of all time. She has also lent her voice to several films and shows, including The Simpsons and Family Guy, and more recently, adult animation Agent Elvis.  Olson is well-known for the strong attitude presented in her characters, including Mickey in The Mick, which would be ideal for a performance as Beth Sanchez.\nPitch Perfect and 30 Rock star Elizabeth Banks is a prominent name in comedy, not just for her performance on screen, but also as a producer and actress. Banks has been praised for her hilarious roles laced with a dry sense of humor, and could easily nail Beth Sanchez's sarcasm. Banks filmography is greatly extended, with over two hundred and fifty credits in video games, films, and television, so Rick and Morty would fit perfectly into her already highly decorated career.\nRelated: Casting Rick Sanchez In A Live-Action Rick & Morty Remake: 10 Actors We'd Love To See\nBest known for her work as a sketch comic, Kate McKinnon made a splash in the comedy world as a cast member of Saturday Night Live and appeared on the show from 2012 to 2022. She also starred in the recent Barbie movie as Weird Barbie, leaving many confused with the character's concept. McKinnon's ability to mold into a variety of different characters was very much proven on Saturday Night Live, and her recurring character Deenie, a.k.a. \"Somebody's Mom\" shares similarities with Beth Sanchez, making her an ideal possible casting for the role.\nHousehold name Alyson Hannigan has been gracing American television and film screens since her breakout role as Willow in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, setting her up for a notable career balancing comedy and drama. Hannigan's other notable roles include Michelle Flaherty in American Pie and Lily Aldrin in How I Met Your Mother, and she was most recently seen as a contestant on Dancing with the Stars. Hannigan has consistently been praised for her comedic timing and would be a huge billing name to include on a Rick and Morty live-action poster.\nStand-up comedian Sarah Silverman rose to fame in 2007 following the release of her show The Sarah Silverman Program, which earned her a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. Before her hit show, Silverman stared in one season of Saturday Night Live, but was fired after only one season. She also famously starred in School of Rock with Jack Black and lent her voice to the role of Vanellope in Wreck-it Ralph. Silverman has been praised for her comedic roles' deadpan performances, something that would lend well to the character of Beth Sanchez, especially when she has to begrudgingly deal with her husband Jerry.\nRelated: 10 Rick & Morty Story Ideas That Would Be Perfect For Dan Harmon's Movie\nLeslie Mann is well known for her work across several comedy films, including Knocked Up and This is 40, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and 17 Again, to name a few.

The supernatural SYFY show joins Chucky as part of the network's Halloween slate, despite having originally been canceled after a well-received first season. Thankfully, SYFY reversed its decision and allowed the Canadian drama series to see the light of day once more, binging all-new hauntings to the neighborhood.\nSurrealEstate stars Tim Rozon as Luke Roman, a real estate agency with unique skills that allow him to handle haunted homes others would shy away from. He is joined by Sarah Levy (who appeared on Schitt’s Creek, just as Rozon did) as Susan Ireland, who handles PR for the firm. The show also stars Adam Korson, Maurice Dean Wint, Savannah Basley, and Tennille Read.

{"title": "Frieren: Beyond Journey's End Episode #6 Release Date & Time", "date": "2023-10-10 19:00:27", "text": "After introducing Stark in episode #5, Frieren: Beyond Journey's End is poised to use him to defeat a dragon despite his apparent cowardice.\nAfter a nice cliffhanger in episode #5, Frieren: Beyond Journey's End fans are anxiously awaiting the release of episode #6. Episode #6 will likely also be notable for potentially causing a major shift in the dynamics of Frieren's party. It remains to be seen how this major change will affect the show, but given Frieren: Beyond Journey's End's quality of writing so far, the new fantasy anime sensation will likely make it work.\nFrieren: Beyond Journey's End episode #6 will be airing in Japan at 11 p.m. Japanese Standard Time (JST) on Friday, October 13. It will be simulcast on Crunchyroll on October 13 at 8 a.m. Pacific Time (PDT), 10 a.m. Central Time (CT), and 12 p.m. Eastern Time (EST). For Frieren fans in the UK, the episode will be released at 17:00 British Summer Time (BST). The release date for the dubbed version of the episode is unknown at this time, but it will likely premiere on Crunchyroll or Funimation at a later date.\nEpisode #5 featured two main subplots. The first involved Frieren and Fern defeating some evil magical creatures that lured humans into danger by pretending to be the ghosts of their loved ones. This was a touching story that highlighted the pain of loss that Frieren feels as a nearly immortal being. The second plot featured Frieren trying to acquire a book from a dragon's nest and enlisting an adventurer to help her do it. This warrior is Stark, the disciple of Frieren's friend Eisen who is a self-professed coward. However, at the end of the episode, it is revealed that he is more powerful than he looks as he turns a large cliff into a canyon.\nDespite Stark's apparent cowardice, he is built up to become an important character as shown in the show's OP (which is a beautiful song made by the creators of Oshi no Ko's hit theme song). Given this, he will likely accompany Frieren and Fern on their journey north after proving himself by helping them defeat the dragon. Since the dragon was incredibly tough to defeat in episode #5 and Frieren innovates on many classic fantasy tropes, the three adventurers could also come to a more peaceful conclusion. Either way, if the clash against the demon in episode #3 is any indication, the show is sure to feature some beautiful fight animation for however long the battle lasts.\nAfter Frieren, Fern, and Stark deal with the dragon, it is unclear what they will do next. They are sure to continue north toward the land of the dead, but the next adventure they encounter on their way is a mystery. Wherever Frieren: Beyond Journey's End takes its main characters next in episode #6 though, it will surely live up to the high level of quality that the adventures in the previous episodes have set.\nDon't miss Frieren: Beyond Journey's End episode #6 when it airs on Crunchyroll on October 13, 2023.\nBen Sockol has been writing articles for the comics section of Screen Rant since early 2022.

{"title": "16 Denzel Washington Action Movies Ranked Worst To Best", "date": "2023-10-10 19:00:27", "text": "Denzel Washington has starred in a lot of movies over the course of his career, including 16 action movies that can be ranked by overall quality.\nDenzel Washington has acted in 16 action movies over the course of his distinguished career, making it worthwhile to rank his many action flicks from worst to best. Washington is one of the premier actors working today, winning two Academy Awards and three Golden Globes across his 40-year career as an actor. He has earned several notable lifetime achievement awards, and in 2020 he was named the greatest actor of the 21st century by the New York Times.\nWashington has acted in a wide variety of films throughout his career, but the genre he probably acts in the most is action. His commanding presence on-screen, memorable voice, and impeccable ability to convey emotion through his expressions, make him a perfect fit as a leading man in the action-thriller genre. Denzel Washington's best movies in this category include some of the biggest hits of the last few decades, as well as one or two disappointing uses of this incredible actor's ability.\nRELATED: How Old Denzel Washington Was In Each Equalizer Movie\nVirtuosity is one of the weaker overall films in Denzel Washington's lengthy filmography. Starring alongside Russell Crowe, Washington's skill as an actor is not enough to redeem this subpar script and ultimately underwhelming premise. Virtuosity falls short of creating any real emotional investment in its audience, stringing events together without taking much time to develop characters and give the audience a reason to care. Washington is not to blame for the film's shortcomings, but there are plenty of them, and they earn Virtuosity the lowest spot in this ranking.\n1998 action-thriller The Siege is another subpar entry in Denzel Washington's distinguished career. The Siege follows Washington's FBI agent, Anthony Hubbard, as he fights against a terrorist cell wreaking havoc in New York City. This action flick provides plenty of action, but very little substance, relying mostly on Washington's powerful presence to capture the audience's attention. While Denzel Washington is perfectly capable of that, the result is still an underwhelming movie that ranks near the bottom of Washington's many action films.\nSafe House, released in 2012, stars Washington and Ryan Reynolds as two CIA agents under attack from a mysterious group of mercenaries. While both Washington and Reynolds put in strong performances, the screenplay is ultimately underwhelming and the action sequences leave much to be desired. Safe House is not the worst of Denzel Washington's action movies, it does create some real intrigue and his chemistry with Reynolds is gripping, but the unconvincing narrative keeps the film in the lower tier of this ranking.\nThe Book of Eli is a post-apocalyptic action film with a star-studded cast that includes Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman, Mila Kunis, Ray Stevenson, and Jennifer Beals. Following Washington's nomadic protagonist, Eli, as he seeks to deliver a mysterious book to a safe location, The Book of Eli relies heavily on its cast to drive interest in its somewhat stale premise. It is visually engaging, however, and the narrative is carefully crafted to maintain suspense up to the end of The Book of Eli, making it worth a watch, even if it's not the best action film Denzel Washington has to offer.\nThe Taking of Pelham 123 follows Denzel Washington's subway train operator as he is forced to negotiate with a dangerous criminal who hijacks one of the cars on his train. Washington's performance is as good as always, but the events feel a bit rushed and the directing is slightly wild. Critics have suggested that this rendition of The Taking of Pelham 123 fails to live up the original version of the film, released in 1974. Even so, there are strong points in the film, including Washington's performance, that keep it from ranking any lower than 12th.\nThe Equalizer 2 is the worst movie in the Equalizer trilogy, but it's not all bad. The film was relatively successful, benefiting from the fame of its predecessor and successfully crafting some solid action sequences. It also includes some of Denzel Washington's best scenes in The Equalizer movies, but its narrative is less engaging than either of the other films in the trilogy. Still, this is a solid entry in Denzel Washington's action-movie filmography, and its story is good enough to merit a mid-tier ranking.\n2016's The Magnificent 7 is a remake of the 1960 film of the same name, starring Washington and Chris Pratt. The Magnificent 7 delivers some riveting action sequences and its talented cast performs well, but the narrative ends up making it a disappointing rendition of the 1960 classic. Even so, The Magnificent 7's beautiful filming locations and powerful score make it another solid, mid-tier film in Denzel Washington's long list of action films.\nDéjà Vu follows Denzel Washington's ATF Special Agent Douglas Carlin as he travels back in time to prevent a terrorist attack and save the woman he loves. This riveting narrative is complemented by a characteristically powerful performance from Washington, and while its premise feels a little far-fetched, it delivers an exciting two hours of action with real stakes. This isn't the best action film Washington has ever made, but it's far from the worst.\nThe Equalizer is one of Washington's more famous films with its wide-scale success leading to the creation of Denzel Washington's only movie franchise. The film follows Washington's retired ex-marine turned vigilante after befriending a young prostitute with ties to the Russian mafia. The Equalizer is full of incredible action sequences, and its narrative is truly thrilling, but the film does lack a real defining purpose, outside another entertainingly violent spectacle.\nRelated: 8 Equalizer Questions A Denzel Washington Prequel Movie Can Answer\n2 Guns, starring Washington and Mark Wahlberg, follows two undercover law enforcement officers who are initially unaware of each other's double loyalties as they simultaneously seek to infiltrate a drug lord's operation. This film is full of intense action sequences, and though Wahlberg and Washington build strong chemistry together, the narrative lets 2 Guns down somewhat. 2 Guns has plenty of appeal as a spectacle, but it lacks conviction and ultimately feels hollow. Even so, the well-layered humor meshes nicely with the action to make 2 Guns an entertaining watch.\nMan on Fire stars Washington as John Creasy, an alcoholic former CIA officer who becomes a bodyguard after leaving the CIA. When the young girl Creasy is guarding is abducted in Mexico City, Creasy races against time to find the people who took her and make them pay for crossing him. Man on Fire's action sequences complement a strong cast and a boldly dark narrative that make for a thrilling overall experience. The danger of Man on Fire is that its depressingly dark narrative, realistic as it is, can leave viewers feeling hopelessly dejected.\nRelated: Man On Fire 2 Is Still Possible 19 Years Later & Can Reboot Denzel Washington's Franchise\nThe Equalizer 3 is the best movie in this riveting trilogy, riding a gripping narrative to the conclusion of Washington's only movie franchise. With as much visceral action as the other entries in The Equalizer series, The Equalizer 3 raises the stakes and executes an outstanding overall action movie with beautiful cinematography and a haunting score. Though The Equalizer 3 could probably be classified as another spectacle-driven action movie, its script is good enough to make the action feel like it has a purpose.\nTraining Day follows Denzel Washington's Detective Alonzo Harris as he takes Ethan Hawke's Officer Jake Hoyt through his first day of training on the LAPD narcotics team. Harris and Hoyt are pitted against extremely violent resistance, doing their best to uphold the law no matter what. The film evokes ethical questions about how far law enforcement can go to enforce the law, and Washington's powerful performance won him the Academy Award for Best Actor. Training Day is gripping and meaningful, and it's easily one of Washington's best action flicks.\nIn the 1991 action thriller, Ricochet, Denzel Washington portrays an ex-cop turned District Attorney forced to grapple with a vengeful criminal he arrested while working as a police officer. Washington's performance is strong as usual, carrying the lead role with his typical physicality and irresistible presence. Ricochet delivers a gripping narrative full of realistic action sequences and smart dialogue. Ricochet has more substance than many of Washington's other action films, and its expert direction keeps the tension high throughout.\nUnstoppable is one of Denzel Washington's best movies regardless of genre. Starring alongside Chris Pine, Washington plays a veteran train technician tasked with stopping a runaway freight train threatening to run off the rails and crash in a highly populated area. Based on a true story, Unstoppable tells an incredible tale of determination and resourcefulness as the film's protagonists risk their lives to stop the train from crashing into their hometown. With high emotional stakes and meaningful dialogue, Unstoppable is an altogether outstanding film.\nCrimson Tide follows the conflict between two US marines in a nuclear submarine during a nuclear standoff with Russia. Crimson Tide is an edge-of-your-seat type of film that builds incredible tension right from the off. The film benefits from strong performances and biting dialogue that drives the narrative with a sense of purpose and reality. Washington is excellent as the second-in-command to Gene Hackman's commanding officer, delivering every line with purposeful conviction. Thanks to all of those things, Crimson Tide is one of Denzel Washington's best-ever movies and his best action movie.\n"}
{"title": "This Buffy Season 8 Romance Still Gives Fans the Major Ick", "date": "2023-10-10 19:00:27", "text": "The canonical comic series Buffy the Vampire Slayer contained a lot of controversial elements, but perhaps none more than this relationship pairing.\nRomance has always been a part of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with fans approving and disapproving of different match-ups, while shipping different characters together. However, Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight, Dark Horse Comics' canonical continuation of the iconic television series, featured an unexpected pairing that remains one of the franchise's controversial decisions.\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight #28 – by TV series writer Jane Espenson, with art by Georges Jeanty – revealed the shocking romantic entanglement of Buffy's younger sister, Dawn Summers, and her close friend Xander Harris.\nDawn, introduced through mystical means in Season Five of the show, had a teenage crush on Xander, revealed in Season Five, Episode 2. Now both adults, Season Eight put them together as a couple, in a move many readers found controversial.\nRelated: Spike's Best Endgame Romance Was [SPOILER], Not Buffy\nXander and Dawn first kiss in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight #28. While their friendship seemed to continue in the comic book continuation of the show, this reveal baffled fans. At the time they fell in love, Dawn was a legal adult and there's only a 5-6-year age difference between the two. However, Xander had always been portrayed as an older brother figure to Dawn; further, there was no buildup to their romance. Season Five of Buffy saw Dawn inserted into the Summers family in an iconic twist; the season would eventually reveal that she was in fact a mystical object, given human form, made precious to the Slayer, so Buffy would protect her at all costs.\nAs even Xander admits at the onset of their romance, it is \"not unweird.\" Another reason for the weird fan feelings about this pairing is that it becomes an important part of the canon. The Buffy in-continuity comics concluded with Season Twelve; in those five seasons, creator Joss Whedon doubles down on the romance, perhaps to show that this wasn't a careless fling or that he really had an overarching plan. In Season Nine, because Buffy destroyed the seed of magic in the world, and Dawn was created from magic, Dawn starts to disappear. Xander betrays his friends to make a deal with the Big Bads to restore magic and save her.\nAs it turns out, the return of magic \"resets\" Dawn's emotions, and she only feels a crush for Xander, not love. In Season Ten, the new Big Bads have opened a portal to a hell dimension that Dawn, as The Key, can close – but only from the other side. Xander goes with her during her sacrifice, and she falls in love with him again there. By Season Twelve, they live together and have a child named Joyce, named for Dawn and Buffy's deceased mom. Years later, this pairing is still very divisive in the fandom. Subsequent seasons added depth to the pairing, but it remained difficult for many readers to accept.\nXander was around for Dawn's (imagined) childhood and was that big brother figure, gives some fans – as Buffy might say – the wiggins. Xander also carried a torch for Buffy for years, and developing feelings for her younger sister is a messy situation; Buffy Season Eight, and subsequent seasons, rely on this for narrative tension. One of the reasons romances in Buffy the Vampire Slayer draw in so many people is that these characters feel real, and real relationships can be messy and nuanced. Feeling strongly about these characters reflects the writing and art that went into them over the past thirty-four years. Even an icky romance shows the deep love held by fans for this series.\nAs far back as she can remember, Casey Connor always wanted to be a Goodfeather writer.

{"title": "Tin & Tina Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-10 19:00:27", "text": "The Spanish thriller Tin & Tina is packed with religious themes and an ending that leaves a lot up to the imagination of the viewer.\nThe Spanish thriller Tin & Tina has plenty of creepy moments interwoven with heady religious themes and an ending that leaves much up to the viewer's imagination. Released in 2023 and directed by Rubin Stein, the film follows Lola (Milena Smit) and Adolfo (Jaime Lorente), a newlywed couple who adopt a pair of strange twins following the loss of their first child. Relying heavily on eerie atmosphere above anything else, Tin & Tina isn't necessarily a scare-a-minute horror film, but an unnerving exploration of faith in the face of tragedy.\nTin & Tina's inclusion on Netflix opened it up to an even bigger audience, and critics were largely split. The film scored a tepid 50% on Rotten Tomatoes with many critics lambasting the film's slow and deliberate pacing which left them somewhat bored. Tin & Tina joins a host of Netflix Spanish shows and movies, and it offers a distinctly Spanish perspective on horror, especially with its heavy incorporation of Catholic themes. Unlike many horror films which are straightforward with their approaches, Tin & Tina posed a heap of questions that the movie didn't necessarily answer. The real scares in the movie's ending came within the margins of doubt.\nRELATED: 10 Best Horror Movies Of 2023\nOne of the things that makes Tin & Tina so creepy is the fact that the film doesn't really offer a lot of definite answers to many of its most shocking events. The ending of the film sees Adolfo and Lola's relationship nearly crumbling as the arrival of their firstborn biological child is heralded as a medical miracle. However, Lola's descent into religious fascination is one of the biggest wedges between them and Adolfo is seemingly punished by God when he is suddenly set on fire in a blaze that also consumes the entire house.\nTin & Tina toes the line between the possible and the impossible, and the movie never explains whether Adolfo was simply struck by lightning or if the twins took it upon themselves to punish their former adoptive father. Adolfo's rejection of religion was a running theme for the character throughout, and it clashed mightily with the twins' biblical devotion. Adolfo's burning of the Bible could have been the last straw for the twins that set them over the edge, and his death ironically mirrored the way he torched the book. Of all the horror movies released in 2023, Tin & Tina best incorporated its themes into the story.\nThe twins are somewhat exonerated by the fact that they were at the orphanage at the time of Adolfo's death, but it was also shown that their caretaker had fallen asleep. While the creepy questions linger about Stein's film, Tin & Tina perhaps earned its split Rotten Tomatoes score because it was just a little too vague. The implication that the young children could have killed Adolfo is there, but it is just too far-fetched to be possible. What's more likely is that Adolfo died in an accident, but it mostly served to justify Lola's religious fascination which had been stoked by the piety of the twins.\nWhen Lola and Adolfo adopt the bleach-blonde twins, they travel to the Convent of Saint Augustine, which is named for the notable Saint in the Catholic religious tradition. Considering how much Catholicism fits into the themes of the Netflix horror movie, it is clear that screenwriter and director Rubin Stein specifically picked Saint Augustine to be the image for Tin and Tina as characters. According to Catholic Online, Augustine is the Saint of brewers which has no connection to the story whatsoever, but it is the theologian's thoughts on faith that actually tie in.\nSaint Augustine proposed the controversial idea of original sin which is a foundational idea of Catholicism, and has a lot to do with Tin and Tina as characters. According to the concept of original sin, even a child is born impure in the eyes of God, and is therefore in need of the guidance of the church. Lola questions throughout the film whether Tin and Tina are evil or simply misguided children, but if St. Augustine is to be believed, they are indeed impure. The choice was clearly an artistic one, and the twins' close association with Augustine also explains their rabid devotion to baptizing the baby later on.\nIn one of the most powerful images in the entire movie, Tin and Tina kidnap Lola's new baby and perform their own twisted version of a baptism. Nearly drowning the child in the process, Tin and Tina insist on wiping away the baby's original sin as quickly as possible which is the last straw for Adolfo who refuses to allow his child around the seemingly dangerous twins. Symbolically speaking, the twins not only tried to wash away the child's sin, but they also forcefully tried to conform the newborn's life to their concept of religion.\nGenerally, exorcism horror movies tend to dominate the small niche of Catholic terror, but Tin & Tina stands out because it uses faith as a frightening theme. Adolfo's clashes with the twins take on a distinctly theological bent because he is non-religious, bordering on anti-religious, while the young twins are practically zealots even as tiny tots. It could be explained that the twins nearly killed the baby because they are young and don't understand, but their motivation is clearly to take possession of the baby's soul much in the same way they reactivated Lola's religious fervor.\nFollowing Adolfo's death at the end of Tin & Tina, Lola is left as a single mother, and she also fully returns to her faith now that her doubting husband is out of the way. As the house burned down around her, she suspected that Tin and Tina were responsible, but following her escape, she learned that they were supposedly still at the orphanage. Lola forgives the kids and takes them back, which in her eyes is the Christian thing to do. Depending on the interpretation of the twins' motivations, the ending could be seen as a triumph or a frightening indictment of blind faith.\nHorror movies with ambiguous endings have a way of polarizing viewers, and when it comes to ambiguity, Tin & Tina takes the idea to the extreme. The biggest question left after the film is whether Tin and Tina are innocent, and unlike many other horror movies, the film gives no definite clues either way. Being that they are children, Tin and Tina's actions could be seen as entirely without malice since young kids don't understand that their actions have consequences. Being raised in such a rigid religious environment clearly colored their worldview, which could be seen as creepy to a couple living in 1980s Spain.\nRELATED: 20 Best Halloween Movies On Netflix\nTheir violent retribution against the family pet could be chalked up to their young minds twisting religious doctrine, and such an event is a possibility despite how gruesome and horrifying it is. Adolfo's death is perhaps the only event that is somewhat suspect, but it could be chalked up to a so-called \"act of God\". Considering the twins don't do anything magical or impossible in the rest of the film, they are likely innocent of killing Adolfo with fire, even if it is eerily connected to their burning hatred for the man.\nWhile many horror movies have some kind of deeper meaning, Tin & Tina's ending was the culmination of the film's themes. Faith was at the heart of the story which was set in a country that was in the middle of a cultural shift. Spain went through growing pains in the 1980s, as certain forces within the government wished to push it towards a fundamental direction (via The Guardian). Similarly, the arrival of Tin and Tina pushed the lives of Lola and Adolfo in a more fundamental direction, and she was more easily swayed because of her desire to have children.\nIn the end, the real division between Lola and Adolfo was their thoughts on parenthood in general. She was obviously very much ready to be a parent, while Adolfo was unsteady. The adoption decision thrust the orthodoxy of parenting on him, and he reacted negatively. Tin & Tina used the twins as a symbol of faith which was greeted with skepticism from Adolfo and acceptance from Lola. The open-ended nature of the ending was also intentional, as it allowed the audience to see things based on their own views on religion, forgiveness, and faith.\nDalton is a freelance writer, novelist, and filmmaker from Orlando Florida.

The 30-year-old Virginia resident and his 29-year-old Russian wife debuted on the popular reality TV franchise in 2021. While the two deeply loved each other, they couldn’t get along with Brandon’s parents, Ron and Betty Gibbs, which led them to leave the family farm and get a separate place. The 90 Day Fiancé pair has contemplated having a baby over the last three years. However, family intervention and various hurdles have stopped them from conceiving a little one.\n90 Day Fiancé's Brandon and Julia have been quiet about their baby plans for some time. As a result, some curious social media users have continuously asked them about it. Recently, Brandon shut down the baby talk and speculation by revealing why he and Julia haven’t tried yet.\nHe shared a photo of himself and his puppy on Instagram and wrote, “I often see people having 2 or more children. We are afraid that we cannot afford one child.” The American reality star implied that he isn’t financially ready for the baby, and Julia liked the post to show the decision is mutual.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\n90 Day Fiancé fans and stars had mixed reactions to Brandon’s post. While some felt the reality TV star was spot on, others believed he was just making excuses. An Instagram user commented, “If you can afford puppies, you can afford kids.” The follower advised the 90 Day Fiancé fan-favorite couple to have a baby before it was too late. Another Instagram user shared that it was okay for the couple to wait. The fan wrote, “You have them when you’re ready and take it a day at a time.” Brandon’s mother, Betty, commented on the post but didn’t force her son to give her a grandkid. She wrote, “Big puppy hugs that always put a smile on your face!”\nIt’s clear why some fans aren’t on the same page about Brandon’s post. The 90 Day Fiancé alum and his Russian wife are already 30. Therefore, they only have four to five more years to have a stable pregnancy. Pregnant people over age 35 are more at risk for complications like miscarriage, which is why many fans think the pair should have a baby now. 90 Day Fiancé season 9 cast member Shaeeda Sween pushed her husband, Bilal Hazziez, to get her pregnant quickly, as she was in her late 30's. Unfortunately, the pair suffered a miscarriage in 2023.\nStill, it is up to Brandon and Julia to decide if they want a child. The two are grown adults who understand the importance of bringing new life into their lives. They probably shouldn’t get pregnant if they aren’t ready or happy about having a baby. Many couples enjoy a beautiful and comfortable life even without birthing a child. Adoption is also a great option if they ever feel like being parents. Having a baby isn’t impossible even after the pair is in their 40's.

Candy Candy Lane is an upcoming holiday movie about a man named Chris (Murphy) determined to win his neighborhood decorating contest. Candy Candy Lane is set for release on December 1.\nNow, Deadline releases first look images at Murphy and his fellow cast members in Candy Candy Lane.\nThe images combine Murphy in everyday environments such as a high school sports stadium with more festival images filled with Christmas icons. Murphy wanders through an elf-workshop-looking environment and stands next to towering Christmas trees.\nComing out in time for the holiday season, Candy Candy Lane will be released on Amazon Prime Video. In addition to Murphy, the film features a supporting cast of Tracee Ellis Ross, Jillian Bell, and Madison Thomas. The film is co-produced by Murphy along with Charisse Hewitt-Webster, Brian Grazer, and Karen Lunder. Candy Candy Lane is directed by Reginald Hudlin, who previously worked with Murphy on the 1992 comedy Boomerang.\nRelated: 25 Best Christmas Movies On Netflix\nStarting as a more typical Christmas comedy, Candy Candy Lane’s plot also features more mystical elements. In order to win his neighborhood decorating contest, Murphy’s Chris is willing to go to extreme measures, including striking a deal with a sneaky elf named Pepper. In exchange, Pepper decides to cast a spell on the town that brings the 12 Days of Christmas to life, causing chaos in the community. Now, Chris is dealing with much bigger problems than a local contest as he must break Pepper’s spell to save his family and the town.\nBased on the first images alone, Candy Candy Lane has the potential to be a whimsical Christmas movie. While the deal-with-the-devil (which in this case, is a mischievous elf) is quite common, Murphy’s over-the-top comedic style has the potential to make Candy Candy Lane a fun festive film this season. Hopefully, Candy Candy Lane will deliver on its promising premise when it releases in the last month of 2023.\nSource: Deadline\n"}
{"title": "11 Slice-Of-Life Movies That Make The Mundane Feel Magical", "date": "2023-10-10 19:10:27", "text": "When done right, slice-of-life movies can make the mundane feel magical. From Marriage Story to Rocky, these films do the genre justice.\nThe slice-of-life movies are essentially a depiction of the mundane. They will typically focus on character and relationships over things like genre elements, special effects, or the overall aesthetic. In short, they can be thought of as substance over style. Often presented as naturalistic with, for example, simple camerawork or minimal use of music, the slice-of-life films that work are often remarkable for doing so without relying on so many things that many typical moviegoers would think a film needs in order to be remotely interesting.\nWhile that might make the slice-of-life genre sound dull or boring, the magic of them is that they're so often not. A gritty, down-to-earth approach to a story can make the emotional levels all the more powerful by grounding them firmly in reality. A good story should move the viewer regardless of its settings or superficial content, but there's definitely something to be said for the idea that a harrowing drama the audience might actually live through themselves will most likely hit differently than a fantastical blockbuster. These 11 movies make the mundane feel magical.\nRELATED: 10 Dialogue-Heavy Movies For People Who Prefer Talking Over Action\n1960's Saturday Night and Sunday Morning is held up as perhaps the definitive kitchen sink drama. The British cultural movement that developed in the late 1950s and through the early '60s was known for its frequent use of angry young men protagonists and the stark contrast it provided against the escapism of most cinema that had come before it. In Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, Albert Finney portrays Arthur Seaton, a rebellious teddy boy who spends his weeks working in a factory, living for the weekend. He attempts to juggle his relationship with an affair with a married woman, but things come to a head after she becomes pregnant.\nConversations with Other Women stars Helena Bonham Carter and Aaron Eckhart as two wedding guests who find their way to a hotel room together. They cheat on their partners, then spend the night unpacking their emotional baggage together. The film is notable for being shot and edited entirely in a split screen format, with the left and right sides of the screen constantly differing to, for example, either show multiple angles of the same moment at once or to allow for flashbacks to unfold concurrently with footage of a character narrating them.\nWith its feel-good, sports-centric storyline, it's easy to forget that, at the heart of it, Rocky is a slice-of-life movie through and through. When audiences are first introduced to The Italian Stallion, he's an enforcer working to collect debts for a loan shark. It's a dirty life, so he dreams of bettering himself which he sets about doing by training for a landmark boxing match with world champion, Apollo Creed. All of this is punctuated by the underplayed romance that develops between him and Adrian, serving as the film's emotional backbone.\nIt's remarkable that Kramer vs. Kramer is so much more thrilling than, say, Alien vs. Predator or Freddy vs. Jason, when its title refers to the divorce proceedings and custody battle between Ted (Dustin Hoffman) and Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep). The focus of the film soon becomes the growing bond between work-obsessed Ted and the son he had arguably been taking for granted. It's part bitter relationship drama and part father-son love affair. In what is perhaps a depressing indictment of the infantilization of modern pop culture in general, this nuanced drama was one of the highest-grossing movies of 1979, taking $173 million against its $8 million budget (per The Numbers).\nA modern and very conscious homage to Kramer vs. Kramer, 2019's Marriage Story depicts the process of divorce between Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole Barber (Scarlett Johansson), as well as their respective custody battle. Unlike Kramer vs. Kramer, Marriage Story is intent on exploring how the very process of divorce, itself, is responsible for creating a rift between the initially amicable pair and serving to drive them apart. As well as the ever-dependable Driver and Johannson (who were both nominated for Oscars), the film also boasts a quite rightly Oscar-nominated performance from Laura Dern.\nRELATED: Marriage Story Ending & Real Meaning Explained\nIt doesn't get much more slice-of-life than Dogme 95. Founded by Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, the avant-garde movement is a set of rules designed to ensure films are created around the values of story, acting, and theme, eschewing special effects and cheap narrative clutches. The 10 rules, for example, demand that films be shot on location without the use of props beyond items already present in the location. On the face of it, it's difficult to imagine how a film could possibly be entertaining when produced under such oppressive restrictions, and yet Festen, a story about family drama at a 60th birthday party, is truly gripping.\nAustrian filmmaker Michael Haneke is a true master of his craft. He's built a career out of films largely designed to aggravate their audience by purposely subverting film-making conventions. A narrative conclusion, for example, may be omitted in order to comment on the audience's desire for a conclusion. It may be clever, and it may be a valid artistic expression, but it's rarely satisfying to watch. Amour is an uncharacteristic exception within his filmography. The French film concerns an elderly woman who finds herself paralyzed after surgery, leaving her husband as her carer. Instead of being obtuse like usual, with Amour, Haneke settles on simply making his film utterly devastating.\nRoom at the Top is notable for being a rare kitchen sink drama to sweep nominations at The Academy Awards, picking up nominations for Best Picture, Lead Actor, Supporting Actress, Director, Adapted Screenplay, and winning Best Actress in a Leading Role for Simone Signoret's performance. The angry young man movie concerns a reprehensible Yorkshireman attempting to rise through the British class system by seducing the wealthy daughter of a factory owner. Meanwhile, he maintains an affair with an older, married woman whom he loves. The film is utterly compelling. It's hard to look away as Joe inadvertently constructs his own personal hell and then is forced to live in it.\nIn this utterly heartbreaking gem of a film, a couple, Kate and Geoff, are planning to celebrate their 45th wedding anniversary when Geoff receives news that the body of a past lover, Katya, has finally been discovered following a tragic hiking accident where she fell down a crevasse over 50 years ago. The news deeply affects Geoff, which leads Kate to a number of unpleasant revelations and the suspicions that, in spite of his loyalty to her, Geoff has and will never love her as much as he loved Katya.\nIf slice-of-life movies go hand in hand with tragic romance, never has that been clearer than in 2003's Lost In Translation. The classic star-crossed lovers kept apart by fate dynamic plays out with the extra twist of simply exploring themes like connection, isolation, and loneliness. It makes a solid case for being Bill Murray's best work as well as Sofia Coppola's best movie to date. Among other things, Lost in Translation features one of the most heartfelt and iconic endings of all time, being directly parodied in everything from Community to The Office.\nThough relatively obscure outside its titular nation, This Is England took England by storm in 2006, going on to spawn three miniseries sequels: This Is England '86, This Is England '88, and This Is England '90. It offers a truly nuanced exploration of racism set against the backdrop of skinhead culture in 1980s Britain. It's a showcase of utterly beautiful filmmaking with a focus on often neglected aspects of production such as rehearsal. The film's protagonist Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) might just be the greatest child performance of all time, and the film quite rightly catapulted Joseph Gilgun, Vicky McClure, and Stephen Graham to their current status as British national treasures.\nIn one form or another, Sol has been working in film and television in for over a decade. He's produced it, directed it and even animated it. Now, he's writing about it. He once went viral for making a line graph about The Simpsons. "}
{"title": "Indiana Jones & The Dial of Destiny Blu-ray Release Date Revealed (Including No-Dialogue Cut)", "date": "2023-10-10 19:11:05", "text": "The release date for physical media versions of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has now been revealed, and they include a no-dialogue cut.\nAfter releasing in theaters this past summer, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny now has a physical media release date. Directed by James Mangold, the fifth entry in the long-running Indiana Jones franchise sees Harrison Ford return as the intrepid archeologist for one last adventure. After becoming available for purchase on digital platforms on August 29, the sequel is now gearing up for its physical media release.\nNow, Disney reveals that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny will arrive on 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and DVD on December 5, 2023. The physical media edition will include a host of bonus features, including featurettes breaking down the major set pieces in the prologue, New York City, Morocco, Sicily, and everything in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny's wild ending. Also included in the physical media releases is a version of the movie with only John Williams' iconic score. Unfortunately, there's still no official date for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny's Disney Plus release date.\nThe early buzz out of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny's premiere at Cannes was decidedly mixed, with critics divided on Ford's last outing as the beloved hero. While the film's wide release brought more positive-skewing reviews, the sequel still wasn't the slam dunk some had been expecting. Despite the audience reception to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny being significantly more positive (the film's audience score on Rotten Tomatoes is, as of this writing, 88%), that wasn't enough to save it at the box office.\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny's box office currently sits at a meager $383.8 million. Considering the film is budgeted at around $300 million, it's been a considerable flop for Disney and will not break even. While the quality of the film itself is perhaps partially to blame, in hindsight, it's hard to imagine even a well-received Indiana Jones movie succeeding at this price point.\nOne major problem facing the film is that Indiana Jones isn't a character that means a great deal to younger audiences. Although Ford remains a beloved movie star, he's now in his 80s, and it's a tough sell to get younger demographics invested in a movie about someone their grandfather's age. Furthermore, the previous film in the franchise was released back in 2008, making for quite a gap between installments. While Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny struggled in theaters, strong VOD performance suggests the physical media release may be popular.\nSource: Disney\n"}
{"title": "Captain Sandy Accuses This Below Deck Star Of Misogyny As Feud Escalates", "date": "2023-10-10 19:15:19", "text": "Below Deck Mediterranean's Captain Sandy Yawn spoke out about another Below Deck franchise star, calling them out for misogyny amidst their feud.\nBelow Deck Mediterranean star Captain Sandy Yawn isn't staying quiet about the misogyny she sees in her fellow Below Deck franchise star Captain Lee Rosbach. Captain Sandy, who is currently appearing on Below Deck Mediterranean season 8, hasn't been a fan of Captain Lee for the majority of her time in the franchise. Captain Sandy is known for her militant approach to her crew, sometimes micromanaging the staff of her ships to the point that they find it difficult to work with her. Her style is vastly different from Captain Lee, but regardless, Captain Sandy has been successful in her career and enjoys her time on Below Deck Med.\nIn a recent interview with TVInsider, Captain Sandy spoke out about Captain Lee out for the way he's directed his own misogyny at her through their years of knowing each other. \"Captain Lee from day one has never supported me. I think he is a man in a man’s world who doesn’t like a woman being a captain.\" Captain Sandy is \"proud of what I do. I work very hard to get to the helm.\" Sandy shared that she doesn't need Lee's support, explaining, \"he doesn’t weigh in on my captaining. He is not the captain of all captains.\"\nAlthough Captain Lee and Captain Sandy have been friendly in the past, their feud has been ongoing since they were both brought into the franchise. It’s clear that the pair see eye-to-eye as Captains, but don’t have much else in common outside their shared love of the sea. The Captains have taken jabs at each other in the past, with Lee insulting Sandy often due to her gender, even though he’s done his best to say he respects that she’s a woman in the industry. Lee has publicly questioned Sandy’s abilities in Captaining a crew, which was doubly insulting considering she was there for him in a time of need.\nAlthough Sandy has made her position clear when it comes to Captain Lee, she doesn’t have to worry about him invading her space when it comes to Below Deck Mediterranean. Captain Sandy has been the sole Captain on the series since Below Deck Med season 2, and has provided an interesting alternate perspective on how super yacht captaining can be as a woman in an industry full of men. Captain Sandy's perspective has been fresh throughout her time on Below Deck Mediterranean, even with the adversity she's faced both at the hands of her critics and peers like Captain Lee alike.\nAlthough Captain Lee and Captain Sandy seem to have their issues, they've managed to keep their relationship professional throughout their time on Below Deck. While Captain Lee wasn't invited back for Below Deck season 11, Captain Sandy has continued on with Below Deck Mediterranean and worked diligently throughout her time with the franchise. Captain Sandy speaking out about her feelings on the way she's been treated in the past is refreshing, and Below Deck Mediterranean has been supportive of her at the helm.\nBelow Deck Mediterranean airs on Bravo at 9 p.m. on Mondays.\nSource: TVInsider\n"}
{"title": "Chucky Special Effects Supervisor Jeff Skochko On Season 3's Blood Bath", "date": "2023-10-10 19:15:26", "text": "Chucky season 3 special effects supervisor promises more blood than has ever been used in the new season and discusses the practical effects used.\nChucky continues the story of the doll possessed by notorious serial killer Charles Lee Ray, but this time he's heading to Washington. As Jake Wheeler, his best friend turned boyfriend Devon Evans, and their friend Lexy Cross continue to try and thwart Chucky's plans, he has made himself comfortable in the White House. Terrorizing the first family and the other occupants of the White House, Chucky continues his murderous plots to quench his thirst for power.\nChucky season 3 will be split into two parts, with the second debuting sometime in 2024. Don Mancini created Chucky, expanding the world he built in the Chucky films. The series takes place after Cult of Chucky, the seventh movie in the franchise. Jennifer Tilly, Zackary Arthur, Bjorgvin Arnarson, Alyvia Alyn Lind, and Fiona Dourif all reprise their roles in the third season of Chucky, with Brad Dourif returning as the voice of the murderous doll as well. Devon Sawa joins the cast in a new role as a series regular.\nRelated: Chucky Season 3: Release Date, Cast, Trailer & Everything We Know\nScreen Rant spoke with special effects supervisor Jeff Skochko about the third season of Chucky. He shared insight into the use of practical effects, his first experience with Chucky, and the actual deadliness of the traps used in the Saw franchise. Skochko also teased that season 3 will have the most blood ever used on Chucky.\nScreen Rant: Chucky season 3 is taking things to a new level, which is incredible. It's such a meta show that really is a blended genre experience. What horror influences did you use for the special effects in Chucky season 3?\nJeff Skochko: Well, in season 3, we've just got into the tip of our stuff. The first couple episodes were a little slow for us. We were doing our regular stuff with our smoke and our wet downs and that, but the chandelier is what kept us busy. We built that whole thing, and so that took several weeks and a lot of crew to first manufacture all those crystals and then build the whole chandelier, and then not also build the chandelier, but we had to make it that it broke apart when it fell.\nYou're working from what Don's vision is and with the director, and we have a great collaborative team on the show, so you're taking things that you've used in the past. But as far as influences, we have to follow their lead in that aspect.\nI see. Gotcha. Now, can you describe the creative process behind bringing Chucky to life in the third season and how it's evolved from its past seasons?\nJeff Skochko: Sure. They're all similar in a way that we get the scripts and then we'll have a concept meeting, and all the departments head there and we'll just read through it, and then we'll break off into our department meetings. And a lot of times, stunts effects, prosthetics, puppeteers and visual effects and that, we'll have a joint meeting because all the departments intermingle. So we will have discussed what's the best way to do what. If Chucky has a specific action that the puppeteers need any assistance with, like if he's flying across the room or something, either we'll assist them with that or they'll handle that, but we'll iron out all those details.\nAnd then amongst the other departments, we'll figure out who needs to do what, and then we'll sometimes go away and we'll do tests and we'll send the tests out and everyone can get a look at them to understand how the gag would work on set. And then we'll get feedback from that. And if there's any adjustment being made, we'll make the adjustment. If not, we'll let every department know what is required from special effects, and we'll go from there.\nHow many Chucky dolls do you guys usually go through in the course of a season?\nJeff Skochko: Well, it depends. I mean, the puppeteers have their Chucky dolls, which are the ones that speak and do certain movements in that, and they have some interchangeable parts. And then the props department, for season 2, when we did the army of Chucky, I think they purchased like 75 or 80 dolls or something like that, so it just depends. Sometimes we'll have a bunch here at the shop that we'll be prepping with, like when we did season 2 with the Chuckys all on top of the van.\nAt any given time, some of them do get destroyed. I think we've cut off a few of them, some arms and legs and some other parts, so it just depends. But I think at minimum, probably five a season.\nVery cool. Very cool. Now, one thing I love about this show, maybe Chucky in general, is I feel like everything is done in camera. There's a lot of practical effects on this show. But can you talk about balancing the practical effects with the digital effects and creating this seamlessly terrifying experience for viewers out there?\nJeff Skochko: Yeah. Usually what happens is once we figure out who's going to do what, especially if it's a practical gag and say there's a lot of elements to it, visual effects will usually say, \"You know what? Let's shoot as much as we can in camera,\" and then we'll either augment it or clean it up in post. And it's using the best tool for the job. And this show is very pro-getting everything in camera, whether it's prosthetics or whether it's Chucky.\nAs many practical elements as we can get in front of the lens is what the mantra of the show is. And then we'll go to visual effects for any assistance that's needed after that. And sometimes there just is visual effects shots. They may not be tied to Chucky, but I mean, everyone kind of has their spot, what they're best at.\nYeah, that's what I love about this show. I feel like there's an actual effort made to make sure that everything is at least tried in camera first, which actually goes to show the creativity of this show. It's fantastic. Were there any memorable or particular challenges this season, in Chucky season 3, that required an innovative approach to special effects?\nJeff Skochko: Well, the chandelier. We'd never done a chandelier before, so that was the biggest gag on season 3 to date. There is some bigger stuff coming up. A lot of it was in our wheelhouse already. There's always something. It's always exciting when you're doing something new you haven't done before. So I told one of the other reporters, this will be the most amount of blood ever used on Chucky will be this season. There's things to come.\nWhen I saw season 2, I was like, \"No way. There's no way this gets topped in season 3.\" And off the bat, I feel like it's doing a pretty solid job. How does the horror genre, especially Chucky, push the boundaries of special effects this season?\nJeff Skochko: Well, I think it depends. When we do the Saw movies, you're building these traps that... They don't exist. They existed in a mind. You have to make them work as well. It's not just that they're just a set piece. So the level of ingenuity and the level of R&D that we have to go through is crazy. And I was saying to one of the other reporters, a lot of the traps in Saw can literally kill you.\nThat's the way they're built, and a lot of them have to work. There are safety measures put in, and we do everything cautiously, but that's the way they are. With Chucky and that, the gags are... They're big, but they're controllable, and there's less, I'd say, of the mechanical part that you have in the traps of Saw and more, whether you're spraying stuff or you're liquefying stuff or you're blowing something up, you all take back from your past and use that as your template.\nIt's funny, I just talked to the Saw folks a couple of weeks ago, and it's crazy to think that these things get made because it has to be a little terrifying with those traps because they can't hurt you. It has to be that sense of a precaution taken.\nJeff Skochko: Yeah. Well, we've done three of the Saw movies and it's crazy, some of the things, and they're all big steel rigs. And even just building them and putting them together. And the thing is, we usually build them here at our shop, and then we have to transport them to a studio or location wherever we're doing and install them.\nSo there's a massive amount of work, especially I think it was Jigsaw with the Spiralizer where you had this thing, and even just making the cone for inside was a big effort because you have to come up this stuff. Nothing's foam and latex. Everything is steel, and they want stuff to work and that, so it's a very creative process, but it can be tough. It can be mentally straining.\nHow has your experience as the specialist effects supervisor evolved through Chucky, and what have you learned along the way that you were able to apply to other productions?\nJeff Skochko: Well, it's a very collaborative effort on Chucky, so it's great. Sometimes you're able to pitch an idea and get that idea in there. Sometimes you're able to make a suggestion and say, \"Well, hey, what if we did this shot when it's raining to make it more dramatic?\" or something like that. So it's very friendly that way, and I think the longer you're on a show, everyone gets more comfortable with each other and you're more comfortable sharing your ideas. And yeah, it's a good collaborative effort on Chucky, and so it's a comfortable place to work, and they come up with crazy gags that we have to make happen, so they write it on the page and we turn it into reality.\nHas there ever been anything on the page that you guys weren't able to get made or get done?\nJeff Skochko: No. I think the only thing I was telling was that in season 2, there was a rain sequence, a big storm in an episode that Dawn directed that unfortunately the rain was cut for budget reasons, which was a little sad because we were all looking forward to it, and it would've been some really cool shots. But like everything, there's always a limit on the budget.\nTalk to me about your first experience with Chucky. Did you watch the films prior to this or was this something that you just jumped on and kind of immersed yourself in once you got the job?\nJeff Skochko: No, I saw Chucky when I was a teenager, or maybe younger than a teenager, and I saw the first few Child's Play movies. I haven't seen them all, but I've seen most of them, and I was excited to get the show. And yeah, it's been a great experience. And Chucky's a known entity, so it's nice always to work on a project where you can say, \"I'm working on Chucky,\" and you don't have to explain in detail of what it is. People have an idea. Throughout your career you work on some movies that they're just a one-off, so they haven't come out yet, so no one really knows or understands when you say, unless it's part of a franchise.\nEvery time I see Chucky on screen, I'm always impressed because I feel like, I know that's a doll, but it moves seamlessly like a human being. What surprised you the most working on Chucky? Because you got to see the curtain pulled back and see how the dolls actually work. What surprised you the most when you actually got to see that side of Chucky?\nJeff Skochko: Well, it's just that it's funny that when you first start seeing Chucky and seeing all the different parts and the different sizes of Chuckys, there's some oversize stuff that you would never realize is oversize, and just the level of the skill and the life that the puppeteers bring to it. Yeah, it's fun. You walk around set and you see Chucky.\nIn Chucky's unending thirst for power, season 3 now sees Chucky ensconced with the most powerful family in the world — America's First Family, inside the infamous walls of the White House. How did Chucky wind up here? What in God's name does he want?\nCheck out other Chucky season 3 interviews here:\nNew episodes of Chucky season 3 air Wednesdays at 9/8c on SYFY.\n"}
{"title": "What Is An Executive Producer? Hollywood's Most Confounding Movie Credit Explained", "date": "2023-10-10 19:30:26", "text": "The executive producer is one of the most important credits on a film's production, but its elusive definition requires some explanation.\n“Executive producer” is one of the most prominent screen credits, but various definitions make the title a confusing one. Movies often feature numerous executive producers per project, with some of the names even attached to their own production houses. The more company logos appear at the beginning of a film, the more executive producers it has. Some Marvel Studios executive producers feature so prominently in the credits to those films, that they start to become recognizable names in themselves.\nThe executive producer is not to be confused with the producer. They are two separate credits conferring two very different roles. The producer is expected to be hands-on, solving the problems of a film production as they appear. Generally, they are tasked with managing the logistics side of a production, freeing the director up to handle the creative side. The producer reports directly to the executive producers, and is responsible for assuring them that the production is running smoothly.\nThe reason the “executive producer” credit’s meaning is still so elusive is that there isn’t one strict definition. Rather, there are numerous vaguely similar roles that can hold the title. Broadly, “executive producer” can be anyone who has a “big picture” role within the film, as opposed to a more hands-on role. This can be someone with a broad creative overview, like Kevin Feige with the MCU. Feige doesn’t write the Marvel movies, but it’s his job to oversee the creative direction of the franchise, which involves input on each individual film’s story. TV showrunners are often given an EP credit on their TV shows for the same reason.\nAn executive producer can also be someone who was involved in the conception of the franchise, such as Stan Lee in the MCU. In this case, it’s usually a less involved role, with the title being an additional credit that satisfies the creator and allows them to earn more money off the new installment. Finally, it can be someone who was involved in funding the film, such as Eva Longoria on the John Wick movies or Danny DeVito on Pulp Fiction. The money entitles them to input on the film, but this is generally filtered through the producer.\nIt’s most common for an executive producer to be a financier for a project. They may represent a movie studio, an investment group, or simply an individual financial stake. The majority of executive producers credited to a film or series will be financial backers. This wasn’t always the case, but the number of credited executive producers to a film has risen exponentially in recent years. According to a study (via Stephen Follows), the average number of executive producers per film has gone from less than 2 in 1990 to 5.1 in 2021. This increase is due to larger trend of ballooning budgets in the movie industry.\nSource: Stephen Follows\n"}

While fans may already have an idea of what kind of character the \"Batman Below\" is, the new cosmic-horror Robin is a complete unknown.\nBatman: City of Madness, a three-part miniseries by Christian Ward and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou, finds Gotham City under attack from the Batman Below – an immensely powerful, uncaring being spawned by the contempt, loathing, and dread seeping into his reality from Gotham itself. In the first issue, the beastly Batman Below is officially released, and he immediately begins searching for his own version of Robin.\nThe monster may have found his Robin in the form of a distraught young Black boy seeking revenger for the unjust death of his father at the hands of a Gotham police officer. In an interview with Looper, Ward shared some of the influences that went into crafting City of Madness, and what to expect from the Batman Below's search for a sidekick.\nConsidering the Batman Below's own grotesque mental and physical characteristics, if he succeeds in completing his duo, the new Robin will certainly be the most macabre iteration ever. Christian Ward has spoken extensively about the series, along with the creative process he went through in developing the idea, the characters, and the world that City of Madness exists in. However, he has not divulged much about whom the cosmic horror Robin is, or what type of personality the character could take on if the Batman Below succeeds in this quest. What Ward has made clear is that a diverse set of influences went into City of Madness.\n\"A lot of the stuff that I've been mining from is very old fairy tales and folklore, cosmic horror. All that sort of stuff,\" Ward explained to Looper. \"Lovecraft', 'Alice in Wonderland', those are the two big ones. There's a little bit of the 'Pied Piper' in there.\" From Ward's statements, and what is already known about the Batman Below, it's not hard to deduce that this Cthulhu-like monster will transform the grieving boy into a ghoulish Robin who he'd love to partner with – one like him, who has been begotten by the hatred and fear that infests Gotham City. This wouldn't be unlike Red Hood's Jason Todd, who would have been the perfect choice for conversion – though he may not satisfy Ward's Pied Piper inspiration.\nDespite the existence of this new and intriguing character — who may be doomed to a dark Robin conversion — of all the Robins that have worked with Batman, Dick Grayson would have made the most sense for the Batman Below to target. In typical Lovecraft fashion, a turned Grayson would have presented a facade of wholesomeness that covers a base of offensive, corroding, evil – the ultimate in Batman sinfulness. It will be interesting to see how this new character develops over the course of the limited series, especially as Ward does — or doesn't — slide him into those traditional Lovecraftian horror tropes. No matter the outcome, it's simply terrifying that, once loose in Gotham City, the Batman Below will be focused on transforming this new Robin to form his own sinister dynamic duo.\nBatman: City of Madness #1 is available now from DC Comics.\nSource: Looper\nMarcel Green is a writer for Screen Rant's Comics and Anime Sections."}

The eight-episode series adapts the original manga by Eiichiro Oda, starting from the beginning of the East Blue Saga. Every arc in the Saga was covered in season 1 except for the final storyline, which sees Luffy and the Straw Hats arrive in a place called Loguetown.\nDuring an Ask Me Anything on Reddit's r/television, Matt Owens (via u/netflix) explained Loguetown was not skipped over during season 1. Instead, due to a reduced episode count, it was decided that Loguetown would be saved until One Piece season 2 for the sake of preserving its quality. Check out what Owens had to say below:\nSkipped? Never! It wasn't included in season 1 because our episode number got reduced. And to try to cram it in would not have done service to it or the story it had to share space with. Loguetown is not \"cut\" we just haven't gotten there yet!\nIn the manga, Luffy's crew arrives in Loguetown at the end of the East Blue Saga, their final destination before entering the Grand Line. This is also where they become targeted by another Marine, Captain Smoker, who vows to chase them into the Grand Line to escape Loguetown unharmed. Smoker's appearance is teased in One Piece season 1's ending, where he can be seen looking at a Wanted poster featuring Luffy.\nSince Loguetown directly followed the Arlong Park Arc in the manga, it's likely the location will appear at the very start of One Piece season 2. This will help set up Smoker's role in the live-action show while providing an introduction to how Luffy's crew arrives at the Grand Line. It also means the majority of season 2 can focus on storylines in the Arabasta Saga, the first Saga to feature the Grand Line.\nLoguetown being the start of season 2 means the story could be played around with to ensure every arc of the manga gets a chance to shine in live-action. Because of how long the Arabasta Saga is, season 2 may not cover everything, leaving some ideas open for the show's promising future. With plenty of new and exciting adventures arriving in the next chapter of Luffy's quest, One Piece season 2 could be even better than season 1.\nSource: Matt Owens (via u/netflix)/Reddit\n"}
{"title": "How Many Episodes The Frasier Reboot Has & When The Finale Releases", "date": "2023-10-10 19:40:28", "text": "Almost two decades since the original series, Kelsey Grammer is returning as Frasier Crane, and here's the episode release schedule and episode count.\nThe Frasier reboot series is scheduled to begin on Paramount+ very soon, so here is a helpful guide to the season's episode count and when they will air. The original run of Frasier ended in 2004 after eight seasons, and the show was incredibly consistent. All eight seasons saw Frasier stubbornly go through life only enjoying coffee, wine, and fine dining, and it was endlessly entertaining. Now, almost two decades later, the well-respected psychiatrist is returning with a legacy season. There are a lot of Frasier characters missing from the reboot, including Niles, Martin, Daphne, and Bulldog, but Kelsey Grammer is back as the titular shrink.\nWhile the original series won an immense number of accolades, including an unbelievable 24 Emmy Awards, the reboot series hasn't garnered quite the same reception. Unfortunately, the Frasier reboot has gotten a mixed reception from critics, but that doesn't mean audiences aren't interested in where Frasier is in his life 20 years later. The reboot series isn't set in Seattle, as the show sees Frasier returning to Boston, and the character now has a very non-Frasier-like son. A lot has changed in the radio host's life, and here's how many episodes of the rebooted series there are and when the last episode will air.\nRELATED: Where To Watch Frasier (Original Show & Reboot)\nThe Frasier reboot will have 10 episodes. Not much is known about each episode, but a few of the titles have been revealed. Episode 1 is titled, \"The Good Father\" and episode 2 is called \"Moving In.\" Based on the title of Episode 7, \"Freddy's Birthday\" will be centered around Frasier's grown-up son, Frederick Crane. The final two episode titles have been revealed too, as the penultimate episode is called \"The Fix Is In,\" followed by the season finale, \"Reindeer Games.\" While 10-episode seasons are the norm in today's television landscape, this number is relatively low for Frasier. In the series' original run, most seasons had over 20 episodes.\nThe Frasier reboot's finale is on December 7, 2023. Based on the title \"Reindeer Games,\" the Holiday season is a fitting release for the finale, and the episode will likely be a festive one. However, the title has a double meaning, as it also teases an interesting story arc. \"Reindeer games\" is a phrase used to describe activities that unfairly discriminate against certain participants. Frasier could be using his intellect to alienate the less educated characters, something he was guilty of doing in the original series. As yet, it isn't clear if \"Reindeer Games\" will mark the series finale or if there'll be a Frasier reboot season 2.\nThe Frasier reboot episodes will be released weekly on Paramount+, with the exception being the first two episodes, which will air together on October 12, 2023. Not all the episode titles have been announced at the time of writing, but here is a list of the full Frasier episodes release schedule:\nCurrently splitting his time between Madrid and Chicago, Stephen Barker has been a staff writer at Screen Rant since 2020.

{"title": "Expendables 4's VOD Release Date Confirmed After $44.9 M Box Office Disaster", "date": "2023-10-10 19:44:52", "text": "After hitting theaters less than a month ago and cratering at the box office, The Expendables 4’s digital release date has been revealed.\nThe Expendables 4's VOD release date has now been revealed as the movie continues to be a major disappointment at the box office. Directed by Scott Waugh, the latest installment in the action franchise sees the titular mercenary team embark on a mission to prevent World War III. The film, which sees Jason Statham take over as lead from Sylvester Stallone, was met with abysmal reviews and flopped at the box office in its opening weekend.\n Now, as The Expendables 4's box office continues to underwhelm, an Apple TV listing reveals that the film's VOD release date has been set for Friday, October 13. This digital release date comes less than a month after the movie hit theaters.\nNone of the previous Expendables movies were critical darlings, with the franchise instead carving out a niche for itself with audiences who enjoyed the cast of iconic action stars from the last 40 years and bloody, old-school fight scenes. Clearly, however, this formula has worn thin with the most recent installment.\nThe poor reception to The Expendables 3 is likely at least in part to blame, with that sequel trading its R rating for PG-13, a move that ultimately failed to attract younger audiences and instead alienated the franchise's core demographic. That movie was also released back in 2014, making for an almost 10-year gap between releases. A decade is evidently plenty of time for audience interest in a property to wane, not to mention the drastic changes to movie-going behavior that have occurred on a more general level.\nAnother reason why the new sequel failed could be because of The Expendables 4 cast. A big part of the appeal for previous installments were action stars like Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Jet Li, and Jean-Claude Van Damme all sharing the screen together, but most of these stars don't return for the new sequel. Even Stallone, the central figure of past entries, has a significantly reduced presence this time around. While The Expendables 4 has been a disaster at the box office, it's possible that the movie will end up being more popular when it hits VOD later this week.\nSource: Apple TV\n"}

Are they still in U.S.?\nLoren and Alexei Brovarnik had revealed their plans to move to Israel on their 90 Day Fiancé spin-off. Loren was a group leader for a Birthright Israel trip where Alexei was a medic when they first met. Loren had not grown up religious like her parents, but the Birthright trip changed her outlook toward her religion and its practices. Since their meeting in 2013, Loren flew to Israel five times to be with Alexei until she brought him to the U.S. on a K-1 visa to get married. Their first wedding was in September 2015 in America and July 2016 in Israel.\nIn April 2020, the reality TV show couple welcomed their first son, Shai Josef, while in August 2021, they had Asher Noah. Loren then welcomed her daughter, Ariel Raya, in September 2022. In Loren & Alexei: After the 90 Days season 2, the couple considered moving their family from Florida to Israel. Loren’s parents were not thrilled by the decision, but they accompanied Loren and Alexei to Israel for 10 days during the season. \nRelated: Where Do 90 Day Fiancé Couple Loren & Alexei Brovarnik Live\nIn May 2023, Loren and Alexei appeared in a commercial for Hollywood, Florida, confirming that they never moved to Israel. Loren and Alexei have also continued appearing in episodes of Pillow Talk. Their latest one aired on October 8, 2023. It was for the premiere episode of 90 Day Fiancé season 10. Called the 90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk House, it included couples such as Loren and Alexei, Anny and Robert Springs, Elizabeth and Andrei Castravet all under one roof to provide commentary on the new season. Their current location appears to be Hallandale Beach, Florida.\nOn Sunday, October 8, Loren posted an Instagram story to provide an update on Alexei and his family after the war in Israel. She thanked the fans who reached out. “Alex’s family is ok!” Loren wrote, “We have very dear friends and relatives who have gotten back to the IDF. We are sending them and all of those fighting our prayers and strength during this time!” Loren added. Meanwhile, Alexei also broke his silence to share a recorded message in response to questions about his and his family’s safety. “So, first and foremost to me and my immediate family, my parents are okay and safe at this point in Israel,” Alexei added.\nLoren and Alexei have not mentioned their plans for relocation in the future. They are a popular 90 Day Fiancé franchise couple, and it’s certain they will remain a part of the franchise for years to come. Even if a new season of Loren & Alexei: After the 90 Days has not been announced, they could have a season 3 to document the birth of the couple’s third baby. If not, there’s always Pillow Talk for Loren and Alexei to show up on Sunday nights and entertain their fans.\nSources: Loren Brovarnik/Instagram, Loren Brovarnik/Instagram, Alexei Brovarnik/Instagram\n"}

James Wan and Leigh Whannell launched another successful horror franchise in 2010 with the first Insidious. The horror movies revolve around the Lambert family and psychic Elise Rainer as they encounter ghosts and demons from The Further. After following the Lambert family for the first two movies and then shifting the franchise to prequels about Elise, the Insidious 5 cast brings the various story threads together for another thrill following the Lamberts.\nThe Insidious movies have continued to be made for more than a decade due to the consistent box office success of the franchise, and the 2023 horror movie continued to show how strong of a performer the franchise is. Plenty of people watched Insidious: The Red Door's ending in theaters and saw how the movie set up the future of Blumhouse's franchise. There are more ways to watch Insidious 5 than in theaters, as the movie's release on streaming and digital services provides opportunities to see it at home. Here is what to know about how to watch Insidious: The Red Door.\nThe Insidious franchise is overseen by Blumhouse Productions, but the horror-focused studio has seen different distributors get involved with the series over the years. Although Universal handled Insidious: The Last Key, Sony Pictures and Screen Gems are in charge of Insidious: The Red Door. Sony does not have its own streaming service like Universal, Paramount, Disney, or Warner Bros. The studio has instead signed a deal with Netflix that gives the streaming service first rights to stream Sony theatrical releases. Insidious: The Red Door falls under that agreement, meaning it will be released on Netflix first.\nRelated: How To Watch The Insidious Movies In Order\nInsidious 5's streaming release will begin on Netflix, but no release date has been announced so far. However, Sony also came to a deal with Disney for the Pay 2 window. This means each Sony movie will go to Disney Plus or Hulu after they leave Netflix. Considering the scary nature of the Insidious movies, it is more likely that Insidious: The Red Door will stream on Hulu instead of Disney Plus after it leaves Netflix even if it is only rated PG-13.\nInsidious: The Red Door is currently available to rent and buy digitally on a variety of PVOD services. Sony officially released the movie in this way on August 1, 2023, just 27 days after its theatrical debut. Insidious: The Red Door is available on Apple TV+, Prime Video, Google Play, YouTube, Vudu, Microsoft, and Spectrum. The cost to rent Insidious: The Red Door is $5.99 on Apple TV+, Prime Video, Google Play, YouTube, Vudu, and Microsoft, while it costs $6.99 on Spectrum. The price to purchase the movie on VOD is $19.99 across all services, but it is not available to buy on Spectrum.\nBased on the cost breakdown for Insidious: The Red Door's digital release, renting is the cheaper option for people wanting to watch the movie. However, if someone is already invested in the franchise or knows they like the movie from a theatrical viewing and want to rewatch it over the years, buying the sequel digitally would be more cost-effective. There is also the option to buy a physical copy of the movie through its home video release, as Insidious: The Red Door can be purchased on Blu-ray for $22.96 at Amazon, $24.99 at Target, and $27.99 at Best Buy, to name a few options.\n"}

{"title": "How Buffy The Vampire Sequel Plans To &quot;Give Credit & Justice&quot; To Tara & Cordelia", "date": "2023-10-10 19:56:44", "text": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s Charisma Carpenter gets candid about the sequel series does justice to her character, plus others like Anya and Tara.\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer star Charisma Carpenter gets candid about how the sequel series does justice to her character, plus others like Anya and Tara. Carpenter is one of the returning Buffy actors who gets the spotlight in Slayerverse: A Buffyverse Story, a nine-episode audio drama that takes place a decade after the show's finale and sees several cast members reprising their iconic characters, including Cordelia Chase who is the vampire slayer in an alternate universe. The project is co-written and directed by Amber Benson, who also returns as Tara Maclay, Christopher Golden, and Kc Wayland.\nIn an interview with Variety to promote Slayers: A Buffyverse Story, Carpenter opened up about how the audio project offers some justice for Cordelia in the wake of the character's disappointing exit from the spinoff Angel and the emotional abuse she experienced from series creator Joss Whedon. The actor stresses in her quote how \"that show involved hundreds of people to make, and it wasn’t about just one person.\" She also highlights what the audio drama will do differently:\nOne of the most important things to me about “Slayers” is that it is an opportunity to give the “Buffyverse” fandom permission to enjoy the show, enjoy these characters again in a way that is representative of perseverance, of work ethic, of the familiar. It has really been made clear to me how much entertainment in general and the previous show and what this future show will do to provide comfort, empowerment, self-belief and reminders of our purpose.\nI think it will be an opportunity to give credit and justice to Tara, to Anya, to Cordelia. Because that show involved hundreds of people to make, and it wasn’t about just one person. So I feel like it’s really a beautiful thing to have this opportunity to bring her back to life — Cordelia specifically — and have her live out a very empowering life, and share her wisdom from that battle. I just feel like it’s very poetic in a lot of ways.\nIn the Audible audio drama, Spike (James Masters) attempts to track down a Watcher for his eager new Slayer protégé. Their paths collide with the veteran Slayer of a parallel reality where Buffy Summers never existed and Cordelia Chase is the “one-and-only” Slayer, and she needs Spike’s help to deal with Spike's former flame Drusilla (Juliet Landau). The story is clearly meant to correct Cordelia's story, as she had one of the most organic and compelling arcs in the entire Buffyverse until Angel season 3 which was followed by absolute character assassination.\nThe story that led to Cordelia's exit was a mess behind the scenes that was made worse because of Whedon's treatment of Carpenter, which the actor detailed. She came back in Angel season 5, for the episode \"You're Welcome\", but did so with the belief that Cordelia wouldn't be killed off. Cordelia was killed off anyway. It was an iffy end to one of the franchise's most compelling characters, a popular girl who proved to have a heart of gold. Far more importantly, it was capped off by Carpenter's negative experiences on set.\nBenson, too, declined to make a guest appearance in Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 7 partly because she couldn't guarantee how Tara would be utilized. Anya was killed off in the series finale that was barely acknowledged. It makes the audio drama a worthwhile chance to write some wrongs that have never sat well with the viewers.\nSource: Variety\nAbdullah Al-Ghamdi joined Screen Rant in 2019.

The two are arguably Marvel's most successful couple, but for the time being at least, it appears Marvel has no intentions of reuniting the couple. Now, MJ is dating mild-mannered Paul, which may be enough of a catalyst to inspire a full-blown fight between herself and Spider-Man.\nThe former lovebirds will be having a knock-down, drag-out brawl in The Amazing Spider-Man #35 by Zeb Wells, Patrick Gleason, Marcio Menyz, Erick Arciniega, and VC's Joe Caramagna. Now infected with the sins of his worst enemy, a newly villainous Spider-Man is on a warpath of committing vengeance upon those he thinks wronged him. He started his revenge with Kraven, and next on his hit list are Paul and MJ. John Romita Jr., Scott Hanna, and Menyz's cover art can be found below.\nAs seen in the preview panels below, the issue picks up where the previous left off, after Spidey, who's once again adorned in his Black Suit, catches MJ and Peter under the Holland Tunnel. In comes the Queen Goblin, who kickstarted this entire plot to begin with by imbuing the Green Goblin's hellacious persona into Peter Parker. She appears to be having second thoughts about what she's done, but it's too late. To protect her partner, MJ urges Paul to flee before activating her Jackpot powers. In a sight no one would have expected, the two exes trade fighting stances before squaring off.\nThis most certainly is a unique means of prolonging the reunion between Mary Jane and Spider-Man that readers so desperately want to see. In large part due to the infamous contract between Spidey and Mephisto dating back to the One More Day storyline in the mid-2000s, Marvel continues to stick to its guns about keeping the former lovers separated for the most part. While there may be a day when they do get back together, Marvel seems hellbent on stretching out the inevitable as much as it can. However, if this is the route Marvel does choose to take, then it is hard to deny it as at least a direction that no one would have seen coming.\nIt most certainly takes advantage of just how vile this version of Peter Parker can be, but it also utilizes the places both characters are in now. Both are in completely different places since their romance first began so many decades ago. Not only is Peter evil now, but MJ is no damsel, adopting a superhero persona of her own now. One of the biggest criticisms against Spider-Man's more recent stories (including that aforementioned One More Day arc with Mephisto) is that some writers have forced the character to go backward, halting his evolution by stripping away mementos of his character development, like his marriage.\nHowever, unpredictable as it may be, setting up a fight between Mary Jane Watson and Spider-Man leans into the more recent evolution that both characters have gone through lately and takes them in a direction that should continue to progress their characters.\nThe Amazing Spider-Man #35 is on sale starting October 11.\nJoe Anthony Myrick (or JAM) is a comics writer who specializes in, of course, covering the big figureheads of the industry (Marvel and DC), as well as lesser-known indy parties and some personal favorites like BOOM!

{"title": "10 Horror Movies That Are Unintentionally Hilarious", "date": "2023-10-10 20:00:29", "text": "Horror is a great genre, and sometimes, the ones that go wrong end up being even more fun than the ones that work. Here are 10 of the funniest.\nThis article contains a mention of suicide in relation to a horror movie premise.\nHorror is one of the most fun genres around, but it's also something that can go very wrong if the people producing it don't know what they're doing. Unlike a bad drama or a bad comedy, a bad horror movie is far more likely to inadvertently end up being completely and utterly laughable for the audience. A mixture of bad special effects, ludicrous heightened premises, and hammy acting can make bad horror movies funny enough to rival the best comedies around, and thanks to their simple, straightforward plots, they're rarely boring either.\nPerhaps stemming from a desire to disarm the genre so that it can't scare us, many people specifically seek out bad horror movies when they want a laugh around Halloween. What could have been great horror movies failed to resonate with audiences looking for a good scare upon their initial release only to take on life as cult classics once people started to realize just how hilarious they actually were. There are also more modern films that are yet to be reevaluated and discovered for the secret, unintentional comedies that they are. Here are 10 of the funniest.\nBlack Sabbath has some genuinely brilliant horror in it towards the end, making it a 1960s horror movie that should be on audiences' watchlists. It's also noteworthy for featuring perhaps the earliest, \"I'm watching you\" phone-call-from-a-killer scene, predating Scream, A Stranger Calls, and even Black Christmas by over a decade. Aside from the melodramatic, cheesy production, what really tips it into being laughable are the wraparound sequences presented by Boris Karloff. The telephone segment is particularly silly because it ends with the protagonist supposedly cursed forever by a ghost that will haunt them forever from beyond the grave... by making slightly annoying phone calls now and then.\nA latter-day entry in the classic British anthology horror genre that boomed throughout the '60s and '70s. Horror writer, Wilbur Gray (Peter Cushing), attempts to convince someone of his discovery that cats are secretly evil supernatural creatures by recounting three feline-focused horror tales that he's become aware of. If trying to make cats scary isn't funny enough, one segment inexplicably introduces its star, Donald Pleasance, with a headshot of him portraying Blofeld as he did in the James Bond movie, You Only Live Twice. The only justification seems to be because Blofeld famously also had a cat.\nRelated: 10 Best Horror Movies Of 2023\nIf viewers pick an Italian zombie movie from the 1970s, odds are they're going to get a few good laughs out of it. Zombi 3 is particularly funny, though. Despite having no in-universe connection to it whatsoever, the movie is officially a sequel to Zombi 2, itself an unlicensed sequel to the European cut of George A. Romero's intentionally funny zombie masterpiece, Dawn of the Dead (released in Italy as Zombi). Zombi 3 has everything someone could hope for: terrible makeup, inexplicably plotting and dialogue, and hammy acting (from the humans and the zombies).\nRelated: George A. Romero's Living Dead Universe Explained: All Sequels, Spinoffs & What's Canon\nEd Wood's magnum opus and one of the most infamous so-bad-it's-good movies, to the point that it's essentially why Tim Burton made his biographic masterpiece, Ed Wood, Plan 9 from Outer Space has everything from stilted acting to cardboard sets blowing in the wind. Wood had filmed footage of the film's star, Bela Lugosi, for another project. When he, unfortunately, passed during production, the footage was inserted here with missing scenes filmed using a \"lookalike,\" Wood's chiropractor, holding a cloak over his face whenever he appeared. In Plan 9's defense, its reputation as the worst movie ever made is laughable.\nMost people have seen some of Night of the Lepus already. The film, in which giant rabbits terrorize a small desert town, can be seen playing prominently on a television screen at one point in the background of The Matrix. Despite a reasonable setup in which scientists botch an attempt to use hormones to control a surging rabbit population, the simple fact is that rabbits just aren't scary, no matter how big someone makes them. The giants are sometimes portrayed here by footage of rabbits hopping around a model village in slow motion; and sometimes just by a man in a rabbit costume. It never looks good.\nThe Wicker Man (1973) is a masterpiece with a strong claim for the title of the scariest film ever made. The 2006 remake on the other hand is a film in which Nicolas Cage rampages through a village, punching women in the face while dressed as a bear and screaming about honey. Cage and the director have since claimed that the film is a black comedy, which is fine if true, but audiences aren't laughing with the film. Moments like Nicolas Cage screaming, \"Killing me won't bring back your God damned honey\" have been heavily \"memified online,\"\nRoar might just be the strangest film project to ever make its way through production. Noel Marshall (who also writes and directs) stars alongside his real-life wife, Tippi Hedren, and daughter, Melanie Griffith, who essentially bankrupted themselves by taking a movie camera into the middle of a big cat reserve. The visibly uncomfortable actors attempt to improvise their way through a plot that devolves into essentially being Night of the Living Dead with lions and tigers instead of zombies. 50% of the movie's 140-person crew sustained injuries at some point during production. Cinematographer, Jan de Bont, who went on to direct Speed, was famously scalped by a lion named Cherries.\nUnlike The Wicker Man, Vampire's Kiss is a Nicolas Cage movie that is actually supposed to be a comedy. However, once again, the audience is not laughing in the way that the movie intended. The film is Cage's first time playing a vampire before starring as Renfield's Dracula, 35 years later. Montages of Cage's \"Cagiest Moments\" that exist online generally feature about 50% footage from Vampire's Kiss, and the movie is also where those famous Nicolas Cage reaction gifs come from. It is a true Cage tour de force, with the man affecting a fictional accent, genuinely eating a real-life cockroach, and screaming at unsuspecting passersby on the street.\nThe ever-maligned The Happening is overdue for a reappraisal as the comedic masterwork that it is. The film features utterly nonsensical dialogue with characters inexplicably talking about hot dogs out of nowhere and a scene where Mark Wahlberg attempts, at gunpoint, to prove that he's normal by bursting into an impromptu, utterly incongruous performance of \"Black Water\" by The Doobie Brothers. As proved by Smile, the central premise: that people are compelled to kill themselves, could have been terrifying, but instead, the audience is given scenes like a man starting a lawnmower before lying down in front of it.\nPound-for-pound, Troll 2, not a sequel to Troll, and only featuring creatures referred to as \"goblins\", might be as densely packed with humor as a classic episode of The Simpsons. The film is a sincere attempt from infamous schlock director, Claudio Fragasso, and screenwriter wife, Rosella Drudi, to make vegetarians scary after being annoyed by their meat-free friends.

{"title": "10 Horrifying DC Movie Moments That Are Way Worse Than You Remember Them", "date": "2023-10-10 20:00:29", "text": "DC movies have included many horrifying moments - we rundown the 10 most memorably disturbing moments seen in DC movies.\nThere have been many horrifying DC movie moments, but some are worse than most tend to remember. The characters of DC comics, both heroes and villains, are typically presented as larger-than-life archetypes, and that is frequently reflected in their on-film portrayals. While that often leads to triumphant moments of heroism and epic battles of good and evil, DC films have also not neglected to show the dark side of comic book movie storytelling.\nSeveral DC movies, from the worst to the best, have had outright horrifying moments of characters dying and heroes enduring unexpected defeats. Other darker DC movie moments have also involved heartbreaking twists and unexpected reveals or characters heading down surprising dark paths. Here are 10 horrifying DC movie moments that are way worse than often remembered.\nRELATED: Every Upcoming DC Movie In 2023 And Beyond\nJames Wan is most widely known for his horror movie pedigree in the Saw, Insidious, and Conjuring franchises, and he delivered a powerful second-act sequence of terror in 2018's Aquaman with the Trench. As Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) and Mera (Amber Heard) try to avert a war between Atlantis and the surface world, the monstrous undersea beasts known as the Trench attack their boat, forcing them to flee to the oceanic depths. While Aquaman has a generally light-hearted tone, the members of Trench are nonetheless frightening adversaries that add an edge of horror to Arthur Curry's high-seas adventure.\n 2013's animated movie Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox adapts the Flashpoint comics story, in which Barry Allen creates an alternate reality after traveling back in time to prevent his mother's murder. With Atlantis and Themyscira at war, one of the darkest moments of The Flashpoint Paradox comes when Wonder Woman uses her lasso to force Shazam to say his name, turning him back into Billy Batson and enabling her to kill him. The DC Universe seen in the majority of The Flashpoint Paradox is an alternate reality, but even still, the brutal killing of a young hero like Billy Batson hits with a dark impact all its own.\n In 2019's Shazam!, Billy Batson (Asher Angel) is determined to find his mother after being separated from her as a child and being moved from one foster home to another ever since. When Billy finally finds his mother, Marilyn (Caroline Palmer), it is far from the happy reunion he expected, with Marilyn admitting she abandoned Billy in the belief that a foster family could look after him better than she could as a mother with an unexpected pregnancy. Even with all the superheroic and holiday season magic of Shazam!, the truth of how he became an orphan is still a heartbreaking revelation for Billy to uncover.\n In the alternate reality of Andy Muschietti's The Flash, both Barry Allen and his younger self (Ezra Miller) come to realize they cannot undo the devastating outcome of the invasion of General Zod (Michael Shannon), as it is an \"inevitable intersection\" of this alternate timeline. In The Flash movie's ending, the two Barrys then meet Dark Flash and realize he is the future version of Young Barry, still trying to fix the past. Judging from Dark Flash's appearance, he is likely in his early '70s, suggesting the 18-year-old Young Barry has spent over 50 years trying to rewrite an event that is a permanent fixture of this reality, truly making him a Dark Flash.\nRELATED: 10 Most Underrated DC Movie Villains\nZack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice introduced Ben Affleck's Batman as both a 20-year crime-fighting veteran and one who terrifies even his own allies in the Gotham City Police Department. That much is established from his introductory scene in Batman v Superman, in which police arrive at a building where a human trafficking operation is run. Batman has already apprehended and tied up the traffickers and left even the very victims he's saved shivering in fright. With one cop discovering the Dark Knight looming in a corner like an enormous bat, Batman v Superman emphasizes Ben Affleck's Caped Crusader as pure fear made into a man.\n The 2020 animated film Justice League Dark: Apokolips War was the concluding chapter of the DC Animated Movie Universe and tells the story of the Justice League being brutally defeated when they face Darkseid on his home world of Apokolips. Darkseid is nothing if not cruel in his victory, slaughtering many heroes in his devastating conquest of Earth, placing numerous others like Batman under his mind control, and de-powering Superman with liquid Kryptonite. Though Apokolips War shows the heroes rally to defeat Darkseid and save Earth, the movie does not hold back in the slightest in showing the horror of what Darkseid does to the League and Earth.\nRelated: Every DC Animated Universe Movie Ranked Worst To Best\n While Batman v Superman provided a harrowing glimpse into the post-apocalyptic Knightmare, Zack Snyder's Justice League features two, and it truly is as hellish a future vision as any superhero movie has featured. The Knightmare of Zack Snyder's Justice League shows a future in which Darkseid (Ray Porter) conquers Earth, kills Lois Lane (Amy Adams), and turns Superman (Henry Cavill) into his minion with the Anti-Life Equation. With Darkseid turning the entire planet into a wasteland, the Knightmare more than lives up to its name, with Snyder's unmade Justice League sequels having planned to show the efforts of Batman (Ben Affleck) to undo the Knightmare future in order to save Earth.\n The Dark Knight features one of the most brutal yet hidden death scenes in any comic book movie. After kidnapping Lau (Chin Han), the money man for Gotham's crime bosses, and amassing half of their funds in a cargo ship, Heath Ledger's Joker simply lights the huge pile of money on fire - with a tied up Lau sitting right at the top. The Joker, of course, is completely indifferent to the fact that Lau is being burned alive just feet away from him, and between that and the fact that Lau's death happens off-screen makes it one of the Clown Prince of Crime's most disturbing murders.\nRELATED: 10 DC Movie Deaths Nobody Thought Would Last (That Actually Did)\n Danny DeVito's Penguin is portrayed as a thoroughly revolting monster in Batman Returns, but the movie takes a sharp turn in its third act with Oswald Cobblepott's death scene. After a failed attempt to kill Batman (Michael Keaton), the Penguin gurgles, \"I'll murder you momentarily, but first I need a cold drink of ice water\" before keeling over dead. With his emperor Penguin giving Oswald a makeshift funeral procession, the Penguin's death scene is still a ruthlessly bitter ending to Batman Returns that surely traumatized a lot of children upon its release.\n Todd Phillips's Joker presented a new take on Mr. J as impoverished clown Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a man pushed over the edge after the lifetime of plight and mockery he's experienced. After talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) uses a video of Arthur's failed attempt at stand-up comedy to mock him, Arthur accepts an invite to be interviewed, only to show up in clown make-up as \"Joker\" and confess to some previous murders, before shooting Murray on camera. To Arthur, mistreating the downtrodden like him will eventually cause society to \"get what you f---ing deserve!\" which makes the moment he finally snaps in Joker the most horrifying DC movie moment ever.\nBrad Curran is a Features Writer and Interviewer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "21-Year-Old Sports Movie Gets Unexpected Sequel Update", "date": "2023-10-10 20:02:04", "text": "A modern classic sports movie released in 2002 receives an unexpected sequel update from its director, who says they are considering an idea.\nBend It Like Beckham director Gurinder Chadha says she has an idea for a sequel. Released in 2002, the sports movie follows two ambitious girls, Jess (Parminder Nagra) and Jules (Keira Knightley), who pursue careers in professional football despite the disapproval of their parents. Bend It Like Beckham was a bona fide critical success, receiving praise for its light-hearted tone along with its undercurrent of social commentary on Indian culture. The movie also made $76.6 million at the box office, making it the highest-grossing association football film ever made.\nNow, 21 years after Bend It Like Beckham was released, Chadha hinted that a sequel could be on the way. During a recent interview with Metro, the director revealed that in light of the recent Women's World Cup and the increased interest in women’s football, she is in the early stages of developing an idea for a potential sequel. Read her full comments below:\nWith all this talk of the World Cup and the popularity of women’s football, in the past I haven’t thought about. I never really wanted to make a sequel to the film because I just thought the way Parminder and Keira played it, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Archie Panjabi, I could never really follow that up and create that same magic in the same way. But with the recent success of football, I just feel like I’m starting to percolate an idea for a possible sequel of some kind.\nThe Bend It Like Beckham director, who co-wrote the original movie, says her sequel idea is owed largely to England's recent success during the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. The English national team, nicknamed the Lionesses, made it all the way to the final round of the tournament for the first time in history, but lost in heartbreaking fashion to Spain. A few of the female athletes on the English team say they started playing football after watching Bend It Like Beckham back in 2002. The film clearly carries an enormous legacy, which a sequel could capitalize on.\nThere has been talk of a Bend It Like Beckham sequel before the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. The 2002 film has long been appreciated by the LGBTQ+ community for its discussion of queer themes and symbolic queer undertones. Knightley believes that Jess and Jules should’ve ended up together, and the star has even expressed interest in a lesbian Bend it Like Beckham sequel. Whatever direction a Bend It Like Beckham sequel decides to take, there is clearly an interest in revisiting the beloved characters and themes from the original film.\nSource: Metro\n"}
{"title": "Maestro Review: Bradley Cooper’s Bernstein Biopic Is Artful & Fractured", "date": "2023-10-10 20:07:24", "text": "Maestro is not a biopic of an artist so much as a human artwork, capturing the questions he provokes and the contradictory answers that define him.\nMaestro begins with a quote from its real-life subject, Leonard Bernstein: \"A work of art does not answer questions, it provokes them; and its essential meaning is in the tension between the contradictory answers.\" As a mission statement, I struggled to reconcile it with the film that followed. With 2018's A Star Is Born, Bradley Cooper showed himself to be a filmmaker of striking emotional clarity, and this quality carried over to his second feature — I did not feel like I was being left with questions. Only after thinking about it for some time did I realize Cooper's epigraph does not describe his movie, but his Bernstein. This is not a biopic of an artist so much as a human artwork, capturing the many questions he provokes and the contradictory answers that define him. Seeing it in this light has helped me appreciate the project as a whole more than I did at the time, when it spoke to me only in pieces.\nMaestro is most interested in the relationship between Bernstein (Cooper) and Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan), to whom, I should note, the opening quote could also apply. They meet one night at a party and instantly connect. Lenny has already had the tipping point of his rise to fame, when he was asked to conduct the New York Philharmonic with just hours notice after that day's guest conductor fell ill. Felicia, an actor, hasn't yet, and is the understudy in a Broadway play. But they recognize in each other a kindred potential to be and do many things, which draws them to one another. For a while, Cooper shows them in parallel, capturing their elation as audiences applaud his conducting and her acting. But, as the film leaps through time, rendering their lives a mosaic of moments, Felicia is gradually subsumed by their marriage. She still acts, we hear, but her place on camera is soon in the wings, listening as her husband is lauded as one of the most significant, multifaceted artists in the world.\nThe nature of this arc, and indeed of their entire marriage, is one of those questions defined by contradictions. Lenny and Felicia are at various stages joyously united and bitterly divided. They give each other strength, and sap each other's energy. Theirs is a committed, lifetime bond, but Lenny still needs to form connections with others; Felicia allows him his freedom without judgment, but resents him for it. Lenny's affairs and fluid sexuality function like an open secret (fittingly oxymoronic), and he simultaneously stays his authentic self by living a kind of lie. And, just Bernstein prefigured, it is through this push-and-pull that we find understanding. Their love makes sense to us, even if it seems like it shouldn't. This is, naturally, a feast for the performers, and Cooper and Mulligan are both excellent in their roles.\nThey each walk a delicate line to keep their choices open to our interpretation. For example, in one early scene, Lenny runs excitedly to introduce Felicia to David Oppenheim (Matt Bomer), who Lenny was in a relationship with when we first met these characters. The camera cuts between Mulligan's face, smiling brightly, and Bomer's, struggling to hide the pain visible in his eyes. There has been no indication that Lenny has formally left David, who showed him such tenderness in an earlier scene, nor that Felicia has been fully informed of who she was meeting. As the frame lingers on Bomer, we hear Lenny say, \"Perhaps I've been insensitive,\" but David assures him everything is quite alright. I cannot say, from Cooper's intonation, whether Lenny was genuinely unaware of how this would feel for David, or had done it knowingly. Felicia will ascribe both innocence and malice to his behavior across the runtime, but what's important for Maestro is that both possibilities remain in play.\nThis sequence stuck with me, as have a few others, and I credit the actors (and their direction and framing) for locking me in. Cooper's camera shows such interest in their faces (another strength carried over from his debut), and he catches nuances of expression that filled me with emotion — Mulligan is most often responsible, but Bomer really does leave an impression with minimal screen time. Otherwise, my chief viewing state was one of admiration, not unlike how you might feel standing in an art gallery. I would imagine, with the way Maestro sometimes goes for the big swell, that this consequence of Cooper's approach was unintended. Though I see the project's aim better now than I did, I experienced the movie as fractured, missing the emotional thread I wanted to bind it all together.\nThat's not so say admiration isn't a valid artistic experience; there's a great deal to enjoy about Maestro on an aesthetic level. The cinematography by Matthew Libatique, who gets to photograph sections in both sharp black-and-white and rich color, is some of the best I've seen this year. If I had to pick one reason to see this in theaters before it lands on Netflix, it would be to enjoy how beautiful everything looks on the biggest screen possible. The makeup and prosthetics by Kazu Hiro that transform Cooper into Bernstein at various ages are some of the best I've seen, ever. A wave of controversy about the non-Jewish Cooper wearing a false nose to play the Jewish Bernstein, based largely on an unflattering angle of young Lenny in the Maestro trailer, prompted Kazu Hiro to issue an apology for unintentionally causing offense. Whatever your stance on the role identity should play in Hollywood casting, actually seeing his work should make it clear how unfortunate it was that it was ever accused of something as base as racialized caricature.\nThere's much more to talk about - a testament to the movie's thoughtful construction. It will likely speak to some more than it has to me. But, as a second film, it does affirm Cooper's talent behind the camera, especially as a director of actors. I hope he continues to allow them, and the human moments they capture, to remain his lodestar, rather than following a path I can see branching out from Maestro that leads, for me at least, to more definitive museum pieces.\nMaestro releases in limited theaters on November 22 and becomes available to stream on Netflix December 20. The film is 129 minutes long and is rated R for some language and drug use.\n"}
{"title": "Lord Zedd’s New Evil Ranger In Power Rangers Is Even Scarier Than Tommy's Green Ranger", "date": "2023-10-10 20:20:26", "text": "Lord Zedd has a new Evil Power Ranger 30 years after he commanded Rita Repulsa to make Tommy Oliver into the iconic Mighty Morphin Green Ranger.\nPower Rangers’ Lord Zedd has a new Evil Ranger in Power Rangers Cosmic Fury, and this new villain managed to be as scary as the Mighty Morphin Green Ranger, if not more. Power Rangers Cosmic Fury celebrated the franchise’s 30th anniversary with a nostalgia-filled season that revisited beloved friends and foes. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Blue Ranger Billy Cranston was the mentor to a new generation of Rangers who now had to take on the Emperor of Evil Lord Zedd.\nCosmic Fury brought Power Rangers full circle in many ways, including with the addition of a new Evil Ranger. While Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ran for three seasons and had hundreds of episodes, the “Green With Evil” arc from season 1 is still remembered as the highlight of the show. There have been multiple Evil Rangers in the Power Rangers timeline, but the newest example might be one of the best.\nPower Rangers Cosmic Fury’s Ollie, the Dino Fury Blue Ranger, became one of Lord Zedd’s generals at the beginning of the show. Lord Zedd had previously brainwashed Ollie in Dino Fury season 2 and made the Blue Ranger into one of many Power Rangers’ evil Rangers. Ollie was able to break free of the bad guys’ magic in Dino Fury, but he was turned again in Cosmic Fury episode 1. The same magic that had once turned Ollie evil was used again against the Blue Ranger, who then became loyal to Zedd. Ollie lost his Dino Fury powers, but he would soon gain a new form.\nWhereas the Power Rangers gained new morphers and powers created by Billy, Ollie was given a new morphing device by Lord Zedd. The Blue Ranger kept his color, but now with a much more sinister suit. Ollie was not the first evil Power Ranger to be created by Lord Zedd, as the Emperor of Evil was directly involved with the creation of the Green Ranger in Mighty Morphin. While Rita was the one to brainwash Tommy Oliver and give him a corrupted power coin, Lord Zedd was the one behind it all. However, unlike Tommy’s five-episode arc, Ollie was an evil Ranger right until Power Rangers Cosmic Fury's ending.\nIn terms of pop culture impact, there is no denying that the Mighty Morphin Green Ranger was far more important than any other Evil Ranger or Extra Ranger in general. It was thanks to the success of Tommy’s Green Ranger story that Power Rangers never abandoned the Evil Ranger trope, having even created original characters to fill this role. That said, from a narrative standpoint, Cosmic Fury’s evil Blue Ranger was arguably scarier than the original Green Ranger, at least from the Rangers’ perspective. Whereas the Mighty Morphin crew barely knew Tommy when he turned evil, Ollie had been a Power Ranger for two years.\nRelated: What Is The Next Power Rangers Season After Cosmic Fury?\nThe Power Rangers were friends with Ollie since Dino Fury season 1, meaning that having to fight him multiple times during Cosmic Fury could not have been a worse experience. In addition, the Green Ranger was only an obstacle during a very specific arc, and even still, his redemption happened not too long after his introduction. Cosmic Fury's Ollie, however, only rejoined the team at the end of the season. Power Rangers’ Evil Rangers are often some of the coolest characters in the franchise, and fortunately, Power Rangers Cosmic Fury gave Lord Zedd a new champion worthy of the classic evil Green Ranger.\n"}
{"title": "Conan The Barbarian: Arnold Schwarzenegger Reveals Dangerous Conditions Filming 41-Year-Old Fantasy Epic", "date": "2023-10-10 20:24:18", "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger reveals the concerning shooting conditions he faced when filming Conan the Barbarian, one of the actor's breakout roles.\nArnold Schwarzenegger reveals the dangerous shooting conditions that happened behind the scenes of Conan the Barbarian. The 41-year-old fantasy epic stars Schwarzenegger as a boy who is turned into a slave after a warlord murders his parents and tribe. Made in 1982, Conan the Barbarian is considered one of the actor’s breakout action roles, as the movie predated Schwarzenegger’s other ‘80s standout, The Terminator. The fantasy action was followed up by a 1984 sequel and a Conan the Barbarian 3 starring Schwarzenegger has been rumored.\nReflecting on Conan the Barbarian, Schwarzenegger reveals the grueling filming conditions during his time on set. In an excerpt from his new self-help book Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life (via Insider), Schwarzenegger claimed that he had to complete nasty stunt work, including biting “a real, dead vulture that required [he] wash [his] mouth out with alcohol after each take.” Highlighting the perilous nature of situations that saw Schwarzenegger bouldering and outrunning dogs, the actor got wounded early on during the shoot, such that he “tore a gash on [his] back that required forty stitches.” Check out the full quote from Schwarzenegger below:\n“I learned to ride horses and camels and elephants. I learned how to jump from large rocks, how to climb and swing from long ropes, how to fall from a height. I basically went to another vocational school, this one for aspiring action heroes. Then on top of that, Milius [Conan's director] had me doing all kinds of terrible sh*t. I crawled through rocks, take after take, until my forearms bled. I ran from wild dogs that managed to catch me and pull me into a thorn bush. I bit a real, dead vulture that required I wash my mouth out with alcohol after each take. (PETA would have a field day with that one). On one of the first days of filming, I tore a gash on my back that required forty stitches.”\nWhile Conan the Barbarian’s content aligns with such stunt work, the tasks Schwarzenegger was asked to complete are way out of line with what would be acceptable now. Forty-one years later, it is hard to imagine any actor would be required to bite a scavenger such as a vulture, which could carry copious diseases. Based on the rest of the filming description, the “horses and camels and elephants” that Schwarzenegger rode also may have experienced questionable treatment.\nRelated: Why Conan The Barbarian Proved So Many People Wrong About Schwarzenegger\nThis isn’t to say that there are no present-day cases where actors are asked to complete intense tasks like that of Schwarzenegger in Conan the Barbarian. Actor Leonardo DiCaprio famously ate raw bison liver on the set of The Revenant. While this does not sound as grotesque as a vulture per se, DiCaprio’s efforts are nonetheless a gross human-animal interaction on a more recent set.\nIn his writing, Schwarzenegger mentions PETA, which stands for the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. As an organization, PETA is often quick to contest animal treatment on screen, including recently with Gladiator 2 and Jackass Forever. PETA certainly would “have a field day” if they had known about the conditions of Conan the Barbarian, and based on Schwarzenegger’s descriptions of the set, that may have been for the best.\nSource: Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life (via Insider)\n"}
{"title": "These 16 Planets Are The Key To Star Wars' Future", "date": "2023-10-10 20:31:16", "text": "Ahsoka has identified 16 planets holding key significance in the Star Wars galaxy with importance to the ancient past and the near future.\nThanks to Ahsoka, 16 planets in the known galaxy (and beyond) have been identified as crucial worlds for the future of the Star Wars franchise. As seen in the credits of the new show, the names of several different worlds can be translated from ancient Star Wars text, confirmed to be part of the migration routes belonging to the intergalactic star whales known as purrgil. This signifies their key importance in the ancient past and likely the near future.\nIn the established Star Wars canon, the purrgil and their migration routes were used by early space farers to safely map out the known galaxy. It's now been confirmed that these worlds were first discovered by early civilizations such as the Nightsisters and Zeffo long before the First Jedi. As such, these planets could have major roles in the upcoming \"Dawn of the Jedi\" movie from director James Mangold set 25,000 years before the prequels. Additionally, if extragalactic adventures continue these worlds are perhaps known by other galaxies' civilizations who may have also used the purrgil. Here are all 16 planets from Ahsoka's credits and their histories.\nThe planet Arcana was the world containing an ancient stronghold belonging to the Force witches known as the Nightsisters. This was where Ahsoka Tano first found the star map leading to Grand Admiral Thrawn and his extragalactic exile as seen in Ahsoka's premiere. It's also where Ahsoka fought the HK assassin droids sent by the Nightsister Morgan Elsbeth to retrieve the map. Considering the world's connection to the ancient origins of the Nightsisters, it follows that the world is part of the purrgil migration routes as the Nightsisters used the whales to relocate to the known Star Wars galaxy from their original homeworld of Peridea.\nThere is very little known about the new planet identified as Ierne in Ahsoka's credits sequence. Other than being part of the purrgil migration routes, Ierne is confirmed to be relatively close to Arcana in the Star Wars galaxy. Perhaps it will be featured in future Star Wars projects down the line.\nGarel was first featured in the Star Wars Rebels animated series. Located in the Outer Rim in the Lothal sector, the world was temporarily used by the Rebel cell known as the Spectres and Phoenix Squadron during the Empire's reign as a staging ground during their efforts to sabotage Imperial operations. However, the Rebels were eventually discovered by the Empire and were forced to flee.\nThe homeworld of Jedi Ezra Bridger, Lothal was a key world the Spectres sought to protect from the Empire as seen in Star Wars Rebels, though their continued presence also made the world a key target. To that end, it was on Lothal that Ezra used his bond with a pod of purrgil to send both himself and Grand Admiral Thrawn into hyperspace to be exiled for years outside the known galaxy as confirmed by Ahsoka. Following the Liberation of Lothal, Sabine Wren chose to stay, honoring Ezra's sacrifice and ensuring that his home would continue to be protected.\nRelated: How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order\nLocated in the Outer Rim, Mandalore is also one of the planets identified in Ahsoka's credits. Home to the ancient warrior-clan race known as the Mandalorians, the world has a vast history in the Star Wars galaxy. This includes their wars with the Jedi during the Old Republic, the Siege of Mandalore during The Cone Wars, their near-genocide during the reign of the Empire known as the Night of a Thousand Tears, and the recent Reclamation of Mandalore seen in The Mandalorian season 3 led by Bo-Katan Kryze and Din Djarin, resulting in the defeat of Moff Gideon and his Imperial Remnant forces who'd turned the world into a hidden base.\nAgamar was the world most notably featured in Star Wars Rebels where the Spectres discovered a legion of Separatist battle droids who were unaware the Clone Wars had ended. Following some initial conflict, Ezra Bridger, his master Kanan Jarrus, and Clone Commander Rex joined forces with the droids against the Empire who arrived to wipe them all out. Agamar is also located in the Outer Rim Territories.\nThe planet Yavin and its jungle moon of Yavin 4 are best known for being the backdrop of the Rebellion's attack on the first Death Star as seen in A New Hope. Serving as the first significant victory over the Empire, the Battle of Yavin serves as a key marker on the Star Wars timeline with events before and after given dates in relation to when the battle took place. Additionally, the ancient Massassi temples used by the Rebellion confirm the world's significance to early civilizations.\nRelated: New Star Wars Movies: Every Upcoming Movie & Release Date\nFollowing the Nightsisters' relocation to the known galaxy from Peridea, Dathomir became their new homeworld. It's here that the witches continued their matriarchal society, one that eventually produced Darth Maul who'd become Palpatine's first Sith apprentice during the prequel trilogy. Likewise, the majority of the Nightsisters were wiped about by General Grievous during the Clone Wars, a result of their ongoing conflict with Count Dooku. Now, Grand Admiral Thrawn has come to Dathomir following his return to the known galaxy. Allied with the Great Mothers, it seems Thrawn may use Dathomir as a new base of operations as he continues to make use of the Nightsisters' dark magicks.\nLocated near the Galactic Core, Corellia is a primary world responsible for the vast exploration and expansion of the civilized galaxy. Featuring vast shipyards, Corellia is most notably the homeworld of Han Solo as well as where the Millennium Falcon was built. Seen most prominently in Solo: A Star Wars Story, Corellia was also recently featured in Ahsoka as well where it was revealed Elsbeth had been building a massive hyperspace ring to bring back Thrawn, right under the noses of the New Republic.\nFamous for its unique hanging cities, Cato Nemoidia is one of the galaxy's Colony Worlds. Despite being the base of operations for the Trade Federation and its connection to the Separatist Alliance, Cato Nemoidia held an alleged position of neutrality during the Clone Wars. Cato Nemoidia was also the world in which Jedi Master Plo Koon was shot down in his starfighter during Order 66 as seen in Revenge of the Sith.\nOne of the galaxy's Core Worlds, the planet Duro is believed to be one of the first worlds to have developed hyperdrive technology. This makes sense considering their connection to the purrgil migration routes. It stands to reason the Duros were among the first to follow and study the star whales in Star Wars' ancient past. Some of the most famous Duros include the infamous bounty hunter Cad Bane as well as the Rebellion's Shriv Suurgav.\nFirst seen in The Rise of Skywalker, the desert world of Pasaana is located in the galaxy's Expansion Region. It's here where the Sith assassin Ochi of Bestoon met his demise shortly after killing Rey Skywalker's parents, still in possession of the Sith dagger that was sought after by Rey and her Resistance allies years later. It's also where Lando Calrissian took residence in search of his missing daughter.\nKnown as the Galactic Center, the city-wide planet of Coruscant has served as the galaxy's capital during multiple ages of the Republic as well as Palpatine's Empire. As such, it follows that Coruscant will continue to play a key role during the New Republic era. However, the Core World may have a dark fate considering the fact that the New Republic eventually moves its capital to Hosnian Prime as seen during the sequel trilogy, effectively breaking a galactic tradition that had spanned millennia. Perhaps Thrawn's return will explain the Coruscant mystery.\nRelated: Upcoming Star Wars Shows In 2023: Story, Casts & Everything We Know\nSeatos was the world in which Morgan and her Dark Jedi mercenaries were able to get the coordinates to Peridea thanks to the recovered star map. Likewise, it was also where Ahsoka experienced her Force vision with Anakin before bonding with a pod of star whales who helped her follow Thrawn's agents to the extragalactic world. Seatos was also located in the Outer Rim Territories.\nOdyn is another new planet introduced to the Star Wars galaxy, though it was only referred to by name in the Ahsoka credits. Furthermore, it looks as though Odyn may be one of Seatos' moons based on the credits sequence. It's also worth noting that Odyn looks to be a variation of Odin, Nose mythology's king of the gods. As such, there may be a connection to Baylan Skoll and Shin Hati, seeing as how Sköll and Hati are the names of Norse mythology's twin wolf gods of the sun and moon. Regardless, naming a planet after the king of the gods likely means the planet will have future significance.\nLocated in another galaxy, Peridea was confirmed as the world where the star whales go to die, the end of their migration route with the planet's rings comprised solely of their bones. The former witch kingdom of the Nightsters was where Ezra and Thrawn ended up for nearly a decade after the series finale of Star Wars Rebels. Now, Ahsoka Tano and Sabine are the ones stranded following Ahsoka's finale along with Baylan and Shin. However, Baylan is still on his quest for major power, having discovered Peridea's connection to the Force gods of Mortis which will undoubtedly give Peridea a major role in the future of the Star Wars franchise.\n"}

During the chaos of Winston's siege on The Continental, Cormac enters an elevator and rides it to the operations room of the hotel. Charon explains that no one knows where the operations room is and that it is a manager's privilege to know the exact location. However, before The Continental's elevator operator dies from wounds given to him by Cormac, he whispers the number 13 to Charon.\nThis helps Winston and Charon deduce that the operations room is located on the 13th floor of The Continental, despite the hotel not having a 13th floor. This element of the hotel is not mentioned at all in any of the John Wick films. While the inner workings of the hotel such as the formation of bounty targets and various other services are detailed, the 13th floor remained a secret until the events of The Continental.\nStemming from the 13th floor, another secret found in The Continental is the hotel's self-destruct function. As Cormac devolves further into madness and is consumed by his need for revenge against Winston in The Continental episode 3, he forgets about the High Table and his retrieval of the coin press, instead activating the hotel's self-destruct countdown. This is another privilege of the operations room awarded only to the manager and the operations room's director which begins a countdown that will eventually bring down the entire hotel and everyone in it.\nGiven the importance of Cormac to Winston Scott's origin story, it is surprising that the former's management of the building is not mentioned in any of the John Wick films. Cormac's tyranny as well as his psychotic, violent nature are left unspoken in John Wick even by Winston who plays an integral role in all four films. While this makes sense given the lack of relevance of Cormac to John's journey, it is surprising that Cormac's horrible management showcased in The Continental is left mostly secret by its sequel series.\nAfter enacting The Continental's self-destruct countdown, Cormac attempts to flee by taking an elevator to an underground railway line. While Winston and KD eventually track him down and kill him, his plan is still shown. Cormac was planning to use an escape pod that would take him away from the hotel as it exploded. The pod pulls up next to Winston after Cormac's death as a voice can be heard saying \"Mr O'Connor, your escape pod has arrived.\" This element of The Continental is not mentioned in any of the John Wick movies proving it as another secret for the show.\nThe core MacGuffin of The Continental's plot was the coin press Frankie stole in the opening heist of the show's first episode. Much of the series centered on Cormac obsessively chasing down the coin press as well as the Adjudicator of the High Table. In The Continental episode 3, the true power of the coin press is revealed in that it allows anyone who holds it to easily infiltrate any of The Continental's branches across the world such as Mazie's Bowery agents.\nThroughout John Wick, the power of The Continental's currency is shown at length. From the different guns, weapons, and ammo John can purchase with them to other services like tailoring and accommodation at the hotel chain, the currency of the John Wick world is showcased. However, the John Wick films do not detail how these coins are created - at least pertaining to the New York Continental - meaning The Continental's focus on the coin press is yet another secret of the titular hotel that is absent from its connected film series.\nBoth The Continental episode 1 and episode 3 feature a secret of the hotel that was not highlighted in any of the John Wick films. During Frankie's heist and Winston's siege in the first and third episodes of the show respectively, a red light is activated within The Continental. This red light indicates to all residents that for as long as the light is flashing, violence is permitted on Continental grounds. This goes against the primary rule of all Continental branches and allows for some of The Continental's biggest, most exciting action sequences.\nIn the four John Wick movies, violence is rarely shown on Continental grounds given the main rule of the hotel. As such, the red light is not used in any of the films meaning it was a secret of The Continental from the 1970s. The closest the John Wick movies come to using the red light is in John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum in which Charon activates green, flashing neon lights as the agents of the High Table engage in a firefight on the premises of the New York Continental. That said, this is slightly different from the red light featured in The Continental.\nIn the John Wick films, the titular assassin strikes an accord with the Bowery King on multiple occasions. While Winston and the Bowery King are shown to be aware of one another's businesses and have somewhat of an alliance, it is mainly through John that the Bowery King is involved in the John Wick films. However, The Continental established that Winston had an alliance with the Bowery as far back as the 1970s. While not the Bowery King himself, Mazie and her Bowery agents aided Winston in taking control of The Continental, proving that the latter's alliance with the Bowery was kept secret for much of the John Wick franchise.\n"}

An off-the-cuff remark allows the villain to express his feelings about DC's other Joker.\nWarning! Spoilers ahead for The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #11!The Joker really isn't a fan of one recent trend in the DC Universe that's wearing down the uniqueness of his character. The Clown Prince of Crime says what some fans are thinking as he goes to war with a copycat.\nIn The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #11 by Matthew Rosenberg, Carmine Di Giandomenico, and Romulo Fajardo Jr., the battle between the DC Universe's two Jokers is intensifying. As chaos reigns throughout the city, Gotham's Joker begins kidnapping people for some unknown purpose. Meanwhile, LA's Joker is tearing the city apart and has his people search high and low to find the supposedly fake Joker.\nUnfortunately, morale is wearing down among LA Joker's crew as Clayface calls it quits. Joker insists that everyone get back to work finding the impostor (while taking the time to kill a henchman to prove a point). The Joker heads back into his base where he finds his associate Killer Moth watching the news, who insists that Joker take a look at the current report. The station reports on a copycat Joker that's wandering around naked after crashing a subway train, causing LA Joker to remark how all his doppelganger is ruining his credibility.\nFor the last several months, the DC Universe has been plagued by two Jokers: One in Gotham and another in Los Angeles. Both Jokers are sure they're the real thing and, as such, have been doing their best to find the other, kill him, and resume their life as the sole Joker. It was a mystery where the other Joker emerged until Gotham's Joker remembered that the new Joker was created after a henchman breathed in Joker Venom, inspiring the original to have the henchman surgically altered to resemble the Joker.\nBoth Jokers absolutely hate the fact that another is running around. What's interesting about LA Joker's insult is that it perfectly captures the problem with having more than one Harlequin of Hate. It makes the Joker less of a threat and more of a novelty. While it's certainly fun to see multiple clowns trying to kill each other and it's made for a good mystery, it doesn't serve the character well to have numerous copies of himself. As long as there's more than one Joker, he can never be taken seriously again.\nEver since the Black Label book Three Jokers, the Joker being more than one person has become an evergreen gimmick that's stuck with the character. While it was interesting at first, copies of the villain have only served to hinder his character. It was far scarier knowing there was only one giggling maniac haunting the DC Universe. Having more than one at a time lessens the unique threat of the Joker if just anyone can become him. Hopefully, it won't be long before the DC Universe is back down to just one Joker. Because until that day comes, the cackling criminal just won't be the same kind of threat he used to be. The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #11 is on sale now.\n"}

With more than ten songs, we break down all the songs & when they play throughout the horror/time travel film.\nWarning: This post contains spoilers for Totally Killer\nTotally Killer is primarily set in the 80s and its song selection reflects the era. Directed by Nahnatchka Khan from a screenplay by David Matalon, Sasha Perl-Raver, and Jen D’Angelo, Totally Killer combines horror and slasher elements with time travel, bringing a healthy mix of Back to the Future and Scream with some 80s nostalgia thrown in for good measure. Totally Killer’s music selection is a big part of what makes it whole.\nMichael Andrews composed the original score, and Toko Nagata served as music supervisor on the film, selecting the songs that play throughout the film. One of the songs that appears on the soundtrack — “The World is Ours” by The Werewolves — is an original piece written specifically for the slasher time travel film. And considering Kiernan Shipka’s Jamie Hughes travels back to 1987 to stop the Sweet Sixteen Killer, Totally Killer’s soundtrack includes plenty of well-known songs from the era, like Chris De Burgh’s “Lady in Red” and Bananarama’s cover of Shocking Blue’s “Venus.”\nHere is every song in Totally Killer, in order:\n“The World is Ours” by The Werewolves - “The World is Ours” plays at the start of Totally Killer, in the scene that introduces Jamie and her mom Pam’s relationship. Jamie is playing the song in her room while getting ready to go out and Pam tells her to turn it down. The song plays again about an hour into the film while Amelia is trying to adjust the time machine, and Chris interrupts her work to ask if it’s ready for his own nefarious purposes.\n“Taleen Kalie” by Vague Flesh - This song plays when Chris is first talking to Jamie after her mother’s murder, and he tells her that Blake doesn’t like the true crime podcaster and has expressed as much. This is especially the case considering Blake thinks far more highly of Chris’ Pulitzer-winning father.\n“Venus” by Bananarama - “Venus” plays after Jamie fights the Sweet 16 Killer and travels back to 1987 in the photo booth time machine. When she opens the curtain, Jamie sees a packed fairground with people sporting a different style than what she’s used to.\n“Hearts Don’t Break” by Lizzie Borden & The Axes - “Hearts Don’t Break” plays when Jamie makes her way to her high school and enrolls herself after speaking with the office receptionist, who quickly hands her a class schedule and sends her on her way.\n“He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not” by Bob Crawford - This song plays when Jamie and Lauren arrive at Tiffany’s party. Randall prevents Doug from entering the house because he doesn’t fit in, which serves as a hint that Doug is essentially an outcast with the group of people he stalks and later kills.\n“Bizarre Love Triangle” by New Order - “Bizarre Love Triangle” plays during Tiffany’s party, where the teens are seen dancing, drinking, and having a good time. The scene is a bit intense because it’s right before Tiffany’s death, and Jamie has yet to find her to stop her murder.\n“Lady in Red” by Chris De Burgh - “Lady in Red” is heard during Tiffany’s death scene, in which the Sweet 16 Killer comes out of the closet and stabs her 16 times. At the same time this is happening, Jamie is attempting to break into Tiffany’s parents’ bedroom to save her.\n“Say You’re the Only One” by Sierra - This song plays in the car ride on the way to the cabin when Jamie admits she hasn’t been getting much sleep.\n“Under Control” by Brian Carr - “Under Control” plays at the cabin where Jamie breaks down the rules about never being alone now that the killer is out there.\n“Let the Music Play” by Shannon - This song is heard when the killer is attempting to murder Heather at the cabin. He turns up the music so that his stabbing isn’t heard.\n“The Killing Moon” by Echo & The Bunnymen - “The Killing Moon” plays near the end of Totally Killer, before Jamie’s plan to catch the Sweet 16 Killer. It’s also when Kara says that the killings weren’t happening until Jamie showed up.\n“Littlе Bit ‘o Soul” by The Linda Lindas - This song plays after Jamie returns from 1987, but many things have changed in her present timeline, including her name and family status. Lauren gives Jamie a notebook to flip through to see all the changes, and this is when “Little Bit ‘o Soul” is heard.\nThe Totally Killer soundtrack — featuring all songs — is available to listen to on Spotify and Amazon Music. However, while the songs listed above are on the soundtrack, they appear alongside other songs on the playlists, as Prime Video has not released an official Totally Killer soundtrack for purchase. But since the film uses popular songs, they’re not hard to find online or on any individual music streaming service.\n"}
{"title": "In The Fire Director Conor Allyn On Exploring Science Vs. Faith & Working With Amber Heard", "date": "2023-10-10 21:07:43", "text": "In The Fire director Conor Allyn discusses the dichotomy between science and faith in his movie, and how at home Amber Heard felt with her character.\nScience and religion are pitted against each other once more in filmmaker Conor Allyn's In The Fire, which arrives in theaters and on digital platforms on October 13. Though the movie takes place in a remote Latin American town at the turn of the 20th century, its themes concerning fear of the unknown and ostracization within society remain relevant today. Allyn directed the thriller from a screenplay he co-wrote with Pascal Borno and Silvio Muraglia.\nIn The Fire introduces Dr. Grace Burnham (played by Amber Heard), a psychologist who travels to a remote plantation in hopes of helping a young boy named Martin (Lorenzo McGovern Zaini) heal from his emotional scars. Though she is convinced there is a medical diagnosis and thus possible treatment for his strange behavior, the villagers — including the priest, Father Antonio (Luca Calvani) — refuse to accept any explanation outside of the child being cursed by the devil and exhibit supernatural powers. Eduardo Noriega costars as Nicolas Marquez, Martin's father and a recent widower whose grief intersects with Grace's loneliness.\nRelated: 10 Indie Films That Launched The Careers Of Major Directors\nScreen Rant spoke to Allyn about his work on In The Fire, from building out the superstitions of the mysterious Latin American town to deciding how best to approach Martin's mental health from scientific and religious angles. The director also praised Amber Heard's dedication to the role, and how she connected to her character on multiple levels.\nScreen Rant: I thought In the Fire was a really interesting story, and I was wondering how you approached that cultural clash between the Marquez family and Dr. [Grace] Burnham. Especially because there's that bilingual aspect of the film, where a lot of the characters are speaking Spanish throughout.\nConor Allyn: We definitely wanted any way that we could make the boy Martin, or Grace—Amber's character, the doctor—more of a fish out of water, more of an outcast, was a good thing. I think whenever you're making a movie you want to do some world-building. It's been a lot of movies made, so finding unique space is difficult sometimes. I've traveled quite a bit in South America, and I love Westerns. There's a great Western culture in South America, sort of Gaucho culture. And I thought, 'Okay, let's create a new space for this world here. And we'll do it in South America. It'll be like a Western, but in a totally different space.'\nAnd it really helped with all the other aspects of the movie. We have the science versus religion. Latin America is an incredibly religious place where the sort of extreme viewpoint of that would be really evident. And so for Amber's character of Grace to come into this really foreign place, where she just doesn't belong, doesn't speak the language. She's a doctor, and everyone here thinks the priest is the person who should be giving us all the facts in life, and really creating that distance.\nSpeaking of that distance and world-building, did you discuss what the town was like before Martin became a part of it? How much superstition was there that he then added to?\nConor Allyn: I mean, certainly one of the points of the movie is that whenever anything goes wrong in this town, this remote place, people need someone to blame. You make a period movie, you want to be relevant to society now, and I have, unfortunately, I think we all still do this. There's a line in the movie that talks about, before all this, this place was an Eden; it was beautiful. It was someplace you'd want to come to, and things have gone wrong. Plague, and the crops fail, the rains don't come. Various things. Some specific and some sort of atmospheric. And for whatever reason, Martin gets blamed for these things. Maybe because he has some sort of supernatural powers, or maybe because s--t happens, and we look for something to explain it away.\nAs far as the superstition aspect of it is, I think people lean farther into that when things aren't going well. You know, when everything's hunky dory, we're not leaning on superstition. But as things start to get away from us, and we want answers, sometimes you gotta reach for those answers. And you reach into the wrong places.\nHow did you shape the settings? Like I think it was filmed in Italy and Guatemala, is that correct? How do you turn that into Colombia?\nConor Allyn: One interesting thing is it wasn't really meant to be Colombia, per se. It was meant to be a little bit more mysteriously remote on purpose. Sort of a romantic feel to it. 'Is this place real? Is it not?' Because some things happen in the movie that, make us question what's real. As far as how we we placed it, in southern Italy, they have these old fortified farmhouses from the 15th and 16th centuries. So we basically rented—for a very reasonable number for an indie movie—a 500-year-old farmhouse that was Spanish actually. Because southern Italy was part of Spain, or some ancient part of it.\nI rented this really beautiful farmhouse, shot most of the scenes, the interiors, the stuff around the the Marquez family farm there. And then when we went to Guatemala, we did the townscape and stuff that was out at the cemetery and out in the fields and the volcanoes and all that stuff. Which we're actively exploding during [filming]. It wasn't scripted that [there] was supposed to be like, volcanic activity in the movie. And we were shooting in Antigua, which is the old colonial capital of Guatemala, UNESCO World Heritage Site, an amazing place. And it's it's a town in the shadow of three volcanoes, all of which are active, and several of which were active during our production, which was very apropos for superstition.\nI love Amber Heard, and I thought she was great. What was the collaboration process with her to nail down Grace, what she stands for and how she's portrayed? \nConor Allyn: I don't want to say it was easy, because we spent a lot of time working on it. But Amber really naturally fit this character. And it is not a coincidence that she connected with a character who goes through what this character goes through in the movie. Grace in the movie is this sort of fearless truth-teller, who has great intentions and goes to this small town and wants to help this boy, and isn't believed. Because she's a woman, and because she's a doctor in a town that's led by a priest. Because she's a psychologist at a time when psychology wasn't respected.\nAmber herself has gone through so much of that. In the movie she's dragged through the public square and whipped for some of the things she says; you know, sounds very familiar to her life. And so she was connected to this character from an early point. And I think our main work was kind of trying to assemble how she—where she starts in the movie—is kind of an icy doctor, who doesn't have a lot of maternal emotional instincts. She wants to help this boy as a doctor, not as a mother.\nAnd the kid is strange, and he's disturbed, and he's not emotional either. But over the course of the film, these two unlikely characters do create a bond; an unlikely bond. And she does find these maternal instincts to protect him. Science or no science. And that was something that we probably, from an actor-director standpoint, were working on, like, 'Okay, how, how emotional should I be? How intimate should I be? Am I more of a doctor here? Am I more of a friend?'\nSpeaking of Martin, what research did you do, and what was your approach to how he would be viewed scientifically versus how he would be viewed religiously at that time?\nConor Allyn: Yeah, this was a fun one for me, as a history nerd. And this also has to do with Grace and her skills as a doctor or psychologist at this time. So what we couldn't do was use any modern science. So basically anything written after like, 1895—which is most of the stuff—[was] unusable. So how she approached medicine and how she approached diagnosing Martin and how he was acting, needed to be based on what was available to them at that time. And we also didn't want to use a specific [term]. We didn't want to be like, 'Okay, he's on the spectrum. He's autistic.' We didn't want to be so hyper-specific, especially in a time when those terms weren't available.\nI really liked the chemistry between Amber and Eduardo Noriega, but I did not expect that it would go there. Can you talk about what they saw in each other as characters?\nConor Allyn: I'm glad you brought that up. I was just saying how Amber's character is a doctor; she's not emotional, she doesn't get intimate very easily. And we wanted the intimacy in the movie to be earned and authentic. And with her and Eduardo, who's the boy's father, it's these two very isolated people. She's isolated because all the things we just talked about, physically isolated; but also, she's doing this job, nobody wanted a doctor, nobody was looking for a psychologist back then—really at all. No respect to science, she was a woman. She's an outcast in her own outcast profession.\nAnd this father, his son is the weird kid, the outcast of the community. And because the father has sort of protected his son—not even out of love, but sort of out of honor to his late wife—he's also an outcast in his community. And these are two just really lonely people who kind of start in a really rocky place and find respect for one another. And so they're connecting more out of sort of shared loneliness than it is of like, 'Oh, I love you, I want to be with you forever,'—which is, I think, natural. It's not always a true-love-first-kiss kind of thing, you know? Sometimes it's a little more complex than that with adult romance.\nFinally, the climactic fire—the titular scene—was really great to see. How did you film that? What goes into that fire?\nConor Allyn: Yeah, that was a big one. So we did that in Guatemala. We built a barn that we consequently burned down. So it was a combination of practical fire, and some embellishment with VFX. But I think with fire VFX, it only works if the practical element is there. If there's nothing practical going on, and you just add fire, it looks pretty bad. So we had a lot of practical fire, but you gotta do that safely. The thing was meant to burn, so you got to be careful what you're doing. And we also had actors in the scene, we also had horses in the barn, so there's a lot going on. And then smoke, you know that the smoke would clutter up very quickly, so we have to be sort of letting that out. And also, we wanted some smoke in the scene. Then there was also a part of the barn that starts to collapse while they're in there. So our production designer had created this sort of this movable beam that was not structurally necessary, but looked like it was, and when needed we could just crash it down to the ground. light it on fire and crash it down to the ground.\nYou never quite know with those kinds of scenes. On an indie movie, you don't have time, everything's ambitious and a struggle, but you have to do it safely. And you want to do it well, so that the scene really, the big scenes, you really want them to pop. And I'm glad you like that one, but a lot of work and energy resources [went[ into that one. And it needed to; that's one of those scenes where this movie is constantly asking the audience, 'Did I just see something normal that the kid's being blamed for, or did I just see something supernatural?' Grace is being asked that question; she's being asked to question all of her science. And the audience is being asked the same thing and it will be through her point of view. And so achieving those moments is really important.\nA doctor from New York (Amber Heard) travels to a remote plantation in the 1890s to care for a disturbed boy who seems to have inexplicable abilities. She begins treating the child, but in doing so ignites a war of science versus religion with the local priest who believes the boy is possessed by the Devil and is the reason for all the village's woes.\nIn The Fire opens in select theaters, On Digital and On Demand on October 13.\nSource: Screen Rant Plus\n"}

Set to release on Apple TV Plus next month, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters takes place after the events of 2014's Godzilla, following two siblings who uncover secrets about the mysterious organization known as Monarch. The story will see the siblings encounter Army officer Lee Shaw, who is played by Kurt Russell in the present-day storyline and his son during a section set in the 1950s.\n Now, as the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters release date approaches, Shakman speaks to Collider about the decision to cast the real-life father and son as the same character in different time periods. While not revealing too much of what is in store for Lee Shaw, the director teases that the casting of Kurt and Wyatt Russell works perfectly in the show. Check out Shakman's full comment below:\n\"Certainly, we discussed two different actors. I think that's the usual approach to things. But we had this idea that Kurt Russell and Wyatt Russell, who are often, I think, offered things as father and son, but I don't think they'd ever been offered the same part to play in two different time periods. \n“It just felt like, ‘What an amazing idea,’ and it's so rare. I mean, two actors who are extraordinary on their own, two actors who bear an uncanny resemblance to each other because they’re father and son playing the same part, just felt like an idea that we had to run wholeheartedly at, and they were excited to do it.\n\"Also, it's such a unique fit because Kurt Russell stars in all the movies I love, and since I was a kid, I've been watching him on screen. The idea of Kurt Russell plus Godzilla just feels absolutely, 100% right. He occupies the same awesome space. Then the fact that Wyatt could work so beautifully as the young version of that same character, it just was serendipity, you know, things that we couldn't have planned that the fates made possible for us.\"\nAfter the success of 2014's Godzilla, the MonsterVerse has expanded in a number of exciting ways. In addition to several sequels and an animated show, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters serves as an opportunity to expand the world and lore of the franchise with a more character-driven approach.\nThe casting of both Russells suggests that both time periods will be extensively explored in the series, charting Monarch's early operations in the decade following World War II. As revealed in 2014's Godzilla, the nuclear testing that took place at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific in 1954 was actually an attempt to kill the titular monster, and it's possible that the show will dive into the circumstances surrounding this explosive turning point in the dynamic between kaijus and humans.\nWhile the upcoming show will be connected to the other MonsterVerse movies, it seemingly only features one returning character. As revealed by the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters trailer, John Goodman's Bill Randa will seemingly return as a cameo, with the rest of the cast featuring newcomers like Christopher Heyerdahl, Mari Yamamoto, Qyoko Kudo, Shota Tsuji, Josh Collins, Charlie Hewson, Joe Tippett, and Kiersey Clemons, among others. Thankfully, audiences don't have too long left to wait to see the show for themselves, with Monarch: Legacy of Monsters set to premiere on Apple TV Plus on November 17.\nSource: Collider\n"}

The movie follows Sandy Patterson (Jason Bateman), who tracks down a woman named Diana (McCarthy) after she has stolen his identity in order to bring her to justice and clear his credit. The movie was a financial success, earning $175.4 million off its budget of $35 million, but it was critically panned upon its release. At the time of writing, it has a Metacritic score of 35 out of 100 and an even lower Rotten Tomatoes score of 19%.\nNetflix has now calculated their Top 10 most-viewed English-language movies for the week of October 2 through October 8. Identity Thief is No. 9 on the chart thanks to 3.9 million views, which accumulated a total of 7.3 million hours viewed. The ten-year-old movie has joined a list that also includes contemporary Netflix hits like their new thriller Fair Play, starring Bridgerton's Phoebe Dynevor and Solo: A Star Wars Story's Alden Ehrenreich.\nThere are likely a multitude of reasons why Identity Thief has become a hit on Netflix despite its rotten reputation. The pair of stars at the helm would most likely be the core draw. Bateman has proven a reliable draw for Netflix thanks to his hit crime show Ozark, which recently ended, but McCarthy has also had a career transformation since the movie originally premiered.\nAt the time in 2013, McCarthy was just two years out from her Oscar-nominated turn in Bridesmaids. However, theaters were becoming saturated in Melissa McCarthy comedies, and critics tended to spend the next few years dismissing any movie of hers that didn't feature her reuniting with Bridesmaids director Paul Feig, such as The Heat (66%), Spy (95%), and Ghostbusters (74%). Her non-Feig movies were not received so well, with Identity Thief dipping about as low as her other titles Tammy (24%) and The Boss (22%).\nRelated: Every Melissa McCarthy & Paul Feig Movie Ranked\nHowever, since then McCarthy has branched out into movies outside her typical comedy realm. This includes her dramatic role in the 2018 biopic Can You Ever Forgive Me?, which earned the star her second Oscar nomination, and her recent villainous turn as Ursula in the 2023 live-action remake of The Little Mermaid. Now that audiences have gained some distance from her 2010s run of comedies, it seems that interest in her earlier movies like Identity Thief has been revitalized despite the negative critical reaction.\nSource: Netflix\n"}

The toy line, and the subsequent cartoon, have been relegated to the dustbin of history. In an interview with SuperHeroHype, Nacelle CEO Brian Volk Weiss pointed out the reasons why. First, according to Weiss, the toys had little play value, with suction cups instead of legs. Second, and most tragic, Robo Force was upstaged by the Transformers. Ideal Toys, Robo Force’s original manufacturer, intended for the line to be huge. According to Weiss, Hasbro introduced The Transformers just a few weeks later, and the rest is history.\nNow Robo Force is getting a second shot at life courtesy of the Nacelle Company, one that acknowledges the bum deal the franchise originally got. Nacelle looked at what made the original Robo Force flop so bad and improved on it. No one can say what was running through Ideal’s engineers' heads when they were designing Robo Force, but they missed the mark greatly. Furthermore, as Weiss went on to point out, Robo Force lacked a coherent backstory and Nacelle will be fixing this in their prequel comic. Writer Melissa Flores has given the Robo Force their first ever backstory, one drawing on the property’s real world history.\nRelated: He-Man Turned One '80s Toy Into Pure Nightmare Fuel\nRobo Force is getting a fresh start at Oni. The original problems with Robo Force’s origin story have been fixed, giving the line a relevant makeover that will appeal to modern audiences. Robo Force played second fiddle to the Transformers, and Flores and Oni will tap into this injustice, using it as a springboard to introduce new generations of fans to the line. The real world has counted Robo Force out, just like the forthcoming comic, but they are all that stand between humanity and total annihilation.\nSource: SuperHeroHype\nShaun Corley is a freelance writer currently residing in the mountains of Appalachia.

{"title": "The Simpsons Gave One Major Character Their Best Episode In Decades", "date": "2023-10-10 21:10:28", "text": "While The Simpsons doesn't always focus on the members of its title family equally, season 35 episode 2 highlighted the show's most underrated hero.\nWhile the long-running animated sitcom often sidelines some of the eponymous family’s members, The Simpsons season 35 episode 2 gave one of them their best storyline in years. Marge Simpson is a complicated character. Since The Simpsons usually focuses on her husband Homer, Marge is often used as a supporting character in The Simpsons instead of occupying a main role. This is exacerbated by the fact that the series was originally intended to focus on Bart, while Lisa is creator Matt Groening’s favorite character. As such, Marge is the Simpson family member least likely to get stories focused on her internal life apart from Maggie, a baby who can’t speak yet.\nHowever, The Simpsons season 35 went some way to redressing this imbalance with a heartfelt outing that focused entirely on Marge’s experience of life in the Simpson family. In The Simpsons season 35, episode 2, “A Mid-Childhood Night's Dream,” Marge gets some worrying news about Bart’s progress in school and embarks on a trippy, hallucinatory journey of self-discovery that provides the character with her best story in decades. In the process, The Simpsons proved that the show can still make Marge’s story a compelling one even if she is less prone to wild antics than her husband and children.\nEarly in “A Mid-Childhood Night's Dream,” Marge wakes up in a pool of sweat after an unsettling dream about her children growing up too fast. Homer commented on her heavy drinking the night before and suggested that this uncharacteristic excess, along with potential food poisoning, might have caused her stomach upset and nightmares. While The Simpsons season 35 premiere focused on Homer, “A Mid-Childhood Night's Dream” opted instead to delve back into Marge’s subconscious with another dream sequence that offered more context for her fearsome visions. It turned out that, while Marge received disconcerting news during a meeting with Bart’s teacher, it wasn't the type of surprise viewers might expect.\nBart’s teacher Rayshelle Peyton warned Marge that Bart was growing up and that he would soon be entering middle school. Marge’s subconscious inflated this comment into a fearmongering dream about all of her children abandoning her, and her fear of empty nest syndrome made for an engaging, poignant plot. This was a compelling storyline that felt rooted in her character, rather than coming out of left field like some of her more outlandish plots. Where The Simpsons season 35’s Mr. Burns acts nothing like his old familiar self, Marge’s arc in “A Mid-Childhood Night's Dream” worked precisely because it felt true to her persona.\nMarge’s troubled relationship with Bart has been a goldmine for The Simpsons over the years as the eternally rebellious first child constantly sought both independence from his family and solace from his parents. Classic episodes like season 7, episode 11, “Marge Be Not Proud” and season 10, episode 3, “Bart the Mother,” mined this relationship for drama and laughs in equal measure. However, “A Mid-Childhood Night's Dream” offered a new look at Marge’s struggle with her son.\nRelated: 12 Best Animated TV Shows Ever Ranked\nThis ambitious outing was rooted in Marge’s relationship with Bart but, this time, it was her fear of him growing up too fast rather than his misbehavior that anchored the plot. This was a fresh outlook for the show since stories that cast Marge as a hectoring scold can often become tiresome. This plot line has played out countless times and provided viewers with some great episodes, so there is no need for the show to revisit it once again from a slightly different angle.\nKerry Washington’s Rayshelle Peyton made a comeback in “A Mid-Childhood Night's Dream” and the character once again proved a valuable addition to the cast of the series. One mistake that The Simpsons season 35 can’t afford to make is introducing even more new characters while ignoring the many great supporting stars that the series has added to its cast list in recent years. Fortunately, “A Mid-Childhood Night's Dream” found a perfect role for Peyton as the supportive teacher who gently warned Marge that Bart was growing up, thus inadvertently starting her fear spiral. Peyton also returned to reassure Marge later in the story, rounding out her subplot nicely.\nMarge’s relationship with Bart was not the only recurring theme that “A Mid-Childhood Night's Dream” revisited from earlier espies of The Simpsons. Like season 8, episode 9, “El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)” and season 19, episode 9, “Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind,” the episode was told mostly through a melding of reality and fantasy as Marge’s imagination and dreams blended with her lived experience. The notable difference here was that these earlier episodes centered on Homer’s story whereas The Simpsons season 35 made the wise decision to instead illustrate Marge’s inner world, something that has historically received less screen time from the show.\nWhile The Simpsons bringing back Sideshow Bob or producing two Treehouse of Horror Halloween specials in one year might smack of desperation to some viewers, these recent developments also betray a desire to liven up the show’s formula. Critics have cautiously hinted at this for years now, but “A Mid-Childhood Night's Dream” was evidence that The Simpsons really is getting good again. The outing was a genuinely superb, poignant, and funny episode that felt like it could have been plucked from one of the Golden Age seasons of the series that viewers often canonize online. A major part of this episode’s success came down to the story’s timelessness.\nRelated: 24 Longest-Running TV Shows Ever, Ranked By Duration\nSome of the most embarrassingly ill-judged moments in later seasons of The Simpsons, from a dated Baby Shark reference to a mortifying “Bernie Babies” gag, felt like half-baked attempts to prove the series was still relevant. However, The Simpsons avoided its oldest problem with “A Mid-Childhood Night's Dream” as the show jettisoned these bids at relevancy in favor of a storyline that would work in any era. Marge’s journey was rooted in her character rather than any number of fleetingly popular topics, resulting in a plot that felt compelling. Over the years, viewers have argued that Marge doesn’t receive much story focus, but The Simpsons season 35 successfully refuted this criticism.\n"}

They're easy to hate, but their shows wouldn't be as great without them.\nA great villain can make a viewer's blood boil, yet deep down they know their favorite TV series wouldn't be the same without these characters' devious acts. In recent years, TV has allowed for a growing number of fantastic female antagonists, offering a complexity that can make audiences simultaneously hate them and need more of them. These women are willing to destroy the hero or whoever else they please in a way that's compelling and completely steals the show.\nFrom the despicable Dolores Umbridge in Harry Potter to Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the movies have many iconic female villains. With the golden age of television allowing for more complex characters and larger roles for women on TV, female antagonists on the small screen are being explored in a level of depth that allows audiences to connect and sympathize with them. Great TV villains can make audiences sympathize to the point where they're turning against their heroes — or make them so angry and frustrated that they need to shut off their televisions.\nRELATED: 10 Best Television Villains Of The 21st Century\nLuther begins as a captivating game of cat and mouse between the titular character and the seductive murderer Alice. She is a fiercely intelligent and dangerous killer, managing to outwit the show's hero on many occasions. Alice is terrifying, but she's also painfully irresistible and captivating. The complex romantic relationship between the show's characters draws many comparisons to Hannibal Lecter and Will Graham.\nKatherine Pierce is the vampire doppelganger to Elena Gilbert, allowing actress Nina Dobrev to dabble in both good and evil in The Vampire Diaries. Katherine is manipulative and cruel, but despite being a vampire, she shows acts of humanity from time to time that make audiences fall for her. Katherine's charm and occasional acts of love make her a villain viewers love to hate.\nRELATED: 5 Times Katherine Pierce Proved She Was The Villain Of The Vampire Diaries (& 5 Times She Was Actually The Hero)\nIn a show about violent mobsters and murderers, Livia Soprano still manages to be one of the most hated characters in The Sopranos. Not only is she the mastermind who attempts to turn Junior against her own son in season 1, but her behavior impacts Tony Soprano long after her death. While playing the part of the miserable old woman, Livia Soprano manipulates those around her, and never once takes responsibility for her actions.\nThe Boys is filled with characters who are fun to hate. From Homelander to Soldier Boy, the Prime Video series is filled with irredeemable villains who constantly steal the show. The Boys season 2 villain Stormfront is one of the most unlikable characters on the show, primarily because she's an actual Nazi. Like many supe villains in The Boys, the threat of Stormfront is that she was able to fake being a hero, and knew how to manipulate the public.\nAnn Dowd is a fantastic actress who also played a great female antagonist in HBO's The Leftovers. However, it's her role as Aunt Lydia in The Handmaid's Tale that's downright terrifying. The world of Gilead in The Handmaid's Tale is a bleak, dystopian future ruled by an oppressive theocracy that largely restricts the role of women in society. Aunt Lydia is a woman who supports this terrible regime, making her a major threat. Lydia brutally enforces the patriarchal power of Gilead to the point of abusive violence, making her so easy to hate.\nIn the massive universe of Star Trek, Kai Winn stands out as a memorable villain who made audiences legitimately furious. Smartly written and brilliantly portrayed by Louise Fletcher, Kai Winn is a religious leader with great aspirations, utilizing her image of social niceties to commit acts of self-service and rise through the ranks. She was a politician disguised in religious attire, making her both incredibly dangerous and an intelligent social commentary.\nWhile Georgina may not be the terrifying murderer psychopath that other female villains are, in the world of Gossip Girl, she serves as a perfect foil early on. Georgina finds a number of ways to meddle and sabotage those around her, from putting roofies in Serena's drinks to having characters deported. Somehow, despite every awful act, Georgina manages to be a villain who is hard not to love.\nJodie Comer is one of the most exciting young actors in recent years, with the character Villanelle in Killing Eve showing the terrific range she's capable of. Villanelle is a cold-hearted assassin who's happy to commit simple acts of cruelty and shows no remorse for the lives she ends. The scariest thing about Villanelle is the pure joy and fun she seems to feel from her cruelty, and that she's not only a ruthless killer but also a character who provides great comic relief in the series.\nRELATED: Why Villanelle Is The True Main Character Of Killing Eve (& Why Eve Is)\nPlayed by the hilarious Jane Lynch, Sue Sylvester is the thorn in the side of Glee's New Directions. As the largely successful coach of the cheerleading squad, Sue is a bully to everyone at McKinley High, from students to teachers, and even to the school's principal. Competition for funding puts her at direct odds with Will Schuester, causing her to constantly attempt to sabotage the underdog glee club and its members. There is more to Sue than the devious outer layer, though, and as the show progresses it begins to explore her complex and vulnerable sides.\nAvatar: The Last Airbender is filled with iconic characters, with Azula being one of the most memorable. While she may only be 14, she's incredibly tactical, manipulative, and powerful, allowing her to have a threatening, power-hungry presence. Azula is a product of the abusive, war-like culture in which she was raised, psychologically damaging her and forcing her to project that same trauma onto others. No matter what evil she commits, Azula is a villain fans still feel remorse for in the end.\nGame of Thrones has so many fantastic villains, but Cersei is the one who stands out most from start to finish, constantly abusing her position of power to commit cruel and selfish acts. Beginning as the queen to Robert Baratheon, Cersei manages to linger close enough to the Iron Throne until she's able to seize it for herself. Her one redeeming quality is her love for her children, but after she loses all of them she has nothing left but hatred, even letting King's Landing and its people burn before surrendering the throne. For eight seasons, Cersei made every Game of Thrones fan despise her.\n"}
{"title": "10 Best Manga Published By Shonen Jump's Biggest Rivals", "date": "2023-10-10 21:10:28", "text": "Shonen Jump is the king of the manga hill and has been for a while, but competitors Kodansha and Shogakukan have plenty of great titles worth a read.\nWith the number of manga hits Shueisha's Shonen Jump generates month after month, it's easy to forget that it's just one in a number of publishers creating content for the thriving, ever-growing manga market. Indeed, there are two other major publishers - Kodansha and Shogakukan - that consistently produce excellent, if less celebrated, manga stories that are every bit as good as Jump's best.\nOf all the manga industry publishers, Kodansha and Shogakukan have the resources, tradition, and influence to challenge Shueisha's global manga omnipresence. Like Shueisha, both began as book publishers before finding a rich revenue stream in manga and later anime. Interestingly, Shueisaha was originally founded by Shogakukan as its entertainment imprint, and the two are joint owners of the American manga distributor Viz Media. Here, then, is a list of manga titles from Kodansha and Shogakukan that manga fans should be reading now.\nGosho Aoyama's Detective Conan, which is known in the U.S. as Case Closed, tells the story of Shinichi Kudo, a high school student with an aptitude for solving crimes. However, after a secret organization he's been investigating poisons him with a mysterious drug, his body is transformed back to that of a toddler. Determined to continue pursuing his passion, and figure out how to neutralize the drug's effect, Shinichi Kudo assumes an alternate identity and continues solving crimes. Detective Conan is one of the longest-running manga, and not without a reason: solid storytelling, interesting characters, and an ongoing mystery backstory that amazingly stays dynamic. It's detective manga at its finest.\nNegi Haruba's Go! Go! Loser Ranger flips the script on the well-known Sentai genre that's been popularized in the U.S. by the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Rather than detailing the heroic exploits of a super-powered group of teenagers, the story follows a bunch of villains who having been defeated over and over by a hero team known as the Dragon Keepers. The villains decide to infiltrate the Dragon Keeper organization in order to finally achieve total world domination. It’s a great bottom-up take on the genre that perfectly plays off decades-worth of popular Sentai tropes.\nNanashi's Don't Mess With Me, Miss Nagatoro tells the story of shy but earnest student Naoto Hachioji, who is continuously bullied by his classmates. When a freshman student named Hayase Nagatoro joins in the abuse, Naoto sees it as more of the same. However, something strange occurs as Nagatoro's attentions intensify; she's seemingly on a mission to help Naoto be the best he can be. It's a unique \"boy meets girl\" story that creatively mixes slice-of-life manga elements with romance manga style to produce a thoroughly enjoyable coming of age story.\nWhile Eiichiro Shimizu and Tomohiro Shimoguchi's Ultraman is part of the popular television and movie franchise, it is nothing like its televised version. This Ultraman is a grittier, more serious, and much more compelling story than those spawned in the wider Ultraman universe after the first TV series ended. This story links back directly to the first Ultraman in the original 1966 TV series and his alter-ego Shin Hayata. After sharing the same body for so long, Hayata absorbs some of Ultraman's abilities and passes them on to his son Shinjiro. Years later, armed with superhuman abilities and a special power suit, Shinjiro is called on to fill the void that Ultraman left when he returned to his home world.\nKei Urana's Gachiakuta tells the story of Rudo - an orphan living in the slums outside of Heaven. After being framed for killing his foster father, Rudo is cast into the Abyss; the area below the Slums where all the trash from Heaven is dumped, and where criminals are exiled. In the Abyss, Rudo becomes a Janitor, a group of people organized to protect the inhabitants from the monsters who’ve evolved from the countless ages Heaven has been dumping refuse into the area. Rudo vows to learn the skills and abilities to one day get his revenge on the people who framed him. Manga fans should check it out not only for Rudo's story, which is full of interesting twists, but also for the tremendous world-building Urana pulls off.\nRelated: Attack on Titan Publisher Kodansha Announces New Manga App\nNaoki Urasawa, Osamu Tezuka and Takashi Nagasaki’s Pluto reimagines the groundbreaking, fan-favorite anime Astro Boy as a gritty 'whodunit' involving an advanced robot police detective assigned to find the individual responsible for taking out the world’s greatest robots. His investigation is further complicated by the fact that, like Astro Boy, he is also a target of the killer. Outside the obvious links to one of the most popular and well-known heroes in anime, this manga is as solid as they come in terms of story, character, and artwork, and a thrilling crime story even without its sci-fi elements.\nKatarina and Ryosuke Fuji's Shangri-La Frontier tells the story of Rakuro Hizutome, a high school gamer who loves the challenge of playing and winning at \"trash\" games - badly-made games, or VR video games that are still in beta, and full of glitches that completed games rarely show. Having climbed the ranks to become one of the best \"trash gamers\" online, he tries a new trash game at the suggestion of a friend only to find it's the hardest he’s ever played, and his results have real-life consequences. Shangri-La Frontier is not for everyone, but for the growing group of 'gaming manga' readers, there’s no better series.\nAs a manga, Yasuo Ohtagaki's Mobile Suit Gundam: Thunderbolt is a bit of an anomaly in a franchise known for its animated television and film content. However, it might also be the best that the franchise has to offer. The story takes place concurrently with the original Gundam television series, but so far is not explicitly part of Gundam canon. It focuses on a battle between the Principality of Zeon and the Earth Federation in a section of space called \"Thunderbolt.\" The conflict focuses on Zeon soldier Daryl Lorenz and Earth soldier Io Fleming as they face off against one another to secure victory for their respective sides. This is required reading for anyone into the Gundam franchise.\nMasamitsu Nigatsu's Akabane's Bodyguard tells the story of high school student Ibuki Arakuni, who learns that his friend Akabane Koneko is the target of assassins due to the fact that her father is a mobster. Tasked with making sure that she graduates safely, Ibuki embarks on the year-long job of being Akabane's secret bodyguard. It's a hard life for Ibuki, but there’s also plenty of room for romance and humor. This title is worthy of attention for Nigatsu's solid integration of multiple manga genres, including gangster, romance, comedy, school, and action in a compelling story with consistently interesting characters.\nNo list including Kodansha titles would be complete without Muneyuki Kaneshiro and Yusuke Nomura's Blue Lock, the story based on Japan's real-life quest to be a world power in soccer. Specifically, the story focuses on high school middling soccer player Isagi Yoichi and his plan to become the nation's premier soccer forward through the Blue Lock - a program that mercilessly trains its participants to be the best they can be or give up soccer altogether. Besides the intense drama between the Blue Lock participants themselves, as well as the program management, Blue Lock is interesting because of its \"superhero-fication\" of this extreme sports story.\nEven though the above recommendations are the best sources for fans to introduce themselves to what Kodansha and Shogakukan has to offer, they represent just a small portion of the quality manga content both publishers generate each month. Much of that content can truly give Shonen Jump a run for its money, and shows just how much great content there is for manga fans willing to dig a little deeper.\nMarcel Green is a writer for Screen Rant's Comics and Anime Sections."}

The corpse's attire indicates that she was killed on her wedding day, and the musical number \"Remains of the Day\" confirms this. It's revealed that she was murdered by her own fiance, who made out with her family's jewels and left her corpse to rot in the forest. Still, it wasn't until the end of Corpse Bride that the identity of her murderer was made clear.\nSet in Victorian England, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (2005) follows Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp), who unwittingly becomes married to a corpse. His new bride, Emily (Helena Bonham Carter), whisked him down to the underworld, where she hoped they would spend their days \"living\" happily ever after. Of course, Victor had already fallen in love with someone else—Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson), who was still very much alive. His journey back to his beloved was met with several obstacles, including Victoria's betrothal to Lord Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant). Still, the events of the macabre tale became even more complicated.\nThe beginning of Corpse Bride revealed that Emily had been one of the most beautiful women in town before her death. She could have married anyone, but she fell in love with a mysterious man her father disapproved of. When Emily was forbidden from marrying this man, the couple planned to run away together, surviving on a small fortune that the bride would steal from her family. Tragically, upon their rendezvous in the forest, Emily was murdered by her groom, who stole her fortune and left her to die.\nOf course, Corpse Bride eventually revealed that this man had been none other than Lord Barkis, though it's unclear precisely how he killed her. Considering the wound on Emily's side and the fact that he attempted to kill Victor with a sword, it has been theorized that he stabbed her. To make matters worse, Emily states after realizing Barkis' identity that he had left her \"for dead,\" indicating that she was still alive when Barkis fled the forest with her family's fortune.\nRELATED: Why Tim Burton's Corpse Bride Is So Different To Nightmare Before Christmas\nEmily's age is never confirmed in Corpse Bride. All we know for certain is that Barkis murdered her nine years before he attempted to marry Victoria. Still, since Emily was an unmarried member of a wealthy Victorian family, it can be assumed that she was in her late teens. This is supported by the fact that Victor and Victoria are both 19 during the events of the Tim Burton movie since Emily appears to be about the same age as her fellow Corpse Bride characters. Of course, this would mean that she remained 19 for nearly a decade, adding to the tragedy of her despicable murder.\n"}

Inspired by Tarantino's knack for classic action and revenge movies, both Kill Bill installments have cemented their names among some of the most memorable action movie series. However, despite being commercially and critically successful, the movie series has garnered a lot of negative attention because of its long list of behind-the-scenes controversies.\nIn recent years, Uma Thurman has opened up about the challenges she faced during the first Kill Bill's shooting, shedding light on the sometimes demanding, dangerous, and, arguably, borderline exploitative nature of movie productions. The actress' account of the filming of one scene in particular is quite shocking, raising concerns about the working conditions and safety standards followed during movie shootings. With these harsh truths about the two Quentin Tarantino movies, one cannot help but perceive them differently.\nRELATED: Did Elle Driver Die In Kill Bill 2? Quentin Tarantino Already Gave The Answer\nIn February 2018, Uma Thurman took to social media to reveal how a car accident during the filming of Kill Bill nearly killed her. Although she defended Quentin Tarantino by highlighting that the director \"was deeply regretful and remains remorseful,\" she explained that the negligence towards the accident was almost criminal. According to reports (via NYTimes), it all started when Uma Thurman was already apprehensive about filming a driving scene during Kill Bill's shooting. However, Tarantino convinced her to film the sequence and even asked her to drive at \"40 miles per hour\" to make her hair blow \"the right away.\"\nUnfortunately, the scene almost proved fatal for Thurman and became \"the biggest regret\" of Tarantino's life (via BBC) after the actress' car lost control over an uneven patch on the road and hit a tree. While Tarantino was apologetic, Uma Thurman revealed that Harvey Weinstein prevented her from pressing charges against the production by not giving her and Tarantino the accident footage. However, as Thurman's social media post confirmed, she was proud of Quentin Tarantino because he gave her the accident's behind-the-scene video despite knowing it could harm his image. Although Uma Thurman eventually found a semblance of justice, the Kill Bill driving scene is much harder to watch after learning about the problematic reality of its filming.\nKill Bill's production was marred with several other controversies, including the ones surrounding Quentin Tarantino spitting on and choking Uma Thurman during action scene takes. Without denying his behind-the-scene actions, Quentin Tarantino said that although Michael Madsen's character spits on Thurman's The Bride in the film, he decided to do it himself to avoid taking multiple retakes of the abusive shot. He feared that by letting someone else do it, he would risk messing up the scene, leading to multiple retakes, which would not be in Thurman's best interest.\nAs for the choking, Tarantino said (via Deadline) that it was Uma Thurman's idea to have a real chain wrapped around her neck in the Kill Bill scene where Chiaki Kuryama's assassin Gogo attacks her character. However, given how Uma Thurman was actually choked for the scene to make her character's strangulation seem realistic, it is hard not to feel concerned about the safety and ethical considerations on the sets of Kill Bill. The fact that Uma Thurman later had a brush with doom during the filming of Kill Bill's car scene adds even more heft to these concerns.\nSources: NYTimes, BBC, Deadline\n"}

Starring Cuba Gooding Jr., the drama movie is based on a true story, following former felon Eugene Brown as he establishes a Washington D.C. chess club to help get inner-city kids off the streets. Other than Gooding Jr., Life of a King cast also includes Dennis Haysbert, LisaGay Hamilton, and Malcolm Mays.\nLife of a King shockingly becomes a Netflix success as it ranks in the top 5 in the worldwide charts for the week of October 2–October 8. According to Netflix's recent update, the drama came in at No. 4 on the worldwide top 10, sandwiched between Love is in the Air (No. 3) and Infinite (No. 5). According to the streamer, Life of a King received 6.3 million views. Topping the global top 10 this week were Fair Play and Reptile.\nWhile the Netflix global top 10 tends to have some surprises, Life of a King is one of the most shocking inclusions. Barely getting a theatrical release, the movie brought in just $44,000 in the entirety of its theatrical run, of which $6,547 was domestic. Furthermore, it is a decade-old movie, and the director does not have any current projects, making Life of a King’s streaming renaissance all the more surprising.\nAlthough it is not one of Gooding Jr.'s best-rated movies or shows, Life of a King made the global top 10 in 20 different countries on Netflix. While this included smaller countries like Trinidad and Tobago and the Bahamas, Life of a King also gained traction in higher subscriber-count regions like Brazil and Mexico. For a $44,000 project to gain much traction, the movie's charting is one of the more unusual cases, but its true-based story likely prompted its appeal.\nRelated: Netflix's Top 10 Movies Show Exactly What Streaming's Future Looks Like With Hollywood's Failures\nAlongside Life of a King, Netflix has seen surprising resurgences throughout the year, including the unprecedented streaming success of the TV series Suits.

For Jennifer, she's such a pro, she's always so on board and we do like to give her as many teardrops on her somewhere to represent every murder that she's committed. So, this year we tried to get as many teardrop diamonds on her nails as we could and some on her face. Maybe nobody even knows that, but me and Jennifer Tilly are like, yeah, that's so cool. Let's do that.\nI love it because you just gave me a tiny little exclusive and Easter egg all in one. I think that's great. Now, it's something I can look out for trying to pick out different little Easter eggs and moments. Can you share any signature makeup effects or transformations viewers can anticipate in the upcoming season without giving too much away in terms of spoilers?\nSid Armour: Sure. Oh. Geez, without giving too much away.\nOr, hey, give it all away. We want the news, we want the tea.\nSid Armour: You want the tea. I'm not really sure exactly how much I'm allowed to say. I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to say.\nCan you share any kind of techniques or materials you utilize to achieve that eerie, unsettling look for Chucky season 3?\nSid Armour: So Chucky is done by the puppeteer department and the creator of the Doll Witches, Tony Gardner, and he has a six person puppeteer department. And it is a very expensive doll, and there are many dolls that do all different things. So, there's not just the one Chucky doll, there's many. And so we all stay as far away as we can from Chucky, and Chucky can only have certain bloods used on him. So, if we're going crazy and splattering the whole room and splattering the cast in blood, it's a conversation of how are we not going to get Chucky in the way of this? Because you don't want to stain Chucky's face because that could be really expensive. So, we have to respect the doll.\nAbsolutely. Just out of curiosity, what was your entryway to Chucky? Were you a fan of Chucky growing up and was this kind of like a dream project for you? Or was it almost the opposite where it was like, \"Well, I got thrown into this world and here we are.\"\nSid Armour: Oh my gosh. So, I always loved horror and I did get to work on Bride of Chucky a little bit when I first moved to Toronto. And then all of these years later, I just had it in me that I wanted... As soon as I heard about the series, I just had it in me that it was something I really wanted to do and I had no idea the lengths and how big and how fulfilling it was going to be. I knew it would be fun.\nI had no idea there were going to be multiple seasons and how much blood and how much I was going to get to do. And it's also really high glam. I have a runway background, and so it's really fun making everybody super high fashion as well as covered in blood. It's just been great.\nAbsolutely. And so that must be a full circle moment for you, right? Working on Bride of Chucky, then coming all the way around to Chucky the series and three seasons in.\nSid Armour: I know. I know. And we're three seasons in, and it's just like when we all sit sometimes and talk about the possibilities of what would be fun for future seasons, you could just let your mind go wild because everything's on the table and Don Mancini is so creative and there's so many different ways that Chucky can get out there and start killing people, so it's really fun.\nWhich character had the most different transition into makeup that was the biggest challenge for you in season three?\nSid Armour: Oh, that's interesting. Well, we have a lot of new characters, but I mean definitely, even though it's small, Devon Sawa is a different person.\nI was going to ask about that because he plays the priest last season, and he's the president this season. How does that look change?\nSid Armour: It's just grooming. He's got a tan because he's on camera a lot and he's distinguished. He has a certain coiff hair do, he's so much fun, and he's so up for anything. And yeah, he's a really fun guy to work with. Yeah.\nCan you walk me through the collaboration process with the show's creative team and the directors to make sure that the makeup aligns with the overall vision of Chucky season 3?\nSid Armour: Sure. I have lots of ideas. And then they always say, lets sidebar makeup because she's talking way too much about stuff that's happening way down the line, because I really want the show to be all about makeup. And it is. And we do collaborate with all the different departments. There's a lot of meetings about who does what, and I really love that because I think one of the fun things about film is learning what the other people do.\nI know what I'm doing and I'm doing new cool things, but there's always somebody else that knows a little trick or something that's going to happen, and we're always doing a different murder and it's just every day is a really fun day that way. I love that.\nNow this season starts off in the White House, and you kind of touched on this a little bit, but I feel like the glam of the show in terms of the makeup and aesthetic is elevated a little bit this season. Can you talk about how that differs from previous seasons that we've seen in the past?\nSid Armour: Well, Jennifer is the most glamorous, for sure. And if it's possible, we got even bigger with that. But we also have Halloween. And Halloween at the White House is a whole different ball game than just Halloween going down the street. People have money and there's people there. And so we had just tons and tons of characters that we had to create. And it was so much fun because also Don Mancini makes a lot of references. He really is a film buff and you can see everybody on the Zoom meeting. He'll say, \"Oh, let's do that. We'll do The Godfather, that scene in the Godfather with Jennifer Tilly and the horse head.\"\nAnd you can just see everybody, everyone's nodding. And then you know that as soon as we finish our meeting, everyone's looking up the movie trying to figure out what he's talking about because he is referencing so many genres and so many films and it's really amazing and he just makes it happen. And we just all make it happen.\nHow often do the actors on Chucky have input into their look on the show?\nSid Armour: That's a great question. I definitely am a character driven makeup artist. I think that what the character is drives who they are. And you know what? Most of our actors are definitely on board with that, and they have their own vision. And we have lots and lots of meetings with Don about what that character would be doing.\nAnd Don's super inclusive with letting me and some of the other departments talk about how we see a lot of the characters, like the Glenn and Glenda character last season. That was huge. And there was a lot to that. Again, maybe not every viewer understands what went into what, but I love listening to what people think that they're going to... What actors think is their character.\nWhen you're paging through the scripts and reading these different characters, do you already form the look in your head of what they're going to look like?\nSid Armour: Oh yeah, sure. And you know what sometimes especially... These scripts are like, I can't tell you how smart they are and how funny and how well done and the little things that they write just for the reader in between paragraphs. And it's really been a pleasure just to read the scripts and start thinking about it.\nAnd I just go crazy and start thinking about their characters in my mind and then start talking to all of the actors about what they see. And then as artists do, sometimes I'll just be sitting there doing nothing and ideas will start coming to me. And I really like that. I really want all the decisions that I make to be based on something that has to do with their character. I'm not very much on being influenced by other people's work. I'll say that.\nIn Chucky's unending thirst for power, season 3 now sees Chucky ensconced with the most powerful family in the world — America's First Family, inside the infamous walls of the White House. How did Chucky wind up here? What in God's name does he want?\nCheck out our other Chucky season 3 interviews here:\n"}

In Strange New Worlds season 1, episode 5 \"Spock Amok\", the R'ongovians are determining whether to ally themselves with the Klingons, Romulans, or the United Federation of Planets. Admiral Robert April (Adrian Holmes) explains their delegation matches the Tellarites' rudeness, and Pike notices they prioritize logic when speaking with Vulcans like Mr. Spock (Ethan Peck) and T'Pring (Gia Sandhu). Pike, then, becomes the template by which the R'ongovian Captain Vasso L'Gaelia (Ron Kennell) comes to understand humans.\nPike realizes that the R'ongovians' changing behavior isn't due to them being fickle. They're a culture characterized by empathy, and their shifting attitudes depending on who they're talking to is representative of the value they place on understanding others' points of view. The key to bringing the R'ongovians into the Federation is to meet them with an amount of understanding equal to their own. Fortunately, empathy makes Pike a great Starfleet captain, and his secret trick is to put himself into the R'ongovians' shoes by explaining the reasons they shouldn't join the Federation. It's an atypical tactic for Starfleet, but Vasso is grateful for the understanding, and the R'ongovians sign with the Federation.\nRelated: Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Cast - Every New & Returning Character In Season 2\nCaptain Pike's secret tactic still works in the 24th century, when Captain Carol Freeman shows that respect for a different culture is key to negotiating alliances. In Star Trek: Lower Decks season 4, episode 6, \"Parth Ferengi's Heart Place\", Freeman is responsible for approving the Federation application of a markedly different Ferengi Alliance, in negotiations with Grand Nagus Rom (Max Grodénchik) and First Clerk Leeta (Chase Masterson). Admiral Vassery (Fred Tatasciore), overseeing the negotiation, is entrenched in his own perspective, so gives up a lot in the spirit of cooperation, but Freeman can see the Ferengi capitalist values reflected in Rom's attempts to coerce the Federation into giving up their resources for nothing, and she's not having it.\nBecause Freeman recognizes the elements of Ferengi culture in play, she can respect it enough to use the same tactic Pike did with the R'ongovians. Grand Nagus Rom and his wife Leeta have made some inroads towards a more equitable Ferengi society, but the cultural divide between them and the Federation is still wide. After living on Deep Space Nine, Rom knows how to meet the Federation on their terms, by asking not for latinum, but for the things that do have value to them, like access to starships and trade routes. In turn, Freeman meets the Ferengi on their terms, even when it seems to conflict with Starfleet values. She stipulates the Ferengi have to recruit Q'onoS, the Klingon homeworld, to access Federation benefits without membership, and the risk pays off with the reward of Rom's respect.\nCaptain Pike's secret trick of seeing the other party's point of view worked on relative unknowns the R'ongovians, and on former Federation antagonists the Ferengi, but could it work on long-standing enemies of the Federation? The Klingons remain as independent as ever, so Rom is right to balk at Freeman's revised contract. However, Freeman's own Cerritos is home to one of Starfleet's first Orions, Lt. D'Vana Tendi (Noël Wells). Freeman actively encouraged Tendi to return home specifically to foster ties between the Orions and the Federation, so it's possible she's hoping to gain a greater understanding of what Federation membership would mean from their point of view. Freeman could easily be the one to open that conversation with the largely misunderstood Orions.\nStar Trek has long touted the principle of empathy in order to turn adversaries into allies, and in the cases of Pike and Freeman, it's that principle that allows the Federation to ally with more member worlds. In Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, the R'ongovians are relatively unknown to Pike, but through careful observation, he recognizes what they value, and embodies it to earn their respect. Whether she's aware of it or not, Freeman uses the same tactic with the Ferengi in Star Trek: Lower Decks. Ironically, going against what's expected for Starfleet officers becomes exactly what is needed in those moments to bring in more allies to the Federation, and foster that kind of radical empathy among its member races.\nStar Trek: Lower Decks season 4 streams Thursdays on Paramount+.\n"}
{"title": "&quot;We're as Good as Dead!&quot;: Dark Peanuts Parody Imagines Charlie Brown as a Twilight Zone Villain", "date": "2023-10-10 21:30:27", "text": "New fan art by Francesco Marciuliano has given Charlie Brown the abilities of an iconic Twilight Zone villain, completely redefining the series!\nA dark new parody of the iconic Peanuts comic has reimagined Charlie Brown as a Twilight Zone villain. Peanuts is well-regarded as one of the most wholesome comics ever created. The Charles Schulz-developed franchise has reached the hearts of millions with its lovable characters and endearing stories. However, several fans have found ways to subvert what made these classic characters work, including an incredible new piece of fan art.\nArtist Francesco Marciuliano took to X recently to share a genius recreation of Peanuts' very first strip. It starts out fairly simple, with Shermy declaring that Charlie Brown is coming down the road, calling him \"Good Ol' Charlie Brown.\" However, things take a serious turn when he tells Patty \"if we stop thinking good things about that monster he'll zap us to the cornfield.\"\nIt's a brilliant homage to Anthony Fremont from The Twilight Zone's iconic episode \"It's a Good Life,\" who is a monster in the form of a little boy with the power to manipulate reality with a simple thought.\nWhat works so well about this parody is how it completely changes Charlie Brown's character. The iconic protagonist of the Peanuts franchise is a target for laughter from his friends because of how wishy-washy he can be. Now, to see him hold power over the kids is an amusing subversion of the typical Peanuts strip. The kids live in fear of him in this parody, with Patty even telling Shermy \"We're as good as dead\" when he reveals Charlie Brown to be like the Twilight Zone villain, paving the way for several funny scenarios in this new reality. For example, Lucy could let Charlie Brown finally kick the football in a twist on the famous Peanuts football gag, fearing she'll be wished away to the cornfield — or, even worse, turned into a football herself, just like Dan Hollis was turned into a Jack-in-the-Box at the end of the Twilight Zone story.\nThe best thing about Marciuliano's art is that introduces a Twilight Zone Charlie Brown in the very first Peanuts comic ever created. It works so well because it subverts the punchline of the very first strip, since Shermy delivered the first line of Peanuts dialogue, hinting that he hates Charlie Brown, despite saying good things about him. In this alternate reality, Shermy can't voice what he really thinks because Charlie Brown could easily wish him away. When taking Peanuts history into account, though, he very well could have been wished away at some point. After all, Shermy was removed from the comics in 1975 as more and more kids like Franklin were introduced. It wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility that an angry Charlie Brown sent him to the cornfield.\nThis transformative fan art for both Peanuts and The Twlight Zone works in more ways than one. Not only is it a loving tribute to two beloved franchises, but it makes a great crossover as the iconic comic strip becomes much darker. It's almost unbelievable that these two very different properties could work so well together, but Francesco Marciuliano has proven that Charlie Brown can work as a Twlight Zone villain as he causes chaos for the Peanuts gang in their alternate reality.\nSource: Francesco Marciuliano\n"}
{"title": "Stephen King Book Plot Hole Solved By New Movie", "date": "2023-10-10 21:50:26", "text": "Pet Sematary: Bloodlines explores the backstory of the titular burial ground, and one line helps explain a strange plot hole from Stephen King's book.\nWarning: Major spoilers for Pet Sematary: Bloodlines below!\nA key quote from Pet Sematary: Bloodlines might explain a plot hole from Stephen King's original novel and the movie adaptations that followed. While King wasn't keen on 1992 sequel Pet Sematary Two as it wasn't based on any of his own writing, he's given his endorsement to 2023 prequel Bloodlines. That's because this latest installment adapts an important chapter from his1983 novel, where Jud Crandall recounts the sad tale of Timmy Batterman, a Ludlow local who was killed in combat and resurrected in the \"sour ground\" of the titular cemetery.\nThis chapter is a cautionary tale against using the burial ground to bring a person back, as they return as twisted, evil versions of their former selves. Bloodlines greatly expands on this passage and the backstory of the town, revealing that Jud and his family are descendants of the founders of Ludlow. Pet Sematary: Bloodlines' ending also reveals Jud decided to stay in town after the bloody events of the story to keep vigil over the cemetery, which makes his actions in the 2019 movie - and by extension the book - all the more baffling.\nRelated: Pet Sematary Bloodlines 2: Confirmation Chances, Franchise Future Release Plans & Everything We Know\nThe prequel explains that the descendants of Ludlow's founders formed a pact to stop \"the sickness\" caused by the burial ground from spreading beyond the town. Pet Sematary: Bloodlines cast regular Stephen King alum Henry Thomas as Jud's father Dan, who tells him the evil in the woods gets into people's heads and \"messes with their minds,\" but that it prefers the dead as they \"put up less of a struggle.\" The people who return from the dead - like Timmy in Bloodlines or Ellie (Jeté Laurence) in the 2019 Pet Sematary - are essentially possessed by the Wendigo's spirit and do its malevolent bidding.\nWhile Dan's line reveals why the dead are so susceptible to the \"darkness,\" it could also explain Jud's actions in the book and film adaptations. After the events of Bloodlines, where Jud sees his former best friend become an undead monster responsible for multiple deaths, it's unbelievable he would risk kicking off another chain of bloodshed in the 2019 film. Yet, this is what he does when he tells Louis (Jason Clarke) about the cemetery's reviving powers so they can bring Ellie's beloved cat Church back to life.\nWhile the deceased might be the most vulnerable to Ludlow's evil forces, after 50 years in town and losing all his loved ones, it makes sense that Jud (John Lithgow) would become vulnerable too. Across the decades, this force could have chipped away at his mind and used him to lure further victims to the graveyard. In the book, there was never a concrete reason for Jud telling Louis about the cemetery given what he knows about its effects on the resurrected.\nThis makes even less sense after the prequel, where Jud witnessed firsthand the monsters the \"sour ground\" spits out. That said, Jud's actions could be forgiven somewhat by Pet Sematary: Bloodlines' explanation of the Wendigo's influence on his mind, with the being slowly chipping away at his defenses until the thought of using the burial ground for something positive sounded like a good idea.\n"}
{"title": "Why Boy Meets World Was Cut One Season Short Because Of Sabrina The Teenage Witch", "date": "2023-10-10 21:53:53", "text": "Sabrina the Teenage Witch was involved in the decision to end Boy Meets World after season 7, as discussed in an episode of Pod Meets World.\nBoy Meets World ended after season 7, and Sabrina the Teenage Witch factored into the decision. Both shows were part of ABC's popular \"TGIF\" lineup, which has been home to some of the network's most beloved programs, including Full House, Family Matters, and Step by Step. Boy Meets World joined the block when it premiered in 1993, with Sabrina the Teenage Witch added to the lineup with its first episode in '96. Both shows stopped airing in the TGIF block in 2000; Boy Meets World ended with season 7 that year, while Sabrina went on to air an additional three seasons on The WB.\nAppearing on Pod Meets World, a podcast hosted by Boy Meets World stars Danielle Fishel, Rider Strong, and Will Friedle, stage manager and director Steve Hoefer discussed the choice to end the show and the role Sabrina the Teenage Witch played in the decision.\nIt was not a done deal, but ABC was leaning toward, to my understanding, the way it was told to me, that TGIF would've stayed together if they had two anchor shows for the four slots, and since we were the original, obviously we were one, and if Sabrina had not jumped networks, that would have given them their second anchor, and they would have approached at least one more season with the new story of you guys having moved out.\nRelated: Boy Meets World: The True Story Behind Topanga’s Name\nHoefer's comments highlight just how much the TV landscape has changed in the last 20 years, particularly for networks. Boy Meets World season 7 averaged 8.7 million viewers and, while less than the previous two seasons, a network would be thrilled by that number today. For comparison, even one of ABC's current top comedies, Abbott Elementary, averaged 3.95 million in the 2022-23 season, simply because even incredibly popular shows face far more competition today.\nHoefer's mention of \"anchors\" harkens back to a different time as well. Typically, anchors were seen as reliable, existing shows that could bolster new ones. The solid-performing series would often serve as a lead-in to the newer show, with networks hoping that viewers wouldn't change the channel after the anchor series ended. While this strategy is still a key part of TV programming, it's not as important as it once was.\nWith the rise of so many different TV platforms and cable channels, audiences have become accustomed to finding shows they want to watch, regardless of when and where they air. This has made anchor shows less necessary or at least not a guaranteed way to improve viewership numbers for another series or programming block. In that way, it's possible a Boy Meets World airing today would have been renewed for season 8, no Sabrina the Teenage Witch necessary.\nSource: Pod Meets World\n"}
{"title": "Totally Killer Costume Designer On Revisiting '80s Childhood & Creating An Iconic New Slasher Look", "date": "2023-10-10 21:57:23", "text": "Totally Killer costume designer Patti Henderson breaks down her work on the Blumhouse slasher, including trying to create a new iconic killer.\nAs the era becomes fashionable for the modern generation, one Gen Z-er is finding herself getting to experience the '80s firsthand in Totally Killer. The movie finds teenager Jamie inadvertently landing in 1987 thanks to her friend's time travel machine, though her chance to enjoy the time is cut short when her small town's infamous serial killer begins his reign of terror by targeting Jamie's mom and her friends.\nThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina alum Kiernan Shipka leads the star-studded Totally Killer cast alongside Olivia Holt, Julie Bowen, Randall Park, Lochlyn Munro, Charlie Gillespie, Liana Liberato, Kelcey Mawema, Stephi Cin-Salvo and Anna Diaz.\nRelated: New On Amazon Prime Video: All 138 Movies & TV Shows Arriving In October\nIn anticipation of the movie's premiere, Screen Rant spoke exclusively with Costume Designer Patti Henderson to discuss Totally Killer, finding the perfect looks harking back to her own '80s childhood, crafting the look for a potentially new slasher icon, and having to destroy her own work.\nScreen Rant: I'm very excited to talk about this movie with you, Patti. I watched it last night, and it was just such a joyride from start to finish. What about the script or the concept as a whole really sparked your interest want to be a part of it?\nPatti Henderson: Well, the script was fantastic, for starters. The nods to the '80s absolutely was what drew me in. I grew up in the '80s, so I really wanted to work with some of the things that I remembered. I remember myself wearing, [what my] friends [were] wearing, and I wanted to do it again.\nSo whose costume, based on the script, were you most excited to help get to put together first?\nPatti Henderson: First was definitely the Jamie costume, Kiernan's look, with the leather jacket, but also being able to have her look like the rocker that she was when she was going to the concert that night. Then getting stuck in the time machine and popping out and being able to blend in well enough into the '80s that people didn't see her sticking out like a sore thumb was very, very key, very important. I think we pulled it off, because the rocker chicks were back around back then, and they're here today too, right?\nDefinitely, I kept having flashbacks to like Stevie Nicks with Jamie's jacket in particular, I thought it was a great little touch. Now, who would you say then was the most challenging character to develop a costume for?\nPatti Henderson: Interesting, you're the first one that's asked me if there was a challenge. I think it was not just one person, I think it was the three Mollys, or the four, you could say if you include teen Pam in there. We had Tiffany, Pam, Marissa and Heather — we made this last year, so I had to think about that for a minute. [Chuckles] It was really, really important to me to — it was a pull to the Mean Girls, but we made them all look like the Mollys, and I wanted to do Molly's looks justice, and do it correctly, and pull all of these girls together. You see them standing in the hallway, you see them even in the gym class, Heather still has a little hat on her head. It wasn't a challenge, there were no challenges on this, but it was a lot of fun, I don't know if I can say it any better? [Chuckles]\nFun little creative drive for you!\nPatti Henderson: Yeah, absolutely super creative. I did a lot of picking [clothing], I started in Vancouver and headed all the way down to San Diego, great vintage shops all along the way. I hit the Rose Bowl flea market, one of the biggest flea markets in North America, and the '80s is out there. Anytime we saw something, \"Oh, this is for the Mollys, this is for the Mollys.\" We put stuff together, we built racks and when the girls came in for their fittings, they were able to pull looks together that were individual enough for each character, but still represented the Molly look.\nNow I love when an actor is permitted that sort of creative collaboration with directors and costume designers to help figure out the look of their character. I'm curious what that process was like for you in talking with your actors, talking with Nahnatchka, and finding a good blend of what everybody wanted?\nPatti Henderson: Oh, for sure, definitely a collaborative project. I think it was very important, especially for Natch and myself, there's a fine line between character and caricature, I always say, and you have to pull back a little bit so that it's not too humorous and believable. I think we pulled it off with our color palette for the '80s. We went with softer tones, pinks, lighter blues, like teals, the florals, the pearls, the preppy looks, we had to make sure that it was believable. Then, when we flipped over to the Gen Z, we went with a color palette that was a little cooler jewel tones, if you will, to differentiate, because a lot of the kids now are pulling from the '80s, they're pulling from the '90s, they're pulling from Y2K. So it was very, very important collaboratively, even with my background team, to make sure that they were dressing the background that played in the scenes in each era appropriately, so that it was believable. Olivia and I had an interesting time in the fitting room, because I just pulled in four racks, and I let her start going through the racks, and obviously she didn't live the '80s, and at one point, I said to her, \"I'm having trouble reading you.\" She was like, \"Oh, it's just all so good!\" We had a great time pulling looks together, and she goes, \"Yeah, I love this, or that maybe doesn't work as well.\" But I'm very open to making the actors happy and comfortable, as well as producers, directors, let's work on this together.\nThat's great. Now, I also wanted to talk about the look of the killer in particular, the slasher genre has seen so many iconic looks for killers throughout the years. I love the sort of Max Headroom-style mask that he wears. Can you talk me through that development process of coming up with a look for him?\nPatti Henderson: Absolutely. Tony Gardner built that mask, Tony Gardner of Alterian, and his team and I had worked with him on Curse and Cult of Chucky in the past, so we're quite tight, we're good friends. We sat down and discussed with Natch, of course, and other producers, because we wanted this iconic look for this killer. We want him to be remembered like Freddy or Jason, you know what I mean? We want to add him to the list. So, it wasn't just Max Headroom, there were some iconic actors that we pulled some looks from — I don't know if you notice the jawline, little earring, to bring a look that the audience was going to go, \"Ah,\" and remember. It was important for me to build a costume that flowed with him time traveling, something that was relevant to today, something that was relevant to the '80s. So what I did is I jumped back even further to the '50s, and I pulled a silhouette from James Dean, his bomber jackets that he would wear, his dark denim jeans with a cuff rolled up. I gave the killer Red Wing boots, which I think have been around since the turn of the century. Things that no matter where he time traveled to, he would fit in well. It was also important for me with the killer's look that there was a bit of texture given to that costume, so it wasn't just an all-black look, hiding in the bushes kind of thing. So the jacket was actually a navy bomber that had some sheen to it, so it caught bits of the light and the camera would catch bits shining off of it. The mask really worked well to pull that whole look together, but the key part of that look that was the ‘80s but also contemporary — because a lot of kids are wearing t-shirts that they're pulling from the racks from the ‘80s or from their parents’ closets, right. So the t-shirt that he was wearing was a nod to Don Johnson in Miami Vice. We created our own little logo, so there's a guy leaning against a sports car, a vintage car with the palm tree and the sunset in the background. We just dressed it a little bit, worked collaboratively with the art department, graphic designer and Natch to come up with a look that is going to be memorable, and people are gonna go, “Ooh.”\nI love that, even down to the graphic tee, I don't see killers wear graphic tees in movies, so that's kind of a cool little twist. Now, when it comes to whodunnit-style slashers, there's, you have to hide the mystery of who it is until it comes time for the big reveal. How did that factor into your process in creating this costume? It's easy enough to hide with gloves and the mask, but how did you go about you making sure that the rest of the costume still kept secret?\nPatti Henderson: Well, it was definitely the silhouette, the silhouette of the look, and it had to work with whoever was wearing the costume at any given moment. Right? Whether it be a stunt performer or — I don't want to give any spoiler alerts here — the eventual killer and, you know, Chris Dubasage with his touring group of podcast people in the beginning. It was just important that the silhouette and the cut was going to work on a variety of people. But like you said, the gloves were very important to hide things, and Tony and I talked about the mask coming down far enough that the costume can come up. We did put a hoodie on him for layers, so that you couldn't really tell if the person was slight or if they were a bit built bigger built, and I think it worked.\nI definitely agree, because that's something that I always kind of keep an eye out for after the Scream franchise sort of set that in motion. We've got reviews coming out now for Totally Killer, they seem to be very positive, which I'm very happy for now that I've seen the movie. How are you feeling?\nPatti Henderson: I'm absolutely thrilled. This was a fun project that I was extremely excited to be invited to participate in.

{"title": "Is The Crown Season 6 The Last One?", "date": "2023-10-10 22:00:26", "text": "The Crown has been a huge hit for Netflix, but will season 6 be the final outing of the Emmy-winning series chronicling the lives of British royalty?\nThe Crown has become an award-winning sensation, with audiences captivated by this fictional retelling of the life of Queen Elizabeth II, and there have been many questions about whether season 6 will be the show's final outing. Premiering in 2016, The Crown became a multiple Emmy-winning Netflix show that takes viewers through the complicated life of the British monarch. Although there has never been a shortage of content about British royalty, this series has solidified itself as a standout favorite within the genre.\nThe last five seasons of the show have performed very well, which raises the question of how much more of The Crown viewers can expect. Luckily, Netflix has confirmed how many seasons the series will run, so fans know what to expect going into The Crown season 6. The new episodes are sure to deliver the same amount of intrigue and tension as prior outings,\nGiven The Crown's massive popularity, it may come as a surprise that season 6 marks the Netflix show's ending. The new episodes will bring the series to a close, and Netflix's Tudum elaborated on what viewers can expect from these installments. Although The Crown is building toward its series finale, season 6 will include the beginnings of Prince William and Kate Middleton's romance. A royal wedding for Prince Charles and Camilla is also on the agenda, and Queen Elizabeth II will reflect on her reign in the final episodes.\nRelated: 6 Will & Kate Storylines That Should Be In The Crown Season 6\nThe Crown season 6 will contain 10 episodes in total, though their release schedule on Netflix will be different from previous seasons. The first four installments of season 6 will be available on Netflix on November 16, 2023. The Crown will then be on hiatus until December 14, at which point the final six episodes will be available to stream.\nThere is no definitive answer as to why The Crown is taking a different route in terms of how episodes are going to be available to stream. Netflix has chosen to utilize the \"binge model\" with its previous seasons, dropping all the episodes at one time. While a two-part outing is unprecedented for The Crown, it's not out of the ordinary for the platform overall. Perhaps hoping to compete with the weekly release models of Disney+ and Max, Netflix has utilized this split-release method with recent seasons of Stranger Things, You, and The Witcher.\nThese happen to be some of Netflix's most popular original series, which indicates that the streamer could be splitting up the seasons to create further buzz. Given that it's The Crown's final season, it makes sense that Netflix might want to prolong the excitement and chatter surrounding it for as long as possible — even if that means viewers won't find out what happens to their favorite characters from The Crown for a little longer.\nIf you asked Aleena Malik at any point in her life what her passion was, she would confidently tell you it was writing.

Spoilers ahead for Fire & Ice: Welcome to Smallville #2!The Justice League's passionate hero Fire is lending a hand to supervillains, but not for the most altruistic reasons. As Bea da Costa continues to struggle to adapt to the quaint life of Smallville, the firebrand finds a new way to reinvigorate her career by chasing after social media clout.\nThe iconic Justice League International member's life has been on a downswing ever since she got into a row with Green Lantern Guy Gardner. After Fire's fight with Guy nearly harmed the city of Boston, Superman suggested that she and her longtime partner Ice take some time for themselves in his hometown of Smallville.\nAs the duo moved to the town and began their new lives, Ice was far more excited at the opportunity they'd been given. Ice opened a hair salon and began mingling with the locals. Unfortunately, Fire was less happy with their situation. Desperate to be taken seriously in the superhero community again, Fire began cold-calling other heroes, including the whacky hero Ambush Bug for help.\nIn Fire & Ice: Welcome to Smallville #2 by Joanne Starer and Natacha Bustos, Fire is attempting to revitalize her career by using the social media site Fabgab, but her videos of beating up Ambush Bug aren't doing well. Fire drowns her sorrows in a local bar where she meets Charlie Rhoades, a wheelchair-using bar owner. Fire discovers that Charlie has a huge following on Fabgab due to the inspirational nature of his content. This inspires Bea to hire low-level supervillains to work at Ice's salon as part of a 'rehabilitation' program to give criminals a second chance. Ice, however, is disgusted when she realizes Fire is just using the villains and the salon to bolster her own public image.\nUnlike Ice, who actually likes the town they're in, Fire is willing to do whatever it takes to get out of Smallville. But Superman has made it clear that he won't tolerate supervillain activity or devastating fights in his hometown. That pretty much limits what Bea can do to try and revitalize her superhero career other than use the internet to keep her in the public's eye until she can figure out her next move. While it's not the worst idea, Bea's plan is particularly short-sighted. Fire has no interest in actually rehabilitating her employees, meaning she could be setting up Smallville for a disaster.\nHelping supervillains gain stable employment and giving them a chance to redeem themselves is a noble pursuit. But Fire doesn't actually care about helping these villains, she just wants out of Smallville. In her bid to chase internet fame, she's unnecessarily putting Smallville at risk by bringing in a bunch of criminals without proper vetting all for the sake of getting back into the superhero community. Ironically, had Fire actually cared about this endeavor, she could wind up getting what she desires. But the Justice Leaguer's overeagerness for internet points may wind up harming Smallville.

The movie was one of many removed from Disney's streaming platform earlier this year, alongside popular TV shows like Willow. However, in late September, six removed films - including notable titles such as Crater and The One and Only Ivan - were added to premium video-on-demand services like Amazon and Vudu.\nNow, TheWrap reports even more removed Disney+ films are available to rent and buy on PVOD platforms, including the critically panned Artemis Fowl movie. Other new additions to PVOD platforms include Stargirl, Hollywood Stargirl, Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made, and Wolfgang. As of writing, the only unavailable removed Disney+ originals include Magic Camp, Darby and the Dead, and Black Beauty.\nA large purge of Disney+ content happened in May of this year, resulting in the removal of 12 movies and dozens of shows from the streaming service. By June, it was reported that Disney got a $1.5 billion write-off for content they removed from both Disney+ and Hulu. Because of this, it appears the removal of so many shows and films was motivated by profit.\nWhile most of the movies removed from Disney+ are now accessible through PVOD, all the TV series cannot be accounted for. This includes shows like Willow, which was initially reported to be on hiatus following season 1 until the show was removed from Disney+. With so much content still lost because of the purge, it's unclear where the still-missing media will end up if it manages to return.\nDisney+ still has plenty of projects on the way, such as more shows in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the highly-anticipated Percy Jackson and the Olympians TV show. However, this doesn't negate how difficult it became to find movies like Artemis Fowl and how impossible it is to seek out removed content without a home anymore. The PVOD releases of these latest Disney+ movies could mean more removed content from the platform will resurface in the future.\nSource: TheWrap\n"}

Released in 2013, the comedy film follows four friends who take a break from retired life to throw a wild bachelor party in Las Vegas for their last remaining single pal. The Last Vegas cast features four celebrated and seasoned stars – Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Kline – who went a long way toward making the movie a modest box-office success.\nNow, a decade after Last Vegas was released in theaters, the star-studded comedy is now a hit on Netflix. For the week of October 2 to October 8, Last Vegas received 7.2 million viewing hours and 4.1 million total views, ranking 8th on the charts and marking its first week in Netflix's Global Top 10.\nAt the time of its release in 2013, Last Vegas opened to $16 million and came in third place at the box office. It ended its theatrical run with a final worldwide gross of $134 million, nearly five times its budget of $28 million. The comedy's box office success gave its distributor, CBS Films, its highest-grossing release in its history, which begs the question of why, after only a decade, Last Vegas has largely been forgotten and is only now being rediscovered on Netflix.\nRelated: 10 Hidden Gems On Netflix That You Probably Haven't Seen\nDespite its modest box office success, Last Vegas was disregarded by critics as a retread of The Hangover with an older cast. This resulted in a 46 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, where its audience score of 59 percent suggests that those who saw the film shared similar sentiments. The film's four stars, none of which had ever shared the screen before Last Vegas, went a long way towards making the movie watchable, though it appears to offer little else. Even though Last Vegas may have been forgotten, audiences are now rediscovering it on Netflix.\nSource: Netflix\n"}
{"title": "Alucard’s Return In Castlevania: Nocturne Explained (& What It Means For Season 2)", "date": "2023-10-10 22:10:27", "text": "Alucard the vampire made a triumphant return in Castlevania: Nocturne's season 1 finale, which promises big things for the forthcoming season 2.\nWarning: Major spoilers for the ending of Castlevania: Nocturne below!\nAlucard returned when all seemed lost in Castlevania: Nocturne, which means big things for season 2. Netflix's Castlevania was one of the first video game adaptations to receive a (mostly) positive critical reception. It managed to appeal to both fans of the games and newcomers, and after it came to an end after four seasons in 2021, a spinoff titled Nocturne was quickly announced. Given how audiences had grown to love the core cast of characters - consisting of Richard Armitage's Trevor Belmont, Sypha (Alejandra Reynoso), and James Callis' Alucard - Nocturne's announcement was met with a mixed response.\nThankfully this sequel series, which is set 300 years after the events of Castlevania, proved to be a worthy successor. Nocturne loosely adapts Rondo of Blood and Symphony of the Night and follows Trevor's descendant Richter (Edward Bluemel) and Speaker Maria (Pixie Davies) as they try to stop an apocalyptic vampire plot during the French Revolution. Despite their best efforts, they utterly fail to prevent Erzsebet Báthory (Franka Potente) from causing a solar eclipse that allows vampires to move during the daytime. In Castlevania: Nocturne's ending, when all looks hopeless, an old friend shows up to save the day/night.\nRelated: Castlevania: Nocturne Cast & Character Guide\nAfter Erzsebet's eclipse has plunged the city into darkness, Richter, Maria and the other heroes flee from her vampire forces. Nocturne's other major villain Drolta (Elarica Johnson) gives chase and soon catches up to them. As she prepares to strike, she's suddenly impaled by Alucard's sword, and after Drolta takes a moment to reflect on her abrupt change in fortune, she perishes. Alucard then faces her minions, declaring himself the son of Dracula and that he will slay them all if they attack; they wisely flee instead.\nIt appears the events of the original Castlevania have largely faded in the centuries that have passed, as sorceress Annette (Thuso Mbedu) has never heard of Dracula, while Richter always thought Alucard was just a myth. Of course, Alucard quickly recognizes Richter as a Belmont descendant thanks to his trademark whip, but time will tell if the two become besties like Alucard became with the late Trevor.\nWhile he showed up in the nick of time in Nocturne's finale, the question remains as to why Alucard didn't show up even sooner. Given that he's one of the most powerful vampires in existence, he may have been able to prevent Báthory's plot from succeeding had he appeared even a little earlier. This is a question Castlevania: Nocturne season 2 - which has since been confirmed by Netflix - will likely address, as Alucard's brief cameo in the finale doesn't have time to address it.\nRelated: How Castlevania: Nocturne Is Connected To Castlevania\nIn the finale of the original series, Alucard was last seen with Sypha and Trevor as they planned to establish a village for the Danesti refugees following Death's defeat. Presumably, much has changed for Alucard in the centuries between Castlevania and Nocturne, and he may have even gone into another long slumber, which is how Trevor and Sypha first met the vampire in season 1. While he may have been late to the party in the spinoff, he will no doubt be instrumental in reversing Báthory's plan in the next series.\nGiven that Trevor and Sypha are very much human, there was little chance of them returning for Nocturne. The new series wisely decided to use the first season to establish the new heroes and villains instead before re-introducing Alucard, giving viewers a chance to invest in them first. In truth, the overpowered Alucard would have quickly turned the tide had he arrived before the season finale, so his delayed entrance was all the more impactful.\nThat doesn't mean he, Richter or the show's other heroes will have an easy time during the second season. Outside of possibly Dracula himself, Erzsebet Báthory might now be the most powerful vampire in existence with an army of vampires and night creatures at her command, in addition to some human allies. Alucard and his teleporting castle (assuming he still has it) will give the heroes time to regroup and plan how to undo the mess. That said, with Maria's mother Tera (Nastassja Kinski) now a vampire servant of Báthory, things are liable to get even more complicated for the spinoff's heroes.\nAlucard's return was the perfect season 2 hook for Castlevania: Nocturne, and it will be interesting to see how the character has evolved in the 300 years since he last appeared. His return also leaves open the possibility that Dracula himself (Graham McTavish) could make an appearance, as the character was resurrected in season 4's finale without Alucard's knowledge. Father and son working together to save the world in the next season might just be enough to turn the tide in the heroes' favor.\n"}
{"title": "Where Was Stephen King's Rose Red Filmed? Mansion & Seattle Filming Locations Explained", "date": "2023-10-10 22:21:25", "text": "The 2002 miniseries Rose Red was crafted by Stephen King and depicted the mysteries of a haunted house in Seattle, but was it filmed in Washington?\nStephen King loosely adapted Shirley Jackson's 1959 novel The Haunting of Hill House into a television miniseries, Rose Red, set in Seattle, Washington, where all three episodes were filmed. The horror show revolved around an infamous haunted mansion in the Pacific Northwest, and the name of the house was Rose Red, hence the name of the series. A group of parapsychologists and psychics traveled to the mansion to investigate the hauntings and supernatural happenings, leading to a series of unfortunate events.\nThe cast of Rose Red included Nancy Travis as Dr. Joyce Reardon, Matt Keeslar as Steve Rimbauer, Melanie Lynskey as Rachel \"Sissy\" Wheaton, Kimberly J. Brown as Annie Wheaton, Judith Ivey as Cathy Kramer, Matt Ross as Emery Waterman, Julian Sands as Nick Hardaway, Emily Deschanel as Pam Asbury, Kevin Tighe as Victor \"Vic\" Kandinsky, David Dukes as Dr. Carl Miller, Laura Kenny as Patricia Waterman, Jimmi Simpson as Kevin Bollinger, Richard Sanders as Mr. Stanton, Tsidii Le Loka as Sukeena, and Yvonne Sciò as Deanna Petrie. From August to December 2000, the cast and crew of the ABC horror miniseries filmed in and around Seattle, Washington.\nThe most prominent location used in Rose Red is the Thornewood Castle in Lakewood, Washington, which is just south of Seattle and Tacoma. According to Thornewood Castle's official website, the castle was the setting for the Rose Red mansion in Stephen King's miniseries. It was built in the early 1900s from a dismantled 15th-century English house, and as of today, the estate functions as a bed and breakfast, wedding, vacation, and event rental space. But in the early 2000s, the Rose Red production team restored the house and worked on it to ensure it fit King's vision for the spooky story.\nExterior shots of Thornewood Castle were captured for the three-episode television show, but the cast and crew were also able to film specific scenes inside the mansion. Two bedrooms and the billiard room were used during the production, so the Thornewood Castle played an integral part in the making of the series. Ultimately, the exquisite building was the most important location for the development of Rose Red, which is why the network and the producers scoured over numerous proposals from different mansions across the country before settling on Thornewood Castle because it was the best fit for King's script.\nRelated: Is Rose Red Based On A Stephen King Book? Inspirations Explained\nThe University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, can also be spotted in a handful of scenes in Rose Red. The college's campus doubled as the fictional school — Beaumont University — in the 2002 ABC miniseries. The University of Washington was founded in 1861, making it one of the oldest universities on the West Coast, and it currently serves as a public research college. Given its expansive and beautiful campus, the University of Washington has been the setting for numerous films and television shows, including 10 Things I Hate About You and The Sex Lives of College Girls.\nThe Space Needle is one of the most noteworthy landmarks in Seattle, Washington, so it would only make sense if it was featured in a television show set in the western city, aka Rose Red. The observation tower was constructed in 1961 for the 1962 World's Fair, and at the time, the Space Needle was the tallest structure not only in Seattle but also west of the Mississippi River. As of today, that is not the case, but the Space Needle is still one of the Seattle skyline's defining features. Related: Stephen King's Rose Red Was Originally A Remake Of The Haunting\nThe cast and crew of Rose Red used plenty of exterior sets to tell the scary story in the ABC miniseries, including the southeast neighborhood of Mount Baker in Seattle, Washington. One of the houses in the jurisdiction was utilized as the setting of the home that was destroyed by a rain of stones in the television show. As a result, the location is easy to spot while watching Rose Red.\nThe Mount Baker neighborhood has a clear view of Mount Baker (hence its name) in the Cascade Volcanic Arc and the North Cascades of Washington. The area is also right on Lake Washington, so it is home to many breathtaking natural landmarks, making it the perfect location for the aforementioned scene in Stephen King's horror series.\nOf course, the Rose Red production team could not only use practical locations for the three-episode miniseries. So, they built sets at the Sand Point Naval Space in the Sand Point neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, for interior scenes. The crew utilized three airplane hangars at the abandoned naval base to construct the specific sets they needed to capture the essence of Stephen King's script for the show based on Shirley Jackson's book The Haunting of Hill House.\nThese sets at the Sand Point Naval Space included rooms at the Rose Red haunted mansion that they could not use in the Thornewood Castle. The production team built an expansive set for the great hall in the house and other interior settings for the show. So, while watching Rose Red, the scenes in the mansion's great hall were not actually captured at Thornewood Castle. Instead, they were filmed at the Sand Point Naval Space. Unfortunately, those Rose Red sets were torn down following the conclusion of principal photography, so they cannot be visited, unlike Thornewood Castle.\nThe intersection of Spring Street and Seventh Avenue in Seattle, Washington, was the fictional setting for the Rose Red mansion in Rose Red. Since the actual building that doubled as the haunted house in the ABC television show was located in Lakewood, Washington, and not Seattle, the producers had to use a fake address for the fake mansion. However, in real life, the crossroads of those two streets is nowhere near the Thornewood Castle and is not as picturesque as the fictional setting in Stephen King's Rose Red.\nRelated: Every Stephen King Miniseries, Ranked Worst to Best\nThe final location used for Stephen King's 2002 horror miniseries was the Artic Building in Seattle, Washington. The Artic Building is a hotel originally built in 1914 for a group of socialites who benefited from Alaska's gold rush, and it contains a beautiful dome that doubled as the Rose Red mansion's library in the television show. As mentioned above, not every scene that took place in the haunted house in Rose Red was filmed at Thornewood Castle, even though a majority of sequences were captured there.\nSource: Thornewood Castle\n\n\n "}
{"title": "Strange New Worlds Season 3 Won’t Repeat Star Trek Into Darkness’ Carol Marcus Mistake", "date": "2023-10-10 22:31:26", "text": "If Carol Marcus appears in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3, the controversy surrounding Star Trek Into Darkness won't be repeated.\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3 won't repeat Star Trek Into Darkness' Carol Marcus mistake if she appears. Strange New Worlds season 2 brought Lt. James T. Kirk (Paul Wesley) aboard the USS Enterprise commanded by Captain Christopher Pike (Anson Mount). Kirk formed bonds with his future Enterprise crew mates Ensign Nyota Uhura (Celia Rose Gooding) and Lt. Spock (Ethan Peck) as well as Lt. La'an Noonien-Singh (Christina Chong). But Kirk also dropped a bombshell on La'an that curbed their possible romantic pairing: He has a pregnant girlfriend named Carol, who can only be Carol Marcus.\nDr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch) was introduced in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan as the inventor of the Genesis Device, which she built with David Marcus (Merritt Butrick), her son with Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner). Kirk and Carol were estranged for many years, and Jim wasn't involved in raising David at her request. Jim and Carol reunited after Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalban) stole and weaponized the terraforming power of the Genesis Device. After Khan was defeated, Kirk and Carol parted ways once more. The alternate Kelvin Timeline's version of Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) appeared in J.J. Abrams' Star Trek Into Darkness, but the filmmakers' controversial attempt to add Carol as a new female lead character on the USS Enterprise badly misfired.\nRelated: Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Cast - Every New & Returning Character In Season 2\nIf Carol Marcus appears in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3, the hit Paramount+ prequel won't make the same mistake Star Trek Into Darkness made by having Carol gratuitously strip to her underwear in front of Lt. James T. Kirk. As James told La'an, Carol is pregnant with David at that point, so if she does join the cast in Strange New Worlds season 3, Carol would either still be with child or just newly delivered baby David. Either way, flaunting Carol as a sex object wouldn't be on Strange New Worlds' agenda if they introduce the future creator of the Genesis Device.\nStrange New Worlds season 2 took some big creative swings that paid off, such as mounting a crossover with Star Trek: Lower Decks and presenting Star Trek's first-ever musical episode. But Strange New Worlds' creative team will surely not repeat Star Trek Into Darkness' blunder by hypersexualizing Carol Marcus if she appears. Strange New Worlds' Carol would be the younger version of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan's career-driven Dr. Marcus while Alice Eve's Carol in Star Trek Into Darkness was a Kelvin Timeline reinvention that was reflective of J.J. Abrams' intent to make his young USS Enterprise crew more sexually charged.\nStar Trek Into Darkness ignited controversy over Carol Marcus changing out of her uniform after telling Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) to \"turn around\" and Kirk disobeying and getting an eye full of Carol in her underwear. Critics of the scene point to it being gratuitous eye candy with no bearing on the film's story. J.J. Abrams and his team offered an apology while Alice Eve herself is proud of her role as Carol and doesn't understand why that scene upset people. However, Star Trek Into Darkness was released in 2013 when the #MeToo movement was starting to hold abusers of women in Hollywood accountable, and audiences pushed back at Star Trek Into Darkness exploiting Carol Marcus and Alice Eve's sex appeal.\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds certainly has an attractive cast, but the prequel series hasn't gone for gratuitous eye-candy moments. Characters like Captain Pike and Captain Marie Batel (Melanie Scofano) sleep together on Strange New Worlds, but the show doesn't hypersexualize any of its characters the way J.J. Abrams' Star Trek movies or Star Trek: Enterprise did with T'Pol (Jolene Blalock). If Carol Marcus does appear in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3, it will be under very different circumstances than in Star Trek Into Darkness, and she will be a different character than Alice Eve's Carol.\nJohn Orquiola is Screen Rant's Star Trek Beat Editor, Senior Features staff writer, and interviewer."}
{"title": "Is The Exorcist: Believer A Box Office Bomb? Breaking Down Its $27M Opening", "date": "2023-10-10 22:31:26", "text": "Reviews for The Exorcist: Believer claim it's a critical failure, but it may not be a commercial flop due to a number of key factors discussed here.\nThe underwhelming critical reception to The Exorcist: Believer raises the question of whether the latest Exorcist film will become a box office flop. The Exorcist: Believer made its worldwide debut on October 6, 2023, one week ahead of its previously scheduled release date of October 13, 2023, in an attempt to avoid box-office competition with the highly-anticipated Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour. While The Eras Tour has already generated over $100 million in pre-ticket sales alone, The Exorcist: Believer has yet to break even on its reported production budget from its opening weekend domestic ticket sales.\nWith The Exorcist: Deceiver already in the works for a 2025 release, the poor critical and commercial response to The Exorcist: Believer places the entire franchise in jeopardy. Director David Gordon Green, most well-known for his successful reboot of the Halloween franchise in 2018, seems to have bitten off more than he could chew in modernizing an Exorcist franchise that has struggled to find relevancy and success in the 50 years since the original film came out. Universal Pictures is still likely to move forward with its planned Exorcist trilogy, although it won't be clear whether Green will again be at the helm until the box office numbers are finalized in the coming weeks.\nRELATED: 8 Biggest Takeaways From The Exorcist: Believer's Scathing Reviews\nThe Exorcist: Believer was extensively marketed and hyped up, even becoming an episodic theme for the popular reality show Big Brother the week leading up to its premiere. The Exorcist: Believers' box office fell short of expectations that initially predicted the film to generate between $30-35 million domestically in its opening weekend. With a total box office opening weekend sum of roughly $26.5 million domestically and nearly $44 million globally, The Exorcist: Believer didn't live up to its potential out of the gate, although it was not too far off from initial estimates.\nWith a production budget of $30 million, The Exorcist: Believer still has ample time come Halloween season to prevent it from becoming the biggest flop in The Exorcist franchise. The original film became a cultural phenomenon and a landmark in cinematic history, generating nearly $231 million domestically and just under $429 million at the worldwide box office. The Exorcist had a budget of $12 million in 1973, which is roughly equivalent to $83 million in 2023 adjusting for inflation. The Exorcist II: The Heretic generated $25 million from a $14 million budget in 1977, while the greatest flop of the franchise was 2004's Exorcist: The Beginning, raking in just under $44 million globally from a whopping $78 million budget.\nUniversal and Peacock paid $400M for the rights to the right to the upcoming Exorcist trilogy. Keeping this in mind, the threshold for how much the movie needs to be successful is certainly higher considering the implications of how the other two expected Exorcist movies will fare in the coming years. Because of the underwhelming critical reception and early box office indicators of The Exorcist: Believer, there could already be some cause for concern about the longevity and overall quality of The Exorcist: Deceiver and beyond. It could be potentially disastrous for Universal, Peacock, and Blumhouse if the sequels end up being canceled after the bad reviews and box office for Believer.\nRather than a total abandonment of the new Exorcist trilogy, a substitution in the director's chair will be a much more likely outcome of Believer can't recover this Halloween season. While David Gordon Green still receives a great deal of credit for revitalizing Halloween in 2018 and making one of the best installments in that horror franchise, his subsequent efforts of Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends were widely disappointing as well. Considering the heightened stakes of a new Exorcist trilogy that will still likely happen under Universal's and Peacock's $400 million deal, a fresh take on the franchise might be the best course of action with Green no longer at the helm.\nRELATED: The Exorcist: Believer Ending Explained\nThe best thing that The Exorcist: Believer has going for it is its relatively minuscule budget of $30 million. The film nearly made all of that back in its opening weekend domestically, and it surpassed that number by well over 33% globally in just a matter of days. The Halloween draw to see horror movies in theaters will also likely give The Exorcist: Believer a much-needed boost at the box office. The Exorcist: Believer could also benefit greatly from the general lack of horror films coming to theaters in October 2023. Setting a low financial bar with its modest budget could end up being The Exorcist: Believer's saving grace.\nIt's also worth noting that critical reception for The Exorcist: Believer is slightly harsher than if it were a standalone independent horror movie. No Exorcist sequel has been able to scratch the surface in terms of quality and impact as the original 1973 film, which still holds up to this day. While seeing The Exorcist in theaters this Halloween season is always the safer bet, there is still modern life in The Exorcist franchise with this latest installment. The Exorcist: Believer could surprisingly turn some heads with a box office comeback as the Halloween holiday draws nearer.\n"}
{"title": "10 Black Adam Quotes That Prove He's DC's Most Cold-Blooded Hero", "date": "2023-10-10 22:31:26", "text": "Black Adam’s fists may hit hard, but his parting remarks hit even harder. These top ten quotes prove Teth-Adam is the ultimate anti-hero.\nBlack Adam is one of DC’s most enigmatic characters, fluid in his morality in a way that is paralleled by few other hero or villain. Despite being colored in shades of ever-changing grays, Teth-Adam stands unwaveringly resolute in his commitment to safeguarding the nation of Kahndaq and its people, guided by his steadfast belief that \"Adam knows best.\"\nImposing for his powers, and his will, Black Adam is also known for his sharp tongue. Across decades of comic history, this cold-blooded hero's narrative has accumulated an array of badass quotes, each a testament to his unyielding spirit and a reflection of his formidable strength. Below are ten quotes that prove Black Adam is not to be messed with.\nBlack Adam is the ultimate defender. He puts his country and people above all else, and will go as far as it takes to protect what is his, even if that means whispering death threats in the ear of a child. In Black Adam: Year of the Villain #1, Shazam, Jokerized by the Batman Who Laughs, makes a grievous error, attempting to invade Black Adam's nation. While Shazam initially gains the upper hand in their confrontation, Black Adam ultimately prevails with the assistance of his fellow country people. Before letting Billy go, Black Adam imparts a stern, calculated warning to dissuade the young hero from ever returning.\nBlack Adam's viciousness protective of his people and country is rendered beautifully in Injustice: Gods Among Us Vol. 2, when the anti-hero seeks retribution for children killed in a shelling attack. This justification makes Black Adam incredibly easy to sympathize with, even as he's ripping Cyborg's arm off, for daring to get in his way. The insult hurled at the former Teen Titan is wholly Teth-Adam, balancing his indignant righteousness with his unintentionally funny side. Lines such as this are the perfect example of what makes a good anti-hero, a morally gray champion of the people, who justifies their raw violence with the pain they share with those they try to protect.\nRelated: DC's New Justice League Is Complete as a Shocking Leader Takes Control\nWhen it comes to asserting dominance, and being absolutely unapologetic about it, Black Adam is the reigning champion. The quote, \"Bow to me, or they perish,\" encapsulates the essence of his character as the ultimate badass. In the midst of a confrontation with a formidable Frost Giant in Black Adam: Endless Winter Special #1, Black Adam's indomitable spirit shines through. It is not merely enough for him to emerge victorious in battle; he demands nothing short of absolute subservience from the ice-like behemoth. Black Adam's unyielding resolve and unapologetic assertion of power solidify Black Adam's status as one of DC's most compelling warriors.\nIn Christopher Priest's Black Adam #6, Batman and the Black Adam engage fiercely, sparing neither punches nor harsh words. When Batman delves into Black Adam's past, presuming to know him better than Adam himself, the anti-hero firmly asserts his self-awareness and identity, making it clear he doesn't need Batman's reminders. Black Adam openly acknowledges his past as a slave, embracing it as part of his history. However, in the same breath, he boldly declares his current identity, a testament to his newfound power, strength, and control. The powerful declaration makes it clear to Batman that he has no right to try to tell Teth-Adam who he is.\nRelated: Black Adam's New Comic Just Made Him A Hero, Not A Villain\nIn Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths #7, following a massive battle between villains and heroes, Black Adam confronts Clark and Jon, issuing a warning that leaves no room for doubt that he will retaliate if they involve themselves in his affairs. This underscores his formidable nature, a reminder he's not a force to be trifled with. Yet, the warning is softened when he pays Jon a compliment, while simultaneously delivering a stinging insult to Clark. This deft blend of respect and provocation speaks volumes about Black Adam's character. He is far from a one-dimensional figure – neither completely arrogant nor soft, but a captivating mix of strength, cunning, and complexity.\nIn the realm of anti-heroes, few characters embody the complex nature of redemption and morality as vividly as Black Adam. Adam’s belief that there is no redemption for him, as expressed in Black Adam (2022) #2, reflects the haunting echoes of his conscience, tormenting him for his ruthless act of slaying his own nephew in order to obtain his powers. In Adam's eyes, his nephew was too feeble to wield the extraordinary gift bestowed upon him by the gods, so Adam seized it for himself, believing he had greater inner strength. This internal struggle between merciless actions and resignation that redemption is out of reach defines Black Adam's identity as the ultimate anti-hero.\nIn a display of his unyielding resolve from Justice League of America Feat Black Adam #7.4, Black Adam delivers an unforgettable line, one that solidifies his status as the ultimate cold-blooded hero. When the Secret Society launches a brazen assault on Kahndaq, seeking to claim the nation's power and subjugate its people, the need for Black Adam to return to his people after a noticeable absence, is crucial. The anti-hero dispatching the Society's leader with a throne chair is poetic justice at its finest, serving as a symbol of both his power and the consequences that befall those who dare try to take Kahndaq under their control.\nRelated: 10 Best Black Adam Storylines In DC Comics\nIn a bone-chilling moment that epitomizes the cold-blooded nature of Black Adam, the quote, \"I will show you war!\" captures one of his darkest storylines, World War III. In this comic, Black Adam unleashes his unrestrained wrath upon the world, leaving a trail of devastation in his wake as he massacres thousands. Among his grim casualties is the death of Terra, a former Teen Titan who dared to confront him. In this gut-wrenching act, Black Adam's ruthless resolve stands exposed, showcasing his sheer brutality as he punches a hole through Terra’s chest, solidifying his reputation as one of the DC Universe's most fierce, unrepentant characters.\nEven Black Adam, the poster child for tyranny in the name of the greater good, recognizes that Superman had gone too far in Injustice: Gods Among Us Vol. 2, and tries to impart a poignant truth to the Man of Steel. If Superman had taken a moment to engage in some self-reflection, rather than punching holes through people to solve his problems, Black Adam's profound and startlingly candor might have struck a chord with the grieving hero. It is undeniable that this scene gave Black Adam his well-deserved 'death of an anti-hero' moment, complete with last words that were nothing short of solemnly perfect.\n52 sees Black Adam embark on a vengeful crusade against the malevolent forces responsible for unleashing the Four Horsemen upon his home and family. With the heroes of the world scrambling to strategize, Black Adam takes matters into his own hands, engaging in an epic showdown, culminating with him killing Death itself. What makes the final battle truly amazing are Adam's parting words for the Horseman, as he assumes the role of Death for himself. At that moment, Black Adam emerges as a force to be reckoned with, the ultimate badass who walks the fine line between darkness and redemption, embodying the essence of the cold-blooded hero like never before.\nCombining her love for DC and her experience as an Intelligence Analyst, Taylor began writing for Screen Rant in 2023.

{"title": "Star Wars Theory Introduces A Third New Galaxy & Sets Up Intergalactic Adventures", "date": "2023-10-10 22:35:28", "text": "Star Wars sets up the introduction of another galaxy after Ahsoka with Skeleton Crew potentially offering more intergalactic adventures.\nA new Star Wars theory sets up the introduction of another galaxy in the near future with the franchise fully embracing intergalactic travel. As seen in Ahsoka, travel between galaxies was introduced with the world of Peridea, the world in which Grand Admiral Thrawn and Jedi Ezra Bridger were exiled for nearly a decade. However, Star Wars could be going even further with Skeleton Crew, the next Star Wars show which is set to star actor Jude Law as a primary protagonist during the New Republic era.\nRecently, a synopsis for the upcoming Skeleton Crew show teases the potential for another galaxy. Set for a tentative release at the end of 2023, this would mean that Skeleton Crew could follow Ahsoka's lead by featuring more extragalactic worlds existing outside the confines of the known Star Wars galaxy. To that end, it's also possible that new methods of intergalactic travel could be introduced as well, potentially even bringing back an old Legends concept into the established Star Wars canon.\nThe new description for the upcoming Skeleton Crew series coming to Disney+ from director Jon Watts is rather intriguing:\n\n\"In the first episode of the Skeleton Crew we are introduced to four kids who make a mysterious discovery on their seemingly safe home planet and get lost in a strange and dangerous galaxy. Finding their way home, meeting unlikely allies and enemies, will be a greater adventure than they ever imagined.\"\n\n\"In the first episode of the Skeleton Crew we are introduced to four kids who make a mysterious discovery on their seemingly safe home planet and get lost in a strange and dangerous galaxy. Finding their way home, meeting unlikely allies and enemies, will be a greater adventure than they ever imagined.\"\nWhat's important to note is that this synopsis doesn't confirm these kids will be stranded in their own galaxy. Instead, it's possible that these kids could be coming from their home galaxy and find themselves stranded in the known Star Wars galaxy. As such, it stands to reason that they'll be interacting with foreign concepts such as the Jedi, Imperial Remnant, and New Republic (which are of course established and known to the audience).This falls in line with the Skeleton Crew footage that was shown at Star Wars Celebration 2023 where these kids are living on a world that seemingly resembles an Earth-like planet, only to be thrust into a new galaxy full of action and adventure with the help of Jude Law's as-of-yet unknown character (though he's rumored to be a former Jedi). After Ahsoka ventured out to another galaxy, the idea of extragalactic characters coming into the known galaxy is quite compelling.Related: How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order\nWhat's important to note is that this synopsis doesn't confirm these kids will be stranded in their own galaxy.

After Ahsoka ventured out to another galaxy, the idea of extragalactic characters coming into the known galaxy is quite compelling.Related: How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order\nThere are two primary ways in which extragalactic travel has been achieved in the Star Wars canon thus far. The first is more organic thanks to star whales known as purrgil. Having been followed by early spacefarers to safely map out and explore the galaxy in the distant past, purrgil have the ability to jump through hyperspace. Furthermore, Ahsoka confirms that star whales can also travel between galaxies.\nThe star whales explain how Ezra and Thrawn ended up on Peridea located in another galaxy after Ezra used the Force to bond with a pod of purrgil, sending them both into exile. It's also how Ahsoka got to Peridea herself in the recent Star Wars show, following Morgan Elsebth who'd constructed a massive hyperspace ring known as the Eye of Sion to bring Thrawn back (the other confirmed method of intergalactic travel). That being said, it's unlikely that Star Wars will solely rely on either the star whales or Thrawn's unique ship to achieve intergalactic travel in the future.\nTo that end, it stands to reason that new ways of traveling between galaxies will soon be introduced. Assuming that the kids in Skeleton Crew do find themselves inadvertently stranded in the Star Wars galaxy apart from their own, neither the star whales nor the hyperspace ring in Thrawn's possession make much sense. Instead, a past method from Star Wars' non-canon Legends materials could be brought back to explain their unintended journey.\nIn Legends, the early alien race known as the Kwa constructed a network of portal devices known as Infinity Gates. These gates could transport beings and ships across the galaxy instantaneously. Originally the native race of Dathomir, the Kwa and their Infinity Gates could easily play a new role focused on intergalactic travel within the established canon. After all, the extragalactic world of Peridea was the original home of the Nightsisters before they relocated to Dathomir in the known galaxy (for reasons unknown).\nHaving been killed off by the Nightsisters in Legends, the Kwa's powerful Infinity Gates and the Star Temples that housed them fell under the control of the Force witches. That being said, there weren't very many left after the Kwa destroyed several of the Gates after they were sought after by the Rakatans and their Infinite Empire (who were recently re-canonized themselves). As such, the Infinity Gates' connection to the Nightsisters in Legends makes a lot of sense for the canon, especially now that the Witches have become so integral to intergalactic travel following Ahsoka.\nRelated: Upcoming Star Wars Shows In 2023: Story, Casts & Everything We Know\nIt would certainly be intriguing if Infinity Gates were brought back to the Star Wars canon with the added ability to travel between galaxies. The idea of a group of kids exploring a long-forgotten Star Temple which accidentally sends them to the known Star Wars galaxy sounds very exciting. Likewise, the plot then becomes trying to find another Infinity Gate assuming there's no way back the way they came. This is also where Jude Law's Jedi character could come in, helping them make their way back home.\nGoing beyond the upcoming Skeleton Crew show, canonical Infinity Gates would allow Star Wars to fully embrace the idea of more intergalactic adventures, expanding the narrative opportunities to a very high degree. Having first begun in earnest with Ahsoka, it would be very cool to see Skeleton Crew keep the new concept of intergalactic travel going when the new show starts streaming on Disney+. Although the Star Wars galaxy is already quite vast with countless worlds and characters, exploring whole new galaxies could very well be the next frontier going forward.\n"}
{"title": "Disney CEO Reportedly &quot;Exhausted & Overwhelmed&quot; After Multiple Box Office Flops", "date": "2023-10-10 22:35:33", "text": "Disney CEO Bob Iger has reportedly become increasingly frustrated and overwhelmed by the company's surprising box office failures this year.\nDisney CEO Bob Iger is reportedly taken aback and exhausted by the multiple box office failures the company has experienced this year. For several decades, Disney has been one of the biggest and most successful companies in the world, especially when it comes to films, releasing countless animated and live-action movies that have raked in millions and have also gained much critical acclaim. However, this year, Disney has struggled to keep up with its success from previous years, with a significant number of its movies bombing at the box office. Reports suggest that the company has lost an estimated $900 million across several underperforming movies this year.\nNow, according to Bloomberg, Iger, who came out of retirement last November to save the company, is feeling the strain of Disney's woes. Sources close to the CEO describe him as \"overwhelmed and exhausted\" as he faces the company's current issues, which include diminished attendance at Disney World, a loss of Disney+ subscribers, and the aforementioned box office disappointments.\nDisney came into this year with a lineup of movies that looked both exciting and promising. They had titles like Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Elemental, a new Haunted Mansion movie, and a live-action remake of The Little Mermaid. Most of these movies have, however, underperformed at the cinemas, with the Indiana Jones revival making only $383 million globally on a budget of $300 million, while Haunted Mansion raked in a lowly $24.1 million domestically in its opening weekend against a budget of $150 million.\nRelated: Indiana Jones 5's $300M Failure Means Harrison Ford's 3 Franchise Exits Were All Box Office Disappointments\nElemental, a highly anticipated movie that many expected to do well, had one of Pixar's lowest-grossing opening weekends, earning only $29.6 million at the box office against a budget of $200 million. One of the main reasons why these movies have been doing poorly this year is because of their hefty budgets. For instance, the $200 million budget allocated to the making of Elemental makes it one of the most expensive animations ever and as such, the movie would have been required to make over $500 million at very the least to be considered a success. It has since rebounded, though, standing at $492.3 million globally.\nAnother reason for Disney’s abysmal year at the box office is because a good number of their recent movies have simply not been good enough. Releases like Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, The Little Mermaid, Elemental, and Haunted Mansion have all received mixed reviews from both critics and audiences, and this has discouraged many watching them in theaters. However, with a slate of new movies already scheduled for release in the coming months, it will be interesting to see if Disney turns around their unprecedented box office problem.\nSource: Bloomberg\nBoluwatife Adeyemi is a freelance writer currently contributing to Screen Rant as a TV and News Writer.

{"title": "New Pet Sematary Movie Forgets What Really Made Stephen King's Original So Terrifying", "date": "2023-10-10 22:40:26", "text": "Pet Sematary: Bloodlines offers a few chills and thrills but fails to capture the ingredients that made the original Stephen King adaptation so scary.\nPet Sematary: Bloodlines may arguably be a decent horror movie in its own right, but it lacks what made the original Stephen King adaptation so terrifying. Marking Lindsey Anderson Bee's directorial debut, Pet Sematary: Bloodlines serves as a prequel to 2019's Pet Sematary, the second movie adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name. Since Pet Sematary easily ranks among Stephen King's best works, traversing it to the big screen was naturally challenging. However, both Pet Sematary movies did a decent job of bringing the King of Horror's novel to the big screen.\nSince Stephen King never wrote a sequel or a prequel for Pet Sematary, Pet Sematary: Bloodlines takes a rather ambitious approach by expanding the author's original lore and bringing some backstory to the origins of the titular burial ground. Unfortunately, its story proves to be way less captivating and chilling than the original because it does not have one crucial ingredient that made the Stephen King story so great. Without this ingredient, Pet Sematary: Bloodlines comes off as another run-off-the-mill horror flick that had the potential to be much better.\nRELATED: Pet Sematary: Bloodlines Ending Explained\nIn Pet Sematary: Bloodlines, the \"living dead\" characters who attack are young adults, bringing little to no novelty to the movie to make it as scary as the original Stephen King adaptation. The original Pet Sematary movie, on the other hand, features Gage as its primary antagonist whose malevolence after revival contrasts his innocence, vulnerability, and purity from when he was alive. Even from a moral standpoint, it is far easier for adult characters to fight back against evil returned-from-the-dead young adults than fending off children like Gage. The reason being that even though they have nefarious intentions after their revival, they still appear harmless and non-threatening.\nThe idea behind Pet Sematary came to Stephen King after his son, Owen, nearly got hit by a speeding truck. However, after finishing the book, the author was so disturbed by what he had written that he avoided publishing it until a contractual obligation forced him to. Just like Stephen King's paternal instinct made Pet Sematary so frightening for him, Gage's death and transformation in the original Pet Sematary adaptations trigger a deep-seated, primal fear surrounding the protection and care of children. Pet Sematary: Bloodlines fails to leave that impact due to the lack of younger characters like Gage or Ellie (in the 2019 remake) in its storyline.\nPet Sematary: Bloodlines seemingly forgets that the original story's terrors do not come from showdowns between the living and the dead. Instead, they come from its heartbreaking portrayal of how grief towards losing a loved one can force someone to make unimaginable decisions. Louis Creed's gradual psychological and emotional descent following his son's demise and the uncanniness of Gage's return as a sinister being is what makes the original scary. Pet Sematary: Bloodlines, in contrast, fails to be that effective because it conforms to the well-worn conventions of the zombie horror genre instead of being narratively original and thematically deep.\n"}
{"title": "The Best New Horror Movie In October 2023 Came Out Of Nowhere To Beats A Sequel That Was 50 Years In The Making", "date": "2023-10-10 22:50:26", "text": "The best horror movie to come out in October 2023 is not a franchise, has very little marketing, and doesn't have a wide theatrical release. \nOctober is always horror movie renaissance month, including legacy sequels and the classics, but October 2023's best horror movie is one that is better than a new entry in a 50-year franchise. With big-budget releases, small independent films, and streaming all now with options, the horror movie landscape has never had more options. However, critics and audiences seem to be favoring the newer, more novel entries of horror movies more than old franchise tales spun in new ways.\nNew producers such as Jordan Peele and Jason Blum have revitalized the horror genre over the past decade, giving it a breath of fresh air with new stories told that can double as societal commentaries, psychological thrillers, and think pieces. In past years the only reasonable way to see new horror entries around Halloween time was to make a trip to the local theater. Those movies had the highest budget, the most marketing behind them, and often had years of franchise success to back them up. However, things have changed. For example, one of the best horror movies of 2023 is an original story with a relatively small budget.\nTotally Killer, a small, streaming Blumhouse movie released on Prime, is getting great reviews including an 87% Rotten Tomatoes score and an 81% audience score. The Totally Killer cast, which stars Kiernan Shipka, Olivia Holt, and Julie Bowen, leads a movie that follows the same path as traditional slasher films but also adds elements of dark comedy and new time travel rules to the scares. The movie, released to streaming on October 6th has been a surprise, low-budget hit for Prime and Blumhouse, the studio that was also behind one of October's franchise, wide-release films.\nRelated: Totally Killer Ending and Sweet 16 Killer Identity Explained\nBlumhouse Productions and Jason Blum were also behind The Exorcist: Believer, with Blum serving as producer of the film. It is the first Exorcist film since Universal Pictures and Peacock bought the right to the franchise for $400 million. The hope was that The Exorcist franchise would be a steady stable of movies to produce for horror fans as well as a place to stream them all on Peacock. However, The Exorcist: Believer is bombing with just $27 million in opening weekend partially due to negative reviews despite being a big theatrical sequel release. That number will also likely crater with the Taylor Swift movie due to hit theaters shortly.\nMore and more frequently, audiences and critics are choosing original horror stories and titles over legacy franchise offerings. The Exorcist: Believer is far from the first horror franchise to suffer from abysmal box office figures and reviews. Recent films such as Jeepers Creepers: Reborn in 2022, the Child's Play reboot in 2019, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre reboot in 2022 all suffered from poor box office performances and were panned by critics.\nRelated: The Exorcist: Believer Ending Explained\nFor many, the novelty or creativity of these original films, which are iconic entries in the horror canon, have worn off after countless sequels, spinoffs, and reboots. Very few, if any, horror sequels and reboots have come close to capturing the attention and popularity of their predecessors. Films like Totally Killer may not have dive into deep psychological themes like The Shining or Rosemary's Baby of years past, but they tell new stories and introduce new characters to the always-popular horror genre.\nRyan is a Core Features contributor for Screen Rant.

{"title": "10 Most Powerful Anime Swords", "date": "2023-10-10 23:00:28", "text": "Legendary swords that stand out above other fictional weapons and have earned their place as the iconic weapons of iconic heroes.\nFew anime tropes are as beloved as the sword master, naturally leading to the most powerful swords in anime being cherished relics. These ridiculously strong blades stand out above other fictional weapons and have earned their place as some of anime's most iconic weapons ever.\nSamurai stories have had a major influence on anime, leading many anime heroes fight with a katana just like historical samurai. However, thanks to the large number of iconic fantasy anime, many other iconic anime swords are based on European-style swords or are purely works of the creator's imagination. Regardless of their exact form, the most powerful anime swords are instantly recognizable and featured in some of the most iconic anime sword fights of all time.\nA descendant of the ninja who has gone down in history as Japan's Robin Hood, Goemon Ishikawa XIII is one of Lupin's major allies. Goemon plays a very crucial role in Lupin's gang. As he has boasted many, many times throughout the long-running Lupin III series, his sword Zantetsuken is capable of cutting through virtually anything, serving a very niche but very valuable role in Lupin's heists. Notably, Goemon very rarely actually hurts anyone with Zantetsuken despite its impressive cutting power, mainly cutting through inanimate obstacles to the gang's heists or subduing enemies by destroying their weapons or clothes to defeat them through sheer embarrassment.\nAlthough the only sword Zoro is depicted with throughout the entire series is the white-hilted Wado Ichimonji, a weapon of immense sentimental importance to him, his fighting style revolves around using three swords at once. Zoro's three-sword style was introduced early in the series and is a perfect demonstration of One Piece's unique visual style and endless variation of memorable and diverse abilities of its characters. Using this style to decisively dispatch his opponents, Zoro himself quickly established himself as one of the strongest characters in the series and he, alongside the swords he wields, only grows stronger throughout One Piece.\nIntroduced all the way back in 1989, Guts's enormous sword the Dragon Slayer has become an iconic part of his character. Over the decades, Guts has used the Dragon Slayer to destroy monsters, demons, Apostles, and even malevolent gods in spectacular fashion. In a recent fight scene in the Berserk manga, Guts used the Dragon Slayer to cut one hair from the godlike Griffith's head. While this is a minor thing, it proves that Griffith isn't quite as invincible as he seems and that Guts may have the means to finally defeat him. Unlike many of the other strongest anime swords that require finesse and technique, the Dragon Slayer's strength as a blade is almost entirely due to its massive size.\nIn battle, Van's sword is able to switch between a flexible, whip-like form and a standard cutting blade when exposed to an electrical current. Van uses his sword in several novel ways, using its flexible form like a grappling hook to travel distances quickly and spinning the blade fast enough to deflect oncoming bullets. The real potential of Van's sword, however, is unlocked when it is used to summon and control the powerful and awe-inspiring mech Dann, one of the seven strongest mechs on the planet of Endless Illusion. Fittingly, Dann enters battle being dropped from orbit in the shape of a giant sword.\nThe Nichirin Swords are the signature weapons of the Demon Slayer corps. A newly forged Nichirn blade changes color when drawn for the first time by its wielder, reflecting that Demon Slayer's particular aptitudes and abilities. In particular, a Nichirin Sword's color reflects an affinity with a particular Breathing Style. Although Tanjiro's black Nichirin Sword is initially considered unlucky, this is a superstition based on both the rarity of black Nichirin Swords and their exact nature being poorly understood. In fact, Tanjiro's Nichirin Sword turning black actually reflects that it is a very powerful sword. The Black Nichirin swords are associated with Sun Breathing, the powerful Breathing Style that was the first to be developed and from which all other Breathing Styles are derived.\nThe identity of the human reincarnated into the sword in his new life as an isekai protagonist has never been revealed, so the sentient's sword only name is Teacher, given by Fran, the aspiring adventurer that the sword mentors. Before meeting Fran, Teacher was able to travel and level up on his own, like a typical RPG character. Before even meeting Fran, Teacher was able to gain levels and unlock several powerful techniques. In addition to his impressive RPG abilities, Teacher retains his human intellect, allowing him to aid Fran with both powerful techniques and helpful tactical guidance.\nMononoke's Sword of Salvation lives up to its name, with the mysterious Medicine Vendor of underrated horror classic Mononoke using the Sword to exorcise the malevolent spirits that give the series its title. In order to draw the sword, the Medicine Seller must discern the mononoke's Shape, Truth, and Reason: what it is, what it wants, and what caused it to become a mononoke. Mononoke is more a series about investigating evil spirits than fighting them. Once the Medicine Vendor is able to draw the Sword of Salvation, what follows can hardly be considered fights. Changing into a powerful second form, the Medicine Vendor rarely needs more than a single swing of the sword to exorcise the mononoke.\nThe Sword of Light is established to be one of the most powerful weapons in the world of Slayers. Throughout the course of the series, the Sword of Light lives up to its reputation, cutting down powerful monsters with one blow. Of course, Slayers is a comedy series, so the twist of the premise of an immensely powerful holy weapon is that it's in the hands of the least competent character in the cast. Although Gourry is a capable swordsman, his naivety and general lack of intelligence is the source of much the series' humor. This, combined with memorable female lead Lina Inverse's constant attempts to buy the Sword of Light from Gourry means that the sword is both one of the series' most powerful important weapons and funniest running gags.\nOne of the defining aspects of the Bleach Universe is the Soul Reaper's Zanpakutō, sentient swords inhabited by spirits and possessing diverse impressive powers. Ichigo's Zanpakuto stands out as particularly noteworthy for a number of reasons. As a seemingly normal human, why Ichigo is even able to wield a Zanpakuto in the first place is an ongoing mystery and Ichigo's growth in power to unlock more of his weapon's powers and to better master the tempestuous spirit inhabiting the weapon drives much of Ichigo's character development. As Ichigo becomes increasingly able to rein in Zangetsu's full power and unlock its potential, he becomes consistently one of the strongest individual characters in Bleach.\nThe two swords bestowed by the Dog Demon Toga to his sons Inuyasha and Sesshomaru, Tessaiga & Tenseiga are two of the most powerful objects in the series making them two of the most powerful swords in anime history, just like the Inuyasha series itself has become a beloved icon of anime. While Tessaiga allows Inuyasha to unlock more and more powerful combat techniques, Tenseiga itself drives much of Sesshomaru's character development. Although initially contemptuous of his father's gift and envious of his brother's seemingly much more powerful weapon, as Sesshomaru learns more about the healing powers of Tenseiga and learns to wield them, Sesshomaru develops more empathy and compassion, gradually shifting from a complete villain to a more heroic character who may never be entirely virtuous, but at least comes to care fiercely for his loved ones.\nFor as long as stories have existed, swords have become synonymous with fictional heroes, and many anime characters over the years have used swords. Of all the swords ever wielded by anime heroes, a handful clearly stand out above all the others thanks to their memorable visual design and sheer strength.

{"title": "10 Worst Disasters To Happen On Major Movie Sets", "date": "2023-10-10 23:00:28", "text": "Hollywood has seen some tragic disasters while making some of its most iconic movies. Sadly, these have frequently claimed their performers’ lives.\nThis article contains discussions of death and life-changing injuries, including those of young children.\nMovie sets can be dangerous places despite safety guidelines and regulations, and some have been the site of tragic disasters. While film sets strive to prioritize safety, several major movies have been marred by catastrophes. Unfortunately, many of these have been fatal.\nOne might presume that modern cinema sets have refined safety standards over the years and effectively minimized accidents. This is mostly true. However, filming movies — particularly those requiring a lot of stunts — can still go wrong, no matter how extensively filmmakers and performers prepare. Accidents happen, and these on-set disasters might be the worst to occur during production.\nPerhaps the most infamous movie set disaster occurred while filming 1994's The Crow, resulting in the death of star Brandon Lee (via NPR). Nearing the end of production, Lee was filming the movie's opening, wherein his character, Eric Draven, is shot by thugs. After using dummy rounds (bullets with no gunpowder) for a previous scene, a bullet was lodged in the gun barrel. Nobody checked the barrel, and the gun was subsequently loaded with a blank round (gunpowder with no bullet) for Lee's scene, effectively becoming a fully live round. Lee was mortally wounded and died on set.\nOne of the most tragic on-set disasters happened during Twilight Zone: The Movie. The Twilight Zone had many great episodes and fierce popularity throughout its run, leading in 1986 to the production of a feature-length anthology movie. While filming the movie's first segment, actor Vic Morrow and two children — Myca Dinh Le and Renee Shin-Yi Chen — were all killed by a falling helicopter. The low-flying helicopter was jolted by pyrotechnics on the ground, which were reportedly much larger than the pilot or film crew were expecting. The helicopter spun out of control, landing on Morrow and the two kids and killing them instantly.\nAnother firearm tragedy occurred in 2021 on the set of the Western movie Rust. As actor Alec Baldwin was rehearsing a scene in which his character pointed a gun toward the camera, the gun accidentally fired. Of the three people standing behind the camera, two were shot. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was hit in the chest and died on the way to the hospital, while director Joel Souza was injured in the shoulder. Details remain unclear, but Baldwin has vehemently denied pulling the trigger and was subsequently cleared of involuntary manslaughter charges. Rust has since finished filming.\nWhile The Dark Knight is often associated with the untimely death of actor Heath Ledger, the movie also claimed another life. Stunt performer Conway Wickliffe died while rehearsing one of the movie's car chases (via The Guardian). For the scene, during which the Batmobile is blown up, Wickliffe was leaning out of the passenger-side car window while filming another car that was running parallel. His fellow stunt driver unfortunately missed the turning at the end of the track and their vehicle collided with a tree. Wickliffe tragically died at the scene, and The Dark Knight is dedicated to both his and Ledger's memory.\nMidnight Rider is an unfinished biopic about blues musician Gregg Allman. It only managed one day of filming in 2014 before tragedy struck, ending the production indefinitely. The cast and crew began filming a dream sequence that featured actor William Hurt laying on a metal bed upon a trestle railway bridge over the Altamaha River in the state of Georgia. Unbeknownst to the crew, a freight train was rapidly approaching, and they acted too late to reach safety. Several of the crew were injured, but as the train struck the metal bed, camera assistant Sarah Jones was propelled towards the train by shrapnel, killing her instantly (via The Hollywood Reporter).\nTom Cruise's classic action thriller Top Gun was famed for its use of aerobatic stunts and flight sequences — many of which Cruise filmed himself in Top Gun: Maverick, the movie's sequel. Among the stunt pilots employed by Top Gun was the highly regarded Art Scholl. Sadly, while filming a stunt sequence, Scholl failed to recover from a spin and lost control of his aircraft after. Scholl crashed in the Pacific Ocean, off the Southern Californian coast. Neither Scholl nor the plane were ever recovered, and as a result, the cause of the crash has never been fully determined. Top Gun was dedicated to Scholl's memory.\nStunt performer David Holmes acted as star Daniel Radcliffe's stunt double for the first six Harry Potter movies. Holmes was testing a stunt sequence on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part One, called a \"jerk-back,\" or a stunt designed to imitate the effects of an explosive blast. Per Holmes' 2014 interview with The Mirror, he was slammed into a wall, landing on a crash mat beneath. Tragically, Holmes' neck was broken by the ordeal, and he was left paralyzed. Now a wheelchair user, Holmes has started a podcast with Radcliffe called Cunning Stunts, in which the pair interview stunt performers from the movie industry.\nThe 1956 movie The Conqueror is mostly remembered for its woeful miscasting of John Wayne as the Mongol Genghis Khan. However, the movie has retained a more deadly legacy thanks to its filming location. Across several sites in Utah, The Conquerer was filmed downwind of the American nuclear weapons test site, the Nevada National Security Site. Despite being assured of their safety, 91 crew members would develop cancer in their later lives (via People). Of these, 46 died from their illnesses, including Wayne himself, who died of stomach cancer at age 72.\nMotorcyclist Joi Harris died while performing a stunt on the set of Deadpool 2, filling in as Zazie Beetz's character, Domino. After successfully rehearsing the stunt sequence, Harris performed the stunt dressed as Domino. However, because of time constraints, adequate safety gear had not been produced to fit underneath the character's clothing. As a result, Harris was not wearing a helmet when she lost control of her motorbike. Hitting a curb, Harris was thrown through a window of the Rogers Tower in Vancouver and pronounced dead at the scene. It is one of the most recent and tragic disasters to have occurred on a major movie set.\nSource: NPR, The Guardian, The Hollywood Reporter, The Mirror, People\n"}
{"title": "Snape's Memories In Harry Potter Had A Deeper Twist That's Been Slept On For 16 Years", "date": "2023-10-10 23:11:27", "text": "Snape's memories contained many plot twists in Harry Potter, but a subtle detail within the Pensieve revealed a tragic truth about the character.\nSeverus Snape's memories in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows contained many of the series' greatest twists, but some subtler revelations were included as well. Though the Potions Master had been an antagonist for most of Harry Potter, the scenes following his death revealed that he had once loved Lily Potter and had dedicated himself to protecting her son. Though this didn't entirely redeem him for his past misdoings, it was a moment of clarity and understanding for Harry, which is something Severus Snape had initially not wanted.\nWhen Severus Snape learned that Lily was dead, he fully understood that it was his own fault. He had been the one to tell Lord Voldemort about Trelawney's Chosen One prophecy, which is what led the villain to seek out the Potters, to begin with. To make amends, he agreed to help Albus Dumbledore keep Harry safe—under one condition. Snape told the Hogwarts headmaster that Harry was never to know the truth about his past with Lily, to which Dumbledore replied, \"I shall never reveal the best of you,\" and he kept his word. In the end, it was Snape himself who revealed the truth to Harry.\nRELATED: Harry Potter Cast - Where Are They Now?\nAs far as Harry could tell throughout Harry Potter, Severus Snape had always hated him. This was undoubtedly true—Harry looked so much like James Potter that Snape struggled to separate his hatred for one from the other. Still, his true feelings toward Harry were far more complicated. The Boy Who Lived was a constant reminder of everything Snape had done wrong in his life (and everything he continued to do wrong). However, Harry was still Lily's son. Though Snape's struggle with these feelings was his most vehemently kept secret, he decided in his final moments that he wanted Harry to know about them.\nThe final missions that Dumbledore had assigned to Snape were to kill him when the time came and to tell Harry the truth about being a \"pig for slaughter\" once Voldemort had begun to keep Nagini the snake close. This means that when Harry approached the professor as he lay dying, the only memories he needed to pass on were these. They would prove that Snape was on Harry's side and tell Harry what he needed to do next. However, at that moment, knowing that both he and Harry were about to die, Snape decided to tell the boy the complete truth—the good, the bad, and the ugly.\nThe fact that Snape gave Harry memories of his childhood with Lily, his conversations with Dumbledore regarding his inadvertent hatred toward Harry, and his determination not to let the Boy Who Lived know the truth indicates that the man had decided in the moments before his death that he wanted Harry to understand who he had been. This is touching to consider. As a double agent, Snape would have known long ago that his efforts would go unappreciated and that he would be remembered as a villain (he may have even thought he deserved such a legacy). However, his very human desire for Lily's son to know the best of him changed the Harry Potter character's story at the last minute.\nRELATED: 10 Pensieve Memories The Harry Potter Movies Left Out (That Change Everything)\nDespite the touching nature of Snape's final change of heart, it's frustrating to remember that he could have told Harry from the beginning. It would have been so valuable for the orphan to know someone who had grown up alongside his mother. He could have heard stories about Lily, about her prowess at potions, or her kind heart. Harry could have even learned the truth about why she had died and had some time to process and forgive Snape for his part in it. However, Severus Snape was full of faults, the most prominent being jealousy, pride, and selfishness.\nWhen Snape made Dumbledore promise never to reveal the truth in the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows book, he specifically said that he couldn't stand for anyone, \"especially Potter's son,\" to see this gentler side of him. The sad truth is that this exact thinking is why Snape went down the path of darkness. He couldn't stand for James Potter or any of his other abusers to see that he was weak. Lily had warned him against this, but he wouldn't listen. Ultimately, it took his own death before Severus Snape realized that his love for Lily had never been a weakness.\nVoldemort killing Snape before he had a chance to talk to Harry had never been the plan. In the Deathly Hallows book especially, it's clear that the double agent was desperate to get to the castle and find Harry. Ultimately, it was just good luck (or perhaps destiny) that Harry was there when Voldemort murdered Snape, which allowed the man the opportunity to not only deliver his message from Dumbledore but also reveal the truth about Lily and his complex morality. Still, this begs the question—how would things have gone down if Snape had had the opportunity to find and talk with Harry as he had initially planned?\nWithout the clarity of death, it's difficult to imagine Snape being able to swallow his pride and tell Harry the whole truth. When interacting with the boy, Snape had always been fixed behind a snide mask, and it's unlikely that would have changed just because he was finishing his mission. The professor may have filled a vial with memories containing only the essential information and passed it on to Harry, knowing the boy couldn't resist looking at them. Of course, it's touching to imagine these two having a heart-to-heart. However, this wasn't in Snape's character until he had nothing to lose.\nSince the conclusion of the Harry Potter series, Snape's redemption has been a topic of debate. The character behaved so poorly throughout Harry's years at Hogwarts that it's tough to forgive him just because he had once loved Lily. Additionally, his jealous behavior regarding his childhood best friend has come across as disturbing to some, raising questions about whether he would have even cared had James and Harry died so long as Lily survived. Ultimately, this is the entire point of Snape's character arc in Harry Potter—he was never fully good or bad.\nThe important part of Snape's ending is that, before he died, he decided to reveal the better parts of himself. This didn't eliminate the darkness that so naturally existed inside him. It only added another layer of complexity to Snape's character and further enforced the themes of Harry Potter that people aren't inherently good or bad—their morality comes down to who they choose to be at any given moment. Snape may not have always made the right choices, but Harry decided to remember the man for the slivers of good that Lily had inspired in him.\n"}
{"title": "Pokémon: Every League Championship Ash Participated In (& Where He Placed)", "date": "2023-10-10 23:15:58", "text": "Ash competes in plenty of League Championships throughout his time in the Pokémon anime and even wins some of them, thanks to his skill as a Trainer. \nAsh Ketchum was on his Pokémon journey for twenty-five years. He's been to eight different regions, befriending and catching all kinds of Pokémon on his way to become a Pokémon Master. Competitive and relentless, Ash has also participated in numerous championships, often placing among the Top 10 and nearly reaching victory twice. It takes seven tries before he becomes a regional League Champion, though.\nBelow is every tournament and championship battle that Ash has ever had, including the ranking at which he finished. The entries are listed in chronological order, starting with Ash's first conference performance. Ash has also participated in many smaller tournaments, but those aren't considered here; instead, only the regional Leagues' big conference tournaments are counted.\nThe Indigo Conference is the first championship Ash participates in, explaining why it's also his lowest placing in a Pokémon League so far. Still, he makes it to the Top 16 out of 200+ contestants, which is no easy feat. Ash loses against Richie, who fans remember as the Trainer who seemed like an Ash clone, to the point where he also had a Pikachu. The battle is exciting enough, but Ash loses because his Charizard refuses to obey his commands. Instead, it lies down and takes a nap, leading to Ash's disqualification. Ash was still an inexperienced Trainer back then, so it makes sense that he lost this tournament. He simply wasn't ready to go all the way.\nAsh first becomes a Champion during the Orange Islands arc in the original saga. His final battle is against Drake, the notorious Dragon Master. The match ranks as one of the anime's most exciting, as Drake's Dragonite single-handedly defeats four of Ash's Pokémon before being taken down by Pikachu. The Orange Islands were created for the anime, and the storyline took place early in the series, so many casual fans don't know about Ash's victory at the Orange League. It also wasn't a tournament-style like the other Leagues, but was more like the games, with Ash battling against the region's champion only. Still, besting Drake in battle was one of Ash's best moments as a Trainer, and cemented Pikachu's spot as his secret ace.\nHarrison was one of Ash's best rivals in Pokémon, acting as both a wise mentor and challenging opponent who pushed him to become a better Trainer. The Silver Conference also made Ash more cunning, and even though Harrison bested him in battle, their match was one of the series' most thrilling. Ash also faces Gary during the Silver Conference in one of the anime's most unforgettable and rule-breaking battles. He comes out on top, and his rivalry with Gary officially comes to an end. After his defeat against Harrison, Ash ends up placing in the top 8, but fans could see the young Trainer was already on his way to greatness.\nIn Hoenn, Ash entered the Ever Grande Conference and once again placed in the Top 8. This time, he loses against the conference's eventual winner, Tyson, in one of the anime's most bizarre battles. Going into the second half of the battle, Tyson and Ash seem evenly matched. Ash's Torkoal bested Tyson's Shiftry, but the latter's Hariyama defeated two of Ash's Pokémon, Torkoal and Corphish. In the end, it all comes down to a battle between Ash's Pikachu and Tyson's Meowth. Both Pokémon put on a valiant effort, but Meowth comes out on top after a particularly energetic Iron Tail caused Pikachu to collapse.\nAsh's loss at the Lily of the Valley Conference still stings some fans. During his journey across Sinnoh, Ash exhibited real maturity and growth, making many in the community believe he would finally become the Champion. His battle against his reformed rival, Paul, seemed to confirm this, as Ash showed remarkable strategy and composure that eventually led to his victory.\nAlas, things didn't go according to plan. Ash faces Tobias in the semi-finals, and he is no match against his opponent's Pokémon. Tobias has a Darkrai, a mythical Pokémon that he used to win all his previous battles. Still, Ash manages to defeat the Pokémon with his Sceptile, making the crowds cheer. Tobias doesn't even sweat because his next Pokémon is Latios, a Legendary, and although Pikachu ends up fainting, it takes Latios down with it. However, Ash no longer has any Pokémon left, and Tobias wins the match. Many fans still consider it unfair that Tobias won by using a Mythical and a Legendary, and they might have a point.\nDuring Unova's Vertress Conference, Ash's Pikachu once again takes center stage, acting as its Trainer's last hope. In his battle against Cameron, Ash chooses a balanced team of 6, but Pikachu is the only one left standing when Cameron takes out his newly-evolved Lucario. The electric mouse performs admirably, but succumbs to the mighty Lucario, one of Generation IV's best mons. Ash takes his defeat with maturity and places among the Top 8 again, actually going down in rankings for the first time ever.\nIf Ash's loss at the Lily of the Valley Conference stings, then his loss against Alain at the Lumiose Conference outright burns. Ash makes it to the finals with one of his best teams in the series: Pikachu, Greninja, Noivern, Talonflame, Hawlucha, and Goodra. Alain's team is no joke either, and his Charizard is a menacing foe similar to Tobias' Darkrai. After a gruesome battle, both Trainers are down to their last Pokémon, Ash-Greninja and Mega Charizard X. Both Pokémon fire their attacks at once, creating a massive cloud of steam. Once the fog clears and after an intense stare-off, Greninja succumbs. Alain's victory at the Lumiose Conference is still controversial among the community, as many feel that Ash was at the top of his game during the Kalos season.\nThe news went around the world: after twenty-one years, Ash Ketchum was finally a Pokémon Champion. As previously mentioned, it wasn't entirely true because Ash was already the Orange League Champion. Still, his victory at the Manalo Conference made him a regional Champion, an honor that only the best Trainers achieve. Furthermore, he was the region's first Champion ever, making the whole thing even more noteworthy. His last opponent is Gladion, one of Sun & Moon's best characters. It all ends when Ash's Lycanroc uses Counter, sending Gladion's Lycanroc out of the field and winning Ash the match. It was a triumphant moment for every fan, a victory twenty-one years in the making, and one of the anime's most satisfying moments to date.\nAsh didn't compete in the Galar League and earn badges there; instead, he used his win in Alola to enter the World Coronation Series, a tournament designed to find out who's the best of the best, with competitors like Gym Leaders and regional Champions in the mix. Ash earned his way into the World Coronation Series' final tournament, the Masters' Eight, which featured some of Pokémon's most skilled trainers.\nAsh fought hard in the Masters Eight, going up against Steven Stone, Cynthia, and finally the undefeated Leon, Champion of Galar. Ash's match with Leon was incredible, featuring Mega Evolution, Z-Moves, and Dynamaxing, and it was a hard-fought battle on both sides. Ash and Leon's match eventually came down to Pikachu versus Charizard, with Pikachu drawing strength from every Pokémon Ash ever caught in order to win. Ash was crowned Monarch of the World Coronation Series, the title given to the strongest Trainer, effectively achieving his dream of being the best that no one ever was.\nGoing over Ash's tournament performance like this really shows how Ash's techniques and skills grew across the series, even in spite of its decades-long duration. With one exception, Ash placed higher every time he attempted to challenge a league conference. And when Ash finally became a champion, he didn't stop there; instead, he needed to be THE champion and went up against seemingly impossible odds to accomplish that. Fans were thrilled when Ash finally achieved his dream of becoming Pokémon's best, even if that meant that Ash's journey was now drawing to a close.\nDavid is a twenty-nine-year-old Mexican writer and reader.

{"title": "12 Alice In Borderland Characters Ranked Worst To Best", "date": "2023-10-10 23:20:26", "text": "Alice in Borderland’s season 3 announcement means any character could return. Here are the main Alice in Borderland characters, ranked worst to best.\nRanking the main Alice in Borderland characters from worst to best reveals how many interesting heroes and villains the show features. Netflix’s Alice in Borderland is based on the manga of the same name by Haro Aso, who also created Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead. Surprisingly, even though Arisu and his friends seemly returned to the real world at the end of season 2, Alice in Borderland’s story is not over – meaning all the fan-favorite characters can return.\nNot much is known about Alice in Borderland season 3’s story, although the Joker Card from the season 2 finale has been front and center in the marketing. Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) and Usagi (Tao Tsuchiya) are so far the only characters confirmed to return, but anything is possible given how season 2 ended. Here are 12 Alice in Borderland characters, ranked.\nA villain who seemingly died and came back multiple times, Niragi should not have been around as long as he was in Alice in Borderland. While the frustration of seeing a repulsive villain returning from the dead is an interesting narrative trick, Niragi’s role in the story became repetitive. Even when the show tried to set up some form of redemption arc with his return in Alice in Borderland season 2, he remained a villain and repeated the same actions from season 1. Niragi was never supposed to be the “final boss” of the story either, making his role in season 2 redundant, despite Dori Sakurada’s great performance.\nAnn had the potential to be one of the best Alice in Borderland characters. Unfortunately, the show never gave Ayaka Miyoshi’s character enough time to shine. Ann was introduced midway through Alice in Borderland season 1 as one of the most important people on the Beach. Still, not much was revealed about the character, except that she used to work as a forensics scientist in the real world. Ann returned in Alice in Borderland season 2 and had her own separate plot – investigate where exactly they had been this whole time. However, Ann’s investigation led nowhere, meaning the show once again wasted the character in season 2.\nHeiya (Yuri Tsunematsu) was one of the new additions to Alice in Borderland season 2’s cast. While the show made an effort to showcase Heiya’s origin story through flashbacks from before she met Aguni and Arisu, not much was really established about the character other than she hated her mother. Heiya’s archery skills were a highlight of season 2, especially in the Alice in Borderland season 2 finale. Still, compared to other characters who received more screen time and were far better developed, Heiya wasn't too interesting.\nAlice in Borderland’s Face Card players were the main antagonists of season 2. While some of them were nothing but one-time obstacles for the main characters to overcome, such as the King of Diamonds and the Queen of Spades, the Queen of Hearts (Riisa Naka) had a surprisingly strong presence. Even though Mira was not given a backstory, the Queen of Hearts still managed to leave a mark on the series, namely in the season 2 finale. Whereas all the other Face Card citizens would use a gimmick or physical strength during a game, the Queen of Hearts almost beat Arisu using nothing but words.\nFrom villain to anti-hero, Aguni (Sho Aoyagi) had one of the best character arcs in the show. It must be noted that Aguni’s actions during his time at the Beach, especially letting Usagi be captured, make a case for the character to be considered irredeemable. Fortunately, Alice in Borderland never tries to picture Aguni as a hero, although he does become one of the leading characters in season 2. The highlight of Aguni’s story, however, was in season 1. Following the Hatter’s mysterious death, Aguni had to face his demons in an intense, emotional sequence amidst the chaos of the Ten of Hearts game.\nWhile it may seem odd to list a character who died in season 1, episode 3 as one of the show’s best, Arisu’s best friends made their mark on Alice in Borderland. Chota (Yuki Morinaga), who believed himself to be a coward, was at the center of one of the most emotional and tragic moments in the entire series. Chota fought Shibuki to protect Arisu and, alongside Karube, chose to die to save his best friend. Chota would then appear in a couple of scenes throughout the show in the form of an illusion guiding Arisu during key times.\nRelated: Alice In Borderland’s Sequel Is Perfect For Season 3 (But Netflix Probably Won’t Use It)\nAlmost everything said about Chota applies to Karube (Keita Machida), who also died in Alice in Borderland season 1, episode 3. Whereas Chota was shy, Karube was full of confidence and had many plans in the real world. Even still, he chose not to fight Arisu during the Seven of Hearts game and let his friend survive. The scene in which Karube accepts his fate and smiles as Arisu begins to cry is arguably the best moment of the show. Even after two seasons, both Chota and Karube remain among the best Alice in Borderland characters.\nArisu, the “Alice” referenced in the title, is the main character and driving force of Alice in Borderland. The fact that the show includes so many great characters, from villains to heroes, could play against Arisu. Fortunately, while Arisu is not necessarily the most interesting Alice in Borderland character, he does not suffer from “main character problems.” From his bond with his friends to his relationship with Usagi, Arisu is always at the center of the show’s most compelling moments. Arisu has a lot of heart, and, despite facing the most terrible situations throughout the series, he never becomes a worse version of himself.\nUsagi, the leading Alice in Borderland character alongside Arisu, could also have faced “protagonist problems.” For example, it was easy to predict whenever Usagi was going to survive a game, mostly because her and Arisu’s story would never be completed before the end of the series. Even still, Usagi is a compelling character, from her introduction as a mysterious and skillful player to her relationship with Arisu. Usagi was also at the center of the most intense action sequences in Alice in Borderland, including but not limited to her performance in the King of Clubs game. Usagi will now surely be involved in Alice in Borderland season 3’s Joker game.\nWith a strong personality and even stronger martial arts moves, Kuina (Asahina Aya) is among the best Alice in Borderland characters who were not necessarily the leading ones. She was introduced early in season 1 as one of the many people living at the Beach, and it was unclear whether she and Chishiya would be on the side of the heroes. Whereas Chishiya made some questionable decisions during the Beach segment, Kuina remained loyal to her friends during the entire show. Seeing Kuina's backstory and what fighting meant for her added even more lawyers to the character, who fortunately stayed around until the end of season 2.\nKyuma (Tomohisa Yamashita) was only in Alice in Borderland season 2 for three episodes. Even still, it is difficult not to consider the King of Clubs one of the best characters in the whole show. While some characters need multiple episodes of development to leave a strong impression, Kyuma only needed a few lines to be a highlight of the season. Each Face Card citizen believed in the message but their respective games, but Kyuma seemed to have an understanding of the world they were in that went beyond that of any other character. Between the real world and the games, it seems like Kyuma was always happy about his life.\nAlmost every Alice in Borderland character has at least one major moment in which they shine, but Chishiya (Nijiro Murakami) has several. From the second game of season 2 to the King of Diamonds, Chishiya stole the show every time he was on screen. The fact that the two best Alice in Borderland games – Solitary Confinement and Beauty Contest – were centered on Chishiya highlights how great of a character he is. Chishiya’s surprising backstory made him even more layered in retrospect. In addition, the way nothing seemed to bother him made for great scenes. Chishiya is Alice in Borderland’s best character, especially after season 2.\n"}
{"title": "Amazing Star Wars Art Brings The Darkest Ahsoka Season 2 Theory To Life", "date": "2023-10-10 23:31:28", "text": "The ending of the Ahsoka season finale makes the darkest Star Wars theory more likely, and an incredible piece of fan art brings this idea to life.\nThis article contains spoilers for Ahsoka.\nStunning new Star Wars fan art beautifully visualizes the darkest theory for Ahsoka season 2, showcasing the horrific yet exciting possibility. Ahsoka season 1 ended with the late Ray Stevenson's Baylan Skoll finding statues of the Force Gods of Mortis, which may foreshadow the return of the most chilling character from the Star Wars Legends continuity. If this theory comes true in Ahsoka season 2, it will radically change the Star Wars franchise and unleash the most terrible threat the galaxy has ever seen in canon.\n\"Comic, SW and all pop culture enthusiast\" @Melticaus on Twitter shared their incredible artwork of Ahsoka Tano and Abeloth, whose sinister reflection spans across the dark waters:\nThis poster is based on the popular theory that Star Wars is setting up Abeloth in Ahsoka, which seems more likely with the return of the Mortis Gods.\nAhsoka and the other Star Wars TV shows have already brought back several elements from Legends, and Abeloth would be a perfect antagonist for season 2. Known as \"the Mother\" among the Force Gods of Mortis, Abeloth was transformed into a dark Force being while also being twisted to madness, so the Father and his children abandoned her and created a prison to contain her. However, Abeloth eventually escaped and began corrupting Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order.\nThe dark power calling to Baylan is somehow connected to the Mortis Gods, so it would make sense if Abeloth were summoning Baylan to her prison. Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Star Wars Rebels, and now Ahsoka all focus on the Mortis Gods, so bringing Abeloth into the mix is the next logical step. She would be an unstoppable Force that would drastically raise the stakes in Ahsoka, but she could also return to plague Rey's New Jedi Order as she did Luke's in Legends. Abeloth is a perfect villain for Ahsoka season 2, but time will tell if Dave Filoni and his team bring this Star Wars theory to life.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are now streaming on Disney+.\nSource: @Melticaus\n"}
{"title": "The Wheel Of Time Season 2's Biggest Character Death Removes A Major Story From The Books", "date": "2023-10-10 23:31:28", "text": "The big character death in The Wheel of Time season 2 finale removes one of the books' most important fights, changing Rand's story in the process.\nWarning: Spoilers for The Wheel of Time season 2, episode 8\nThe biggest death in The Wheel of Time season 2 finale rules out a major fight from the books, changing Rand's future in the process. The final episode of the season saw a handful of characters meet their ends during the fight with the Seanchan at Falme. Based on what happens in the book version of the story, some were meant to die, whereas others exited the show in an unexpected way.\nConsidering that season 2 is an adaptation of The Great Hunt, the second book in Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time series, it was expected from the beginning that the story would wrap up in Falme. The bloodshed that occurs there along with the stakes of the battle, promised an intense, hugely consequential affair. In that respect, the show delivered, with Rand being proclaimed the Dragon Reborn and Mat summoning the Heroes of the Horn, plus all the character deaths. Ingtar, Turak, and Geofram Bornhald all died in the book version of the story, so their fates in the show weren’t surprising. What happened to Ishamael, however, wasn’t in The Great Hunt.\nRand killing Ishamael wasn’t the first time the show appeared to kill off Fares Fares’ character. Then thought to be the Dark One, Ishamael only seemed to die when fighting Rand at the Eye of the World, but it was widely assumed (correctly) that he survived the fight. This death scene, though, had a strong sense of finality. His exchange with Rand about what it feels like to die creates the impression that he really is gone for good, regardless of the notion that the Forsaken can be reincarnated as new people in the books.\nLong after dying at Rand’s hands in The Dragon Reborn, Ishamael returns as Moridin. Theoretically, this story can be told in the show, but the tone of Ishamael’s death scene makes that scenario a bit more doubtful, not to mention the fact that The Wheel of Time has the added challenge of adapting a 14-book story. Recycling villains via reincarnation would only make this harder, making it all the more likely that Ishamael’s story has reached its end.\nIshamael’s death stands in contrast to what happened in the book. In The Great Hunt, Rand defeated Ishamael, but the villain returned in the sequel, The Dragon Reborn. Similar to The Great Hunt, The Dragon Reborn concludes with another round of Rand vs. Ishamael, this time with the fight taking place at the Stone of Tear. After claiming Callandor (the prophesized weapon of the Dragon Reborn), Rand uses it to slay Ishamael in an epic fight. Ishamael’s role in The Dragon Reborn is what makes his death in the Wheel of Time season 2 finale such a big move for the show, as it forces more changes to the story later on down the road.\nNot unlike the fights at Falme and the Eye of the World, the battle at the Stone of Tear is an event of massive importance in Wheel of Time lore. What happened between Rand and Ishamael is significant in more ways than one, not the least of which being how it advances Rand’s journey toward fulfilling his destiny as the Dragon Reborn. It’s also what paves the way for Rand to head to the Aiel Waste, which is the basis of the story for book 4, The Shadow Rising. By killing off Ishamael, The Wheel of Time has raised several questions about its plans for Rand’s future.\nWhile Ishamael dying in Falme is a departure from the source material, it’s a change that makes sense when looking ahead to what’s in store for season 3. In the books, Rand goes to the Aiel Waste because he meets the Aiel at the Stone of Tear and realizes that in them, he has an army willing to follow him. Interestingly, the TV show’s Rand doesn’t have to go to the Stone of Tear for this to happen. Unlike their book counterparts, Aviendha and her fellow Maidens of the Spear were at Falme in the finale. Watching the spectacle atop the tower from a distance, Aviendha muttered the word, “Car’a’carn,” confirming that she’s identified Rand as the object of her search.\nNow that the Maidens of the Spear know Rand is the Car’a’carn, the series has a reason to begin his journey across the Aiel Waste. Since this is clearly what’s around the corner for Rand, it wouldn’t be able to fit his next encounter with Ishamael into his arc without additional changes. After all, Rand had already killed Ishamael before setting off for the Aiel Waste. It would seem that since the show is jumping straight into book 4 and in turn won’t have room for several book 3 stories, it elected to wrap up Ishamael’s arc early.\nThe prospect of the show cutting Ishamael’s story short comes with implications that go beyond just the fight itself. There’s also the matter of what this means for Rand claiming Callandor at the Stone of Tear. The idea that The Wheel of Time is skipping the core part of The Dragon Reborn’s story (Rand fighting Ishamael over Callandor at the Stone of Tear) creates concerns about how the series will work around this. Rand technically doesn’t have to fight Ishamael again for his story to be told properly, but the situation surrounding Callandor is a bit more complex. With or without Ishamael, Rand must find it, as it’s an indispensable piece of his Wheel of Time story.\nKnown as the “sword that is not a sword,” the One Power-imbued weapon is what Rand needs to complete the prophecy and stop the Dark One. For that reason, it’s likely that the show will incorporate this mission into a different story, whether it be his travels in the Aiel Waste in The Wheel of Time season 3 or a different journey altogether. As result, it may happen somewhere other than the Stone of Tear, and by the looks of things, it’ll also call for Rand to get past a different villain now that Ishamael is dead. Because Rahvin and Be’lal were there as well, it’s possible he’ll have to fight one of them to get Callandor in The Wheel of Time’s future.\n"}

In the DC Universe, there have been several sidekicks who have gone on to great things, and in The Flash #1, Wally West, who embodies this idea, explains why he, Nightwing, Donna Troy and others are far less angsty than Batman and other older heroes.\nThe Flash #1 – written by Si Spurrier and drawn by Mike Deodato – finds Wally West experiencing weird glitches and hiccups within the Speed Force. Wally goes to his boss, Mister Terrific, for help.\nHis thoughts racing, Wally says he is the sidekick “who made it” and he is “the luckiest guy in the world.” Wally then goes on to say he does not do “that angsty, Batcavey stuff.”\nDC Comics is not only home to some of the comic medium's most iconic sidekicks, the company practically invented the concept. Robin first appeared in 1940’s Detective Comics #38'; from there, kid sidekicks became all the rage, with multiple publishers jumping on the bandwagon. As comics progressed over the subsequent decades, this first wave of sidekicks “grew up” and became heroes in their own right. The first Robin, Dick Grayson, became Nightwing, while Wally West, the former Kid Flash, took over the mantle when Barry Allen died. Donna Troy, the first Wonder Girl, would go through a variety of aliases, and Garth, the former Aqualad, became Tempest.\nWhat united all of these sidekicks was the desire to escape their mentor’s shadows. Nightwing succeeded wonderfully, growing up to become one of the DC Universe’s most admired, trusted heroes in his own right. Donna Troy struggled to find her footing for years, as did characters like Speedy and Aqualad. Wally West struggled as well, but ultimately proved himself worthy of being called the Flash. For some of these former sidekicks, the drive to prove themselves made them into better heroes, Nightwing and Wally West in particular. Even Donna, Speedy and Aqualad eventually found second heroic careers that continue to this day.\nIt is this burning drive to succeed that gives DC’s second generation heroes less angst than their predecessors. Nightwing is well-adjusted and well respected, even more so than Batman. While some may still view Wally as immature, no one questions that he is his predecessor's equal as the Flash. Wally acknowledges that he is lucky in this regard, that he is a sidekick who made it. Armed with this perspective, Wally knows there is no room for angst and brooding. While not all of DC’s second generation heroes have had careers as successful as the Flash, they are by and far less angst-ridden than their mentors.\nThe Flash #1 is on sale now from DC Comics!\nShaun Corley is a freelance writer currently residing in the mountains of Appalachia.

{"title": "Exorcist: Believer Sequel Still Moving Forward Despite Poor Reception, But Creative Changes May Occur", "date": "2023-10-10 23:32:45", "text": "The Exorcist: Believer sequel is still on track for release, but the critical and commercial reaction to Believer could result in changes.\n2025's The Exorcist: Deceiver is still on track despite the reception of the new movie The Exorcist: Believer. Believer, which is the intended starting point for a trilogy of sequels to the 1973 classic The Exorcist, follows father Victor Fielding (Leslie Odom Jr.) approaching legacy character Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) for help when his daughter and her friend become possessed. The movie's $26.5 million domestic opening fell short of its original $30-$35 million projections, which were already considered a disappointment. This lukewarm commercial reception was met with a dire critical reception in the form of a 24% Rotten Tomatoes score.\nPer The Hollywood Reporter, the reaction to The Exorcist: Believer hasn't impacted the Exorcist: Deceiver release plans. Having spent $400 million on the distribution rights for a trio of movies, Blumhouse and Universal will carry on with production on the sequel, which is currently slated for release on April 18, 2025. However, THR reports that sources close to the production think that the creative approach to Deceiver will be retooled before it goes into production, despite the movie already having a completed script.\nIt makes sense that The Exorcist: Deceiver and the third Exorcist legacy sequel are still in the cards. With such a large monetary investment involved, it would likely take one of the movies winding up majorly in the red for the studios to back out. That is not the case here, as The Exorcist: Believer has already made its $30 million budget back at the global box office, even though it has not yet come close to making up for that $400 million price tag for the franchise itself.\nLuckily for the studios, the stage has already been set for a new creative direction for the next movie. In-universe, the Exorcist: Believer ending doesn't necessarily offer a cliffhanger promising that the main characters will return. Additionally, behind the scenes, director David Gordon Green, who was thought to be helming the entire new trilogy just like his previous trio of Halloween legacy sequels, has recently offered a more doubtful outlook on the possibility of him returning for Deceiver. Star Ellen Burstyn was also only officially attached to return for a single movie.\nBecause of these factors, the major players in the Exorcist: Believer cast and crew could easily be taken off the board almost entirely for The Exorcist: Deceiver. To succeed, the new movie could take a similar approach to Believer, telling an entirely new possession story set in the same universe, though with a renewed focus on a more commercial storyline. There is also the possibility that Linda Blair could return as Regan MacNeil, providing the sequel with a new legacy character to center its plot around that could potentially pique the interest of longtime fans of the franchise.\nSource: THR\n"}
{"title": "10 Movies Like Fair Play To Watch After Netflix's Hit", "date": "2023-10-10 23:40:27", "text": "After watching the thrilling new Netflix movie Fair Play, here are 10 similar movies that deliver similar sensual themes and heart-pounding suspense.\nAfter watching Netflix's new sensual thriller Fair Play, here are ten other movies with similar themes, tones, and narrative styles. Fair Play is the impressive directorial debut of Chloe Domont starring Phoebe Dynevor (Bridgerton) as Emily and Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story) as Luke. Domont, who also has directing credits on the popular HBO series Ballers as well as Billions and Suits, also wrote the screenplay of the sexually charged Fair Play that entangles themes of passion, greed, and betrayal. The intense film is currently ranked at number 2 on Netflix's Top 10 Movies in the U.S. chart as of writing.\nFair Play is incredibly nuanced and full of unspoken tension that is immediately compelling, dripped with grim and seductive themes while ultimately sending a larger message about entitlement and capitalistic envy. The film experimentally balances on the edge by plausibility with an ending that is intended to shock if nothing else, which admittedly could find some viewers confounded as the end credits roll. Still, the majority of Fair Play remains entertaining and enjoyable throughout, updating the erotic thriller subgenre that has been scarce and underutilized throughout decades of film history. Here are ten other similar movies to watch after Fair Play.\nRELATED:Fair Play Ending Explained\nUncut Gems is a frantic and nonstop thriller that is driven by desire, lust, and the human need for material symbols of achievement in a capitalistic society. Adam Sandler gives one of the greatest performances of his career as Howard Ratner, a desperate jeweler who pawns and bargains his way through life to uphold an inflated and luxurious lifestyle that he can't actually afford. His materialistic girlfriend Julia De Fiore (Julia Fox) fits perfectly into Howard's ambitious and expensive worldview. Their sexually-charged relationship is certainly centered on more commercial and mainstream interests than pure mutual admiration.\nCruel Intentions features '90s icons Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and Ryan Phillippe (I Know What You Did Last Summer) alongside a young Reese Witherspoon. A longtime cult classic, Cruel Intentions is wildly alluring with its sensual plot and themes that center around two elitist step-siblings who compete to gain the favor of the innocent and inexperienced Annette (Witherspoon). Both Kathryn (Geller) and Sebastian (Phillippe) are more interested in winning their secret game than gaining Annette's affection. Cruel Intentions is full of manipulation and dark comedy that fans of Fair Play will love.\nBasic Instinct is what most people think when they imagine an example of an erotic thriller, particularly because of one iconic scene featuring Sharon Stone. For fans of the subgenre, Basic Instinct is a must-watch as it greatly informs much of the quintessential functions and characteristics of the modern sensual thriller. The film, which also stars Michael Douglas, sacrifices plausibility for an enjoyable viewing experience, centering on a mysterious murder story full of attractive and unreliable characters with sharp neo-noir visual elements.\nRELATED: Fair Play Cast & Character Guide\nLa Piscine or \"The Swimming Pool\" is a somewhat obscure but accessible French film by Jacques Deray. Most of the plot points take place by a swimming pool at a villa in St. Tropez, hence the name of the film. La Piscine was remade as A Bigger Splash by Luca Guadagnino (Call Me By Your Name) in 2015 starring Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes, and Dakota Johnson, but the original film is arguably the better of the two. La Piscine is surprisingly a crime thriller despite the appearance of a beautiful and relaxed atmosphere on the surface, with a great deal of subtext and tension lurking beneath the seemingly shallow waters.\nIn a similar vein as Cruel Intentions, Wild Things stars two '90s icons in some of the most sensual and iconic performances of their careers. Neve Campbell (Scream) and Denise Richards (The World Is Not Enough) star alongside Kevin Bacon and Matt Dillon in this steamy crime thriller. Wild Things features similar tones of manipulation and seduction as Fair Play while being loaded with plot twists, beautiful locations and actors, and an often forgotten cameo by Bill Murray.\nFatal Attraction is another quintessential erotic thriller that was recently rebooted into a television miniseries this year. The original film has been heralded as one of the most impactful movies of the 1980s, featuring outstanding performances from Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone. Douglas plays a married man named Dan Gallagher whose one-night stand with Stone's Alex Forrest comes back to haunt him, stalking him and his family in this intensely seductive yet terrifying thriller.\nRELATED:Is Fatal Attraction Based On A True Story?\nEyes Wide Shut is Stanley Kubrick's final film and an entrancing portrait of desire, secrecy, and unsettling power. Eyes Wide Shut stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in two of the most provocative roles of their careers that are full of tension, subtext, and suspicions. Eyes Wide Shut is very similar to Fair Play in that the beginning of the movie starts out in a sharply accessible yet intriguing way only to later completely go off the rails as the story progresses to a surprisingly jarring final act. Eyes Wide Shut is often misunderstood as part of Kubrick's filmography, but as a companion to Fair Play, it's practically one and the same.\nConsidered widely as the original inspiration to the erotic thriller, Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is one of the acclaimed director's very best works. Starring James Stewart and Kim Novak, Vertigo is first and foremost an artistic and narrative achievement in film and is responsible for introducing one of the most fundamental shot types in modern cinematography, the dolly zoom. Outside its historical significance, Vertigo is as elegant as it is psychologically compelling, creating an air of suspense that is rich with thematic effect and self-reflexivity on the nature of filmmaking itself.\nMulholland Drive is arguably David Lynch's best movie and one of his most visionary directorial efforts. Noami Watts and Laura Harring are captivating as the two female leads alongside Justin Theroux's memorable performance. Mulholland Drive is best known for its mysterious atmosphere within the world of the film that largely drives the suspenseful story forward. Lynch uses the camera as part of the movie's narration, mixed in with the alluring themes of seduction that make it one of the most ingenious erotic thrillers ever made.\nGone Girl is arguably the greatest erotic thriller ever made with expert direction from auteur David Fincher. Based on the bestselling novel and original screenplay by Gillian Flynn, Gone Girl is overflowing with intrigue, suspense, and eerie seductive themes. The film is incredibly tightly wound and focused creating a masterful portrayal of a love story gone terribly wrong in every aspect from Rosamund Pike's Oscar-nominated performance to the mesmerizing and chilling soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. If you enjoyed Fair Play and have yet to see Gone Girl, you should definitely add it to your streaming watchlist.\n"}
{"title": "10 Best Ma Memes That Make The Movie Way Less Scary", "date": "2023-10-10 23:50:27", "text": "Like many other horror villains, Sue Ann from Ma became a pop culture icon, appearing in many hilarious memes that make the movie less scary.\nThe pop culture phenomenon Ma has provided source material for multiple funny memes that make the movie way less scary. The horror movie Ma follows a middle-aged woman named Sue Ann (Octavia Spencer), who befriends a group of teenagers, inviting them to her basement house parties with a few rules. First, they have to call her Ma. Secondly, none of them can curse in her home. And lastly, the teens can never go upstairs. Soon, though, Sue Ann becomes obsessed with the teens, terrorizing and hurting the kids she once called her friends.\nMa gained mixed reviews from critics, but they praised Spencer for elevating the horror movie with her phenomenal performance, which earned the actress a Saturn Award nomination. Unsurprisingly, Ma's villain became an internet sensation after the film released in theaters. Sue Ann went viral in memes, just like The Babadook did previously and M3GAN did four years later. The best memes for Ma provide laughs that make the movie less scary.\nWhen Ma came out, one of the most popular meme trends involved placing Sue Ann in the promo photos for movies with \"Ma\" in their titles. A hilarious example comes in the form of this meme shared by the actress herself. By placing the character Sue Ann in the movie poster, it brings to mind The Greatest Showman's most important song, \"This Is Me.\" This creates ironic humor because the song is about embracing the things that make individuals unique. In the case of Sue Ann, she's unique because she's a lonely middle-aged woman who becomes obsessed with befriending and torturing teenagers.\nWhile spooky in the movie, Ma includes shots that are hilariously relatable when taken out of context. The GIF in this meme shared by Whitney on Twitter comes from one of the many scenes where Sue Ann stalks the teenagers. The character looks frustrated, judgmental, and extremely intense. Above the GIF, it says \"Me: I'm not judgmental, Also me:\" This alludes to the common human experience of not admitting our flaws. Judging others is a natural part of life. As such, it's easy to laugh at this meme since most people are guilty of it at some point or another.\nThis video contains audio distortion that may trigger people with auditory sensitivities.\nDuring the movie Ma, Sue Ann stands behind a brick wall while eavesdropping on the teenagers she befriends. Her little smile seems sinister and spooky. TikTok's user TresureTheQueen turned this moment in Ma into an amusing meme. The video includes the text \"Me overhearing people talking s**t about me and someone starts defending me\" with a heart-eye emoji. Part of the human experience is caring about what others think because the species is evolutionarily community-oriented. It's common for individuals to wonder what people say when they aren't around. The meme affirms the fact that good friends will often defend one another, no matter their proximity to each other.\nContinuing the trend of incorporating Ma into other movie posters, this meme shared by Twitter user @irsyadmuflih and Spencer replaces the \"J\" in Jaws with an \"M,\" making it Maws. The person who made the meme edited the shark to look like its skin is peeling back, revealing a smiling Sue Ann. Considering both the shark and Sue Ann are the villains of their respective horror franchises, it's clever to combine them. Additionally, the smile on Sue Ann's face evokes a sense of joy for hurting others, which fits with the movie Ma.\nThis video meme points out the fact that the post-production team made a peculiar choice by including the EDM song \"Lookout Weekend\" by Debbie Deb in the credits of Ma. This song choice feels tonally inappropriate. Electronic music typically blends well with sci-fi flicks, and dance music fits with action movies. Neither makes much sense for horror. When production teams choose to subvert expectations, there's usually a clear reason, like the lyrics feeling poignant. \"Lookout Weekend\" has no connection to the plot or ending of Ma, which makes the choice even more bizarre. It's almost like the director just wanted audiences to dance their way out of the theaters.\nMa created effective scares by drawing on realistic fears like stalkers and psychological manipulation. It's not a film that leaves the mind easily, and it could haunt viewers late at night when they're trying to sleep. This meme combines this with the idea of relationship insecurity, making it widely relatable on multiple fronts. One partner thinks the other is thinking about someone else outside their relationship. They aren't entirely incorrect because the meme goes on to show that the second partner is thinking about Sue Ann from Ma, making a distressed expression. Clearly, this movie harnessed horror well, successfully creating a lasting impact.\nvia GIPHY\nBefore she goes off the rails by stalking and hurting people in Ma, Sue Ann seems like a woman who likes to party — albeit with teenagers, which is inherently predatory and creepy. One of the funniest moments from the movie is when she decides to kick a tower of empty beer cans down, as shown in this meme. Above the clip, the meme includes the words \"Me: I'm going to bed early tonight, Me at 3 am:\" which draws on the fact that nights in don't always go as planned, leading to some of the craziest stories later on.\nRelated: Is Ma Based On A True Story? Horror Movie’s Inspirations Explained\nSpencer had a ball with the memes that Photoshopped Sue Ann into other movies, even holding an unofficial competition to decide the best one. The meme that won the contest included various expressions of Sue Ann from Ma put onto all the characters' faces of Jumanji: Next Level. JillJohnson75, the person who created the meme, even Photoshopped safari hats onto the character, making the image all the more hilarious. \"Next Level\" takes on a double meaning because it's part of the movie's title, but the phrase also represents the effort put into the meme.\nDuring one scene in Ma, Sue Ann starts crying while driving the car. This not only shows off Spencer's incredible acting skills but also provides the framework for funny memes. These memes used the clip with a caption highlighting mundane inconveniences that occur in everyday life. This meme posted to TikTok by user TonyBear1988 provides the funniest, best example. In this case, a crying Sue Ann is put with the caption, \"When you're about to start cooking but have to run back to the store because you forgot something.\" The comments prove how commonly this occurs, with many users saying they'd rather make something else than go back out.\nvia GIPHY\nAt one point in Ma, Sue Ann hugs one of the teenagers. She smiles as she leans in, but her face immediately goes flat during the hug. This two-second clip became part of a hilarious GIF meme, including a caption above it that reads, \"When you make plans and immediately regret it.\" For introverts and people-pleasers alike, this meme will resonate due to the dread that sets in after a person realizes they agreed to something without considering their own needs or wants. Like many other Ma memes, this doesn't connect back to the plot, but it does make the movie much less scary in the long run.\n"}
{"title": "The Haunting In Connecticut’s Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-11 00:00:27", "text": "After a family is tormented by spirits throughout The Haunting in Connecticut, the horror movie wraps things up with a rather conclusive ending. \nThe Haunting in Connecticut follows a semi-true story of a family tormented in their home by dark spirits. The plot is centered on Matt, a teenager with cancer, and his parents, Sara and Peter. Simultaneously, the family is dealing with Peter's alcohol abuse, which only makes their situation worse. To be closer to Matt's doctors, the family moves to a new home with Matt's younger brother Billy and his cousins Wendy and Mary.\nAfter the move, Matt begins to experience intense visions, which his family initially thinks are a result of his cancer treatments. However, soon, they all learn there's a room in the basement that once was used as a mortuary. When the rest of the family starts having terrifying supernatural experiences, they realize Matt is telling the truth and something horrifying is happening in their new house. By the end of The Haunting in Connecticut, though, the evil spirits appear to be gone.\nRelated: 10 Creepy Horror Movies Inspired by True Stories\nAfter being haunted by spirits throughout The Haunting in Connecticut, Matt realizes he has to defeat them himself if he wants the terror to stop. He escapes the hospital where he's being treated after awakening to symbols carved into his skin. He returns home with an ax and breaks down the walls, revealing several corpses that had been stuffed there years ago. After doing research and talking to fellow patient Nicholas, Matt learns about a fire that previously occurred in the home.\nMatt decides to free the spirits by lighting the home on fire again. According to The Haunting in Connecticut's ending titles, the house was rebuilt, and none of the later owners ever complained about any supernatural events occurring. The film doesn't clarify exactly how Matt was able to free the spirits. However, it seems his ability to understand the suffering that had happened in the home helped him put an end to the haunting.\nRelated: Every Horror Movie Based On Ed & Lorraine Warren's Ghost Cases\nOne of the most mysterious aspects of The Haunting in Connecticut's ending is how Matt's cancer disappeared after he burned down the home. According to the ending narration from Sara, she believes it was God working in mysterious ways to heal her son. However, there's another interpretation that can come from the film's ending.\nIt's possible that since Matt was experiencing great suffering due to his cancer, he was able to connect to the spirits who had suffered in the home. This could be the reason only he and Nicholas could see the visions while the others in the home could not. When Matt is able to free the spirits and put an end to the torture in the home by burning it down, he is also able to put an end to his own suffering.\nOther than Matt, Jonah is the most crucial character in The Haunting In Connecticut. Many scenes throughout the film suggest there is a connection between Matt and Jonah. At some points in the movie, Jonah even possesses Matt's body and can see the world through Matt's eyes. While it seems Jonah is evil and is responsible for Matt's paranormal experiences, he's actually a victim.\nHe often appears as a burned body who won't leave Matt alone. However, it's later revealed he was actually the assistant of a mortician named Ramsey Aickman, who used to use Jonah to hold séances. But Aickman was binding the spirits to the home, which is why they haunt Matt in the present day.\nAfter everyone else is burned by a spark during the séance, Aickman tells Jonah to escape before he dies with them. Unfortunately, after attempting to escape through the dumbwaiter, Jonah is pulled back down and burned to death. Jonah is then trapped in the house with the rest of the spirits who continue to haunt the home.\nRelated: 10 Real-Life Haunted Places That Inspired Movies\nOne of the saddest aspects of The Haunting in Connecticut is that while Peter and Sara are dealing with their son's cancer, Peter also has to deal with his addiction to alcohol. One night, he comes home drunk and furious that his family has left all the lights in the house on before going to bed. However, Sara follows him outside and scolds him for his behavior.\nIn the next scene where Peter appears, he's listening to an old tape that Matt had sent him from summer camp where he's talking about how excited he is for parent visiting day. At this moment, Peter seems to understand how important it is for him to get better so that he can be there for his wife and son through Matt's illness. The Haunting in Connecticut doesn't confirm what happens with Peter, but the scene suggests he's ready to heal himself so that he can heal his son as well.\nAfter attempting to free the spirits from the home, Nicholas warns Sara that things could get worse in the house before they get better. He compares the situation to the aftershocks of an earthquake. Unfortunately, he later learns that by trying to help the family, he actually made things worse. Nicholas did not remove the evil spirits from the home, but he removed Jonah's spirit from the home.\nHe learns that Jonah wasn't evil, but he was a good spirit who was trying to protect the family from the others. By removing him, he actually put Matt and his family in great danger. This is why Matt wakes up with carvings on his body and has to be rushed to the hospital. It also causes all the food in Matt's home to go bad, which his cousin Wendy discovers after biting into a rotten apple.\nWendy is then attacked by a spirit in the bathroom. Also, even though Nicholas rid the home of Jonah, he didn't actually free him. Jonah continues to appear as a burned body, haunting both Nicholas and Matt, trying to get them to rid the home of the other spirits.\nThe Haunting in Connecticut is allegedly based on a true story, namely the events that happened to the Snedeker family, who rented a home in Southington, Connecticut, in 1986. Their son Phillip Snedeker really did have cancer, though according to a People magazine interview, his cancer was in remission. When he complained of supernatural experiences, as Matt did in the film, doctors diagnosed him with schizophrenia.\nThe family even sent Phillip to live with other relatives because he was playing cruel pranks on his family members but later forgot that he'd done them. This was not shown in The Haunting in Connecticut film. However, according to NBC News, many believe the Snedeker family made up the whole thing, possibly as a copycat story, after the financial gain the Lutz family experienced from The Amityville Horror book and films.\nIn fact, Ray Garton, the author of the book In a Dark Place: The Story of a True Haunting, which the film was based on, doesn't believe the Snedeker family either. He found a lot of inconsistencies in their stories and was directed to write what he was able to get from the family and make the rest of it up. It's hard to say what really happened in the real story of The Haunting in Connecticut, but it made for a great horror film.\n"}

The first season of Loki was one of the best-reviewed MCU shows on Disney+, but the shows that have arrived since then haven't been as well received, so Loki season 2's reviews are a good sign..\nThe MCU had a strong Rotten Tomatoes average before the franchise lost its perfect record with Eternals. Phases 1-3 MCU movies averaged 85 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, but Phase 4 averaged 76 percent, and so far Phase 5 is only averaging 64 percent. The situation isn't much better when it comes to the MCU's streaming shows. While every single Disney+ had earned an overall Fresh score, the average was declining before Secret Invasion earned the first Rotten score for an MCU series.\nRelated: Loki Season 2's Time Travel Explained\nThe MCU earned 25 back-to-back Fresh Rotten Tomatoes scores before Eternals broke the streak, earning a 47 percent. Phase 4 was the MCU's lowest Rotten Tomatoes average yet, but Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania kicked off Phase 5 with another 47 percent score, making the Phase 5 average even lower, and the Phase 5 Disney+ shows haven't done much better. She Hulk: Attorney at Law ended Phase 4's Disney+ shows with the lowest score yet for an MCU series at 77 percent, and Secret Invasion is the first Disney+ series to earn a Rotten score, earning a 54 percent, so Loki's 90 percent (so far) is a much-needed improvement.\nTom Hiddleston's Loki was a big hit in Phase 1 of the MCU, particularly after serving as the main antagonist in The Avengers and his viral Comic-Con Hall H moment where he appeared on stage in character. He gained even more popularity in Phase 2 and 3 as a highlight of both Thor: The Dark World and Thor: Love and Thunder, making him one of the MCU's most enduring characters. The first season of Loki is also one of the most popular MCU shows on Disney+, so audiences and critics are primed to embrace its return, especially after the season finale opened up the multiverse, ending with a cliffhanger.\nThe MCU has struggled as it's shifted away from its Phase 1-3 characters coincides with its expansion on the small screen with Disney+ shows and Disney CEO Bob Iger even suggested the rapid expansion of streaming shows is to blame for a drop in quality. While the majority of the MCU's streaming shows on Disney+ have been well received, it's still hard to maintain quality control with the sheer volume of output from Marvel Studios. Finding success again with Loki is a big deal for the small-screen MCU, but the impact could extend to the big screen as the MCU seeks to regain its footing.\nLoki's absence from Thor: Love and Thunder was notable, and with Avengers: Secret Wars on the way, the MCU is already turning back towards some legacy Marvel heroes, meaning Loki, who's embroiled in the MCU's multiverse, could very well make his return to the big screen. Disney may also see this as a sign to bring back other tried-and-true Phase 1-3 characters. This is already happening with the success of Spider-Man: Now Way Home and hype for Hugh Jackman's return in Deadpool 3, Disney may decide to lean into this strategy even more than they already are with the current plan.\nLoki season 2 is just starting, so its Rotten Tomatoes score could always change in either direction, but for now, it's a much-needed critical win for the MCU. Of course, despite the Fresh Rotten Tomatoes score, Loki still has other potential problems, such as the looming assault allegations against Jonathan Majors, who plays a significant role in the series and has massive implications on the overall franchise as it approaches Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. Phase 5 of the MCU still has an uphill battle on multiple fronts, but when it comes to the franchise's recent critical struggles, Loki's Fresh Rotten Tomatoes score is a step in the right direction.\n"}
{"title": "&quot;I Turned Down X-Men and Batman&quot;: Comics Giant Rick Remender Signs Exclusive Creator-Owned Deal with Image", "date": "2023-10-11 00:00:27", "text": "In a bold move, renowned comics giant Rick Remender turned down offers to write for X-Men and Batman, signing an exclusive deal with Image Comics.\nComics giant Rick Remender has signed an exclusive creator-owned deal with Image Comics, stating that he turned down generous offers involving X-Men and Batman to pursue this promising partnership with Image. Remender is set to commit all his creator-owned work to Image Comics while continuing to work with his Giant Generator imprint.\nIn solicitations shared by Comicsbeat, Remender announced the signing of a three-year deal on his creator-owned projects, keeping him at Image exclusively.\nThis one-of-a-kind deal gives Remender complete creative freedom, something that was a goal of his when he founded his Giant Generator imprint back in 2016. Remender has had a long-standing association with Image Comics, which will continue to flourish with this latest deal.\nRelated: Exclusive: 'A Righteous Thirst For Vengeance' Comes To Image Comics\nRemender further opened up about his recent deal with the comic book publishing giant, stating that Image will take no ownership over his works. This development is groundbreaking in the comic book community, as writers and artists have advocated for this for decades. Remender and his partners will co-own 100% of their properties, a rarity in the industry. The comic book icon went on to say that Image is the only place where this was possible, and that he has absolute faith in the deal and the fruits it will bear. Remender's confidence in the deal is further underscored by his refusal of \"generous offers to write X-Men and Batman.\"\nHowever, Remender isn't the sole enthusiast about this upcoming partnership. In a press release, Image Comics Publisher and Chief Creative Officer Eric Stephenson conveyed his own excitement. He likened working with Remender to \"speeding down the open road in a convertible with the top down,\" emphasizing the creativity, excitement, and energy that Remender brings to collaborations. Stephenson described the writer as the embodiment of the Image Comics spirit, and expressed anticipation for the creative journey ahead, a sentiment undoubtedly shared by fans. Although the specifics of Remender's new titles for Image not been disclosed, one thing remains certain: it’s going to be a ride well worth it.\nRemender and Image’s partnership is a groundbreaking announcement, considering that this type of deal is not often signed between creators and publishers. It also has the potential to change the landscape of comics – DC, Marvel, and other comic publishing companies will not only be deprived of Remender’s brilliant and fan-cherished works for the foreseeable future, but these comic publishing juggernauts may also start to feel the pressure to extend similar agreements to their creative teams, granting them the creative rights they've long sought. Remender’s deal could mark the dawn of a promising new era in comic creation, for writers and artists alike.\nThis partnership also promises an exciting array of new titles and creative comic runs that are sure to captivate and delight fans. With Remender's reputation for innovative storytelling, and the artistic freedom that Image offers its creators, readers can anticipate a fresh wave of original and imaginative content. This collaboration not only reaffirms Image Comics' commitment to fostering creative independence but also ensures that fans will be treated to a diverse and dynamic range of stories that push the boundaries of the medium. It's an exciting moment, promising the unique narratives and artistic visions that Remender and Image Comics are poised to deliver.\nSource: Comicsbeat\nCombining her love for DC and her experience as an Intelligence Analyst, Taylor began writing for Screen Rant in 2023.

The fifth and final season of Breaking Bad begins with a flash-forward to ragged and bearded Walter White who, living under a different identity, has a depressing breakfast at a Denny's on his 52nd birthday. After leaving the restaurant, he opens the trunk of a Cadillac containing an M60 machine gun before the cold open ends on a cliffhanger.\nIn an interview with Variety celebrating the 10th anniversary of the series finale, Gilligan reflected on the opening scene of Breaking Bad season 5. Because he didn't know what Walt was going to do with the machine gun when he wrote the scene, the creator and showrunner called the decision \"the dumbest thing\" he ever did. Read his full comments below:\nThe biggest single fear we had was what to do with that damn machine gun. At the beginning of the final run of 16 episodes, we had Walt buy a machine gun in the trunk of a Cadillac. That was the thing I remember freaking us out the most because we did that, I committed to that. One of the dumbest things I’ve ever done in my career was committing to the idea of Walter White buying a machine gun when we did not know what he was going to do with it. We had no clue. There were literally months on end when I was completely freaked out. We’d be in the writers room’ for a full day, and I’d be slowly banging my head against the wall — not enough to hurt myself but just enough to jar the ideas loose. And everybody was kind of worried about me.\nOnce we figured out this machine gun, that was when the dam broke and things started slowly to click together. It was after that point that we figured he’s got to win. He’s lost everything because of his hubris and his pride and his ego. He’s lost his family, he’s lost his soul. But he’s got to win on some level. He’s at least got to deliver that money to his family. How the hell does he do that once the world knows who he really is? When we figured out that Gretchen and Elliott could be the mechanism by which Walt wins and gets that money to his family, that was a good day.\nIt was the dumbest thing I ever did. I was like, “Let’s start off this season with a bang.” It’s Walt’s 52nd birthday, let’s do the thing with the bacon and he’s all alone in a Denny’s. And he looks like hell. He looks like the Unabomber. What’s he at a Denny’s for? Well, he’s buying a machine gun, of course! It was self-evident that Walt’s story should not end well, so the idea of him looking like the cancer had returned felt right. But you just kind of feel your way through. We didn’t know where it was going. It’s astounding how little we knew. There was a little bit of hubris on my part thinking we would figure it out.\n“We’ve got 16 episodes until the end. We’ll get there!” We were still six or seven episodes away from the end and we still hadn’t figured out where we were going with the machine gun. I remember saying, “Just for a thought experiment, let’s pretend we never did that thing with the machine gun.” I got really scared, but my writers kept me honest. They held my feet to the fire and said we needed to deal with the machine gun. But we made it up as we went. What does this character want right now? What obstacle is in his way? To anyone reading this who fancies a career as a showrunner, don’t do it that way! It’s painful and scary.\nEven though Gilligan didn't know what Walt was going to do with the machine gun and now considers the decision \"the dumbest thing\" he ever did, it inadvertently set the stage for a great ending. As Gillian says, figuring out what Walt was going to do with the gun was the key to crafting the perfect ending. In the end, Walt uses the weapon to exact revenge against Jack who murdered his brother-in-law Hank and stole much of his money. By using the machine gun against Jack and his Neo-Nazi gang, Walt is also able to free an enslaved Jesse.\nRelated: What Happened To Every Character After Breaking Bad: All Confirmed Details\nBreaking Bad season 5 sees Walt suffer various losses, including his family and fortune. However, before he goes out in a blaze of glory, he threatens Gretchen and Elliot into funneling what's left of his meth empire to his estranged son, Walter Jr., and wife, Skyler. Though he's lost almost everything because of his hubris, the ending includes several small wins for Walt, as Gilligan notes, resulting in a perfectly bittersweet conclusion. Perhaps it wasn't dumb, but a brilliant decision for Gilligan to write himself into a corner since it resulted in one of the greatest finales ever.\nSource: Variety\n"}

Marvel reminded readers of their friendship in Bloodline: Daughter of Blade earlier this year, where Strange played a part in protecting Blade's family.\nBlade #3 – by Bryan Hill, Elena Casagrande, Valentina Pinti, KJ Diaz, and VC's Cory Petit – teased the reunion, with Blade in need of some supernatural help in retrieving Lucifer's sword from a billionaire's train.\nIt's easy to forget just how close Blade and Strange are, but the two have a longstanding history. Now, the two are back together for a high-octane new mission.\nDue to a miscommunication earlier in the series, Blade killed the one warrior capable of killing his toughest foe yet, the Adana. In Blade #3, Blade learns that the only thing that can beat Adana is Lucifer's Lightbringer, currently in the possession of the hermitlike Hamilton Achilles (who is like Iron Man, but \"brutal.\") Blade is soon ambushed by that warrior's cult. Just as he's about to be shot with their arrows, Blade suddenly reverts into his astral form, and the opposing warriors are wiped out. The reason is revealed in the form of a suddenly appearing Doctor Strange, whose own group was killed by the Adana earlier.\nIt is a bittersweet reunion for the two, as the former Sorcerer Supreme admits to being disappointed in Blade for his role in bringing the Adana to fruition. Blade #4 is likely going to contain an awkward conversation, especially since it appears this may be their first interaction since Strange came back from the dead. However, Strange will have to get over whatever disappointment he's feeling, as there are bigger things for the duo to concern themselves with. Not just in regard to horrifying threat of the Adana, but also the hellbound sword that will be needed to destroy her.\nThe teaser for Blade #4 at the end of this issue promises that Strange will be joining the team of Blade, his arms dealer Tulip, and his sidekick Rotha in boarding the elusive train, in which the aforementioned Hamilton Achilles takes resides. It looks like getting Lucifer's Lightbringer will need more than simple negotiations, as the newfound troupe will have to battle a train full of vampires if they want to escape with the sword. Not only will this be the first team-up between the two Marvel heroes in years, but Blade and Doctor Strange get to show off in this train heist exactly why they're Marvel's most underrated duo.\nJoe Anthony Myrick (or JAM) is a comics writer who specializes in, of course, covering the big figureheads of the industry (Marvel and DC), as well as lesser-known indy parties and some personal favorites like BOOM!

With October in full swing, there has been a sharp rise in horror content, both on the big and small screens. While the Scream franchise released a movie back in March, The Simpsons has another installment of its Treehouse of Horror series on the horizon. It is set to air on November 5.\nThe Simpsons now gets its own horror take in new Scream-inspired crossover art from @theartofcrowphantom. This piece poses Lisa Simpson next to Ghostface in a vintage-style horror poster. On it, Lisa wears a frightened expression while clutching a telephone as Ghostface holds a bloody knife.\nThe artist titles it Treehouse of Horror, an homage to the ongoing Simpsons horror specials of the same name. The caption reads, “It’s that time of year again!” and encourages onlookers to “stay spooky.”\n@theartofcrowphantom uses a simple but effective approach to mix the two franchises. On the poster, Lisa and Ghostface pose above a home highly reminiscent of the Simpsons' own household. The colors are sparse, with the only light coming from the house and an eerie moon behind the two central characters.\nWhile a comedy series, The Simpsons has an annual tradition of creating “Treehouse of Horror” episodes during the Halloween season. These episodes use horror tropes and draw from specific movies to give the animated comedy a spooky flair. With the 33 Treehouse of Horror episodes to date, there are copious horror film homages, including spoofs of Frankenstein, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, and The Fly.\nRelated: The Simpsons Treehouse Of Horror Could Confirm A Big Death Note Theory\nThe Simpsons has yet to have a Treehouse of Horror specifically dedicated towards a Scream parody, though Ghostface did appear briefly in season 16, episode 20, “Home Away from Homer.” This newest spooky art seems to be the sign that perhaps The Simpsons should take on Scream in a future edition of the Halloween special. The Simpsons will have plenty of opportunities ahead, as Treehouse of Horror continues year after year, and the series has already been renewed for season 36.\nSource: @theartofcrowphantom/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "800 Doctor Who Episodes Available To Stream On BBC In Celebration Of 60th Anniversary Specials", "date": "2023-10-11 03:08:25", "text": "Nearly every Doctor Who episode will finally be available to stream in one place - the BBC iPlayer - ahead of the show's 60th anniversary.\nAll 800 available Doctor Who episodes will stream on the BBC iPlayer in time for the celebration of its 60th anniversary. The long-running sci-fi series first made its debut on November 23, 1963. Returning star David Tennant will take on the role of the new, enigmatic Fourteenth Doctor across three specials that will air in November and celebrate the show's upcoming milestone.\nAhead of Doctor Who's 60th anniversary specials, the official Doctor Who website has declared that nearly every episode since the show began in 1963 will be available on the BBC iPlayer for the first time ever. All 800 preserved episodes dating back to the First Doctor's debut in \"An Unearthly Child\" to the Thirteenth Doctor's regeneration in \"The Power of the Doctor\" will be viewable for UK audiences on November 1, alongside spin-offs The Sarah Jane Adventures, Torchwood, and Class. A number of tie-in programs including behind-the-scenes series Doctor Who: Confidential will also be made available for viewers.\nWhile the BBC has utilized Doctor Who as a key draw for iPlayer ever since the service was rebranded for the streaming era, its classic run has never been fully shared there. Netflix held the rights to stream the classic episodes for some time before they were added to Britbox alongside a number of Doctor Who-related shows developed for the 50th anniversary, including making-of drama An Adventure In Space and Time. However, with BritBox falling under new ownership and facing a rebranding, it is clear the BBC is using this opportunity to make its own service more appealing.\nFurthermore, while its spin-offs gradually found their way to the service, there are certain Doctor Who entries wrapped in other disputes that prevented them from appearing on streaming. The 1996 Paul McGann-led TV movie Doctor Who and Torchwood season 4 were previously stuck in disputes with the BBC and their collaborators, while licensed music copyright issues complicated Doctor Who: Confidential's streaming. With all issues seemingly solved, it will be a relief for many to see every adventure in space and time available in one place.\nWith the classic era and tie-in materials joining iPlayer alongside the revival and spin-offs, the platform's Doctor Who library can offer viewers a chance to revisit essential classic stories ahead of the 60th anniversary. Furthermore, with Doctor Who set to stream internationally on Disney+ for the 60th anniversary and season 14, it could be that the resolved issues will allow for previous episodes to join that service for viewers outside the UK, though whether that will happen so far remains unclear.\nSource: Doctor Who\n"}
{"title": "Star Wars: Anakin Skywalker's 'Father' Finally Revealed", "date": "2023-10-11 05:01:47", "text": "The mystery of Anakin Skywalker's father has finally been solved, with Star Wars seemingly confirming a major fan theory. SPOILERS ahead.\nThe mystery of Anakin Skywalker’s birth has finally been solved, confirming Sheev Palpatine's true role in his mother's pregnancy, and changing the Star Wars mythology behind the corruption of Darth Vader forever.\nThe revelation is offered in the pages of Marvel's canonical Darth Vader #25, proving one long-held fan theory mostly true in its claims that Anakin Skywalker was designed, or engineered (not conceived naturally). It may seem strange that Anakin's parentage didn't become the driving mystery of the Star Wars prequels, when Qui-Gon Jinn sensed the greatest “vergence of the Force” he had ever encountered, and asked the obvious question: \"Who is this boy’s father?\" Assuming such a connection to the Force could only be explained through genetics (Luke would later refer to the “mighty Skywalker blood” in Ben Solo, too), Qui-Gon didn't get the answer he was looking for.\nAccording to Shmi Skywalker, “There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him, I can't explain what happened.” Even in the world of Star Wars, a cosmic variation on a \"virgin birth\" is a major development, and Qui-Gon knew to bring the boy back to the cradle of the Jedi. The boy, he believed, whom the Jedi had been waiting for. Not because he was created without a father, but because his 'father' was the Force itself. Apparently, he wasn't entirely wrong.\nThis step in the mystery of Anakin’s birth is sure to be controversial, even difficult for some Star Wars fans, since it relies upon the intervention of Midi-chlorians. But whether the Force is an ‘energy field’ connecting all life forms, or the effect of microscopic beings connecting all life forms, the result is the same. And Qui-Gon judged that the only way Anakin Skywalker could possess his concentration of Midi-chlorians was if they created him themselves, inside Shmi Skywalker’s womb. Making Anakin the Chosen One, prophesied to one day emerge to bring balance to the Force.\nThat was Qui-Gon’s theory, at least, and it was left as the only explanation in the Star Wars movies (before the mystery was largely sidelined). Theories and potential explanations arose in expanded universe novels, even linking Anakin’s conception to the Sith Lords, instead of the Midi-chlorians alone. UBut now that the truth has been shown, it appears Qui-Gon was just as deceived as the rest of the Jedi Council. The Midi-chlorians may have been the tool used to create Anakin Skywalker, but it wasn’t their idea. Anakin Skywalker was created by manipulating the Dark Side of the Force, as many suspected, but the identity of his ‘father’ guarantees no fan will ever see the Star Wars saga the same way again.\nYes, Star Wars fans, Darth Vader #25 confirms Anakin Skywalker was the result of Dark Side/Midi-chlorian manipulation inside of Shmi Skywalker’s womb, performed personally by Emperor Palpatine. And for those who might wonder how Anakin could ever learn such an Earth-shattering truth, without suspicion of it being further manipulation by his Sith Master, the circumstances of the story help explain.\nWriter Charles Soule and artist Giuseppe Camuncoli's Vader series makes multiple exciting changes to the Star Wars canon, also explaining that Darth Vader built his castle to save Padmé. But upon succeeding in his mission to tear a hole between the realm of life, and that of the living Force, Vader (shown in his true Force form as a roiling figure of dark energy) re-lives the most pivotal moments of his life. Starting from the beginning, beholding his pregnant mother... with Palpatine’s arms encircling her, hands curled in Sith sorcery, forming the swirl of energy inside of her that would one day emerge as Anakin.\nFrom the moment Chancellor Palpatine told Anakin about the tale of Darth Plagueis the Wise and his mastery over life and death, fans have theorized that George Lucas was hinting at something more than fairy tales. The story of the Sith Lord who learned to manipulate Midi-chlorians to create life, and the Apprentice who killed him in his sleep, they speculate, had to be more than it seemed. While Anakin heard he could keep his wife alive through the Dark Side, some viewers heard Sidious confirming he had killed his master after learning that same power over life itself.\nThe knowing looks at Anakin are all the evidence needed, and the full story laid out in the Darth Plagueis novel by James Luceno added fuel to the fire. Some details were left vague, but the story suggests Darth Plagueis and Darth Sidious reached out through the Force to try to create a child they could use as an ultimate weapon. But the Midi-chlorians, sensing their attempt, foiled their plans... creating a child that would bring about the end of the Sith, instead. Of course, that was before Disney bought Lucasfilm and wiped Plagueis from canon, along with all other novels (until they can be worked back into the new Star Wars canon).\nThe same attempt to bring the story of Darth Plagueis back into canon could be at work here, even if the comic shows Palpatine playing a far more personal role in the manipulation of Midi-chlorians to create Anakin. In fact, the passage from Darth Plagueis in which Count Dooku informs Palpatine of Qui-Gon's discovery reads completely different in this new context:\n\"Qui-Gon returned from Tatooine with a former slave boy. According to the boy's mother, the boy had no father... Perhaps conceived by the Force. As Qui-Gon believes.\"\nPalpatine's head snapped back... \"Does this have something to do with the prophecy you spoke of?\"\n\"Everything. Qui-Gon believes that the boy-Anakin is his name-stands at the center of a vergence in the Force, and believes further that his finding him was the will of the Force. Blood tests were apparently performed, and the boy's concentration of midi-chlorians is unprecedented.\"\n\"What is known about this Anakin?\"\n\"Very little, except for the fact that he was born into slavery nine years ago and was, until recently, along with his mother, the property of Gardulla the Hutt, then a Toydarian junk dealer.\" Dooku smirked. \"Also that he won the Boonta Eve Classic Podrace.\"\nPalpatine had stopped listening.\nNine years old... Conceived by the Force... Is it possible...\nUntil now, it was still just rumor and fan theory that suggested Darth Sidious had been the closest thing to a father Anakin Skywalker had, making Palpatine and Vader a father and son. Now this canonical comic has seemingly confirmed he did the job personally (perhaps the only attempt that worked?), but what this means for the bloodline which followed, and Palpatine's connection to Luke, Leia, or Ben Solo is for each fan to consider.\nDarth Vader #25 is available from Marvel Comics.\n"}
{"title": "20 Great Anime Featuring Strong Female Protagonists", "date": "2023-10-11 05:07:36", "text": "From classics like Ghost In The Shell to the more recent Fate or Violet Evergarden, these anime are all about the strong female leads. \nIt's no exaggeration to say that some of the best anime feature strong female characters. Anime is an incredibly diverse media that has something for everyone. Whether the audience is looking for an action-packed, battle-oriented story with larger-than-life characters who possess all kinds of cool powers, or a down-to-Earth, heartwarming tale of everyday life with a relatable cast of characters, there's a whole list of anime to choose from.\nFrom mystery thrillers to magical girl adventures, these are some of the best female-led anime series of all time. With that in mind, female leads aren't exclusive to magical girl or shoujo outings, either. Plenty of quality romance, isekai, and action-thriller series prominently feature women in leading roles.\nWhen a photographer is on the hunt for her next big story, she finds herself investigating the strange happenings at a local carnival and pulled into a conspiracy about a deadly virus. An old friend who happens to be a mercenary, the titular Canaan, comes to help her. Of course, Canaan is also out to get former teammate Alphard, the antagonist of her story.\nThis is the rare anime where the strong female protagonist, the damsel in distress, and the antagonist are all layered and complicated women who ally and come into conflict with one another repeatedly. The thrills and the twists don't stop.\nHigh school can be hard enough on students without them suddenly being transported to a whole new world where their status as an Earthling makes them a wanted fugitive, but that's exactly what happens to Youko Nakajima in this 2002 isekai anime, which predated some of the more ridiculous isekai that would release later.\nBased on a manga that began a decade earlier, aspects of the story are definitely dated, but watching Youko grow from a whiny teen into a full-blown strong female protagonist is worth it. The anime also features a great musical score.\nShonen anime is, by definition, a genre meant specifically to target young boys, so it's unusual to see one that features a strong female protagonist. That's what makes The Promised Neverland unique.\nHere, the protagonist is a young girl named Emma. She's very intelligent and optimistic, and it's only because of her that the other children at the group home have a chance to survive. The Grace Field House isn't what it seems and, while some of the audience will see the twist coming, it's only a contributing factor to this subversive anime series.\nMade in Abyss is a classic story of adventure at its core, driven by the curiosity of its main character Riko. Riko has spent her childhood looking up to her mother, an explorer who vanished into the mysterious Abyss soon after Riko was born. So when Riko receives a letter from her mother telling her to come to the bottom of the Abyss, Riko jumps at the chance.\nOn her journey, Riko encounters dangerous animals and some incredibly disturbing groups of people, but her passion for adventure keeps the series from devolving into depressing misery. While she may not seem like a typical strong female character, the strength she shows in the face of adversity makes her one of the strongest anime protagonists regardless of gender. It also made Made in Abyss one of the best anime of 2022.\nChihayafuru is one of the more niche anime on this list, focusing on the obscure Japanese card game of Karuta. However, it is hard not to get invested in the game when seeing how passionate the show's protagonist Chihaya is about it. Chihaya's passion also draws many of the show's other characters to the sport making her the anime's most important character.\nThe show also has a lot to love outside its central card game. Chihaya is at the center of one of the best love triangles in anime. Seeing her struggle to decide on her future career outside Karuta is also compelling and relatable. Chihaya is one of the most unique strong female protagonists on this list and she makes Chihayafuru compelling despite its niche subject.\nKill la Kill certainly isn't everyone's cup of tea. It’s weird—downright bizarre, even. However, it has been extremely influential for many series, including Chainsaw Man which put a twist on its central gimmick. The non-sensical plot, the over-the-top character design, the colorful backgrounds and explosions, and the unusual approach it takes to explore important themes are all dead giveaways that the audience is watching a Trigger anime.\nThe story of Kill la Kill is about Ryuko Matoi, a girl who sets out to find the one responsible for her father’s death and exert her revenge. She ends up at the Honnouji Academy, an elite school where clothes are a crucial element of its competitive hierarchy. In fact, Kill la Kill relies heavily on clothes to explore themes like fate, freedom, and sexuality—hence the weird costumes. But, it’s also immensely fun and hilarious with tons of stunning action and one of anime's best strong female protagonists.\nIf an anime fan is into works like Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, then the 2012 anime titled From the New World might be what they’re looking for. Set in a utopian future society where humans have developed psychic abilities, From the New World is a coming-of-age story told from the perspective of Saki Watanabe as she narrates the events from her childhood from the future.\nSaki’s world is an isolated society of psychic humans that's bound by complex rules and shrouded in mystery. From the very first episode, it’s abundantly clear that there’s much more to this supposed utopia than meets the eye. The audience follows Saki and her group of friends as they unearth the dark truths about the nature of their society—and the truth is surprising, completely plausible, and will leave fans with plenty to think about.\nOne of the main characters of the fantastical Fate franchise, the blonde-haired knight known as Saber is one of the Servants that the Masters can summon in the Holy Grail Wars. For the uninitiated, the Holy Grail Wars are basically secret battle royale-type tournaments between seven Master magicians who summon seven legendary heroes to fight on their behest as their Servants.\nSaber is the reincarnation of King Arthur, who was a woman in this universe. Aside from Saber, there are six other classes: Assassin, Archer, Rider, Berserker, Caster, and Lancer. Each Servant serves their Master, has unique abilities, and has their own interesting story. The series is gorgeously animated, has the epic action scenes the Fate franchise is known for, and explores some thought-provoking philosophies and themes while having a literal strong female protagonist.\nMost romance anime tend to focus on the pursuit of the relationship rather than giving us the chance to actually see that relationship develop. Luckily, that is not the case with one of the biggest surprises of 2018: Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku.\nWotakoi tells two love stories. There’s the story of two friends who have common otaku interests and decide to start dating, eventually falling in love with each other in a realistic fashion. And then there’s the already established, occasionally dysfunctional relationship of their two friends/co-workers. If anime fans are sick of standard, sappy rom-coms, Wotakoi will feel like a breath of fresh air. This cements its place alongside Kaguya Sama: Love is War as a modern Rom Com classic.\nNana tells the story of two 20-something girls named Nana. Though they share the same first name, they couldn’t be more different; where one is helpless and naïve, the other is proud and bold. One thing they share in common is that they are both strong female protagonists. One boards the train to Tokyo to chase after her boyfriend while the other boards the very same train in pursuit of her lifelong dream to become a professional singer.\nThey end up sharing an apartment, becoming close friends, and supporting each other through life. Nana’s story is that of friendship, romance, heartbreaks, challenges, and the difficulties of transitioning to adulthood. The way the story is told, however, is where this anime truly shines. Nana relies on realistic dialogue and thought processes, relatable characters that act like real people, and believable plot lines that resonate in order to explore themes relevant to young adults who are stumbling through adulthood.\nBased on the eponymous Sanrio character—yes, the same company that created Hello Kitty and Gudetama—Aggretsuko, short for aggressive Retsuko, is a hilarious anime about a 25-year-old anthropomorphic red panda named Retsuko who works in the accounting department of a Japanese trading firm. Frustrated with her superior and annoying co-workers, this sweet little creature has the habit of blowing off steam by going to a karaoke bar after hours and singing death metal at which point she transforms into a scary demon-like version of herself. This contrast is also what makes Aggretsuko's Christmas Special one of anime's best.\nAggretsuko is a brutally honest and biting satirical take on modern life to which most will relate in one way or another. Retsuko is stuck at a job that she hates with a chauvinist pig for a boss, and she wants nothing more than to simply be happy. However, life is complicated and unfair, and, sometimes, the only recourse is death metal.\nA Place Further than the Universe was one of the best anime to come out of 2018. The adventure comedy follows the fascinating journey of four girls traveling from Japan to Antarctica. Kimari, who always had lofty aspirations but no determination to pursue them, meets Shirase, a girl who's fiercely determined to go to Antarctica to search for her mother. Two more girls tag along and the four begin their unforgettable journey. The story of these four female protagonists is so incredibly earnest, inspiring, and heartwarming.\nA Place Further than the Universe is about having the courage to follow a dream. It's about conquering the paralyzing fear of living life. On their journey to a place further than the universe, the four girls support each other in facing their fears, all the while engaging in all kinds of shenanigans that will make the audience burst into laughter and tears.\nViolet Evergarden is without a doubt one of the most gorgeous anime of all time due to its stunning animation, but it’s far from being style without substance. Violet Evergarden is a crushing story about war, love, loss, and empathy. It follows the titular hero as she attempts to reintegrate into society after returning from the battlefield.\nViolet, who was abandoned as a child and grew up as a soldier, never understood emotions. When her superior officer dies in a decisive battle, Violet, failing to save him and losing both her arms in the process, decides to learn the meaning of his last words to her: “I love you.” To do this, she becomes a ghostwriter for people who can’t write but want to convey their emotions in a letter. Over the course of thirteen episodes, we see Violet grow and learn through her interactions with her clients.\nMajor Mokoto Kusanagi, the lead character of the expansive Ghost in the Shell franchise, is one of anime’s best-known strong female protagonists. Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex follows the Major and her team, who works for the Public Security Section 9, as they investigate highly sensitive criminal cases in a world where many people have become cyborgs.\nBut, these amazing advancements in technology also have drawbacks; the existence of cyberbrains led to a whole new class of dangerous crimes, as criminals can take control of people’s cyberbrains, alter memories, and manipulate their sensory input. With lots of action and thought-provoking ideas, Stand Alone Complex is a must-see series for any anime fan, especially if they’re looking for a strong female lead.\nDarling in the Franxx was a hit almost as soon as it came out, even getting a North American manga adaptation, and people weren't binge-watching it just to watch Hiro gain his confidence. Zero Two, a code name given to hybrid humans, was a captivating female protagonist and was enrapturing during every moment she had on screen.\nHer intensity and aggressive impulses are what make this anime so much fun to watch, and it's arguably up there with some of the greatest mecha anime of all time. The soundtrack also helps to boost this show's ratings along with other strong female characters like Ichigo, Miku, Kokoro, Ikuno, and, of course, their Franxx, which are every bit as important to the series as their operators.\nAlmost nothing needs to be said about the strong Magical Girl energy that's exuded during every episode of Sailor Moon. Not only does Usagi undergo an incredible transformation throughout both the manga and both anime series, but she also saves Tuxedo Mask consistently throughout. This is the series that pioneered the strong female anime protagonist, and it is still ongoing, with a new movie Sailor Moon: Cosmos being released soon.\nIn addition, the rest of the Sailor Senshi are some of the most epic sidekicks anyone could ask for, each offering their own unique personalities along with a skill they've honed from day one. Teamwork, feminism, and general butt-kicking are all part of the Sailor Moon series, and it's iconic in every category.\nAfter her mother's death, Tohru Honda finds herself alone and homeless. Eventually, however, she makes the acquaintance of Yuki Sohma and comes to live with her and the Sohma family. The Sohmas have a secret, however: when under stress, embaressed, or when hugged by a member of the opposite gender, they transform into a corresponding animal of the Chinese Zodiac.\nTohru vows to keep the Sohma family curse a secret and quests to find a cure for the strange ailment. A tale of romance, love, loss, and everything in between, it's a tentpole Shoujo anime series that almost any fan of anime will enjoy.\nWhen schoolgirl Lain Iwakura receives a mysterious email from a supposedly deceased classmate, she embarks on a strange journey that could change the way life, death, and reality itself are perceived. In Serial Experiments Lain, individuals are able to transcend their physical forms by uploading their consciousness into The Wired, a virtual world created as a consequence of man-made technology.\nIt's weird, cerebral, and almost tough to follow at points, but Serial Experiments Lain is one of the best single-season anime series of all time. Additionally, it's hard to imagine a character gaining more power than Lain does, making her literally one of anime's strongest female protagonists.\nAll it takes is one look at this anime to know that it's bound to be filled with a similar, Sailor Moon-like energy—but somehow even more so. Madoka Magica is far darker, though, bringing to the surface many complex questions that the anime is so well-known for. With each strong female character bringing a dynamic and drastically different personality to the mix, this is a tough anime not to fall in love with.\nWhile there might not be room for character flaws in other anime, these strong individuals go through a process of self-discovery that includes stumbling a little bit before learning how to fly.\nThere's no arguing that Clare is an incredible female protagonist in Claymore. This anime had a unique storyline from the start, sharing a lot of similarities with the excellent Witcher series. The anime's dark take on the Fantasy genre makes it still worth watching for its epic plot and characters.\nDespite the fact that it's the women kicking serious demon butt in this anime, it's men who are the ones in power, so to speak, making this even more of an interesting dynamic. Despite that, the power that one anime woman can display should never be underestimated, especially when it comes to proving oneself just as worthy of living in a one-sided world. The best anime with strong female characters all prove that beyond a doubt.\nIrina Curovic is a freelance writer in love with TV shows, movies, anime, books, and music, in no particular order. She’s somehow had the immense fortune to find a job that actually allows her to spend her days thinking, talking, and writing about the things she loves so much and it’s been an awesome experience.

{"title": "Superman's Maximum Possible Speed Makes the Flash Look Slow", "date": "2023-10-11 05:18:34", "text": "The Flash may be known as the Fastest Man alive, but as the Last Son of Krypton, Superman is more than a man - and his top speed proves it.\nWhile The Flash is frequently called the Fastest Man Alive, one incredible Superman feat seemingly throws that title back into contention. Between the Flash Family and Superman's fellow Kryptonians, the DC Comics universe features the swiftest characters in fiction. As such, readers have often argued which of the two fan-favorite members of the Justice League is truly faster than the other, with the comics themselves proving time and time again that the Man of Steel can’t keep up with the Scarlet Speedster.\nIn 2019's Justice League #25, the conclusion to “The Sixth Dimension” by Scott Snyder, Jorge Jimenez, and Alejandro Sanchez, finds Superman trapped in graver stakes than ever before. Stranded in a pocket galaxy specifically created to keep him contained, he manages to beat the odds and reach the far-away stars planted to keep him alive, but too far away to empower him. Superman flies through the yellow suns, gaining more power than ever before, and with it, more speed.\nThe Flash himself is no stranger to bending the laws of physics with each footfall, but in this case, his famous Speed Force leaves him at a disadvantage. As Clark soars through the myriad suns, the narration confirms that this is the fastest Clark has ever moved, an achievement impacting not just time and space, but “every dimension.”\nSuch an unimaginable speed might feel like a regular Tuesday for Flashes like Barry Allen or even Jay Garrick, but in this instance, their Speed Force would actually hamper the members of the Flash Family instead of helping them. After all, whenever a Flash has moved too fast, they’ve almost immediately found themselves trapped by the Speed Force, time and time again. The Flashes are capable of almost any velocity, but with that speed comes the ultimate risk of becoming one with the dimension that gives them their power.\nSuperman has no such connection to the Speed Force, and as such never risks being drawn into it like his fleet-footed allies. So while Wally West’s Flash may technically be considered to be the Fastest Man in the Multiverse – having even left Superman in his dust once or twice – he ultimately can only move so fast before he risks losing himself, unlike Clark. Clearly, Superman’s greatest feat of speed isn’t a skill that he pulls out at the drop of a hat, but it does reframe many of his races against his various Flash friends. After all, none of the Scarlet Speedsters can go all out against the Last Son of Krypton without risking a Speed Force sabbatical, while an empowered Superman can defy the laws of physics with ease.\nEither way, DC Comics’ Flash may be the Fastest Man Alive, Clark’s top speed proves that being the Fastest Superman Alive is in a whole different ballgame.\n"}
{"title": "10 Vampires Fans Want to See Buffy Summers Slay (Or Team Up With)", "date": "2023-10-11 05:48:23", "text": "Buffy may be a vampire slayer, but she's no stranger to vampire team-ups. Here are the best comic book vampires that deserve a Buffy crossover.\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer is perhaps the most iconic hunter of supernatural entities in the history of horror fiction, but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t also team up with said entities from time to time. For instance, Buffy’s best friend was a witch named Willow, a close ally was a werewolf named Oz, and a long-time Scooby Gang affiliate was Angel, who was a literal vampire. Plus, there’s Spike, who was a despicable vampiric villain - except when he wasn’t - who would align himself with Buffy and the Scooby Gang as well.\nBasically, Buffy Summers was no stranger to teaming up with the very creatures she was meant to be hunting. While this made for captivating storytelling, it also gives one pause to wonder: if Buffy can team up with in-world monsters (specifically vampires), who else would she team up with from other universes? And what other vampires from those universes would she be forced to kill instead? While that’s an impossible question to answer, it’s still a lot of fun to speculate. So, here are the Top 10 comic book vampires Buffy would either slay or team up with!\nWhile it’s true that Blade is technically a dhampir and not a full-blood vampire, the prospect of the two of them teaming up is too exciting not to include. Blade is a Marvel Comics antihero (with Blade debuting in The Tomb of Dracula #10 by Marv Wolfman and Gene Colan) who has had a number of comic book titles depicting his action-packed adventures - not to mention one of the most popular comic book movie franchises pre-MCU. Blade teams up with the likes of the Avengers, as well as more unsavory vigilantes like Ghost Rider and the Punisher. This means he’d absolutely accept the help of Buffy Summers if their paths crossed, just as she would assuredly love to fight vampires alongside another expert.\nTruthfully, there’s no real reason Buffy would slay these vampires. They rarely kill people, they have their own government that keeps them in-line with human laws, and their baseball skills are absolutely stellar. But, since every one of these entries is a fan service anyway, it seems like the vast majority of Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans would love to see their badass heroine just slaughtering these sparkly edgelords. And because of the Twilight graphic novel by Stephenie Meyer and Young Kim, Edward and the gang were free to be included on this list (much to their assured dismay).\nThis entry is sure to have Buffy saying, “It’s Morbin’ Time!” as there’s absolutely no reason she wouldn’t team up with Morbius if she found herself back in the Marvel Universe (after the previous hypothetical adventure she would have had with Blade earlier on this list, of course). Michael Morbius - who first appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #101 by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane - might have originated as a villain-of-the-week for Spidey, but eventually became a vigilante who would oftentimes work alongside both Spider-Man and Blade. If Morbius was on a mission trying to either stop villainous vampires or perhaps even cure his own horrific condition, Buffy would absolutely lend him her services.\nThe vampires in 30 Days of Night (by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith) are a totally different caliber than what Buffy is used to. Sure, the vamps in her universe can be bloodthirsty monsters, but they’re not as viciously ravenous and utterly gruesome as these vampires. In fact, some fans have attributed them more to rage-infected zombies than classic vampires due to how gory their feeding frenzies have been shown to be. If Buffy found herself in this universe, she would have a moral obligation to wipe these horrific creatures from the face of the Earth.\nRayne from the BloodRayne comic book series based on the popular video game franchise (published by Digital Webbing) is another dhampir like Blade who revels in killing wicked vampires. Given that Rayne is arguably just a more mature version of Buffy Summers herself (speaking in broad terms, of course), it only makes sense that the two of them would team up for the same reason Buffy would fight alongside Blade. The sheer awesomeness and utter badassery these two would generate during a vampire hunt would be a treat for fans the likes of which they’re likely not prepared to handle.\nThe vampires of Fright Night range from old school and classy creatures of the night, to new-age, punk rock vamps who relish in their sadistic kills. However, the common denominator between them is their complete soullessness when it comes to their victims, which means Buffy would have absolutely no reason not to slay them. This is especially true when considering the first Fright Night comic series (by Joe Genitle and Lenin Delsol) was an adaptation of the original ‘80s film, complete with the wicked antics of Jerry Dandrige and ‘Evil Ed’. Terrorizing neighborhood kids and even turning them into vampires? Not cool. And Buffy would certainly put a stop to it if she found herself in that world.\nNight Club by Mark Miller and Juanan Ramírez flipped the usual ‘vampire’ stigma by portraying a gang of vampiric youths who use the supernatural powers to fight street-level criminals who prey on the most vulnerable late at night when they think nobody's watching. These vampires are essentially vigilantes - complete with their own unique ‘superhero’ masks - who are actually making their city a safer place to live. If Buffy was transported to the Night Club universe, she would definitely join forces with these particular vampires.\nWhile there are certainly vampires in American Vampire (by Scott Snyder and Rafael Albuquerque with Stephen King) who Buffy would fight alongside, the overall world of this series would be better off if she put an end to their incredibly dangerous existence. For instance, the series focuses on a new American bloodline of vampires who are impervious to sunlight, are way stronger than the classic strain, and whose bloodlust is equally insatiable. Stronger vampires without the usual weaknesses? That would spell trouble, and would definitely warrant Buffy’s attention.\nArchie Horror’s Vampironica #1 by Meg and Greg Smallwood follows Veronica Lodge from the classic Archie Comics as a vampire. The same lovable rich girl from Riverdale, just with a new taste for blood. For the most part, Veronica is mostly shown navigating her new life as a vampire in relatively kid-friendly fashion, with some stories taking her to alternate realities where she has to battle werewolves and other manner of supernatural entities. The series is actually incredibly similar to that of Buffy the Vampire Slayer given the high school setting and the obvious prevalence of vampires and other monsters, so it’s a given that Buffy would team up with Veronica - they’d probably have a great time hanging out together, too!\nThis isn’t to say Buffy would kill Morty and Summer after they became vampires, she just wouldn’t team up with them given their almost immediate acceptance of their new, murderous lifestyles. In Rick and Morty: “Let the Rick One In” by Kyle Starks and Marc Ellerby (which is a direct sequel to the Rick and Morty season 2 episode “Big Trouble in Little Sanchez”), the horde of vampires Coach Feratu was a part of goes after the Smith family for revenge, and they manage to turn Morty and Summer. If Buffy was in this universe, she would have absolutely teamed up with Rick and the other Smiths, but in doing so, she would have slayed an entire horde of vampires while trying to save two in particular who didn’t necessarily want to be saved. While Rick had things handled pretty well, the vampires in this story would be in even more trouble if Buffy had been there too.\nWhile it seems unlikely fans will actually ever get to see these crossovers in any official capacity, it’s still incredibly fun to hypothesize based on what fans know about Buffy as well as the many universes inhabiting vampires she’d hypothetically travel to. And so, based on how she would likely react in each case, these are the Top 10 comic book vampires Buffy the Vampire Slayer would either slay or team up with.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.
