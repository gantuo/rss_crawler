{"title": "No, Star Wars Hasn't Just Retconned Return Of The Jedi's Jizz Music", "date": "2023-10-02 18:01:28", "text": "The Star Wars fandom is dividing again, this time over what seems to be a Disney retcon of Return of the Jedi - but all is not as it seems.\nStar Wars fans can relax, Return of the Jedi's beloved jizz music hasn't just been retconned. George Lucas' Star Wars galaxy has always been delightfully diverse. Both the first Star Wars movie and Return of the Jedi featured a stunning number of different alien species, notably in the Mos Eisley Cantina and Jabba's Palace. The latter even featured a swinging jazz soundtrack, although - of course - the in-universe name had to be switched up a little.\nThe Return of the Jedi junior novelization officially referred to \"jizz music,\" a term that - in the real world - dates back to the 19th century. It originally meant \"energy,\" but swiftly came to have a far more colorful meaning, one that has amused generations of Star Wars fans. Now, though, a short story in the anthology book From A Certain Point Of View: Return Of The Jedi has generated something of a surreal backlash, with many accusing Disney of a great jizz retcon.\nLucasfilm Publishing has been celebrating the anniversaries of the Star Wars original trilogy by releasing a range of superb anthologies, From A Certain Point of View, each of which contain short stories by various authors. These flesh out background and secondary characters in the movies, offering unique insights into their arcs and motivations. Sometimes the choices are amusing - nobody expected to explore the sarlacc's story in Return of the Jedi - but others are deeply impactful. Slipped in among these tales, however, one - \"Fancy Man\" by Phil Szostak - doesn't refer to jizz music. It refers to jatz music instead.\nRelated: Star Wars Original Trilogy Cast & Character Guide\nUnsurprisingly, the Star Wars fandom seems to be furious. Few seem prepared to let go of their beloved jizz music, and many are appalled at the idea of jatz standards. Ironically, though, this isn't a Disney retcon at all; their complaints are 30 years out of date.\nJatz music was first mentioned 30 years ago, in a WEG sourcebook. From that point on, the terms jizz and jatz have been used interchangeably in Star Wars, both in canon and Legends - and even on official Lucasfilm websites. Sourcebooks and even novels have mentioned both jizz and jatz music, with writers switching between the terms with barely a second thought (although perhaps with a snigger). From A Certain Point Of View: Return of the Jedi continues this trend, canonizing the fact the music has many different names:\n\"Jatz was, of course, one of the most popular forms of performed and recorded music in the entire galaxy, including Outer Rim worlds such as Orto. It came to be known by many names, some less palatable than others, over time and across cultures.\"\nFar from retconning jizz out of existence, the short story actually seems to be confirming the joke works in-universe as well. (This does, of course, make it rather amusing that \"jizz\" was first mentioned in a junior novelization.) All this means Star Wars fans can relax; no, Disney isn't taking their beloved jizz away from them.\nTom Bacon is Head of Screen Rant's Star Wars coverage.

{"title": "The House With A Clock In Its Walls Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-02 18:01:28", "text": "The House With A Clock In Its Walls starts out as a funny horror comedy, but its ending features a surprisingly poignant message about trauma.\nWhile The House With A Clock In Its Walls might be a fun supernatural horror comedy, the movie’s ending offers a surprisingly moving message about grief, loss, and growing up. Eli Roth’s filmography is uneven, to say the least. Roth made his debut with 2002’s grisly Cabin Fever, a backwoods chiller that mixed body horror with offbeat humor and a relentlessly bleak tone reminiscent of the genre’s nastiest ‘70s hits. Roth followed this with Hostel and Hostel II, both infamously gory horror movies, and the gruesome 2014 cannibal movie The Green Inferno. However, the end of The House With A Clock In Its Walls is surprisingly more uplifting and positive than the director's previous films.\nThe 2018 movie is an adaptation of the novel House With A Clock In Its Walls. Lewis' Magic 8-Ball breaks the clock, Lewis has to accept a difficult truth, and the reason behind the creation of the clock is revealed. Admittedly, 2018’s The House With A Clock In Its Walls is an adaption of a horror comedy novel, but the book that the movie is based on features as many fantasy elements as it does scenes of horror. In terms of tone, The House With A Clock In Its Walls is closer to 2015’s live-action anarchic, cartoony Goosebumps adaptation than darker children’s horror movies like Coraline or Nightbooks. Still, Roth earned solid reviews for The House With A Clock In Its Walls, perhaps thanks to the movie’s surprisingly mature handling of death and trauma in the end.\nRelated: 10 Best Horror Movies Of All Time, Ranked\nThe House With A Clock In Its Walls opens with its hero Lewis losing his parents in a car crash. Sent to live with the eccentric Jonathan and his neighbor Florence, Lewis soon learns that the pair are a warlock and a witch respectively. When the vengeful ghost of Jonathan’s dead friend Isaac tries to end the world with the eponymous demonic clock, Lewis is forced to leave behind his last physical connection to his parents so that he can save everyone. In the process, Lewis lets go of his attachment to their memory and moves on from his loss.\nLewis’ last link to his parents was a Magic 8-Ball that they gifted him. The toy tells Lewis to “Say Goodbye” as the clock enters its final sequence, and he reads this as a message to let go of his grief over losing his parents by throwing away the toy. This breaks the internal workings of the clock, stopping its doomsday countdown. For all of the many genre Easter eggs in The House With A Clock In Its Walls, this moment proves that the movie’s true horror is the tragedy of loss. Lewis wants desperately to maintain a connection to his dead parents and the villains take advantage of this.\nIsaac’s undead wife Selena took the form of Lewis’s late mother to convince him to summon Isaac and, once Isaac was back in a human body, he was able to use the demon Azazel’s dark magic to protect his doomsday clock. This dark magic summoned a giant snake that Florence was forced to fight down in the boiler room, while another one of Isaac and Selena’s traps turned Jonathan into a baby. This needed to happen in metaphorical terms, since Lewis had to be alone when he faced his grief, conquered his fear of loss, and found the strength to throw away his Magic 8-Ball.\nThe villainous Selena and Isaac created the clock to turn back time and destroy humanity after Isaac was driven to nihilism by WWII. While both Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween and The House With A Clock In Its Walls starred Black as eccentric horror comedy heroes with supernatural skills, Jonathan had a far darker past than Black’s Goosebumps franchise character. Both Jonathan and Isaac were scarred by what they saw during the war, with their trauma taking them on very different paths. Isaac’s trauma led him to become a villain as he consulted the demon Azazel about creating a clock that could turn back time and undo human history.\nMeanwhile, Jonathan becomes the strange, eccentric warlock that he is when Lewis meets him. As he did so, the demon Azazel convinced Isaac that destroying humanity would undo the horrors of WWII. Unlike Lewis and Jonathan, Isaac couldn’t let go of his trauma for long enough to see through this lie. Thus, Isaac created the clock alongside Selena, convinced that this would somehow make up for the horrors of the war. While Lewis could accept that something terrible happened to him in his past, Isaac was driven to evil by a desire to rewrite reality and Selena joined him down this dark, doomed path.\nAfter Lewis saved the day, it might seem a little strange that he pettily used magic to hit his classmate Tarby with a basketball and humiliate him. However, this PG-rated horror movie has a good justification for this goofy scene. The duplicitous Tarby had briefly befriended Lewis earlier in the movie, only to turn on him as soon as Tarby won the title of class president. Magic allowed Lewis to stand up for himself, get revenge on his fair-weather friend, and gain a new love interest in the process as he impressed one of his classmates with his magic-assisted layup.\nIn The House With A Clock In Its Walls’ ending, Lewis and Isaac become mirror images of each other. Both the clock itself and the Magic 8-Ball are artifacts that tie the two characters to their past and, while the clock’s destruction kills Isaac for good, the toy’s destruction frees Lewis from his grief and allows him to enter adolescence unburdened by tragedy. While Disney’s Goosebumps reboot offers a PG horror story where kids and adults must face their fears together, The House With A Clock In Its Walls is scary precisely because Lewis can’t rely on his elders for advice.\nIn the final scenes of The House With A Clock In Its Walls, Lewis realizes that his parents aren’t coming back and that, even among magicians, anyone who promises him otherwise is taking advantage of him. His loss is tragic, but he can also let go of his past and move on. This is something that Isaac’s trauma never allows him to do. Thus, Isaac dies for good while the hero of The House With A Clock In Its Walls can venture into adolescence confidently.\n"}

The first movie in Roar Uthaug’s Troll franchise released in December 2022 on Netflix, quickly becoming the platforms move viewed non-English film of all time (via Variety). While the ending of Troll left the door open for a sequel there was little word on Troll 2 for almost a year - until Netflix finally confirmed the sequel was going ahead.\nTroll 2 will follow on from the first movie, which follows a group of paleontologists who come face-to-face with an ancient troll in Norway’s Dovre mountains. At the end of Troll it was revealed that the beast finally felled by Nora (Ine Marie Willmann) and Kris (Mads Sjøgård Pettersen) was just the first of many. With Tomb Raider and The Wave director Roar Uthaug once more at the helm, there’s plenty to digest when it comes to the possibilities of what awaits in Troll 2.\nAfter almost 10 months with little news Netflix finally gave an update on Troll 2 in September 2023. The streamer confirmed that Roar Uthaug’s Norwegian monster movie Troll was officially getting a sequel, and that filming would begin in 2024. While there was little else revealed beyond this, the fact that director Roar Uthaug is returning alongside the creative team behind Troll has already generated a great deal of excitement for the upcoming sequel.\nTroll 2 is officially happening, with the Netflix greenlight of the sequel to Roar Uthaug’s Norwegian monster movie announced in September 2023 (via Variety). It was confirmed on announcement that director Roar Uthaug would be returning for the sequel alongside writer Espen Aukan. Producers Espen Horn and Kristian Strang Sinkerud will also be returning to work with Uthaug on the sequel to Troll.\nThere is no confirmed release date yet for Troll 2. The Netflix sequel is due to start filming in 2024, so it’s unlikely it will arrive before 2025.\nThere are no confirmed cast members yet for Troll 2, and the only names attached to the project are director Roar Uthaug alongside his creative team of writer Espen Aukan and producers Espen Horn and Kristian Strang. It’s possible that Ine Marie Willmann and Mads Sjøgård Pettersen will reprise their respective roles of Nora and Kris, but nothing’s been announced yet. If the story focuses on entirely new characters it’s possible that none of names from the original return for the cast of the Troll sequel.\nThere hasn’t been much confirmed about the Troll 2 story. However, a few plot details have been teased along with the confirmation announcement. It’s known that the sequel to Troll will focus on another Norwegian folklore figure, though it’s not been revealed if this will also be a troll or something else entirely. \nThe ending of Troll set up a lot of possibilities for the Troll 2 plot. It’s clear there are more monsters inside the Dovre mountains, so the titular troll in the first movie is likely only the first to awaken. That being said, Troll 2 could focus on a different part of Norway entirely, as the entire country has a rich history of local folklore.\nShould any of the characters from the first movie return for Troll 2 this could also impact the plot. Kris and Nora discovered that trolls can be harmed by UV light, and managed to fashion a working trap. The dynamic could be quite different in Troll 2 if the story focuses on them again now that they’ve successfully taken down one of the mythical beasts. Whatever happens it seems likely that Troll 2 will be another unique monster movie for Netflix.\n"}
{"title": "10 Most Over-The-Top Brutal Fatalities In MK1", "date": "2023-10-02 18:01:28", "text": "Mortal Kombat 1 has some of the best Fatalities of any game in the franchise; however, some of its Fatalities are far more brutal than others.\nAlthough Mortal Kombat 1 innovated greatly from its predecessors, it did not change one fundamental part of the game — the Fatalities. Since bursting into arcades in the 1990s, Mortal Kombat has been known for blood and guts — no part of the game quite so graphically encapsulates this as the loved and loathed Fatalities. Ever controversial, Fatalities are such a significant part of the series that they are often taken as a measure of quality for each Mortal Kombat installment. Although some games, such as Mortal Kombat 4, have abysmal Fatalities, others like Mortal Kombat 11 have exceptional ones. Mortal Kombat 1, although not perfect, undeniably has great Fatalities.\nRelated: \"Oh, I Remember This\" - Mortal Kombat 1 Review\nWith a reputation as bloody as Mortal Kombat, each new installment has a great deal of gore to dish out. Mortal Kombat 1, the latest iteration of the tried and true fighting game, does not disappoint in this department. Although the game is more than mindless violence and death, these are undoubtedly the franchise's cornerstones. With an expansive roster of MK1 combatants, most with two Fatalities of their own, there is an abundance of choice available to the player in Mortal Kombat 1; although each Fatality is unquestionably brutal, some are so graphic that the others appear tame by comparison.\nRelated:Mortal Kombat 1: How to Unlock Every Fatality (& Button Inputs)\nAbsent from the previous game, long-time fans of the franchise welcomed the announcement that Reptile would be rejoining the roster in Mortal Kombat 1. A pillar of the franchise since his debut as a hidden opponent in the original Mortal Kombat, Reptile is a reptilian humanoid of the Saurian species. Known for his acidic finishers, Reptile has had some of the strongest Fatalities in previous installments — and Mortal Kombat 1 is no different.\nAlthough both of his Fatalities are brutal, his first, Indigestion, would be a particularly unpleasant experience. Indigestion sees Reptile swallow his opponent whole before vomiting their acid-ridden remains onto the field of battle before finally crushing them.\nA surprise return to the roster, the long-absent Reiko has not featured in a mainline Mortal Kombat game since 2006's Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. Despite this, Reiko has returned with some of the most fearsome Fatalities of any combatant in Mortal Kombat 1. Particularly brutal is his For the General Fatality, in which he viciously contorts his enemy's body, using their own bones against them, before ultimately ripping out their spine and raising it aloft as a trophy.\nThe purple color-swapped ninja and Prince of Edenia, Rain, most recently featured in Mortal Kombat 11's second round of DLC. The ever-popular ninja's combat revolves around the manipulation of water, and his most brutal fatality in Mortal Kombat 1 is no exception. Rain's Fatality 2 involves the water-bending rain summoning a rope of water which, in a manner reminiscent of an anaconda, constricts around his bested foe before devastatingly crushing their body and decapitating them.\nKung Lao's Mortal Kombat 1 Fatality, Lao’d and Clear, reimagines many of Kung Lao's classic Fatalities. Although it recycles a lot from previous games, this Fatality is, nevertheless, incredibly graphic. Utilizing his trademark razor-rimmed hat, Kung Lao destroys the appendages of his opponent, before decapitating them, and finally splitting them in two. It is truly a brutal Fatality, certainly not for the faint of heart.\nIn Mortal Kombat 1's timeline, Sindel is the leader of Outworld — it is clear from her Fatality, Hair Comes Trouble, that she rules the realm through fear. Like her Fatalities in previous installments, Sindel's main weapon is her incredibly long and powerful hair — a weapon put to good use in Hair Comes Trouble. In which, she tears off her opponent's limbs, lifts them by their shoulder wounds, and asks \"Who's your queen?\" before ripping out their spine and skull through their throat. It is not only brutal but undoubtedly Sindel's best Fatality in franchise history.\nEye-Palling Victory was first hinted at during the early reveals of Mortal Kombat 1 — much to the excitement of many. This fatality is brutal and brilliant, perhaps one of Scorpion's best in the franchise's history. It revolves around his famed chained spears, which he throws through his enemy's abdomen before having them return via the back of their head and through their eyes. Although this is brutal enough, Scorpion then yells, \"Come here!\" as he pulls the chains, causing his opponent's head to be severed and pulled through his adversary's back. Truly one of the most brutal Fatalities in the game.\nIn the new Mortal Kombat timeline, Johnny Cage returns to his narcissistic Hollywood actor gimmick, abandoning the past decade of his presentation as a retired actor and embattled military man. His Fatality Hollywood Walk of Pain is, therefore, a thematically appropriate choice; however, unlike the choreographed violence in movies, this Fatality is graphic and brutal. The Fatality begins with Cage embracing his defeated opponent, which is quickly followed by him smashing them face-first into a Hollywood Walk of Fame-style ground plate before ripping them back and taking a selfie with the faceless corpse.\nAlthough General Shao is no longer Khan, in the new timeline, is no less deadly, and his Fatality, Spin Cycle, is evidence of this. Spin Cycle sees General Shao launch his opponent into the air with his axe and grab them midair before finally rotating them around at such an extreme velocity that the air friction causes his adversary's skin to peel away. This, beyond brutal, is a wonderful step away from Shao's typical axe, hammer, or spear Fatalities, which, although cool, are a little predictable.\nThe Tarkatan warrior, Baraka, is undeniably a great combatant; however, he has often been overlooked, especially in recent Mortal Kombat installments. Despite this, his second Fatality in Mortal Kombat 1 is one of the most vicious in the game, if not in the over 30-year history of the franchise. It sees Baraka disembowel his opponent, knee them into the air, before creating a fire and using his foe's entrails as a rope to facilitate their cooking. The Fatality ends with a group of Tarkatans ripping off the roasted limbs of the still-somehow-living combatant.\nIn the franchise's latest iteration, the Chosen One, Liu Kang has been promoted to the status of a god. Although some gods are merciful, the God of Fire variant of Liu Kang is rather unforgiving. His brutality is best displayed in his second Fatality, in which he grabs his opponent by the neck, transports them through a portal to the far reaches of space, summons a black hole, and has their body painfully slowly sucked inside — in a manner disturbingly reminiscent of the Ark Covenant scene from Indian Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. Liu Kang's second Fatality is undoubtedly the most brutal in Mortal Kombat 1.\nSource: CJR Gaming/YouTube\nBased in the United Kingdom, Luke Horwitz is a graduate student in English Literature and Arts at the University of Oxford, having earned a BA in Music from the University of York."}
{"title": "What Was the First Anime?", "date": "2023-10-02 18:01:28", "text": "While it may seem like a straightforward question, the identity of the first anime is a matter of debate, although there is one clear candidate.\nAnime has a long and storied history, naturally leading many fans to wonder what the first anime was. In recent years Anime has become a pop culture juggernaut garnering worldwide fans and critical success. However, its origins are much more humble and controversial with many of the original cartoons being lost to time or under dispute. This makes the question of what the first anime even was quite fascinating to explore. Before discussing what the first anime was, the actual definition of the word \"anime\" needs to be addressed.\nAnime is the Japanese word for animation, so in Japan, this question would just boil down to what would be considered the first cartoon. However, in the West, anime has come to categorize the cartoons made in Japan. Of course, this definition itself isn't perfect as many people feel it doesn't include certain shows they view as anime. The anime-esque Avatar: The Last Airbender is a perfect example as the show is heavily inspired by Japanese cartoons in both look and story, but was made by an American team with Korean animators.\nRelated: An Incalculable Loss - Thousands of Classic Anime Are Close to Being Lost Forever\nThese sorts of edge cases didn't exist in the early 1900s however, which is when animation was in its infancy. At this time, foreign cartoons were only just being introduced in Japan, which inspired a variety of Japanese artists to try their hands at it as well. Many of the cartoons produced were short clips that didn't tell a story. Given the material on which these were created many of these clips are lost to time, and the few examples that do survive are hotly debated by scholars. The first true widely regarded Japanese cartoon with an actual story is known as The Dull Sword, which was created by Jun’ichi Kouchi and follows a goofy swordsman as he tests out his weapon.\nThe Dull Sword is very different from what modern anime fans may expect. It lacks many of the stylistic features that distinguish anime in the present day, and it is entirely silent. It also isn't very entertaining or satisfying on a narrative level. That isn’t to say it isn’t worth watching for fans of the medium who want to see what Japanese animation looked like over a century ago. It still stands as a fascinating glimpse into Japanese culture at that time and is somewhat humorous at points. However, unlike some old shows that still stand the test of time like Astro Boy or The Legend of the Galactic Heroes, The Dull Sword does not hold up on its own as a good watch.\nOf course, as with all discussions of this nature, there are other examples of early Japanese animation that some may call the first anime instead of The Dull Sword. The three-second-long Activity Photo is one such example despite its unorthodox animation technique. The debate over what is truly the first anime will likely never be settled, but The Dull Sword is about as best a candidate for that title as one can find.\nBen Sockol has been writing articles for the comics section of Screen Rant since early 2022.

{"title": "Us Soundtrack Guide: Every Song & When It Plays", "date": "2023-10-02 18:01:29", "text": "Us movie soundtrack is filled with music such as Luniz's I Got Five On It and Beach Boys' Good Vibrations. Here's every song in Jordan Peele's film.\nEvery song on the Us soundtrack perfectly complements writer and director Jordan Peele's vision. In part, that's because Us sees Peele reuniting with Get Out composer Michael Abels, though the soundtrack also features an array of pitch-perfect songs from well-known artists. In addition to Abels' terrifying score, the songs on the Us soundtrack range from contemporary Janelle Monáe-written tunes to Luniz's '90s hip-hop classic \"I Got 5 on It,\" which is notably intertwined with Abels' masterful score.\nWhile Jordan Peele's Us is full of haunting quotes, it's also rife with haunting tracks. For example, Abels' slowed-down version of the '90s Luniz hit helps craft the psychological horror film's eerie atmosphere. Meanwhile, other songs on the Us soundtrack help underscore the film's themes — or add in some much-needed humor. That said, Us is packed with great songs that fill the moments in between pieces from Abels' score. Here's every song in Us, in order of when each plays during the film:\n“I Like That” by Janelle Monáe - Starting at the 11 minute and 23 seconds mark, viewers can hear Monáe's Dirty Computer hit as the film fades from shots of rabbits in cages to the Wilsons driving through a woods-lined road to their NorCal cabin.\n\"I Got 5 On It\" by Luniz - At 21 minutes and 23 seconds, the film's most notable song plays while the Wilsons drive to — and arrive at — Us' significant Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk location. While Gabe (Winston Duke) and Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) sing along, Addie helps Jason (Evan Alex) get into the groove.\n“Good Vibrations” by The Beach Boys - The next recognizable needle drop comes at one hour, five minutes, and thirty-two seconds into the film as Josh (Tim Heidecker) and Kitty Tyler (Elisabeth Moss), the Wilsons' (sort of) friends, argue when Kitty thinks she hears an intruder. Instead of taking her seriously, Josh tells their smart home to play this Beach Boys tune.\nRELATED: What Jordan Peele's Next Movie Is (After Nope)\n\"F*ck tha Police\" by N.W.A. - After her family is brutally murdered by their Tethered counterparts in Us, a bloody Kitty crawls on the floor and tries to get some help from their smart home device, Ophelia. When Kitty tells the virtual assistant to \"call the police,\" Ophelia misunderstands and plays N.W.A.'s \"F*ck tha Police\" as Kitty's double delivers a killing blow. This all unfolds at the 1 hour, 7 minutes, and 43 seconds mark.\n\"I Got 5 On It\" (Tethered Mix from Us) by Luniz - At the 1 hour, 15 minutes, and 42 seconds mark, a reprise of Luniz's \"I Got 5 On It\" plays after the Wilsons successfully kill off the Tyler family's murderous doubles. This version, which remixes the track with themes from Abels' score, was initially used in promotional material. However, when it became a viral sensation, the remix was edited into the film.\n“The Nutcracker Suite: XI. Pas de Deux” by Tchaikovsky - Some of this classical piece plays during a flashback to Addy's ballet days at the 1 hour, 39 minutes, and 55 seconds mark.\n\"Les Fleur\" by Minnie Riperton - In the twist ending of Us, \"Les Fleur\" plays at the 1 hour, 50 minutes, and 42 seconds mark as the camera pans away from the Wilsons' escape ambulance to show miles of Tethered holding hands across America.\nReleased in 2019 by Back Lot Music, the official Us soundtrack features Michael Abels' original score as well as three songs that are heard in Jordan Peele's film. The trio of non-score tracks are \"I Like That\" by Janelle Monáe, \"Les Fleurs\" by Minnie Riperton, and, of course, \"I Got 5 on It\" by Luniz.

{"title": "5 Star Trek Furry Things That Are More Dangerous Than You Think", "date": "2023-10-02 18:11:27", "text": "Star Trek's tribbles are notoriously dangerous, but other furry things like Lower Decks' moopsy pose a greater threat to Starfleet officers.\nOver the decades, furry creatures on Star Trek  have turned out to be more dangerous than one might suspect based on their appearance alone. Some dangerous animals were the beloved pets of famed Starfleet officers such as Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) or Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn). Other dangerous species could not be domesticated, but could instead be found in sanctuaries devoted to their continued care and preservation, whether established for educational purposes or run for profit by Ferengi entrepreneurs.\nWhen these creatures were similar to Earth animals, humans in particular had a way of underestimating certain furry animals native to other planets, usually Class M designated worlds, believing their inherent natures to be close to what they found familiar, only to be surprised when the creatures' actions didn't match their expectations. The contrast between initial impressions and actual actions served as proof that even fauna deserved the same respect and understanding as more intelligent species, a theme that began with Star Trek: The Original Series and continued through Star Trek: Lower Decks.\nTribbles' soft fur and calming coos made them appear completely innocent at first blush, but their high reproductive rate made them ecological nightmares. One tribble became thousands in days, since they were \"born pregnant,\" as noted by Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) during the famed tribble infestation of the USS Enterprise in Star Trek: The Original Series, at which time McCoy determined that their rapid reproduction was only possible after they'd fed. It seemed only Klingons knew of the natural danger tribbles caused, and animosity between the species was mutual, perhaps predicated on the tribbles' side by a genetic memory of the devastation wrought by Klingon extermination.\nTribbles weren't always such devastating creatures, due to the role genetic modification played in their development. In Star Trek: Short Treks \"The Trouble With Edward\", Lt. Edward Larkin (H. Jon Benjamin) believed their biological composition of fur and meat made them an ideal food source, but for their slow rate of reproduction. His 2250s experiments to increase their reproductive rate were overwhelmingly successful, but resulted in his own death and these augment tribbles becoming the dominant version of the species. Further experimentation created the toothy \"attack tribble,\" fortunately contained to Daystrom Station as of 2401 in Star Trek: Picard season 3.\nMugato, also known as Mugatu, Mugutu, or even Gumato, were native to the planet Neural, where they coexisted with the planet's humanoid population, who knew that mugato were more dangerous than they looked. Mugato were ape-like creatures covered in white fur, with distinctive horns atop their heads and spikes trailing down their spines. They looked similar to Earth's gorillas, but the mugato diet was far more carnivorous, as indicated by their sharp teeth, clawed prehensile hands and feet, and venomous bite. Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) learned firsthand just how bad the bite could be when he visited Neural, and had to rely on primitive medicine for treatment.\nBy the 2380s of Star Trek: Lower Decks, mugato were deemed an endangered species. They were discovered in the wilds of Frylon IV, where they were the targets of both Denobulan scientists and Ferengi poachers. The mugato displayed their ferocity quite easily to the researchers, who sadly perished. The Ferengi traders, however, found ways of subduing them, so they could sell their valuable horns, and only ceased their poaching only after Ensigns Brad Boimler (Jack Quaid) and Samanthan Rutherford (Eugene Cordero) convinced them a mugato-themed tourist destination would be more profitable.\nSome of Star Trek's most famous Vulcans such as Subcommander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock), Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy), and Lt. Tuvok (Tim Russ) all kept sehlats as pets, which implied that these furry creatures were gentle by nature, but sehlats were more dangerous than they seemed. These large, powerful animals were similar in size to Earth's wild cats, with bear-like features and prominent six-inch teeth that marked them as the descendants of predators. Sehlats' aggressive tempers could be calmed through consistent regular feeding, not unlike Vulcans' adherence to strict control of their own emotions through ritual and meditation.\nIndeed, the practice of keeping sehlats as pets was an apt metaphor for Vulcan children learning to maintain control over something as inherently wild as their own inner natures. The bond between them was a mutually beneficial attachment, with the sehlat being fed, and the child attaining the trust and protection of an otherwise wild animal. Sehlats could be long-lived, and remain within families, like when Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard) passed his sehlat, I-Chaya, to his son Spock. While not sapient, I-Chaya was Spock's valued friend who nonetheless taught him an important life lesson, seen in Star Trek: The Animated Series season 1, episode 2 \"Yesteryear\".\nThe widespread appearance of Klingon targs in everything from cuisine to children's stories made them seem more harmless than they actually were. They resembled wild boars of Earth, appearing about the same shape and size but for the thick, wiry fur and sharp spines along their backs. As domesticated animals, targs were kept as both pets and livestock, sometimes with little distinction between the two cultural roles. Even domesticated targs were relatively formidable, possessing the same warlike spirit as their Klingon keepers, and capable of wanton destruction despite -- or perhaps because of -- their ultimate destination often being a Klingon's dinner.\nAccording to Star Trek: Deep Space Nine's General Martok (J.G. Hertzler), his own pet targ was as much of a warrior as he was, and yearned to return to the glorious freedom of the wilderness, and it was these wild targs that were even more dangerous than their domesticated brethren. As herd animals, they could easily overwhelm an opponent just by acting on instinct, and their natural weapons of spikes, hooves, and tusks gave them ample opportunities to attack. They were certainly far more dangerous than the watered-down reputation that preceded them thanks to creations like Toby the Targ holonovels and simple plush toys made in their image.\nMoopsy was introduced on Star Trek: Lower Decks as the cutest and most dangerous alien yet. It was a small round creature with a pure white pelt, short legs, and dark, round eyes. Its high-pitched call gave it its name, further adding to its deceptive cuteness. Relatively little was known about Moopsy, including whether it was the only member of its species or whether more Moopsies existed beyond the walls of Narj's Magical Menagerarium. One, of course, was all that was needed to verify Moopsy's true and seemingly paradoxical nature: that of a voracious predator, capable of liquifying the bones of its prey before drinking them. Moopsy was nonetheless beloved by many.\nA free Moopsy posed a genuine threat to those in its path inStar Trek: Lower Decks' menagerie. Moopsies did not form bonds like many other creatures that could be kept as pets. They fed on the liquid bones of any creatures at all, including those that seemed stronger and more powerful than themselves. While slow-moving due to its stature and small appendages, Moopsies could launch themselves at victims with terrifying leaps and drain them of their bones in a matter of moments. Their presence wasn't always a forsworn death sentence, however; Moopsy was guided by its own ravenous appetite, and it could be distracted by stray bones or teeth to lead it back into containment.\nMoopsy was a particularly cute creature new to Star Trek with its appearance in Star Trek: Lower Decks, with the contrast between its innocuous outward appearance and its true dangerous nature contributing to the story's comedy. Other furry creatures provided their own lessons in understanding that life was more complex than it appeared. Star Trek has always encouraged people to look beyond initial impressions, after all, and one only needed to encounter a dangerous specimen once to discover that lesson certainly applied to fauna just as much as it did to the intelligent species of the galaxy.\nJen Watson is a writer and artist based in the Chicago suburbs with a lifelong passion for good stories and a BFA from the Ringling College of Art and Design.

{"title": "The Nun 2 Gets Digital Release Date Less Than One Month After Theatrical Debut", "date": "2023-10-02 18:16:24", "text": "The Nun II lands its digital release date after less than a single month from the opening of its astoundingly successful theatrical run.\nThe Nun II’s digital release date has been revealed. The Nun II was released on September 8, giving it just under a month in theaters. A follow up to 2018’s religious horror film The Nun, The Nun II continues the story of Sister Irene and her battle with the demon, Valak. The Nun II’s cast includes Taissa Farmiga, Storm Reid, and Bonnie Aarons, and is directed by The Curse of La Llorona director Michael Chaves.\nAfter less than one month in theaters, The Nun II has landed its digital release date. First reported by When To Stream, The Nun II will be available for purchase on Amazon and YouTube starting on October 3. Marking just 25 days after The Nun II’s theatrical debut, this release window comes in as one of the shortest windows for Warner Bros. this year. \nThe Nun II’s digital release coming so early on in its run is surprising based on how the film has done in theaters. To date, The Nun II has made over $76 million at the domestic box office and grossed $231 worldwide when considering the international ticket sales. These box office totals are pretty impressive considering The Nun II’s estimated $38.5 million budget. The Nun II even held strong at the top of the domestic box office for three straight weekends, beating out higher-budget films such as A Haunting in Venice. \nThough one of the shortest windows, The Nun II’s quick VOD release is also not unheard of for its studio, Warner Bros. Though less commercially successful than The Nun II, Warner Bros. films The Flash and Blue Beetle became available to rent digitally after only 32 days in theaters. The Meg 2: The Trench saw a gap of even less than 25 days, with digital rental available just 21 days after its theatrical release. \nWith The Nun II’s box office numbers looking comparatively better, Warner Bros. choice to truncate The Nun II’s theatrical exclusivity may seem surprising. Either way, The Nun II’s box office numbers do bode well for its prospects on streaming. As Halloween approaches and more horror films inundate theaters, The Nun II will have a chance to catch those looking for their fall spooks at home. The Nun II’s digital availability will also be good for those looking to binge-watch all the films within The Conjuring universe this fall. \nSource: When To Stream\n"}
{"title": "John Wick's Next Spinoff Won't Make The Same Mistake With Keanu Reeves", "date": "2023-10-02 18:20:27", "text": "John Wick seemingly dies in John Wick: Chapter 4, but Keanu Reeves' return in the next John Wick spinoff movie avoids making a similar mistake.\nThe John Wick franchise's upcoming spin-off Ballerina is a strong indicator that John Wick himself is not dead. After four movies of battling endless waves of assassins and High Table enforcers, John seemingly met his end in John Wick: Chapter 4 after his High Table duel with his old friend Caine (Donnie Yen). However, with John already confirmed to appear in Ballerina, he still has at least one more big-screen appearance ahead of him.\nBallerina will take place before John's apparent demise, with the film set between John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum and John Wick: Chapter 4. Meanwhile, the tremendous success of John Wick: Chapter 4 has led to John Wick: Chapter 5 reportedly entering early development. While this might seem primarily motivated by the financial success and critical acclaim of the main John Wick franchise, it is really Ballerina that demonstrates how central the Baba Yaga is to the franchise.\nRELATED: 8 Big Clues John Wick Is Still Alive After Chapter 4's Shock Ending\nThe John Wick franchise is a cinematic universe that has finally begun expanding into spinoffs not focused primarily on John Wick. Peacock's The Continental spinoff series takes place in the early 1970s, which precludes John from appearing, but Ballerina bringing him into its story shows how much the franchise relies on him. What makes that even more true is the fact that Ballerina is the first big-screen chapter of the John Wick universe not centered on him.\nTo be sure, having John in a supporting role in Ballerina is a wise strategy. Ana de Armas' Rooney will be the first protagonist in the John Wick universe headlining her own movie, so having the support of the legendary Baba Yaga is a smart business move. Still, the question of whether the John Wick franchise can thrive without him around has not been truly put to the test yet. Ballerina's strategy of gradually phasing new protagonists into the franchise's spotlight with John still on hand might help it commercially, but still establishes the expectation that John Wick can jump back into action at any time.\nDespite John being laid to rest next to his wife Helen in John Wick: Chapter 4's ending, one fan theory has suggested that John faked his death with the help of Caine and Winston (Ian McShane) to finally escape the High Table. With Ballerina taking place before John Wick: Chapter 4, it could establish Rooney as a potential player in that theoretical cover-up. Indeed, by having John seemingly go out of his way from his own war with the Elder and the High Table to help Rooney on her mission, it has a built-in story mechanism for Rooney to owe John a favor via an assassin marker.\nIn turn, John might cash in that favor from Rooney by asking her to help him fake his death. Ballerina might reveal such a transaction between John and Rooney outright, or it could simply hint to it to save the actual reveal for John Wick: Chapter 5. Still, while the John Wick universe might be stretching its legs with The Continental, Ballerina, and a spin-off for Donnie Yen's Caine teased at the end of John Wick: Chapter 4, his return in Ballerina shows that it is still very much the John Wick franchise - and that the world has likely not seen the last of the Baba Yaga.\nBrad Curran is a Features Writer and Interviewer for Screen Rant.

Glenn is now embracing grandparenthood.\nIn My Big Fat Fabulous Life, season 11, episode 4, Glenn Thore took the plunge and crossed skydiving off his bucket list with his daughter Whitney Thore. However, the surprises continued when Glenn was in for an emotional treat when he received a thoughtful gift from his great-granddaughter, Madeline (Maddie), embracing a new role as great-grandfather. Maddie is the daughter of William, the son of Glenn's long-lost daughter, Angela Burdett (Angie Vincent), and the sibling of Jaime Daughdrill and Cody. Inquiring minds might wonder if this new bundle could be the glue that bonds the Thore family tree and how Glenn will embrace grandparenthood.\nDuring a confessional moment on My Big Fat Fabulous Life season 11, Glenn shades Whitney's age and remarks that Hunter has no romantic prospects on the horizon. Glenn also humorously mentioned that he and his late wife, Barbara \"Babs\" Thore, once made a pact to forgo the experience of becoming grandparents. Hunter lightened the atmosphere by suggesting everyone benefits from this arrangement, with Glenn gaining the joy of grandkids. Although Whitney and Hunter might be off the hook for grandkids, Glenn's granddaughter Jaime is also in the picture, recently engaged to her fiancé, Heath Horton, ushering in a new generation for the Thore family.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nIn a considerate gesture that tugged at heartstrings, Angie sent Glenn a specially crafted pillow bearing a heartfelt message: \"Grand Daddy, I hugged this little pillow, I squeezed it tight, I filled it with my wishes, hope, love, and light.\" The message continued, advising Glenn to grasp the pillow tightly whenever he felt down, assuring him that Maddie's love would radiate from it throughout the day and night. This present from Whitney's secret half-sister appears to be a poignant peace offering, extending an olive branch in the form of affection and comfort to heal past wounds and mend their fractured relationship.\nWhitney underwent IVF and froze her eggs merely two years ago. However, she appears to have shifted her perspective, suggesting that motherhood might not be in her future. In the latest episode of My Big Fat Fabulous Life, Glenn divulged he and Babs had long abandoned their aspirations of having grandchildren. Instead, Whitney seems to have discovered contentment in her role as an aunt. She finds consolation amidst Glenn's extended family, marking a noteworthy difference from her previous fertility pursuits. After disclosing to E!

This past August, Jaime took to Facebook to express her excitement about becoming the wife of her long-time boyfriend, Heath. This new chapter in Jaime's life likely brings a sense of fulfillment and pleasure to Grandpa Glenn, now embracing this role to an adult Jaime and a great-grandfather to little Maddie. It's a testament to the enduring bonds within the Thore family as they navigate life's twists and turns, and Glenn undoubtedly welcomes his next chapter and new generation with open arms and a proud heart.\nMy Big Fat Fabulous Life airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.\nSources: E!

Kimberly, a 30-year-old from Muscle Shoals, Alabama, is a clairvoyant who dreamed of her future husband thanks to her spirit guides. Months later, Kimberly received a message from an Indian man who wanted her to be his girlfriend. It was TJ who had manifested Kimberly into his life by meditating on her profile picture. Kimberly and TJ's strange relationship on The Other Way season 5 was a successful one until she moved to India. She had previously lived in Jaipur for a year on a student visa.\nBut now Kimberly is going to get married to TJ and settle down in India for good. However, Kimberly's latest Instagram post reveals she's not in India anymore.\nKimberly posted a video captioned, \"Is it bad how much I want to make a 7 year old jealous of my hat?\" Kimberly wore a propeller hat in the clip and was heading out to pick up her niece from school. Kimberly filmed herself driving with her dog accompanying her in the car. She asked her niece if she liked her hat and, in the end, even gave it to the little child to wear. Fans in Kimberly's comments asked her things like, \"Soo you’re back in America???\"\n\"Back in America, huh?\" wrote another fan before joking that they knew Kimberly and TJ's relationship wasn't going to last long. Meanwhile, one fan posted, \"Pretty sure she can come back to the US without it meaning the relationship is over.\" Kimberly replied to this follower to thank them. Kimberly's response could mean she's in America only for a temporary stay. It would also most likely be one of Kimberly's visa requirements. Kimberly and TJ do get married as revealed in a mid-season trailer for The Other Way season 5, as shared by 90 Day Fiancé on Instagram. Kimberly and TJ are shown getting married in a lavish Hindu ceremony.\nKimberly tells the cameras that it feels like a fairy tale coming true to her. She's happy that she's going to be with the man whom she wants to spend the rest of her life with. Kimberly and TJ are happy during the wedding ceremony as cheerful music plays in the background and even TJ's brother Yash Goswami, who was against the marriage, is dancing in the wedding procession with glee. But there is always a twist in the tale when it comes to Kimberly and TJ. The trailer ends with the couple in an argument.\nA homesick Kimberly annoys TJ so much that he's seen asking her to go back to the U.S., and she screams and yells at him. The scene has been compared to a horror movie. If Kimberly is implying she's still together with TJ, him making the relationship work despite the yelling deserves an applause. She has been difficult the entire season when she lashed out at TJ for not building an apartment the way she wanted it to look. But then again, Kimberly and TJ do love each other and could have decided to accept each other just the way they are in order to have a successful marriage.\n90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.\nSources: Kimberly Rochelle/Instagram, 90 Day Fiancé/Instagram\n"}

As one of the best reality TV shows, it's no surprise curiosity about former Below Deck cast members continues. The Venezuelan native has a heart of gold that shined through during each episode. With the Bravo series behind him, Marcos has embarked on a new adventure.\nMarcos has been working as a professional chef for the last ten years. Even though he's primarily cooked in restaurants, working on a yacht came naturally to the chef. The culinary guru started his career in culinary school in Venezuela but, after graduating, decided to travel. He revealed in one of his BDSY season 3 confessionals that he could learn from chefs from all over the world by doing this. Marcos is settled in Los Angeles and has made his mark there.\nSince filming the reunion for BDSY season 3, Marcos has opened his restaurant, Lou'Mar, by ML Eats, which was initially a food truck. The food fuses cuisine from his home country of Venezuela, Korea, and the U.S. The restaurant serves brunch and dinner with many delicious sounding and looking dishes. On top of being a business owner, Marcos also signed a deal with the University of California to cook for them.\nMarcos teamed up with Below Deck Mediterranean season 7's Chef Dave White for a pop-up event in L.A. The plan was for Dave to add in a few dishes and work in his restaurant during the week, and the event brought in a large crowd. Besides his business ventures, Marcos revealed he will not return to BDSY for another season. Since opening his restaurant, Marcos has become too busy to be a chef on a sailing yacht.\nBelow Deck Sailing Yacht season 3 was one for the books, as the entire cast got along well. Marcos has kept in touch with his co-stars and recently hung out with Chief Engineer Colin MacRae. Even though Bravo viewers will no longer see Marcos on their screens, they can pop into Marcos's restaurant, Lou'Mar, to try his delicious food or continue checking up on him via his social media accounts. Whatever the future holds, Marcos will undoubtedly be a success.\nSource: Marcos Spaziani/Instagram\n"}

First airing in 2005, NBC's The Office would go on to become one of the most popular sitcoms of a generation over the course of its nine seasons. The show, which is based on a British series of the same name created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, came to an end in 2013, with audiences forced to say farewell to the show's beloved cast of characters.\nNow, Dwight Schrute actor Wilson has shared a new image from a recent mini The Office cast reunion with Carell and Kinsey at a charity dinner party. Check out the new image below:\nIn his caption, Wilson reveals that the dinner party was organized to raise money for the Lide Foundation, with the actor teasing that, while it \"wasn't exactly a reenactment of the dinner party episode... I did bring my babysitter and a teeny tiny flatscreen,\" a reference to one of the show's most notorious episodes.\nRelated: The Office: One Tiny Detail Makes Michael & Jan's Dinner Party Even Worse\nWilson's image follows some exciting recent news regarding The Office, with Matt Belloni of Puck reporting that a reboot is in the works from Greg Daniels, the showrunner of the hit NBC sitcom. This reboot is said to be in the very early stages of development, meaning there are almost no details regarding what it will be about, where it will be set, or who will star in it. At the moment, it's not clear if the show will be happening at all.\nCrucial to note here is that Daniels is working on the reboot as part of a development deal, which is a far cry from a show actually getting the green light. If Daniels can come up with a good idea and NBC likes it, then the reboot might actually move forward. While little information is known at this point, the use of the term \"reboot\" over \"revival\" suggests that the original cast of The Office, despite being a core reason behind the show's success, will not be returning.\nWith the WGA strike having only just ended, it's likely that it will be some time before anything comes of Daniels' development deal. What is already clear, however, is that any prospective reboot faces the immense challenge of recapturing the same magic as the original NBC show. It remains to be seen whether The Office reboot will actually happen, but replacing stars like Carell, Wilson, and Kinsey will definitely be no easy task.\nSource: Rainn Wilson/ Instagram\n"}

Thriller Movie's Filming Locations Explained", "date": "2023-10-02 18:30:28", "text": "The 2023 Netflix film Reptile stars Benicio del Toro as a detective trying to solve the murder of a real estate agent – where was the movie filmed?\nReptile centers around the baffling murder of a young real estate agent and the complicated life of the detective on the case, and the cast and crew utilized a few cities on the East Coast to capture the movie's story. The Netflix murder mystery film, which premiered on September 29 on the streaming service, takes plenty of twists and turns, leaving viewers constantly guessing what the truth is and who brutally killed Summer Elswick. As the movie's synopsis suggests, nothing is as it seems in the crime thriller.\nThe large cast of Reptile includes Benicio del Toro as Tom Nichols, Justin Timberlake as Will Grady, Alicia Silverstone as Judy Nichols, Eric Bogosian as Captain Robert Allen, Ato Essandoh as Dan Cleary, Domenick Lombardozzi as Detective Wally, Michael Pitt as Eli Phillips, Karl Glusman as Sam Gifford, Matilda Lutz as Summer Elswick, Mike Pniewski as Chief Marty Graeber, Thad Luckinbill as Peter, Sky Ferreira as Renee, Owen Teague as Rudy Rackozy, Frances Fisher as Camille Grady, and Catherine Dyer as Deena Allen. Almost everyone is a suspect — the boyfriend, the best friend, the ex-husband, etc. However, nothing can prepare the audience for what happened in the ending of Reptile.\nAccording to Ready Steady Cut, the primary filming location for Grant Singer's Reptile was the metropolitan area of Atlanta, Georgia. Principal photography on the Netflix thriller film occurred from August 2021 to November of the same year, and the cast and crew spent most of their time in the Peach State, even though the movie takes place in Scarborough, Maine, which is a real town. However, Atlanta has become a hub for plenty of film and television show productions, so it is understandable why the Netflix movie chose the Georgia city as its central filming location rather than committing to shooting the entirety of the project in the New England town.\nAtlas of Wonders reported many of the Atlanta metropolitan area locations used in the film, including the Peachtree Battle Alliance neighborhood, the Cabernet Steakhouse, the Inn at Stone Mountain Park, the Westview Abbey Mausoleum, Accuformance Motors, and the Bigelow's nightclub. It seems as though the producers were determined to strictly use on-location spots for the movie, as opposed to shooting the majority of Reptile in a film production studio. All the reports regarding the Netflix crime thriller's filming locations suggest that production studios were not a part of principal photography.\nThe Peachtree Battle Alliance neighborhood was used for the house scenes. The Cabernet Steakhouse can be spotted in a couple of sequences when the characters go to a restaurant. The Inn at Stone Mountain Park was utilized for Justin Timberlake's Will Grady's conference scene at the film's beginning. The Westview Abbey Mausoleum was the backdrop for Summer Elswick's funeral. The auto repair shop Accuformance Motors can also be spotted in one scene. Lastly, the location of Bigelow's nightclub was used for the sequence where Benicio del Toro's Detective Tom Nichols and Ato Essandoh's Dan Cleary interview Sky Ferreira's Renee, aka the victim's best friend.\nRelated: Justin Timberlake's New Netflix Movie Features A Surprising Actor Reunion\nThe cast and crew of Reptile also heavily utilized Marietta, Georgia, another city just outside of Atlanta, for shooting significant scenes in the film. The primary location set in Marietta was the Manley Firm Law Offices, which doubled as the Grady Real Estate company offices where the victim, Summer Elswick, worked in the Netflix murder mystery film. However, the production team also took advantage of numerous spots in Marietta for their movie. But the most important one was undoubtedly the law office building since it was significant to the case in Reptile.\nAlthough most of the principal photography for Reptile took place in and around Atlanta, George, The Cinemaholic reported that the cast and crew also traveled to some parts of New England to capture a handful of shots for the movie. It would make sense if the production team shot various exterior scenes in the region in the Northeastern United States since that is where the 2023 Netflix crime thriller takes place. Unfortunately, specific New England locations used for the movie are unknown. However, it is possible that the crew went to Scarborough, Maine, the exact location of Reptile, to film specific sequences to make it more believable that the movie's events transpire in the town.\nSources: Ready Steady Cut, Atlas of Wonders, The Cinemaholic\nSarah Little is a Network TV Shift Writer for Screen Rant.

There have been several live-action Joker actors over the years, including Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto, and Joaquin Phoenix's versions of the Batman villain. While Leto played the character in the DCEU, he will most likely not be returning as the Joker in James Gunn's upcoming DC Universe.\nDC's upcoming movies in the DCU will almost surely feature a new Joker, possibly starting with the still-to-be-dated Batman reboot movie, The Brave and the Bold. While each live-action version of the Joker has brought out a different side of the character, from mobster to gang leader to anarchist and beyond, there is one inspiration for how the Batman villain should be portrayed in the new DC Universe that has come up as quite commonly requested. However, that perfect version of the Joker already exists in live-action.\nDespite only having a cameo role in The Batman and a deleted scene released online to showcase his version of the Joker, Barry Keoghan's Clown Prince of Crime fits exactly the inspiration for the Batman villain that was seemingly teased by Gunn for the DCU. Gunn sparked Joker rumors when he posted images of Conrad Veidt in Paul Leni’s The Man Who Laughs on Twitter, talking about how the original Batman comic book creators agreed that Veidt's role in the movie — a character that had a smile carved on his face — served as the inspiration for the Joker.\nWhile Keoghan's Joker has appeared very little so far, the actor's take on the iconic Batman villain is very clearly inspired by Veidt's role in The Man Who Laughs. Speaking with Variety, The Batman director Matt Reeves confirmed as much by comparing the two, saying, \"He has a congenital disease where he can’t stop smiling and it’s horrific,\" and \"his response was to say, ‘Okay, so a joke was played on me,’ and this was his nihilistic take on the world.” Keoghan's look as the Joker is appropriately grotesque, taking cues from The Man Who Laughs and positioning a challenge for the new DC Universe.\nWhile the DCU's Joker might not debut alongside whoever gets cast as Batman for the new universe in The Brave and the Bold, the Joker will inevitably have to come to the DCU one day. Batman can't be without his biggest villain for long, and so the Joker must come to the DC Universe. Whenever that happens, the DCU will have a very difficult task, as its version of the Joker will have to be different from the ones that came before.\nRelated: How To Watch DCEU Movies In Order (By Release Date & Chronologically)\nWhen there are multiple popular takes on the Joker in live-action, that becomes hard. Still, if the DC Universe's Joker manages to take inspiration from The Man Who Laughs and still feel unique among the other live-action versions of the villain — as the best versions of the Joker have managed to do — then the DCU's version of the villain could succeed. Based on how well Keoghan's Joker — who is directly inspired by The Man Who Laughs — was received, Gunn's seeming tease for the direction of the DCU's Joker is the right path for the character's next live-action iteration.\nSource: James Gunn/Twitter\n"}

So she didn't have that kind of runway, unless we treated her as exactly the same as Finn. So it was just kind of finding a situation we could put them in that would let her make very different choices and have a very different milieu to be in, in the first place.\nPart of the series ending kind of was freeing because we didn't have to tie it in as directly. It wasn't like we were cutting to a Fionna and Cake episode in the final season and then cutting back to the main series. It could kind of live as its own offshoot. And that's kind of how we treated it, like this is a branch that can go in a very different direction if we wanted to. And we don't have to show the whole course of her life, we're just kind of showing, you know, a couple of days in her life.\nThe multiverse was already established in the previous show, but Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake leaned into it a whole lot more. Were there conversations about all the other multiverse media that's been coming out recently, and how were you able to make your series standout among these other shows and movies?\nAdam Muto: I think it sort of helped that [the multiverse] already existed as being in the air and almost too many multiverse things right now. So it was kind of like looking at what we could do differently, and what we could kind of strip away and not try to show every single depiction of the characters because it feels like it's kind of moved in that direction, where it's like, ‘how can I show every single version of the character and include that in the story?’. And on a TV budget, you can't really do that for one thing. So we kind of listed all the things we possibly could do, and then narrowed down the list to the ones that felt like they would have the most meat or visually be different, or you know, just a couple of different factors. And then since it was kind of episodic, we wanted to treat it like we didn't have to track all those multiverse strip threads through the entire thing. Like each episode is basically in its own AU. And you know, we'd all seen Sliders at some point. So we just kind of like said, ‘what did we like about sliders? Maybe we can use that.'\nAre there any universes that you hope to include that didn't make it in the final cut that you're able to share?\nAdam Muto: I'll have to look at the list. Some of them were just like, ‘oh, this is a look,’ or ‘that looks cool.’ And they just were visually interesting, but it was hard to say we need a whole episode there. I think initially when we talked about like the FlapJack cameo we were like, ‘maybe we just go to Flapjack for an entire episode and have a crossover.’ And then eventually that got stripped away, because we only had 10 episodes. I'm trying to think if [there are] any others, but that was the one that stands out.\nSo going back to when Adventure Time first made that jump from more episodic storytelling into the lore-heavy serialized stuff. Was there any pushback from Cartoon Network, because around that time, there weren't a lot of animated shows aimed at younger demographics doing these broader stories.\nAdam Muto: What's strange is that they were resistant at first, but then it became sort of a marketing thing, like you could package a bunch of episodes together and promote it as an event. And it was a lot harder to get promos for individual episodes. So it wasn't like we were the only show. They were kind of going to a lot of shows and saying, ‘Hey, we want an eight pack or a 10 pack of episodes that we can kind of lump together’ and even in the later seasons of some of the shows that are still running. Like the last season of Summer Camp Island that was like one big arc. And some of that comes from the creators, and some of that came from the network itself, just having a harder time promoting individual episodes.\nSo elements that ended up playing a big role in the overall story like the Enchiridion - which was around in the pilot - were these things that you always hope to include or was your team just going through and finding things that could work in the overarching story?\nAdam Muto: It's kind of both, where you have things in mind, like what are your significant objects and events in the past that you can refer to that feel like - not that every single audience member would know it - but that felt significant enough in the backstory of each character that you could bring it back and it would have some significance.\nWe tried to leave it in a place where you could start and if this was your first series that you watched, it might be confusing, but you could kind of pick it up. And like, it would just seem like part of the backstory that maybe doesn't even exist. If you didn't know there was an original series, you could still watch it and just think that you're referring to something in the distant past. I think because we’d shown the Enchiridion in relation to Simon, it felt natural to kind of revisit that.\nThe Adventure Time fan base is obviously massive. Did you ever dream that it would get this big?\nAdam Muto: No, we just were trying not to get canceled the first season. I think a lot of that feels so outside of your control. We never sat around and wondered about like, ‘what's Comic-Con gonna be like,’ ‘which characters are people going to ship?’. I don't think we ever had conversations like that. It was more ‘how are we going to finish this in time for the next deadline?’. I think you get kind of tunnel vision. And especially if you're working in a studio, you can look at stuff online, but your day to day is just production. So you know, it's cool to see fan reaction. And when it's in person, it feels like realer in a way because you can see it online and you know, it's detached. It's just text on a screen, or fan art. But then when you see people in person, you're like, ‘Oh, I thought you were tricking us.’ I didn't know if people were actually watching. So it's nice. It's definitely nice, but it's not why we were making it.\nSo with the later seasons, and with Fionna and Cake, and Distant Lands after this fan base was already established, do you feel like the influence of the fan base and the things they wanted to see influenced the show's production at all?\nAdam Muto: I think it influenced especially what characters kind of showed up. Because if they had an established fan base, and the show is sort of fan facing, there are certain characters that lend themselves to a new series more than others. Like it'd be really hard to do a Mr. Pig series or a Shelby series or one about the Snail because the world was so expansive, you could focus on anything. But I'm pretty sure Max wouldn't have said ‘yes’ to a lot of those ideas. So I think the fact that the Fionna and Cake episodes usually got pretty high ratings when it was on linear, kind of made it an easier sell when we were like pitching what the series could be.\nAre there any hints you can give us as to what's coming next for the Adventure Time franchise?\nAdam Muto: I wish. I mean, I think streaming has made it a lot harder to predict the life of what's going to happen for a different iteration of the show, because I'm pretty confident there will be, but I have no idea when. I think in the meantime, we're just developing stuff and kind of seeing what the next year is going to be like.\nBased on characters from the beloved “Adventure Time” franchise, this brand-new 10-episode series set in the land of Ooo follows the alternate universe versions of Finn & Jake on a multiverse-hopping journey towards self-discovery. When Fionna and her sidekick Cake find themselves in the crosshairs of a powerful new foe, they have no choice but to seek the help of former Ice King Simon Petrikov. With appearances from Marshall Lee, Marceline the Vampire Queen, Princess Bubblegum, and Finn the Human, “Adventure Time: Fionna & Cake” transports fans of the classic series to worlds both familiar and alien.

Throughout Big Brother's decades long run, Julie has been the only host of the series and has an intense personal relationship with the series. As a fan of the game herself and a part of the series from its very beginning, Julie often weighs in on what's happening in the BB house, sharing her thoughts on the players and the game as a whole. For Julie, watching new houseguests tackle Big Brother is second nature.\nAccording to an exclusive interview with People, Julie feels that the house's next target should be BB houseguest Jag Bains. \"Jag is good at winning things,\" Julie explained, adding that while he's good at \"winning games...he hasn't been able to steer the direction of the house.\" There's more to Big Brother than competition wins, though, which is why Julie feels BB 25's Cory Wurtenberger is actually running the BB house. Cory \"has the gift of being a persuasive speaker,\" according to Julie, and also \"has a fair amount of people under his belt\" aside from his showmance America Lopez.\nAlthough Big Brother is meant to capture its houseguests 24/7, sharing their most personal thoughts, there's still a code of conduct in place to ensure that houseguests are held to an appropriate standard of behavior. Earlier in the season, BB 25's Luke Valentine used a racial slur and was swiftly ejected from the game, causing a stir among BB viewers. \"It's just zero tolerance for that. That is unacceptable,\" Julie explained. \"That word really stings me. I can't imagine anyone using it even casually. I don't condone it at all.\" She shared that if she had things her way, Big Brother's code of conduct would apply in every situation.\nAs the longest season in BB history, Big Brother 25 has continued long past it's typical season benchmark. Most BB season span between 80 and 90 days, with some in the mid-90s, but BB 25 will be a 100-day-long competition. The houseguests, who have been in the house for roughly 60 days, are feeling the pressure after more than half the competition has gone by. With the series most recent twist resurrecting Cameron Hardin's game after he was unanimously evicted, the series will pick up the pace for the rest of the houseguests as they head towards the finish line.\nWhile there are still nearly 40 days left of the Big Brother 25 season, the houseguests have already played close to a full game. Though there are still weeks to go, the end is on the horizon for the BB 25 cast, including Jag, Cory, and Cameron. With the power shifting week to week, it's impossible to know who will wind up the winner of the longest modern season to date. Big Brother viewers will have to continue watching and expecting the unexpected in order to see what happens next.\nBig Brother airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. EDT, Thursdays at 8 p.m. EDT, and Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT on CBS.\nSource: People\n"}
{"title": "Disenchantment Season 5’s 7 Best Easter Eggs & References", "date": "2023-10-02 18:50:29", "text": "Disenchantment season 5 continues the Netflix show’s tradition of including Easter eggs, with several connecting to Matt Groening’s other shows.\nDisenchantment, the popular animated show from the creator of The Simpsons and Futurama, has just finished airing season 5, which has plenty of hidden Easter eggs and references scattered throughout. The third animation from the mind of Matt Groening, Disenchantment is set in the fictional kingdom of Dreamland, which combines the Middle Ages with futuristic, space-age elements. Disenchantment season 5 serves as the final season of the series, bringing Queen Bean's (Abbi Jacobson) quest to save her home to a close at last.\nDisenchantment follows Bean and her companion, the feisty elf Elfo (Nat Faxon), in their attempts to save Dreamland from Bean's mother, Queen Dagmar (Sharon Horgan). The animated show is known for its hidden Easter eggs and references to popular culture, and season 5 of Disenchantment has continued this tradition, featuring a number of fun nods to itself, movies, and other shows in the Groening universe.\nOne notable reference made in Disenchantment season 5 is a callback to a 29-year-old joke from The Simpsons. In the 1994 Simpsons episode \"Lady Bouvier's Lover,\" Bart tries to sell Comic Book Guy an animation cell of a singular arm and informs the young boy that it was drawn by a man called Hig Heisler. Although Hig Heisler is not a real-life animator, his name appears in the credits of Disenchantment season 5, episode 3, \"Electric Ladyland.\" Specifically, Heisler is given credit for animating the Disenchantment characters' arms.\nThis isn't the first crossover between the two Groening shows. In Treehouse of Horror XXIX, Disenchanment's Luci (Eric Andre) makes an appearance. Luci is seen sitting atop the castle of Dreamland by Lisa during a fever dream. Luci also reappears in the Simpsons season 30 episode \"101 Mitigations,\" where eagle-eyed viewers can see figurines of him, Bean, and Elfo among a pile of trash in Comic Book Guy's room.\nFuturama's Hypnotoad is best known for his oscillating eyes and low hum, using his powers to hypnotize those who watch. These abilities eventually earn the creature its own in-universe show — Everybody Loves Hypnotoad — which becomes a worldwide hit. Hypnotoad returns in the Disenchantment season 5 episode \"I Hear Your Noggin, But You Can't Come In,\" where he can be seen in the background of the freak show. He's sitting upon a gold podium and covered with a glass dome. Locked away in a cell, Hypnotoad can be seen peering through the bars with a sign reading \"Prince Toad\" above it.\nThis makes sense, as Futurama season 11 confirms that the show shares a timeline with Disenchantment. Little is known of Hypnotoad's backstory, so it's unclear how old the creature is. He appears to be the only one of his kind on Earth. If Hypnotoad is as ancient as has previously been implied. it's more than possible that Hypnotoad is, in fact, the toad seen in Disenchantment.\nLuna Park is first introduced in Futurama episode 2 as a theme park inside a giant orb situated upon Earth's moon. Luna Park is inspired by the average 20th-century theme park, and it's revisited multiple times across the seasons of Futurama. It also appears in Disenchantment season 5. The episode \"Who Shot Elfo?\" finds Elfo and a group of escaped freaks attempting to make their way back to Dreamland aboard a submarine. As they set their destination, several other stops can be seen — including one for Luna Park.\nRelated: 10 Ways Disenchantment’s Characters Can Still Return In Futurama & The Simpsons\nIt's not known when Luna Park was first built, but this Easter Egg adds another link between Futurama and Disenchantment. Seeing as the group are traveling by submarine, and Luna Park is based on the moon, it doesn't make much sense. However, it is possible that Luna Park may have started on Earth and eventually made its way to the moon, which could have happened during the destruction of New York in 2308, as confirmed in Futurama.\nIn the Disenchantment season 5 premiere, Queen Dagmar sets off on a mission to locate Bad Bean's body. She begins interrogating the characters about its whereabouts. While Queen Dagmar questions Elfo, he sits at a table lined with different torture devices, including wrenches, pincers, and barbed wire. At the end of the table, eagle-eyed viewers can spot a metal device that resembles Zoidberg's claw on the far left.\nThis could simply be inspired by the Futurama character, but it also could be a reference to the Futurama episode \"Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?\" Dueling using the Decapodian ceremonial process of Claw-Pach, Fry uses a large crab cracker to defend himself against Zoidberg, which looks very similar to the weapon seen on the table in front of Elfo. The Claw-Plach was actually inspired by an episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, meaning this Easter egg could be a reference of a reference.\nDuring an appearance at San Diego Comic-Con in 2018, Matt Groening told audiences that a massive clue had been hidden at the beginning of the opening credits of Disenchantment (via GameSpot). It isn't until Disenchantment season 5's ending that the meaning behind his words becomes clear. The mystery is solved when Bean gives Dreamland back to the Elves. Disenchantment's credits feature a shot of the cast, which is a reference to King Rulo's crown. This hints at the Elves' eventual rule over Dreamland way before it happens.\nDisenchantment's Steamland is home to the Gunderson Steamwork, which is inspired by the 1927 film Metropolis. However, this is not the only reference to the silent science-fiction film. Another is made in season 5 of Disenchantment. Bean is seen embracing a figure resembling a Maschinenmensch (a Robot-Person), the non-human antagonist of Metropolis. It's clear the movie influenced Groening and his animated series, as Disenchantment keeps returning to it.\nIn Disenchantment season 5, episode 9, \"Darkness Falls,\" magic is unlocked and Dagmar is delighted as it slowly spreads across the kingdom of Dreamland. As this happens, a voice can be heard muttering about \"10 years.\" This is a reference to Futurama's cancelation in 2013, the second time Groening's show was canceled before returning for its third run in September 2023. This Easter Egg from Disenchantment season 5 further emphasizes the connections between Groening's series, especially Disenchantment and Futurama.\nSource: GameSpot\nRebecca is an experienced freelance writer from the UK, with two degrees focussing on narrative design and characterisation, as well as being a doctoral candidate on the discussion of the wider public's understanding of minority groups and the issues they live with, through mainstream television, film, and video games. \n\nIn her spare time, you'll find her with her cats, a cup of coffee, and gaming."}

A contemporary reimagining of the 1984 cult classic of the same name, the upcoming film follows the downtrodden janitor, Winston Gooze, as he suffers a horrible toxic accident that transforms him into a monstrous hero. The film features a stellar ensemble cast led by Peter Dinklage as Winston Gooze alongside Jacob Tremblay, Taylour Paige, Kevin Bacon, Sarah Niles, Julia Davis, Julian Kostov, and Elijah Wood.\nNow, Legendary has released a red band teaser trailer for the Toxic Avenger remake. Watch it below via IGN Movie Trailers:\nThe teaser begins with a series of news reports and interviews with eyewitnesses who have seen the Toxic Avenger. After a group of armed extremists known as the Nasty Lads take hostages at the Miss Meat lunchatorium, the titular hero armed with a glowing mop and super-human strength breaks down the door and takes matters into his own hands by ripping the jaw off one of the hostage takers.\nThe Toxic Avenger reboot trailer shows the first footage of its titular vigilante, though just like the initial image that was released this past August, it's only a silhouette that purposefully obscures much of his appearance. Another batch of images released late last month revealed a clear look at Winston Gooze wearing a tutu pre-toxic transformation. Elijah Wood was also unrecognizable as Fritz Garbinger, a character whose appearance is heavily inspired by Danny DeVito's Penguin from Tim Burton's Batman Returns. Kevin Bacon plays Bob Garbinger who, just like his brother, takes inspiration from a DC supervillain – Lex Luthor.\nRelated: The Toxic Avenger Remake Is Already Shaping Up To Be Darker Than The 1984 Original\nThe teaser trailer also promises that much like the original cult classic, the reboot will feature plenty of blood and gore. This was already expected considering the remake received an R-rating from the MPAA for \"strong violence and gore.\" It's also produced by Troma Entertainment, who was behind the original Toxic Avenger and is known for its exploitation-style movies that push the boundaries of graphic violence, gruesome deaths, and over-the-top gore for comedic and shock value purposes. Based on the red band teaser trailer, it appears The Toxic Avenger reboot will follow firmly in the footsteps of orginal.\nSource: Legendary (via IGN Movie Trailers)\n"}

The 37-year-old Panama native last appeared in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6 and faced many challenges in her relationship with Gino Palazzolo. But she stayed with him and traveled to the United States to seal the deal. Unfortunately, the couple still has many unresolved problems that endanger their relationship. They are still not on the same page about signing a prenup and making a will.\n90 Day Fiancé season 10 promises even more drama between Jasmine and Gino. E! News spoke to the couple to get their reactions to a recent trailer that them having a major argument after the Panamanian woman discovered lip gloss in her future husband’s car. While sharing her views, Jasmine accepted her faults. She said, “I was not expecting that. It took me by surprise, and I reacted in the most emotional, crazy way.” Jasmine then admitted that she was glad the meltdown happened in front of the cameras. She added, “Now people are going to see that Gino is not the angel everyone thinks he is.

Gino said, “We’re still undecided if we’re actually going to get married.” The 90 Day Fiancé couple explained that they have different expectations from the marriage. Gino wants a local celebration so all his family members can attend the wholesome gathering. In comparison, Jasmine wants a seaside wedding away from the wilderness. She explained, “Since my family is not going to be able to be present in the wedding, I wanted to make it just him and I. No family at all.”\nIt’s saddening that after years of being together, Jasmine and Gino still treat their relationship like a business contract. Jasmine is in the wrong for not wanting to interact with Gino’s family or invite them to the wedding. She is extremely selfish for wanting her future husband to give up on having his family at the venue just because she can't have hers. Similarly, Gino is at fault for not discussing the wedding plans before inviting Jasmine to the United States. He could have clarified his expectations when he first addressed the topic with her.\nIt’ll be interesting to see what is in the future for Jasmine and Gino. The Panamanian single mom has implied that the lip gloss incident will expose Gino and ruin her social media image. However, she didn’t provide more details on the subject. Gino also didn’t seem to defend himself in the interview, which could hint that he is confident he isn’t at fault. 90 Day Fiancé season 10 will show Jasmine and Gino giving their relationship a last chance.\n90 Day Fiancé season 10 premieres Sunday, October 8, 2023, at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.\nSources: E!

This post contains SPOILERS for Ahsoka episode 7\nGrand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen) has finally made his live-action debut in Ahsoka, and he's already proven himself to be incredibly powerful as Star Wars' latest big bad. Unlike other villains such as Darth Vader or Emperor Palpatine, Thrawn is not a Sith Lord nor can he wield the Force. However, there are some key reasons why he's just as scary and dangerous in the Star Wars galaxy nonetheless.\nAs seen in Ahsoka episode 7, Grand Admiral Thrawn is preparing to finally escape his decade-long exile on the extragalactic world known as Peridea. Having been located by his agents with a means of returning to the known galaxy, Thrawn is nearly ready to take command of the Imperial Remnant as \"Heir to the Empire\", starting a brand-new war with the Rebellion-turned-New Republic in the aftermath of the original trilogy. To that end, his first battle with the Jedi trio Ahsoka Tano, Sabine Wren, and Ezra Bridger proves Thrawn's true power as an effective Star Wars villain.\nAt his core, the true danger of Grand Admiral Thrawn is his genius-level intellect as a brilliant tactician. Not unlike Anakin Skywalker whom Thrawn had history with, Thrawn is renowned for his unconventional strategies and offensives, often raising the eyebrows of his fellow officers and superiors. However, Thrawn's results spoke for themselves which is why he rose through the ranks of the Imperial Navy so quickly, eventually being given command of the Seventh Fleet as a Grand Admiral.\nWithin Thrawn's sinister genius, one of his true strengths is his extensive study of his opponents. Seeking to learn their backgrounds, history, culture, and art, Thrawn was able to gain unique insights into his enemies' strengths and flaws, allowing him to press on weaknesses his fellow officers would have never seen. For example, Thrawn was continually one step ahead of Hera Syndulla during Star Wars Rebels, having gained advantages after learning all about her history and even pieces of art held by her family on Ryloth. Thrawn's whole approach is to truly know his enemy. He thus launches plans that take unique advantage of their literal blind spots.\nIn the same vein, the first thing Thrawn does is seek knowledge after hearing that Tano may be coming to Peridea in Ahsoka episode 6. Wanting to prepare, Ahsoka episode 7 sees Thrawn looking over all the Empire's data on Ahsoka, including the fact that Anakin Skywalker was her master. As such, Thrawn now knows that Ahsoka is just as unpredictable and dangerous as Anakin was, motivating the Grand Admiral to adapt and shift tactics. Rather than continuing to pursue Ahsoka as Morgan Elsbeth would have, Thrawn calls off their fighters in order to better position both himself and Ahsoka right where he wants her to be.\nRelated: 14 Star Wars Easter Eggs In Ahsoka Episode 7\nAs seen multiple times in Star Wars Rebels as well as in Timothy Zahn's canonical Thrawn novels, the Grand Admiral often takes advantage of his enemies' fear. Anyone who faces Thrawn typically ends up second-guessing themselves, struggling to figure out whether they're being played. The fear of Thrawn therefore paralyzes them, leaving them indecisive in their own strategies and creating even more opportunities for Thrawn himself. More often than not, Thrawn's preparation and ability to be flexible with multiple contingencies allow him to control the flow of battle in his favor.\nFurthermore, Thrawn is also able to trick his enemies with false victories, using their confidence against them. During the Liberation of Lothal, the Rebellion was allowed to believe that they had fought hard to break through Thrawn's planetary blockade, though the ships that did make it through were met by a second wave of TIE Fighters kept in reserve and hidden within the planet's atmosphere. As such, Thrawn's unconventional tactics and ability to adapt in real time make him a truly frightening opponent to face in battle.\n To that end, Grand Admiral Thrawn has no problem giving ground in the short term in favor of the long game to become the ultimate victor. While others may want to press an advantage at the moment Thrawn has proven himself to be far more patient, though he's also willing to expend necessary forces if it means his foes overplay their hand. In Rebels, probe droids were destroyed during Thrawn's search for a secret Rebellion base. However, he was still able to use the data to shorten the list of planets the rebel cells could be on, turning what others might have seen as a loss into a gain.\nThrawn also knows when to pull his forces back to gain a stronger advantage as seen in Ahsoka episode 7. With Baylan Skoll missing in action, Thrawn called in a retreat and allowed Ahsoka to reunite with Sabine and Ezra. This is because it ultimately bought him more time to eventually leave Peridea. While Morgan Elsbeth saw this first confrontation as a defeat, Thrawn saw the true value of the retreat. He doesn't need to destroy the Jedi and risk his escape when all he needs to do is let them waste time as he prepares to leave, thus stranding the heroes on the extragalactic world.\nRelated: How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order\nIn the past, the biggest examples of Thrawn losing have come from the Jedi and their more unpredictable use of the Force. Kanan Jarrus motivating the Force entity known as the Bendu to enter the conflict prevented Thrawn from wiping out the Rebellion in Star Wars Rebels season 3. Likewise, Ezra's bond with the pod of star whales resulted in the Grand Admiral's exile and the Liberation of Lothal in Rebels' series finale, explaining Thrawn's absence during the original trilogy.\nNow, Ahsoka has debuted Thrawn in league with the Force witches known as the Nightsisters. It's the perfect example of Thrawn having adapted, turning a key weakness from his past defeats into a strength for future victories. While he might not wield the Force himself, he's already made up for it with this new alliance, further proving Grand Admiral Thrawn's status as one of Star Wars' most dangerous villains.\n"}

Here's everything we know.\nFeud season 2, officially titled Feud: Capote vs. The Swans, is arriving on FX, and the next season of the anthology docudrama already looks set to be filled with just as much edge-of-the-seat drama, intrigue, and high-society betrayal. Feud’s first season showcased the rivalry between Joan Crawford and Bette Davis in the 1960s. The next season of the anthology show is moving forward a decade, detailing the feud between writer Truman Capote and his mostly female high-society friends (the titular Swans) and the scandal that followed after his explosive 1975 Esquire article “La Côte Basque 1965”.\nWith a cast that includes Naomi Watts and Tom Hollander, anticipation for Feud season 2 is high, especially since it will be arriving over five years after the first season. The hit Ryan Murphy historical docudrama could arrive on FX by the end of 2023, and since it’s based on historical events there’s already much to discuss when it comes to Feud: Capote vs. The Swans.\nThe most recent news for Feud season 2 came in September 2023 when FX released first-look images from Feud: Capote vs. The Swans. The handful of images didn’t reveal a huge amount of plot-specifics, but they did give viewers their first look at cast members like Tom Hollander’s Truman Capote and Naomi Watts’s Babe Paley.\nDespite several years passing since 2017’s season 1, Feud was reconfirmed as renewed for season 2 in 2022. Feud season 2 was initially confirmed in 2017 shortly after the first season. However, development then went on hiatus for many years while Murphy exited the show to work on other projects. While the plug was never officially pulled on Feud, between 2017's confirmation and the 2022 story announcement/reconfirmation many believed the show wouldn't return.\nThere’s currently no known release date for Feud season 2, although with first-look images circulating it likely won’t be much longer until one is announced. It’s widely expected that the FX anthology show has been pegged for a winter 2023 release window, which means it could debut by the end of the year. However, given the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes throughout the year, it’s possible FX could delay the 8 episodes of Feud season 2 for an early 2024 release.\nMuch of the cast of Feud season 2 has already been announced, along with who they’ll be playing in the Capote vs. The Swans. Truman Capote will be played by Tom Hollander (The Kings Man), with Naomi Watts (Mulholland Drive) joining him as Babe Paley.\nHollander and Watts aren’t alone in the Feud season 2 cast, however, and the rest of the ensemble lineup of the next season of the FX anthology show includes:\nThe full title for Feud season 2 is Feud: Capote vs. The Swans, which reveals what the story of the next season will be. Truman Capote was a fame novelist and screenwriter who lived from 1924 to 1984, reaching fame with the novella Breakfast at Tiffany’s and 1966 true crime classic In Cold Blood. Feud season 2 will focus on a specific incident from Capote’s life, the now-infamous “La Côte Basque 1965”\nStarting life as a single chapter of the novel Answered Prayers, the article in the November 1975 edition of Esquire marked the end of Capote’s life as a budding socialite. It was clear that many of the characters were based on high-society women Capote knew - the titular Swans of Feud season 2 — with some not even being masked by pseudonyms. Since Capote marketed a lot of his work as non-fiction there was, understandably, uproar, especially since the text included no shortage of scandalous details and gossip, many of it blurring real events with fictionalized conversations.\nCapote was isolated and exiled from the high-class company he’d grown used to keeping thanks to the single chapter. Once a staple of the New York ballrooms, La Côte Basque 1965 saw Capote shunned by his friends and associates — something that pushed him ever further into alcohol and substance abuse. This is the story Feud season 2 will tell, showcasing how the titular Swans went out of their way to ensure that Capote’s article didn’t go unpunished.\n"}
{"title": "Wheel Of Time Season 2 Makes A Villain Reveal From The Books Even Better", "date": "2023-10-02 19:00:31", "text": "The Wheel of Time season 2 takes a meaningless villain reveal from the books and turns it into a huge twist with massive story implications.\nWarning: Spoilers for The Wheel of Time season 2, episode 7\nIn addition to copying a villain twist from the books, The Wheel of Time season 2 made it even better than what happened in the source material. The Wheel of Time season 2, episode 7, titled “Daes Dae’marr,” offered a surprise when one of the show’s newer characters, Barthanes Damodred, stood revealed as a Darkfriend. As it turns out, Barthanes was never the innocent nobleman he was presented to be when he first appeared.\nOf course, Moiraine’s nephew is far from the first Wheel of Time character to turn out to be a servant of the Dark One. The innkeeper Rand and Mat encountered in season 1, Padan Fain, and more recently, Liandrin, were all exposed as Darkfriends. For one reason or another, they were lured by the Shadow into doing the bidding of the Dark One and his generals, the Forsaken. Apparently, Barthanes was among the many tempted by the promises that come with helping the Dark One. At an unspecified point in time, Barthanes became a Darkfriend in the interest of gaining political power for his family, Wheel of Time’s House Damodred.\nIn spite of his admiration for Moiraine and seemingly good-spirited attitude, Barthanes being exposed as a villain didn’t come as a complete shock – or at least, not to book readers. Like the TV character, the version of Barthanes Damodred in The Great Hunt was revealed to be a Darkfriend when Rand visited him after receiving an invitation to a party held at his home in Cairhien. Rand knew very little about the mysterious nobleman before meeting him, but by the end of their conversation, it was abundantly clear that Barthanes was allied with the Dark One. His true loyalties were confirmed to Rand when Barthanes passed on a message from Padan Fain.\nWhat transpired between Rand and Barthanes bears few similarities to the story given to the villain in Amazon’s live-action adaptation. Both versions are members of House Damodred, of course, meaning that the book character is most likely related by blood to Moiraine in some form. However, any relationship that he shared with her was not relevant to the book in any way, as Moiraine and Rand were in separate parts of The Wheel of Time’s world at the time. The Anvaere character wasn’t a factor either. In short, Barthanes’ entire backstory was an invention of the show, but also one that made a lot of sense for the series.\nIn contrast to his brief arc in The Great Hunt, Barthanes is a character whose story actually carries emotional weight in the TV series. In the novel, it hardly mattered that Barthanes was a Darkfriend, especially since he was someone that Rand had just met. The show, on the other hand, managed to dramatize it in a meaningful way, thanks in large part to how it fit both Barthanes and his mother into Moiraine’s season 2 story. The development was much more significant for the show because Barthanes was introduced in episode 5, allowing the series some time to make the character genuinely likable.\nHis affection for Moiraine, which felt sincere, added something to the villain that simply wasn’t in the books. This helped create the feeling that perhaps the TV show’s take on Barthanes wasn’t a Darkfriend. After all, it’s worth pointing out that it was he who helped break through to Moiraine, who had been cold and detached since returning to her family home. Moiraine even apologized after treating him poorly and expressed her confidence in Barthanes’ ability to be a good king for the people of Cairhien. Earlier, she had made comments about how kind he is. All this made his story in Wheel of Time season 2 episode 7 even sadder. After all, it’s only a matter of time before Moiraine learns the heartbreaking truth.\nThough Moiraine has yet to personally discover her nephew’s plan to kill her, it’s already had a profound impact on the narrative. Specifically, it was a massive gut-punch to Anvaere. Remembered as Moiraine’s sister in Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time books, Anvaere never appeared in any of the novels and was only confirmed to exist in the canon through a few forgettable references in the prequel, A New Spring. Whereas the books’ Anvaere was never more than a name from Moiraine’s backstory, the TV show’s interpretation of her has already emerged as one of the best additions to season 2.\nInteractions with Moiraine have helped flesh out Anvaere’s character, revealing that she’s so much more than a noble eager to move up the social and political ladder. Anvaere was depicted as someone who had good reasons for being angry at Moiraine. Moiraine stayed away for a just cause – finding the Dragon Reborn – but admittedly, Anvaere knew nothing of it and was understandably bitter about Moiraine’s return. That said, her love for her sister outweighed this feeling, and even led to her providing Moiraine with some much-needed advice. Anvaere then making the difficult decision to have her own son arrested - and forego her chance to restore House Damodred’s good name – gave her a truly great character moment.\nContributing further to the tragic nature of Barthanes’ storyline is what this means for his ending in the series. The idea that the show followed the course set by the books by making him a Darkfriend makes it increasingly likely he’ll meet a fate not unlike what happened to his book counterpart. Shortly after Rand met Barthanes, he learned from Thom that the nobleman was murdered in his bedroom by a gholam, a creature of the Shadow. Since Barthanes has failed to complete the order given to him by Liandrin, the stage is set for he too to die at the hands of one of the Dark One’s minions.\nBarthanes appears to be living on borrowed time. His status and relationship with Moiraine were what made him useful, but now that his allegiances have been exposed, there’s a good chance he’ll be discarded by his masters. The 13 Forsaken in The Wheel of Time have a low tolerance for failure, so Barthanes meeting an unceremonious end very soon feels like a real possibility. But while his death was easily forgotten by Rand and the others in The Great Hunt, it could have emotional consequences for both Moiraine and Anvaere in The Wheel of Time’s future.\nThe Wheel of Time releases new episodes on Fridays on Amazon Prime Video.\n"}

The Infinity Saga revolved entirely around the Mad Titan. From the moment audiences caught a peek at him at the end of The Avengers, each Marvel film built up to the Avengers' inevitable confrontation with him in Avengers: Infinity War. After they lost and half of all life in the universe was destroyed, the remaining Avengers found a way to bring everyone back and defeat Thanos. However, after his demise, it was unclear where the universe would go from there without its central villain.\nThe MCU Phase 5 is well underway, and the franchise still can't escape Thanos. While Kang appears to be the central antagonist for the Multiverse Saga, many movies still deal with life in a post-Thanos world. If the MCU wants to move forward without being stuck in the past, then it needs to establish a fresh story that doesn't rely on fragments of what came before. Thanos is a great character, but his time is done.\nThe Marvels is the next film in the MCU and is both a sequel to Captain Marvel and a showcase for Monica Rambeau and Kamala Khan, two new heroes introduced in WandaVision and Ms. Marvel. As the release date gets close, new footage is emerging, and a Chinese trailer featured shots involving a familiar villain. The teaser begins with Nick Fury reminding viewers that Captain Marvel is mighty and one of the few Avengers members who could go toe-to-toe with Thanos. Then, it shows the fight between Carol Danvers and Thanos from Endgame, in which she had him on the ropes until he used the Power Stone against her.\nIt's not a scene many have forgotten within the last four years, but it's a great reminder of how powerful Captain Marvel is. However, the flashback to their fight is a reminder that the MCU is still banking on the audience's connection to Thanos. He is arguably the best villain in the franchise, and many are still waiting for the universe to reach the peaks that it hit when everything revolved around the purple titan. The Marvels isn't the only film that is leaning on the past, as many other MCU projects have dealt with the lasting effects of Thanos.\nThe MCU Phase 4 established the beginning of the Multiverse Saga, but it was also a Thanos epilogue in many ways. Projects like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier and Eternals had conflicts that directly connected to Thanos' actions and how the world changed once everyone came back post-blip. Even in Phase 5, the MCU still hasn't fully moved on from him. Secret Invasion leaned heavily on Nick Fury's five-year absence from Earth due to the blip and his recent mission, and it included a serum called the \"Harvest,\" which had DNA from the Avengers collected from the battleground of the Battle of Earth.\nRelated: Every Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie Ranked Worst To Best\nThanos was a phenomenal villain, but these stories should no longer be so obsessed with the fallout from his defeat. Kang is here, and if he is to become an iconic character like Thanos before him, he needs more focus. It's time for the MCU to embrace this new universe and its escalating narrative and leave the Mad Titan's conquest behind.\nRoss Tanenbaum is a writer, editor, and movie junkie from Potomac, Maryland.

Co-created by the genre vet and I Am Number Four author James Frey, the animated horror show centers on a group of teens in New Orleans who become imbued with special powers from mystical spirits known as Loa in order to combat the rise of the malevolent demon, Belial.\nSydney Mikayla leads the ensemble Fright Krewe cast alongside Chester Rushing, Tim Johnson Jr., Grace Lu, Terrence Little Gardenhigh, and Jacques Colimon. Boasting a colorful yet gothic animation style and storytelling that is equal parts heartwarming and terrifying, the show is a perfect gateway into the horror genre for younger viewers and a thrilling ride for those already in love with it.\nRelated: New On Hulu: All 185 Movies & TV Shows Arriving In October\nIn anticipation of the show's premiere, Screen Rant spoke exclusively with Eli Roth to discuss Fright Krewe, the long journey to make the family-friendly horror title, the importance of authentically depicting voodoo religion, and his hopes for its future.\nScreen Rant: Eli, I'm very excited to talk with you. I've been an admirer of your work for a long time, and I feel like this is such a great expansion of your work in the horror genre, especially after The House with a Clock in Its Walls, where you're going for this Goosebumps-like aesthetic. When did this concept first come about for you and James Frey, and how long did it take for you guys to develop it together?\nEli Roth: It was actually before House with a Clock in Its Walls, weirdly, this started in 2015. James is a friend of mine, a dear friend, a writer I love, and we sat down, and we were talking about how there was nothing scary for our kids, and how the show that that still is the greatest [for that] is Scooby-Doo. There's nothing animated scary that we remembered after school, or on Saturday mornings, watching episodes of Scooby-Doo, and watching them go through haunted houses, and how much fun that was, that the teenagers solve the mysteries without parents, that they were all these groovy kids driving around in a van.\nWe thought, \"What if we did a show where it was kid solving supernatural mysteries set in New Orleans, and what if we could do our own Scooby-Doo, or our own Goosebumps, and maybe it's an animated series, and a series of books or whatever it is.\" We wanted to create this world where it's something that is for kids, but that is fun, and teaches you that you can Trojan horse life lessons and things about friendship, and bravery, and all these great things that you can do in a scary story. It just it took years to get done, but we could not have had a better team, and a better crew, and the amazing studio at DreamWorks Animation, and now Hulu and Peacock releasing it, and our showrunners Kristine Songco and Joanna Lewis, and our director Shane Acker. We just have an incredible cast, it really couldn't have turned out better, it was so much better than we ever originally imagined it, but we just loved the idea of doing something set in New Orleans, and using that as a basis for a great scary series, except in our series, the monsters had to be real.\nLooking at Scooby-Doo, you could obviously go the fake monster out, but having this be very real creates more stakes for a lot of the characters, and it's a lot of fun to watch. Now, you talk about the multi-year process and getting this off the ground, what were some of the biggest challenges for you, whether it be creatively or logistically, putting the show together?\nEli Roth: Well, when you come up with a show like this, even the pitch process is very lengthy. First, you have to get the studio on board, and I remember we pitched DreamWorks Animation, and they're so good, they're very patient, so it can sometimes take a year to get the script right, or to get the artwork right. James and I wrote the first draft of the script, we wrote it together, and then they said, \"Let's bring in different artists to draw Missy, and Soleil, and Patrick, and let's have different samples of art. Okay, let's try this, let's bring in a director,\" and now we're bringing Joanne and Kristine before you go out and pitch it. Then, sometimes you pitch to a company, and they would pass on it, or they wait three weeks, or four weeks, before they say no, and then six months later, you go, \"Okay, let's go back to them.\" \"But they already said no,\" it's like all those people got fired, there was a regime change, or places like Hulu and Peacock, the people that are the buyers, their mandates change.\nSometimes they're looking for animation, you know, kids animation is traveling worldwide, everyone in the world watches, it's evergreen, they want that. Then they go, \"Okay, they already have three shows, and they don't want that anymore.\" So it's a combination of lining up the project, getting the script right, getting the artwork right, but also the buyers needing a product like this. Because, obviously, animation is expensive, and it's more cost-effective to just do a season than to just do a pilot, so you have to be very, very patient. We started this in 2015, and here we are in October of 2023, it's finally coming out, but it's really nice when it all comes together and it's worth the wait.\nI couldn't be happier with the show, I think we have something that's so unique and fantastic, and I wanted a show that horror fans could watch with their kids, that if you want your kids to get into scary stuff, you can't start them with Hostel. You need that gateway horror, and something that's fun, that's scary, that's safe, that teaches you lessons about bravery and friendship, and to give kids their own new mythology, a whole bunch of cool new monsters. It's really exciting.\nI love how unique this feels. It feels 3D, but also feels very hand-drawn at the same time. What was it like finding that right look, and what were some of the big things that you really wanted to ensure stayed there, regardless of which artists came in?\nEli Roth: Well, the first decision was 2D, but with a 3D feel, that's what we settled on. Because we looked at renderings in 3D, and it didn't have the same feeling. There's something beautiful and retro about hand-drawn animation that we love, it's just my aesthetic. I started with animation, I made a bunch of short films called Chowdaheads, and stop-motion called The Rotten Fruit, they're floating out there on YouTube. So, even before Cabin Fever, I come from an animation background, and I love hand-drawn animation.\nBut we wanted it to have a real cinematic feel, and I love Shane Acker, he's an incredible director, and I love his film 9, and I love his work. We looked at what kids are going to be watching this on projectors, and on 100-screen televisions in 4K, and we said, \"What can we do that doesn't feel like The Flintstones or King of the Hill?\", which are obviously shows that I love, but something that when you're dealing with horror and monsters can be so cinematic, and so scary, and so rich, with complex camera moves. That was just the commitment that we made right from the beginning. In animation, it's money, and it's budget, and it's time, and working on those animatics, and finding those moves, and finding the look at the monsters. And that was really Joanna and Kristine Songco, who had done the Jurassic Park show for DreamWorks Animation, they're really not just overseeing the writing, but working with the animation studios, and working with the animation directors, and making sure that whatever that aesthetic that we set up with Shane from the beginning was really carried throughout every single episode.\nAnd then, of course, getting the voice talent [is important as well]. I want everything to look like a work of art when you're watching the show, I want it to be beautiful and cinematic and feel like you're watching a movie. That was the ambition of the show, and I think that the animators just hit it out of the park. Horror is so visual, especially when you're dealing with voodoo. James and I thought about how we had seen voodoo represented when we were growing up, and whether it was a voodoo doll, or a voodoo spell that you put on someone, it's such an incredible, rich, deep religion that we had never really seen portrayed like this. If you think about the crossover of religion and horror, it's still happening with The Exorcist and The Nun II, that's the biggest thing in the box office right now. But we really wanted to make sure that we did it in a very respectful way that could teach kids about it, and educate about the Loa, the spirits that help guide the kids, and the values they instill in that this one is for power, and that this one will be for knowledge, and this one is languages, and there's Papa Legba, and there's the Maman Brigitte, and Marie Laveau, and really rooting it in real history.\nWe had voodoo priests and priestesses and practitioners that were on from the very beginning, they were technical advisors, and looking at the artwork. One of our writers was from New Orleans, and her grandmother was a voodoo priestess, so really making sure that even though we're going off into the world of fantasy and horror, that it was all grounded in reality. What animation allows you to do is to render the spirit world in such a beautiful and incredible way so that when I think of what was my understanding of voodoo by the time I was 12, or 13 years old, if the kids watched the show, they'll have a completely different understanding of what the religion in a much, much more grounded way. You want kids to watch the show and eventually when they go to New Orleans, and recognize the different places, and understand the history of the city, from having seen Fright Krewe. People that are from New Orleans are so happy with the show, because they say, \"These guys, they really took the time to get it right and do it in a respectful way.\"\nThe season ends on quite an explosive note. I'm curious if you and James have future plans laid out for this show, or if you're just currently waiting for word from DreamWorks of whether to move ahead?\nEli Roth: Well, we would love to continue it. I'd love to continue it as a TV series, and a book series, and that's entirely in the hands of the viewers. You know how it works, there's a lot out there, there's a lot of content, and if we want this to become the next Scooby-Doo, or the next Goosebumps, it's really up to the public at this point. We feel like we've put our hearts and souls into this, everyone cares so much about it, all the voice talent, the writers, the animators, the incredible artists. Everybody loves this show so much, and hopefully that translates, and if the show catches fires with the public, then everybody would love to do more, but it's up to the public at this point.\nIt all started during detention in a graveyard when Soleil Le Clair, a girl who LIVES for horror, accidentally broke a spell on the Tree of Life and unleashed an ancient evil into this world. The spirit of Marie Laveau, voodoo queen of New Orleans, put her and four other kids in charge of saving the city from Belial, an ancient demon who feeds on fear. Luckily they're not alone — each kid gets a special gift from voodoo spirits called Loa. Super strength is given to Missy, Maybe gets the ability to disappear into the realm of the dead, Pat can understand any language or creature, Stanley gets knowledge about anything he touches, and Soleil can manipulate all four Earthly elements.\nThe ward they live in, the 13th and a Third, is known for fright tourism and Soleil's always loved all the scary legends about her creepy little ward. So she's beyond excited to find out the town's biggest secret — the vampires, rougarous, ghosts, monsters and demons are in fact very real. The creatures have been secretly living among humans for decades...but tensions between the rougarous and vampires have been high lately, and when Missy has to turn into a rougarou to survive a life-threatening injury, the kids can't help but get mixed up in all of it. Our Krewe will have to hone their powers, figure out what Belial's up to, keep the peace between vampires and the rougarous, AND figure out how to be a team because there's no way they'd all hang out otherwise. But going up against local legends like the Feu Follet, swamp monsters, and demon hounds from the underworld is kind of a weird bonding experience, and our Krewe will realize there's more to each other than they thought.\nFright Krewe is now available for streaming on Hulu and Peacock.\n"}

Based on George R. R. Martin's book series A Song of Ice and Fire, Game of Thrones is an epic fantasy show that follows a series of characters that include Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), and Jon Snow (Kit Harington) who are all involved in an epic war over who should become the ruler of Westeros. Unfortunately, the characters also have to prepare for an invasion from a group called the White Walkers, led by the Night King, who want to destroy the entire realm.\nThroughout the HBO series, Game of Thrones has had a number of strong side characters who played a vital part in the overall narrative, one being the character played by Hannah Waddingham. Waddingham is a prominent theater actress who has graced the stages of both London's West End and Broadway, but most know her for her Emmy-winning role as Rebecca Welton in Apple TV's Ted Lasso. However, even before Ted Lasso, Waddingham's Game of Thrones character became a huge pop culture phenomenon, especially for her iconic scene involving Cersei Lannister.\nFirst introduced in Game of Thrones season 5, Hannah Waddingham plays Septa Unella, a member of the Faith of the Seven clergy and one of the High Sparrow's (Jonathan Pryce) most loyal followers. However, Unella is more collectively known within popular culture as the \"Shame Nun\", which alludes to her famous scene in which she strips Cersei completely naked and then forces her to walk around King's Landing while ringing a bell and chanting \"shame\" for her crimes of committing adultery with Lancel, Cersei's cousin.\nHowever, Cersei ultimately gets her revenge because after destroying the Sept of Baelor and reclaiming her position as the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, she immediately imprisons Unella and torments her for all the pain she caused against Cersei. Cersei reminds Unella of the promise she gave to her about how her face would be the last thing the nun would see before Unella dies, and afterward, Cersei brings Ser Gregor \"The Mountain\" Clegane (Hafþór Júlíus \"Thor\" Björnsson) into her cell. Cersei leaves the room and smiles as she hears Unella's screams while the viewer is only left to imagine how The Mountain is torturing her.\nDespite Unella's grisly fate, Waddingham enjoyed playing the character, specifically because of Unella's drab appearance. Waddingham states, \"I'm not interested in looking dolly all the time, it needs to be whatever suits the character. I mean liked the fact that in Game of Thrones, I looked like I'd just been dug up, exhumed from somewhere\" (via CinemaBlend). Her role as Unella also highlights how talented of an actress Waddingham is as the dour, zealous nun is a completely different character from the more confident and fashionable Rebecca Walton she played in Ted Lasso. Waddingham even got to keep the shame bell after her time on Game of Thrones was over.\nTimothy Lee is a writer and avid movie/TV/anime fan who has been working at Screen Rant since 2023. Ever since he wrote his first film review for his college newspaper, he has been obsessed with the art of film criticism. Whether as a hired writer for small news organizations or on independent platforms like YouTube, Timothy is always happy to write about and express his love for all things pop culture.

Re-Po has a massive, formidable body, with a huge mouth full of jagged – though perhaps not jagged enough – teeth, and not one, but several tongues. What makes this monster truly nightmarish is the face within its face. Sprouting from the hellish being's forehead, connected by a sinewy, organic tether, is a ghoulish white, humanoid face. It's a striking image, one that is perfect for the comic book medium; it would be difficult to imagine Re-Po translating to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, when it feels more suited to a Clive Barker horror story.\nThe current arc will also continue the adventures of Rek-Rap, Marvel's demon Spider-Man, who has quickly become a fan-favorite. As the preview pages for Amazing Spider-Man #36 shared by Looper show, Rek-Rap is absolutely freaked out by Re-Po, seemingly even more so than Peter Parker, who seems more puzzled than anything during their initial encounter. However, the solicitations for Amazing Spider-Man #38 make clear that Re-Po will be a serious threat to Spider-Man and his demonic counterpart, asking, \"Can Spider-Man and Rek-Rep both survive the repulsive RE-PO?!\" The cover for issue #38 features the malevolent new nemesis, whom readers will become much more familiar with over the next several issues.\nPerhaps Re-Po belongs in the pages of Amazing Spider-Man, but it would be an unexpected surprise to see it ever enter the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The villain is one of the most horrifying Spider-Man has ever faced, with a terrifying design that more than conveys that magnitude of the threat Re-Po will pose to Spidey and Rek-Rep. Spider-Man's demon ally has quickly endeared himself to readers, meaning it is unlikely he will fall to Re-Po – but with Peter Parker edging closer to darkness lately at the same time, such a loss might be the unexpected tipping point which sends Spider-Man spiraling further into the dark.\nAmazing Spider-Man #36 will be available October 25, 2023 from Marvel Comics.\nSources: Looper; League of Comic Geeks\n"}

Anime can tell a broad range of stories, and the nature of animation allows anime to tackle just about every genre of fiction, from slice-of-life to sci-fi.

Of course, with more anime airing than ever before and heroes of ongoing tales constantly receiving power-ups, these debates can change from day to day. It may be impossible to say for sure who would win in a one-on-one fight, but the most powerful characters in anime can be ranked when they are at their strongest and most capable.\nOver the course of Tokyo Ghoul, Ken Kaneki goes from a timid bookworm to a figure of worship known as the One-Eyed King.

After transforming into a half-Ghoul and training his body, he’s able to destroy entire cities easily and command legions of monstrous beasts that can transform others into Ghouls. This makes him a borderline undefeatable fighter who only grows stronger with each injury he sustains.\nRelated: Tokyo Ghoul's Most Divisive Moment Returns in Creator's New Series\nAs the main hero of Bleach, Ichigo wields a diverse set of powers that come from just about every group seen in the series. His Soul Reaper abilities allow him to wield a spiritual weapon known as a Zanpakuto, while his Hollow abilities give him mastery over the dark energies of the monstrous Hollows. Ichigo even demonstrates some Quincy techniques, such as the Blut Vene which can protect him from attacks, and at one point was also capable of wielding Fullbring, a special type of spirit power that only a small percentage of humans (like Chad) can acquire. While Ichigo surely has far more abilities at his disposal than were ever seen on screen, his return in the Thousand-Year Blood War anime has given him another chance to show off.\nA character based on a legend like Dracula has to be able to deliver in the power department, and Alucard in Hellsing Ultimate does just that. Functionally immortal at the beginning of the series due to the number of souls inside of him, and then literally immortal by the end of it, Alucard cannot be ended. He has super strength, speed, and incredible durability, putting him far above the level of a mere human. He can manipulate and control blood as well, and has a plethora of other odd powers, like the ability to pass through walls. His dual pistols are also essentially cannons, and he is able to summon the souls of those he’s eaten to form an army of servants. As if those abilities aren’t enough, Alucard also has an army of demon dogs at the ready that can tear nearly any enemy it shreds in an extremely painful instant.\nThough dissociative identity disorder means Elfen Lied's \"Lucy\" has many voices that make up her character, Lucy tends to be the strongest of the bunch. It's Lucy who most often utilizes the character's numerous abilities. Lucy is both a deft fighter and a near-perfect marksman, but it's her telekinetic abilities that most often stand out. She makes use of psychic \"vectors,\" which act like invisible arms she can use to extend her reach and power. At her strongest, Lucy's vectors can be used to sink landmasses the size of small countries. She could, conceivably, destroy the whole world, securing her a rank among the strongest anime characters.\nJotaro Kujo is the main protagonist of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders. As a person, he’s as smart as he is tough and able to discern and counter the abilities of anyone who would challenge him. His stand ability, Star Platinum, is one of the most physically powerful Stands in the series, despite its short range. After going up against Dio, Jotaro also learned how to stop time for several seconds, allowing him to wail on enemies as they stand helpless. Those without Stands can't even see them, so Jotaro could easily defeat any character without a Stand, without so much as cluing them into what just happened.\nMuzan Kibutsuji is the progenitor of the Demons of Demon Slayer, who gained his own powers when experimented upon by a scientist with a rare blue spider lily over 1,000 years ago. Muzan is capable of turning others into demons and his blood will outright kill those who are incompatible with it. He can shape and mold his body to form weapons and is an absolutely vicious killer. Muzan's only weakness is sunlight; as a demon, he's unable to go out in the day, and he's spent most of his long life desperately searching for a cure for this one flaw. When in the dark, however, Muzan's ability to regenerate is nearly unlimited, and as a result, he's killed many, many demon slayers over the years.\nThe former chairman of the Hunter Association, Isaac Netero is one of the strongest martial artists in anime history. After subjecting himself to training that was supposed to end him, Netero gained incomprehensible speed and strength, able to throw punches faster than the speed of sound. His ultimate ability is the 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva, the manifestation of his Nen powers at a level that no other character in the series even comes close to matching. Even if he should somehow lose, though, he has a small nuclear bomb implanted in his chest that will obliterate whoever manages to end him and poison anyone who manages to survive the blast.\nAttack on Titan's protagonist Eren Yeager is a very powerful character who has the ability to transform into a 15-meter tall Titan with incredible regenerative abilities. However, the reason he ranks so highly among the strongest anime characters is because of his ability to command legions of Titans with the power of the Founding Titan. Using this ability, he can bring entire nations to ruin with a simple command that summons thousands of 50-meter tall Titans to action. Entire armies could not stand against this ability, and that makes Eren deserving of a spot as one of the most powerful characters in anime.\nMob Psycho 100's Shigeo Kageyama, more commonly known as Mob, is an ultra-powerful esper who can destroy anyone or anything with a simple thought. His powers are so intense that he has to shackle his emotions to keep them from running wild, meaning that he doesn't often put them to use. However, if he feels something too strongly or falls unconscious, his psychic powers come rushing to the surface. In his ???% state, Mob wields powers on par with large-scale natural disasters. Not only does the nature of his abilities make them impossible to guard against, but the strength behind them is also so great that even the strongest psychics in his world buckle beneath them. Mob is among the strongest anime psychics, though he isn't quite the strongest.\nThe big villain of My Hero Academia, All for One is a villain from the dawn of Quirks, who has used his personal power to gather Quirks that enhance his power and allow him to live indefinitely. Over the time since the dawn of Quirks, All for One has collected hundreds of different powers, ranging from physical attacks to radio wave emission to regeneration. All for One is also able to redistribute the Quirks he steals, allowing him to gain favor by providing underlings with new power. All for One's shrewd social manipulation is actually one of his most dangerous traits, and the reason why it's taken 9 generations of One for All users to even come close to bringing him down.\nGojo is continually touted as Jujutsu Kaisen's strongest sorcerer for good reason. While already incredibly smart and strong, what truly puts him over the edge are his cursed techniques Limitless and Infinity. With Limitless, Gojo can essentially control space, giving him incredible offensive and defensive capabilities. With Limitless, Gojo also has the technique Infinity which makes it so that any attack launched against him can only ever get infinitely close to him but never touch him in an astoundingly literal take on Zeno's Paradox. Gojo might not be impossible to defeat in Jujutsu Kaisen, but his raw power makes him one the series' strongest by a wide mile.\nGurren Lagann's Simon is a simple earthling who incorporates spiral power into the attacks of his giant mecha to devastating results. Commanding a mech so large it spans galaxies, Simon can create a drill with the ability to rip reality apart and destroy literally anything that stands in his way. With a nearly god-like command over life and the afterlife, as well as reality itself, this metaphysics-bending warrior is nearly unstoppable and can obliterate the universe itself if he chose to. Only beings with the ability to destroy entire universes could even hope to stand a chance against him.\nGiorno is the protagonist of Jojo's fifth part, Golden Wind, wielding a Stand ability that goes by the same name. Golden Wind allows him to invigorate both living things and inanimate objects with life energy, which can cause them to temporarily come to life or increase their power immensely. However, Giorno's true power isn't seen until the end of the series, wherein he's struck by the Stand Arrow and his Stand evolves, becoming Golden Wind Requiem. Golden Wind Requiem becomes a rare Stand capable of operating independently of its master and can cancel out actions taken against it, removing them from causality. Once struck by Golden Wind Requiem, a person is trapped in a state of reliving their death over and over again for all eternity--a chilling and terrifying power that no one would want to go up against.\nThe Legendary Super Saiyan himself, Broly canonically debuted in the Dragon Ball Super film of the same name and proved that he still lived up to his reputation from the '90s. Broly was so powerful that even Golden Frieza, Super Saiyan Blue Goku, and Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta were only barely enough to keep him busy. Goku and Vegeta had to fuse into Gogeta and use their Super Saiyan Blue abilities to defeat him, but even that wasn't enough to kill him. Broly was later seen training with Beerus on his homeworld in Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, suggesting that this Saiyan's power is only going to become greater with time.\nKoro-sensei is an \"alien\" who wields dozens of incredibly powerful tentacles, which make up the bulk of his body. Koro-sensei is unbelievably fast, able to zip across the world on his lunch break and dodge streams of bullets coming out of machine guns without breaking a sweat. Koro-sensei can only be killed by special \"anti-sensei\" material, which is harmless to ordinary humans even when made into weapons. Koro-sensei is also a master assassin, skilled in various forms of combat--an ability that comes in handy even without a humanoid body. And, while his stamina isn't limitless, it's incredibly high. If he weren't specifically training people to kill him, he'd be nigh unstoppable.\nGetting reincarnated as a slime was the best thing that ever happened to Rimuru Tempest, turning him from a lonely salaryman into a force to be reckoned with in his new fantasy world. Rimuru forged an alliance with a powerful dragon, who shared with him a large portion of his power. This allowed Rimuru to build a following by naming monsters, which granted them new powers, and in turn, allowed Rimuru to grab new powers as well. Rimuru receives guidance from the Great Sage, an AI-like being that offers advice and evaluates scenarios. Rimuru also possesses the incredible ability to take power from anything he devours, a fate that many a villain has fallen to. Rimuru doesn't just have physical power, though; he wields an impressive amount of political power as the leader of the monster kingdom.\nFew anime characters came to regret their incredible powers as much as Devilman Crybaby's Ryo. Though Akira's best friend spends much of the anime series behind the scenes plotting, it is eventually revealed that Ryo is actually Satan. As Satan Ryo commands a massive army of demons that wipe out all of humanity as well as the more powerful devilmen. No slouch in combat himself though, Ryo as Satan actually takes out the series' titular devilman, Akira in a tragic brawl that leaves the heroic devil cut in half. Ryo's misanthropy and raw power ended up costing him the only person he ever loved, making Devilman Crybaby's Satan one of the most tragic and powerful anime characters.\nFans often think of Naruto as the most powerful character in his anime, but even he can't defeat the series' ultimate villain on his own. Known as the Rabbit Goddess, Kaguya is one of the most powerful villains in the Naruto franchise, and may well be the most powerful woman in anime. Not originally from Earth, Kaguya travels to the planet in order to take the fruit of the God Tree. Her plan was to unite people by making them fear her, which is not hard when you can read minds, manipulate memories, travel through space, and control the elements. Once she partakes of the God Tree's fruit, she's also able to heal her own injuries, making her nearly indestructible. Kaguya's powers rank her as one of the strongest anime villains of all time.\nMonkey D. Luffy took a bite of Gum Gum and developed the power to stretch his body, at the cost of being able to swim. That might seem like a big downside for a pirate, but Luffy has made it seem like no big deal over the years. Luffy trained for ten years to master this power, and all that training paid off big time. Luffy's special transformations go from \"Gear 1\" to \"Gear 5,\" and each features a radically different way of using his rubbery nature to enhance his battle ability. Luffy is also a master of Haki, a means of utilizing spiritual power for both combat and non-combat purposes. Though these abilities might not seem so strong on the surface, Gear 5 gives Luffy the powers of a god as he warps reality into a cartoonish parody of itself. These abilities make Luffy one of the strongest shonen anime heroes of all time.\nTetsuo Shima, the de facto antagonist of Akira, awakens his immeasurable psychic powers after a collision with another psychic. His powers quickly grow in strength, and before long he runs the risk of obliterating the entire universe. Thankfully, before that can happen, he warps himself to a place outside of reality and the force of his psychic explosion gives birth to a whole new universe. Few other anime characters possess the ability to both create and destroy reality, and that’s what ranks Tetsuo among the strongest characters in the medium.\n"}
{"title": "Scarlet & Violet's Indigo Disk DLC May Have Pokémon's Easiest Villain", "date": "2023-10-02 19:02:27", "text": "The upcoming DLC for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, The Indigo Disk, seems set to have the least threatening villain character in the series’ history.\nIt seems that Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will have the franchise’s easiest villain for people to beat when the upcoming Indigo Disk DLC releases. Given both the ending of The Teal Mask and its gameplay, it is easy to predict how several aspects of The Indigo Disk will play out. One of these likely outcomes features a villain who appears to be doomed to be overcome with ease.\nIn recent Generations, the Pokémon games have seen some notable changes to the traditional formula surrounding their villains. Perhaps most notably, the Teams of the most recent games, Team Yell and Team Star, have nothing to do with their game’s respective villains. Instead of being evil organizations backing up one of Pokémon’s most terrifying villains, these groups are effectively an over-enthusiastic fan club and a student support network founded by bullying victims. Likewise, the main villains themselves are growing more independent and self-sufficient. The Pokémon Scarlet and Violet games are especially lacking in truly evil characters, but the new DLC aims to change this.\nRelated: Which Pokémon Evil Team Leader Is The Hardest\nThe ending of The Teal Mask does a lot to set Kieran up as an antagonistic force for The Indigo Disk. Shutting himself up in his room, he is seen becoming obsessed with his desire to grow stronger whilst ominous music plays. It’s uncertain what exactly Kieran will try to do after training himself, but assuming he now holds a grudge, he will likely become more aggressive towards the protagonist. However, unfortunately for Kieran, The Teal Mask has also demonstrated just how underwhelming he’ll probably be because the average player’s team is already too strong for him, and this isn't likely to change.\nRelated: Short & Sweet DLC - Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Teal Mask Review\nThe Teal Mask’s level scaling doesn’t really account for endgame teams, and there is no indication that The Indigo Disk will be much better in that regard. The Teal Mask content offers players Pokémon of differing levels to battle depending on whether The Way Home, the final part of Scarlet and Violet’s main story, has been completed. However, the Pokémon in The Teal Mask are easily beaten either way, a situation which extends to the teams of NPCs. Kieran himself, in his final battle against the protagonist, uses a team with levels mostly in the early 70s, the exception being his level 76 Gliscor.\nThe problem is that by the time people reach this point — as most will have already completed the base games before the DLC’s release — in all likelihood, their teams will be in the level 80s, if not even higher. It is worth noting that the toughest Tera Raid Battles encourage people to battle with the most powerful Pokémon they can at level 100. While Kieran will undoubtedly be stronger than he is at the end of The Teal Mask in The Indigo Disk, this disparity seems set to continue; as such, it is doubtful that his team will truly be able to compete with the protagonist.\nGiven his final levels in The Teal Mask, Kieran’s next team will probably be in the level 80s. As such, with the possible exception of story beats giving him a victory outside of regular battle, it seems that Kieran will be unable to pose much of a threat no matter what he tries to accomplish. This is unless he actually has a team at level 90 or above, but this seems unlikely. Such a team would undoubtedly make Kieran the most powerful NPC trainer in the Pokémon franchise, marking a dramatic change in how the franchise’s NPCs are usually designed.\nRelated: Scarlet & Violet: Nemona Is Pokémon’s Most Relatable Rival\nCurrently, Red’s Pikachu in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver is tied with Cynthia’s Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl Garchomp (on a second rematch) for the title of strongest NPC trainer’s Pokémon, at an incredible Level 88. For Kieran to outdo this record with not just his ace but his entire team would be a significant development in this regard. Although this would guarantee more of a challenge, it is important to remember just how easy it is to level up in Scarlet and Violet. EXP Candies are plentiful due to Pokémon Tera Raids, and The Teal Mask even provides an Exp. Charm to boost gains even further.\nOf course, it is important to note that the Pokémon games do offer battles against Pokémon up to level 100. In addition to the extremely difficult six and seven-star Tera Raid Battles, it has long been possible to face trainers with level 100 Pokémon in Battle Facilities. However, Battle Facilities typically represent a more generic challenge that scales in difficulty in response to a win streak. They do not form part of a Pokémon game’s plot like future battles with Kieran will (excluding optional post-game rematches), and so are less beholden to the standard design conventions, which ensure a gradual rise in difficulty throughout a game.\nAny battle with a significant NPC like Kieran must balance difficulty with accessibility so that people are not unfairly overwhelmed in battle. This effectively limits how strong Kieran can become to limit the amount of monotonous grinding required to progress through the DLC. On the other hand, introducing the BB League does mean that several other new trainers will also be faced during The Indigo Disk at a high difficulty level. These are trainers whom Kieran seems set to become stronger than in pursuit of his own goals, so there is still the potential for him to approach impressive heights for any trainer.\nThe Teal Mask sets up future content in various ways, from subtle hints to clear foreshadowing, and a rematch with Kieran is a clear example of this. Given that Kieran is already approaching Level 80 with his Gliscor, it is entirely possible that he will ultimately field a team on par with Red and Cynthia in The Indigo Disk. Nevertheless, given the time provided by the delay between Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s initial release and that of the DLC, as well as the already plentiful opportunities to grow stronger, it is clear that most will have already outstripped him once again by the time this fateful rematch actually takes place.\nSource: Nintendo of America/YouTube\n"}
{"title": "Why The Incredibles Broke Pixar’s Most Iconic Easter Egg Tradition", "date": "2023-10-02 19:11:27", "text": "The Incredibles is unlike every other Pixar movie beyond its use of superheroes as it's the only film to not include a Pizza Planet truck Easter egg.\nPixar's animated movies are known for including some fun Easter eggs, but The Incredibles broke the studio's most iconic tradition. The iconic animated studio has a habit of including Easter eggs referring to its own movies or other parts of Pixar's or Hollywood's history. These range from the popular references to A113 and connections to other Pixar movies, with the Pizza Planet truck - which originated in the studio's first movie Toy Story - among the most popular. This even led to the popular theory that there is a Pixar Shared Universe in which all the movies exist.\nAfter Toy Story debuted the Pizza Planet truck, Pixar turned the yellow delivery vehicle into one of the studio's most popular Easter eggs. It was briefly seen in their next film, A Bug's Life, and returned in Toy Story 2. The Pizza Planet truck Easter eggs have varied throughout the years, but it is still an aspect that Pixar fanatics keep an eye out for with each movie. The newest Pixar movies like Luca, Turning Red, and Elemental included the Pizza Planet truck Easter egg. The overall popularity of this reference to Pixar's past makes it even more surprising that the iconic truck is not in The Incredibles at all.\nRelated: All 27 Pixar Movies Ranked From Worst To Best\nThe lack of a Pizza Planet truck Easter egg in The Incredibles is surprising considering every other Pixar movie has managed to include it in some capacity. However, director Brad Bird has commented somewhat on the lack of a reference. Over a decade after the movie's release, The Huffington Post asked Brad Bird whether The Incredibles secretly had a Pizza Planet truck Easter egg. He admitted he had no idea because \"I was busy making the movie. I didn’t think about the Pizza Planet.\" Bird did admit that it is possible that someone else from the animated team at Pixar included the reference, but he doesn't know about it.\nThere were plenty of opportunities for the Pizza Planet truck to appear too. Since The Incredibles takes place in the 1960s, a retro version of the delivery vehicle could have been featured. The city settings included a number of other cars, so a Pizza Planet truck easily would have fit. Fans have speculated that several yellow cars could be associated with Pizza Planet, but the spaceship topper isn't visible. There is also a theory that since The Incredibles takes place in the 1960s that Pizza Planet does not yet exist, so no delivery truck could be included.\nSomewhat miraculously, The Incredibles remains the only Pixar movie without the Pizza Planet truck appearing in some form. The 2004 animated movie broke the trend for Pixar, but all future movies from the studio made sure to include it. The new 19-year streak of Pizza Planet truck Easter eggs began with Cars in 2006 and continues all the way through Elemental's release in 2023. That makes 21 consecutive Pixar movies to include the iconic truck, and 26 out of 27 movies overall. This includes it appearing among Incredibles 2's Easter eggs, so the family arcade does exist in this universe, even if The Incredibles doesn't reference it.\nSource: The Huffington Post\n"}

While each Power Rangers season since the end of the Zordon Era has been mostly standalone, there is still a strong level of interconnectivity in the franchise. Even Dino Charge and Dino Super Charge, both of which take place in a different timeline from most Power Rangers TV shows, have been part of crossovers in the last few years. This includes Cosmic Fury, which featured three generations of Dino Rangers.\nThe Power Rangers Cosmic Fury cast included David Yost as Mighty Morphin’s Blue Ranger Billy, who fought alongside the former Dino Fury Rangers for most of the season. Heckyl’s return in Cosmic Fury made it into a crossover involving the Mighty Morphin, Dino Charge, and Dino Fury lores. In addition to being a fun crossover, Heckyl’s role in Cosmic Fury delivered on a seven-year-old Power Rangers tease – the debut of Dino Charge’s Dark Ranger.\nPower Rangers Dino Charge’s Dark Ranger never actually appeared on the show, even though Heckyl was clearly meant to become a Power Ranger. Heckyl is one of many Power Rangers villains who were later redeemed, which is something the character even acknowledges and jokes about in Cosmic Fury. Heckyl’s “classic redemption arc” in Dino Super Charge was not surprising considering that the character was not originally evil. Heckyl was the guardian of the Dark Energem from Sentai-6, but after the planet was invaded, he accidentally touched the artifact. Dino Charge’s Heckyl was given the power of the Dark Energem, but an evil alter ego was created in the process.\nRelated: Which Super Sentai Show Power Rangers Cosmic Fury’s Zords & Costumes Are Based On\nHeckyl’s Super Sentai counterpart becomes a Ranger in Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger: Gaburincho of Musicmovie, a film set in the same continuity as the Kyoryuger show. However, due to character rights issues, Power Rangers could not use the Deathryuger design in the TV show. This is why Dino Charge’s Dark Ranger, a character viewers dreamed of seeing in Power Rangers, was not in the show. However, whatever prevented Power Rangers from using the Deathryuger design was handled, and the Dark Ranger finally debuted in Power Rangers Cosmic Fury. Dino Charge’s Dark Ranger also appeared in the BOOM! Power Rangers comics, which are set in a different continuity entirely.\nHeckyl momentarily became the Blue Solar Ranger in the Power Rangers Beyond The Grid comic books, during which the Death Ranger design first appeared in a piece of Power Rangers media. The Power Rangers comics revealed that Heckyl returned to his homeworld to protect the Dark Energer but continued to struggle with its evil influence. While the Dark Ranger’s origin story in the comics was quite interesting and brought Heckyl’s Dino Charge story full circle, it cannot be assumed that those same events happened in the Power Rangers TV show chronology.\nPower Rangers Cosmic Fury’s Heckyl role was surprising, especially because Power Rangers Dino Charge takes place in an alternate universe from the main timeline. Cosmic Fury acknowledged that Heckyl was from another universe but did not get into detail as to how or why the Dark Ranger had come to this dimension. Regardless, Cosmic Fury’s Dark Ranger was an essential part of the Power Rangers’ plan to save Earth from an alien invasion led by Lord Zedd and his allies. Heckyl was Terrick’s spy inside Lord Zedd’s ship and became Squillia’s crush before revealing his true identity. Almost seven years after Dino Charge’s finale, Heckyl morphed into the Dark Ranger.\nRelated: Power Rangers Cosmic Fury’s Ending Explained: Is It The Last Power Ranger Season?\nThe Dark Ranger was supplying Terrick and the Resistance with information on Lord Zedd, but he was eventually captured. After the Power Rangers freed Heckyl and the others, the Dark Ranger briefly joined the Cosmic Fury team in one of the coolest Power Rangers battles in years. Heckyl’s Dark Ranger Morpher was unique compared to the ones from the Dino Charge Rangers, and his transformation sequence began with the “Unleash the power” battle cry. After fighting side by side with the Cosmic Fury Rangers and Mighty Morphin Blue Ranger Billy Cranston in episode 7, Heckyl continued to help the Resistance offscreen.\nRyan Carter plays Heckyl in Power Rangers Cosmic Fury. Heckyl first appears in episode 6 as the spy inside Lord Zedd’s base before morphing into the Dark Ranger in Power Rangers Cosmic Fury episode 7. Ryan Carter originally played Heckyl in Power Rangers Dino Charge, having appeared in the final episode of the season. Carter would reprise his role as Heckyl in Power Rangers Dino Super Charge, which explored the character’s origins and his secret, evil form. Snide, Heckyl’s evil counterpart in Dino Charge, was voiced by a different actor, Campbell Cooley.\n"}

This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 7.\nIvanna Sahkno's Shin Hati has quickly become a favorite among viewers of Ahsoka, especially as the dark Jedi apprentice of Ray Stevenson's Baylan Skoll. The duo has been shrouded in mystery since their orange lightsabers first appeared in the earliest previews of the Star Wars Disney+ TV show, and with each new episode, more about them has unraveled - especially for Shin. As someone craving the power only a high rank from Grand Admiral Thrawn could promise, Shin's desires have strayed from her master's, and now she's set on her own path. Shin's story has piqued the interest of many viewers, and for some, it's inspired some incredible creations.\nOne of these creations is a cosplay by Lucy of striking similarity to Shin, as captured by Tom Roberts. Lucy dons an incredibly faithful recreation of Shin's full outfit, including her silver pieces of armor.\nLucy invokes the energy of Sahkno as Shin in this photo, especially with the far-away glance of the potential of her future. From her hair to her boots, Lucy brings Shin's dark Jedi look of conflict to life with this cosplay.\nWith only the finale of Ahsoka season 1 remaining, Shin has one chance left to find redemption before the story's conclusion. Ahsoka has now offered that path to her, but whether Shin takes it or not is still left to be seen. It certainly seems as if she may take this route based on the abandonment of her master and her chemistry with Natasha Liu Bordizzo's Sabine, but with limited storytelling space remaining and plenty of loose threads left to tie up, it could be that Shin's redemption has to wait until season 2.\nRelated: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nShin is a character that should remain in the future of Star Wars stories. She's become one of the series' most interesting characters, and now that she seems to desire being at Thrawn's side, she could function as an important Force-sensitive adversary in the greater conflict Thrawn's return promises the galaxy. Should Shin take the path of redemption, then she could also become a key part of Luke's new Jedi Order, or at least join the effort to stop Thrawn. Either way, Shin has brought a lot of interest to Ahsoka, and hopefully her story will get to continue on in both galaxies.\nAhsoka releases new episodes Tuesdays at 6 pm PT / 9 pm ET on Disney+.\nSource: Tom Roberts\n"}
{"title": "10 Harsh Realities About The DCEU’s Ending", "date": "2023-10-02 19:30:29", "text": "The DCEU is finally coming to an end with the release of 2023's Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, but the franchise's final days haven't been positive.\nThe DC Extended Universe might be coming to an end, but the franchise's final days have caused huge division and created several problems for the upcoming reboot, the DC Universe. Warner Bros. kicked off the DCEU with the 2013 release of Man of Steel and quickly thrust their superhero franchise into overdrive, adapting the stories of some of DC Comics' most popular characters into live-action. Since its beginnings, however, the DCEU has always been polarizing, with the work of individual directors tending to be praised rather than the franchise's overarching storyline, visual effects, scripts, and even performances from several of the franchise's core cast.\nThis division, and the 2022 merger between Warner Bros. and Discovery Inc., led to a lengthy period of turmoil, with DC Films being replaced with DC Studios, with filmmaker James Gunn and producer Peter Safran hired as co-CEOs. Both Gunn and Safran have delivered strong superhero movies, so immediately set into motion a plan to reboot the DCEU, allowing the mistakes of the past to be glossed over with new stories. While the DC Universe is kicking off in 2024 with Creature Commandos and Waller, and with 2025's Superman: Legacy, the DCEU still needs to deliver its final project, though the faltering franchise has left a lot to be desired.\nThe DCEU will officially conclude on December 20, 2023, with the release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. While 2018's Aquaman became a smash hit, grossing over $1 billion at the box office, predictions aren't as high for the sequel despite the majority of the primary cast returning. There has been confusion surrounding why Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is the final DCEU film before the reboot, with many considering The Flash a better closing narrative before the DC Universe.\nXolo Maridueña will reprise his role of Jaime Reyes from 2023's Blue Beetle in the DC Universe, but despite being positively received, his DCEU debut still became a box office bomb due to its release date. Blue Beetle was released after several disappointing DC projects, and it may have been hard for audiences to get excited about a story in a soon-to-close shared universe. Had Blue Beetle been released a couple of years earlier or waited to debut as an official part of the new DC Universe, it almost assuredly would have fared better.\nBlue Beetle's disappointing turnout was a symptom of a greater issue with the DCEU's recent releases. The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the performance of Wonder Woman 1984 and Gunn's own The Suicide Squad, but its successors didn't fare any better and have acted as the final nail in the DCEU's coffin. 2022's Black Adam and Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash in 2023 were all met with mixed-to-negative responses and only grossed $797.4 million collectively - a number several solo superhero movies have surpassed their own.\nIn the lead-up to The Flash's release, the film was billed to be resetting the DCEU, using DC Comics' Flashpoint storyline as inspiration, seemingly gifting the DC Universe the perfect jumping-off point. However, this failed to come to fruition. The Flash's DC franchise reset involving George Clooney's Bruce Wayne made no sense, it's timeline and storyline were confusing, and the film's poor visual effects and script quality didn't do it any favors. DC Studios had the perfect opportunity to set the stage for a major reshuffle in their live-action franchise with The Flash, but completely fumbled it, leading to more confusion.\nThe DCEU has left many unanswered questions in almost every project, and with the franchise now coming to an end, these loose ends will never be resolved. Part of the magic of a shared franchise is that each project can set up something for the future, but the DCEU's constantly-changing plans and confusing timelines mean that too many storylines were set up. Viewers will never know what happened to Robin, what Bruce Wayne's Knightmare visions would have culminated in, what happened when Superman met Black Adam, or whether Shazam joined the Justice Society.\nRebooting the DCEU seems like the easy way to avoid past mistakes leaking into the new DC Universe, as history could repeat itself once David Corenswet brings a different version of Clark Kent to life in the DCU's Superman: Legacy. However, after a lengthy period of DC releasing disappointing projects, the future won't only entail focusing on a reboot but also trying to rebuild audience trust in the franchise. Many have become apathetic towards the DCEU, as proven by the turnout to Blue Beetle, The Flash, and Shazam! Fury of the Gods, so Gunn and Safran must try and build a strong foundation to reignite desire in the new franchise.\nPerhaps one of the key elements that led to the downfall of the DCEU was that Warner Bros. was in constant competition with Marvel Studios' more successful Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starting with 2008's Iron Man, the MCU now comprises over forty projects across film, TV, and animation. In only a decade, DC released 14 feature films (including Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom) and one TV series, paling in comparison. Jumping too fast into crossover stories meant that individual characters never saw the development they needed, and this was proven by 2023's Blue Beetle, which was more positively received thanks to its overt separation from the wider world of the DCEU.\nAs well as leaving many loose ends and producing several disappointing installments, the DCEU also missed several perfect opportunities to make itself stronger. For instance, Henry Cavill's Superman was wasted, despite many calling for a direct sequel to 2013's Man of Steel, and Ben Affleck's Batman never got the development he deserved, missing out on a much-needed solo project. Perhaps the franchise would have been more popular had Zack Snyder been able to complete his planned Justice League storyline, but even this can't be known for sure. Too many stories and developmental moments slipped through the net, leading to the poor projects that have been released more recently.\nDespite rebooting the DCEU into the new DC Universe, Gunn and Safran have confirmed several DCEU characters who will return in the DCU. While it will surely be great to see John Cena's Peacemaker, Viola Davis' Amanda Waller, Xolo Maridueña's Blue Beetle, and others returning, the fact that some actors will continue to play their roles while others are being recast has led to confusion among DC's audiences. Gunn has stressed that the DC Universe's first projects will mark a new canon, suggesting the entire DCEU will be forgotten, so actors will be playing new versions of the same characters, but this may be difficult for DC fans to comprehend.\nIt has also become evident that the DCEU has wasted some of DC Comics' most popular properties. Henry Cavill's Superman was insignificant in the DCEU, and Ben Affleck's Batman was underdeveloped and never got his solo movie. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman was one of the DCEU's most popular projects, but her cameos in Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash were disappointing. While the DC Extended Universe may have treated its most prized characters in a disappointing fashion, the new DC Universe will hopefully do them justice.\n"}

The FOX animated series Krapopolis has its two-episode premiere on September 24, 2023, kicking off the exciting new series. The show was already renewed for seasons 2 and 3 well before season 1 was even finished, meaning that Krapopolis has a bright future ahead of it.\nPete Michels is the supervising director on Krapopolis, with him having previously worked on immensely popular shows like The Simpsons and Family Guy. Andy Ristaino is the lead character designer on Krapopolis, with him having previously worked on fantastic animated series like Adventure Time and the DuckTales reboot. Both Krapopolis crew members attended SCAD AnimationFest 2023, promoting the series by premiering episode 3 early as well as hosting a Q&A panel.\nRelated:Why Dan Harmon's Krapopolis Was Renewed For 3 Seasons Before Its Debut\nScreen Rant sat down with supervising director Pete Michels and lead character designer Andy Ristaino at SCAD AnimationFest 2023 in order to talk about Krapopolis. Michels and Ristaino were able to shed some light on the creation of Krapopolis, the influence of other Dan Harmson shows, and the future of the series.\nScreen Rant: One of the biggest names attached to Krapopolis is Dan Harmon. How did his work on shows like Rick and Morty and the expectation of that kind of content influenced the creation of Krapopolis?\nAndy Ristaino: I feel like that might be more for me. I worked in character design right from the beginning, and one of their main directors was ‘make sure it doesn't look like Rick and Morty.’ That is kind of how it influenced it. So yeah, we went in a different direction, and a little more realistic and a little less cartoony, basically.\nSo part of the art style obviously is the time period. Were there any challenges that came with adapting this specific time period and mythos to the world of an adult animated show?\nAndy Ristaino: Sure. I mean, I feel like it's all like a lot of costume research and time period research and trying to remember what fruits are available.\nPete Michels: We didn't have pumpkins or coffee. Well, we kind of had coffee I guess, but yeah. Also, I think some of the technology was a challenge too. So Dan's all about making sure that the gadgets and things that they create works, like with Rick and Morty, because I worked on Rick and Morty with Dan, and he wanted to make sure anything that Rick would invent could at least look like it could actually work. And the same with everything we do. But we're limited to Bronze Age technologies. So they have, bronze and they have tin and they have leather and wood and rocks, and you know, sheep stomachs.\nAndy Ristaino: So how do you build a flamethrower out of that?\nSo was the historical research a huge part of trying to make things work, or was it just trying to make things believable and cheating things if you felt like it was better for the story?\nAndy Ristaino: I feel like in the beginning there was a lot more historical research than there is now.\nPete Michels: Yeah, well, in design, we didn't do a lot of like, even background is I think a lot of the murals you see on the walls in the palace or the temple. A lot of those are based on Messinian and Minoan actual archeology that we've researched. A lot of our prop designers do. When we give them a challenge, they'll do a lot of the research and look up what something might have looked like or what the technology available was.\nAndy Ristaino: But also the show takes place in that time period before Greek civilization was really established. So we've got a little wiggle room to make stuff up.\nPete Michels: And one of the rules of the show is that they have not yet invented written language. So we can't do any sign gags. It makes it a little challenge. Like, well, we have to somehow identify this building as like a medical office or something. Well how do you do that without saying ‘doctor's office.’\nAnother big aspect of the show is the star-studded cast. So how much of a factor did the stars play in the characters that they were voicing when it comes to the designs and the writing and personality and stuff like that?\nAndy Ristaino: I feel like definitely the characters changed. If they were like, ‘we're trying to cast this person,’ but it fell through, the design would change to match the voice actor. And we do a lot of things where we try to match, like, the ethnicity and stuff to the voice actor. And I feel like that's the main thing.\nPete Michels: And there's also a lot of personality that an actor will bring to the character, and that needs to be reflected in the design too. So if an actor is cast, and it doesn't quite sound like that voice came out of that person than we’ll redesign it.\nAndy Ristaino: Deliria needed to be kind of elegant and look kind of intimidating.\nPete Michels: And the word elegant is key there too. Because even the posing and the boards, you try to get her a little bit more regal there and a little bit more confident. She's really super self-confident.\nWhat skill sets and aspects of previous shows that you've worked on do you think really helped you in developing Krapopolis, and what unique challenges did you face when working on the show?\nPete Michels: I think the most important skill set for working in anything in animation is the drawing. You have to be able to draw. I’ve worked with Dan Harmon before on Rick and Morty, so I kind of knew his sensibilities, what he liked and didn't like. My background is mostly primetime adult animation. So The Simpsons, Family Guy, and Rick and Morty. So I think it's that [there are] certain sensibilities that are in adult animation. Characters don't do cartoony poses, for instance, they don't close their eyes for a long time, or they don't bounce and stretch too much. So making it more like humans in a sitcom, that was kind of a big, big thing to bring to it.\nAndy Ristaino: And I think Pete your were a good bridge to that world for us when we're starting to develop the show, because I feel like when you came on the show things really solidified. I feel like there's this realism and primetime sensibility that really sort of solidified when you started working on the show.\nPete Michels: Yeah, and even background-wise you know, just where to put the horizon line where to put the camera to make it like you're watching a live television show that's actually been shot with cameras and live actors.\nKrapopolis seasons two and three have already been green lit, which is awesome. So where are you both hoping to take the show in the future? And are there any details you can give us about what you have in store for the next two seasons?\nPete Michels: They do meet a lot of new characters in the upcoming seasons and a lot of new locations also.\nAndy Ristaino: Go to a lot of cool places. We visit more gods and stuff.\nPete Michels: A lot more gods. I think you’ve designed like 120 gods or something.\nAndy Ristaino: Yeah, I’ve designed a lot of gods and a lot of creatures and mythological creatures and things that were never mentioned.\nPete Michels: Yeah, and I think those are the fun things too because we do not just the gods and goddesses and the humans, but there's also monsters. [There are] a lot of interesting monsters that animation lends itself to that were just really fun to do and fun to draw.\nSet in mythical ancient Greece, Krapopolis tells the story of a dysfunctional family of humans, gods and monsters trying to run one of the world’s first cities, while also trying their best to not kill each other in the process. The series features the voices of Emmy Award-winner Hannah Waddingham (Ted Lasso, Game of Thrones), Richard Ayoade (The IT Crowd), Matt Berry (What We Do in The Shadows), Pam Murphy (Mapleworth Murders) and Duncan Trussell (The Midnight Gospel).\nNew episodes of Krapopolis release Sundays on FOX.\nRobert Pitman is a Movies/TV features writer for ScreenRant and loves all things nerdy.

The revelations of the character's Inhuman heritage, alongside her death and resurrection as a mutant, has made Kamala Khan a perfect conduit for stories about identity.\nMs. Marvel: The New Mutant #2 – written by Iman Vellani and Sabir Pirzada, with art by Carlos Gomez and Adam Gorham – places great emphasis on how deeply being a mutant has become tied to Kamala's identity.\nTaking a moment of solace with Marvel's newest married couple, Iron Man and Emma Frost, Kamala reflects on herself as, \"walking proof that we can all coexist.\"\nRelated: MCU's Iman Vellani Reveals New Ms. Marvel Comic Came to Her in a Dream\nDespite the immense controversy it sparked, Marvel continues to commit to the decision to incorporate the mutant gene into Kamala Khan's DNA, alongside her Inhuman roots, while making the newest X-Men member. Among all these changes, Kamala tries to adjust to the public perception of Ms. Marvel souring upon her reveal as a mutant, at a time when mutant-human relations are at an all-time low. In Ms. Marvel: The New Mutant #2, after saving her from an Orchis attack, Tony Stark brings Kamala Khan to meet with his new bride, Emma Frost. During the exchange that follows, Kamala effectively states why she is so critical to the contemporary Marvel Universe.\nEmma Frost cautions the young hero, suggesting that waving her newfound mutant flag proudly is dangerous. This fires Kamala up, leading her to wonders if she didn't go public enough, convinced that she's living proof that people from differing backgrounds should be able to live freely in the same space. \"I'm a Pakistani-American-Inhu-Mutant,\" she shouts proudly. \"I'm literally walking proof that we can all coexist!\" Although Frost quickly shuts down Kamala's idealism, her rant goes a long way in highlighting how becoming a mutant has added to her character. Kamala's story, at its core, has always been about her learning to become comfortable in her own skin.\nEarly in Ms. Marvel's original debut origin run, from G. Willow Wilson, Kamala would take the form of a white woman – specifically Carol Danvers, the previous Ms. Marvel – because, as she put it in Ms. Marvel #3, she didn't think anyone would want to see \"a sixteen-year-old brown girl with a 9 PM curfew\" as a superhero. Subsequently, her stories have always had the core theme of identity, with Kamala growing comfortable with herself over time. Who Kamala is today is someone who would rather change the minds of others than accept discrimination. Being a mutant is just another addition to the identity of an already multi-faceted character.\nWhen the decision to make Kamala a mutant was first announced, there was a concern that the character was being pulled into too many directions; traditionally, however the character has always represented a lot. The mutant metaphor is just another means for writers to give readers a more realistic depiction of a person of color navigating through America. The mutant identity is another way to amplify the more realistic narrative of Muslim identity, as well as the complexities behind Kamala's larger identity. Just as the Ms. Marvel name has belonged to multiple people in the past, Kamala Khan herself consists of multiple identities, all of which encompass who she is and how she approaches life.\nJoe Anthony Myrick (or JAM) is a comics writer who specializes in, of course, covering the big figureheads of the industry (Marvel and DC), as well as lesser-known indy parties and some personal favorites like BOOM!

{"title": "Wes Anderson's Poison: How Venomous The Krait Snake Really Is", "date": "2023-10-02 19:33:24", "text": "A deadly krait snake is at the heart of Wes Anderson's film Poison, but how big a threat would it actually pose to Benedict Cumberbatch's Harry?\nIn Wes Anderson's short movie Poison, Benedict Cumberbatch finds himself in hot water due to a venomous krait snake coiled on his stomach ― but it's unclear if the venomous reptile really spells a death sentence. Poison is the final Dahl adaptation in Wes Anderson's short Netflix film series, and the others in the series featured Dahl's characteristic dramatic claims, both fanciful and nasty; for instance, licorice being made out of rats' blood in The Rat Catcher. While Anderson's Poison features a real type of snake, its danger might not match reality.\nCumberbatch's Poison character Harry Pope, a British man in colonial India, begins the movie trapped in bed, telling his friend Woods (Dev Patel) he has been lying entirely still for \"hours and hours\" so as not to wake the krait asleep on him. Woods is immediately alarmed, jumping backward, and rescuer Dr. Ganderbai (Ben Kingsley) also sees the situation as very grave, even confessing the snake bite serum he has might not save Harry's life. It's clear in the extreme tension between the men, and particularly in Harry's sweaty state of panic, that in the movie kraits are notorious for being extremely dangerous.\nPoison's Harry, Woods, and Ganderbai are right to be worried. Krait bites kill an estimated 70-80% of untreated victims in Bangladesh, the now-independent nation where Anderson's movie is hinted to be set thanks to the trademark jute crops on screen. Kraits live in rural Asia and can bite when startled or threatened. In Bangladesh, the common krait is \"responsible for more than half of all snakebite deaths,\" reports the journal Toxicon: X in the National Library of Medicine. It continues that victims experience pain and paralysis, with death occurring between four and eight hours after the bite:\nSnake biting is a major public health concern in Bangladesh... The common krait (B. caeruleus) is one of the 'big four' snake's species and it has been responsible for one of the most human deaths and injuries from snakebites in Bangladesh and India. Typically, victims report acute stomach pains that worsen over time, followed by gradual paralysis.\nThe Wes Anderson movie's description of kraits is fairly accurate, then. Dr. Ganderbai warns his serum might not save Harry, and antivenom has limited effect in reality, too ― though this is more because it is often administered much too late, owing to victims in rural areas being without easy hospital access. The journal warns that once paralysis has set in, the situation is \"catastrophic\" no matter the treatment. It makes sense that Dahl would know to take kraits' danger seriously, as he trained as a World War II fighter pilot in Iraq, which borders Iran, one of the nations where the snakes live.\nWhile krait snakes really are very dangerous, Poison's ending focuses on another kind of venom altogether. The reptile, whether it was ever really there or wholly imagined, is not the real source of the Netflix film's titular poison. That's actually Harry himself, with the film's toxicity embedded in his racism, attitude of superiority, and interactions with Dr. Ganderbai. Harry keeps his racism coiled like the creature he thinks is on his stomach, acting irritable and dismissive but under control, until a moment of tension so unbearable that it springs out of him — with a snake-like rattling even heard on screen.\nHarry's racist tirade against Ganderbai is not only a betrayal, but also shows viewers that the anxious tension that infuses the men's interactions throughout the short movie isn't merely around the snake, but about power. Harry feels \"superior\" to Ganderbai but is suddenly not in control, trapped in bed and feeling threatened and cornered. The unseen snake is a phantom that haunts the men's interactions, like the racial dynamics of colonial India. Woods apologizes to Ganderbai at the end of the Wes Anderson film on Harry's behalf — but both he and Ganderbai know many more snakes are lying in wait to spring at them.\nSource: Toxicon: X\nJen is a British journalist who moved to Canada, mostly for the poutine.

{"title": "Inception Star Reflects On Wild First Day On Set With Practical Effects Rig", "date": "2023-10-02 19:39:04", "text": "Cillian Murphy reflects on his wild first day on the set of Inception, which included a scene with Leonardo DiCaprio and a big practical effects rig.\nInception star Cillian Murphy reflects on his exciting first day on the set of the Christopher Nolan film, which included a massive practical effects rig. Released in 2010, Nolan's mind-bending thriller stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb, a thief who uses dream-sharing technology to undertake a mission that will finally reunite him with his children. Murphy stars in the movie as Robert Fischer, Cobb's target, with the project serving as the third time Murphy and Nolan have collaborated.\nIn a recent interview with BBC Radio 1, Murphy takes a look back at the big movies of his career, reflecting on one memorable Inception filming experience.\nAs the actor recalls, he filmed one of his most involved and important scenes on the first day, which included a tilting set. Check out Murphy's full comment below:\n\n“I remember that day was my first day on set. It was this big scene with Leo, biggest movie star in the world, someone I have huge admiration for. I walked on and that whole bar had been built on a huge gimbal in order to get the effect of the glass tilting. The whole thing, this huge set, just went like that [tilts hands]. And there were all these stuntmen. I knew I was making a serious movie there.”\n\n“I remember that day was my first day on set.

And there were all these stuntmen. I knew I was making a serious movie there.”\nRelatively early on his career, Nolan became known as a filmmaker who highly valued practical effects and a more old-school style of filmmaking. The director's love of practical action is on clear display in his Dark Knight trilogy, and has only become more legendary with each passing film. Oppenheimer, his latest release, even recreates a nuclear explosion with no CGI, with practical elements layered with VFX to create the blast.\nNolan takes this same approach with Inception, with much of the film's action standing the test of time because of the more old-school way in which it was captured. While certain sequences in the film do rely on VFX, many are impressively real, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's hallway fight, for example, being filmed inside a constructed hallway that could rotate 360 degrees.\nThe practical action in the movie compliments a genuinely novel idea, with the notion of a dream heist being something that is truly original. That's not to mention the fact that Inception's ending scene is deliciously ambiguous, generating conversations and theories that persist to this day. While Inception has ebbed and flowed in terms of its position in Nolan's larger filmography, the film remains a testament to the director's vision and talent, and Murphy's latest recollection further speaks to the impact the filmmaker's approach has on the actors involved.\nSource: BBC Radio 1/ YouTube\n"}

So far, Gen V is doing a great job of expanding The Boys universe. However, it may also prove that the main show's heroes aren't as heroic as they seem. While it's pretty obvious that the actions of Billy Butcher and even Hughie fall into morally gray territory, they're still portrayed as the good guys trying to take down Vought International and Homelander.\nIn their efforts to rid the world of Supe corruption, the main group that goes by \"The Boys\" manages to kill the likes of Translucent and even unravel The Seven. Taking on Homelander is a task too difficult, even with the help of Compound V, but they do succeed in exposing his true colors to the public. Their methods aren't always ethical, even if The Boys are usually trying to do the right thing. And Gen V doesn't necessarily suggest otherwise. However, it shows the fallout of the group exposing how Compound V works, and it's pretty catastrophic for Gen V's young Supes.\nIn The Boys season 2, Hughie and Starlight manage to leak Compound V to the press, letting the whole world know how it works. Their revelation is made much darker through the lens of Gen V. In The Boys, exposing Vought's secret about how Supes are made is seen as a huge victory. The team gives away Vought's biggest secret: that their Supes' abilities come from this chemical. The company works with parents to give the serum to children. The Boys' Gen V spinoff shows how kids react to their parents allowing them to be injected — and it has a detrimental effect on some of them.\nRELATED: Gen V's Surprise The Boys Cameo Secretly Confirms A Major Hughie Theory\nGen V's Godolkin University grants aspiring Supes the chance to perfect their powers, but despite its tagline, it's not a safe place to do so. The Godolkin Dean reveals there were barely any suicides after the Hughie and Starlight's revelation, disregarding the few that occurred as nothing serious. While this may not be a big deal to the Dean, the leak was clearly so traumatic to some students that they took their own lives. Golden Boy's brother, Sam, also struggles with this now-public secret, which may have contributed to him ending up in the Woods. Revealing the truth about Compound V may have hurt Vought, but it also hurt kids.\nHughie and Starlight make the decision to expose the secret of Compound V in The Boys, but it arguably isn't their place to do so. It's important for people to know the truth, as it shows that Vought is exploiting children to have them become heroes. However, it also reveals that parents consented to this. Making this public knowledge was always going to have consequences. When all the Supe kids learn that their parents lied to them, they deal with emotional trauma. The degree of this is explored in Gen V, which starts to paint Hughie and The Boys as villains.\nRELATED: The Boys Season 3 Finally Resolved 1 Annoying Hughie Storyline\nFor some people, knowing the truth may be a good thing, but for others, it completely destroys their lives. Sam is the most obvious example of this. Given how much Starlight resents her own mother after finding out the truth, she perhaps should have taken more caution before going public. Starlight's reaction to Hughie taking Compound V also makes them grow further apart and damages their relationship, showing the impact the drug has even among The Boys.\nThe Boys never shies away from showing the consequences of the characters' actions. One of the most notorious examples is Supersonic's death. Starlight warns him about Homelander's true nature and even tries to get the other Supe involved in taking down The Seven's lead. To teach Starlight a lesson, Homelander delivers Supersonic a brutal death. This incident makes it clear that The Boys won't let even its most heroic characters off the hook. Therefore, The Boys season 4 must show the impact of the characters' actions surrounding Compound V, much like Gen V is already doing.\nWhether it is through a crossover with Gen V's characters or by publicly revealing the impact of Hughie and Starlight's announcement, The Boys' protagonists must see the impact of what they've done. The realization that they've hurt young Supes would likely upset Starlight and Hughie, perhaps making them rethink their battle with Vought — or maybe making them double down on stopping those responsible. There will be plenty of twists in The Boys season 4, and the addition of Gen V makes things even more unpredictable. How much the show leans into the main group being the villains is unknown, but The Boys must face the consequences of their actions.\nBackground\n\nBorn in Glasgow Scotland, Kyle is a passionate journalist who has a keen interest in TV and film.

Paul Rudd debuted in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Scott Lang in 2015's Ant-Man, with the movie revealing that Scott was a thief before he became one of the MCU's most beloved heroes. By the time Ant-Man's post-credits scene teased Captain America: Civil War, Scott had already fully become a hero; however, Ant-Man showed that Scott's criminal ties were very much alive at the start of the film, with Rudd's character trying to rob Hank Pym's house.\nInsider showed safe technician Charlie Santore Ant-Man's heist scene, letting the expert give his review of 2015's Ant-Man.\nSantore was not very impressed with Scott Lang's heist sequence in the MCU movie, with the real-life safecracker pointing out several flaws in Ant-Man's depiction of how Scott got into Hank Pym's vault. According to the specialist, the movie's errors include Scott taking a fingerprint off a door with the use of tape and the character freezing the vault door to crack it apart. As Ant-Man used a real safecracking tool — the StrongArm MiniRig — Santore rated the scene a 3/10. Check out the full quote below:\n\"He's taken the fingerprint off the door with tape. It could have been the cleaning lady's print that he pulled off of there. This actually broke my head a little bit. If you pull the print off with tape, and you turn it over and put a ring on it, and put Loctite in it aren't you actually making it a cast of the invert of the fingerprint?\nCarbondale's a made-up name, but the vault door itself, I looked through hundreds and hundreds of photos of vault doors, and I'm pretty certain that the art directors based this off a very early Diebold vault door. This is actually a real tool. This is a StrongArm MiniRig that's used for putting pressure when one's drilling. So that aspect of it is definitely accurate. We'll go do a quick job that winds up being something where you don't have your full tool kit with you. So there's lots of times when we've been running around trying to bend wires and make tools and sort of have to come up with something that we didn't have with us.\nSupposedly he's freezing it, and it's going to expand and crack this door apart. What they showed us was the bolt work inside of the safe and the door pan. There's a big door pan. If he poured a gallon of water in there, it would spill out the bottom of the door pan, basically. If by chance he froze it and the ice expanded, I mean, obviously water can expand. Glaciers expand over time. The thing about a vault door is, in this case, there's a thin back panel that's like sheet metal essentially on the back of the door. So the idea that that's going to expand is pure fantasy. It would blow the back of the panel off before it blew the door off.\nI opened up a couple of safes that were at a Blockbuster Video a while and there was Astroglide, condoms, and some dirty photos. So I don't know if a manager was having a fling with somebody, but that was pretty unexpected. On the more valuable side of things, we once opened a safe in an affluent part of Beverly Hills that people had recently moved into a home. The former owner was gone. There were Bulgari necklaces, Cartier necklaces, Krugerrands, GIA certificates. I mean, I can only imagine that it must have been a mid-to-high-six-figure lick. But I think that people get traumatized when there's that much left because they're not expecting to have a moral conflict, sort of. You know, 'It's technically mine, but this obviously meant a great deal to whoever it was that was living here before.'\nIt's nonsense, but the MiniRig is real.

However, the character was a very good thief in the MCU. Scott found success in many of his heists, including one at the Avengers Compound in Ant-Man. While the character was a convicted thief before Pym selected him to don his Ant-Man suit and become the new bearer of the Ant-Man mantle, that doesn't mean that Scott only failed in his criminal life.\nScott has been shown to be a smart character, making him a master thief, as Rudd's hero has a great mixture of athletic abilities, as well as knowledge of chemistry and hacking, which help him pull off heists. However, Scott got caught when trying to rob Hank Pym's home, though that ultimately led to him becoming a reformed hero. While Scott has failed as a thief a few times in the MCU, that does not mean that can't be successful if there are high stakes involved.\nThat is why Kang the Conqueror made Scott steal his Multiversal Engine Core back in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, knowing that the hero would deliver if his daughter's life was at risk. Scott was successful, showing that he can be a good thief when needed. Thankfully, his life has taken a turn away from his criminal past, with Scott now being a beloved Avenger — even being chosen to write a book about the events of Avengers: Endgame — and founding X-Con Security Consultants, which sees Scott move away from his past as a thief to now spearhead a security company, showing his growth since the first Ant-Man.\nSource: Insider\n"}
{"title": "Every Pumpkinhead Movie, Ranked", "date": "2023-10-02 19:50:28", "text": "While each of the Pumpkinhead films has its charms, the monster movie franchise's horror outings do differ in terms of quality and watchability.\nWhile the Pumpkinhead film franchise features a terrifying horror villain, not all the sequels are as interesting as their title character, making some of the movies stand out as better than others. Special effects legend Stan Winston made his directorial debut in 1988 with the supernatural horror movie Pumpkinhead. The original movie and the three sequels comprise this underrated horror movie franchise follow the story of the titular demon, a monstrous figure summoned by a grieving father. Pumpkinhead’s antihero wants revenge on teens who killed his son in a hit-and-run but regrets summoning the beast when he sees the bloody chaos that Pumpkinhead can wreak.\nA possible Pumpkinhead remake has been rumored for years, but it still hasn’t happened. As a result, there are currently only four installments in the Pumpkinhead franchise that wavered in quality. The first movie was released in 1988 and proved a minor box office flop, grossing only $4.5 million on a budget of $3 million. Despite its lack of success in theaters plus some weak reviews, Pumpkinhead gained a sequel six years later in the form of Pumpkinhead 2: Blood Wings. Like its titular monster, the franchise then lay dormant. In 2006, the belated sequel Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes continued its story, while 2007’s Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud ended the series.\nRelated: 10 Movie Monsters From The 80s Ranked By Toughness\nIt is hard to fault the 2007 TV movie Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud for ambition. Rather than phoning it in and offering another simplistic revenge story that copies the beats of the original movie, this fourquel instead opted to incorporate the real-life Hatfield and McCoy feud into the Pumpkinhead series. However, like the later installments of the Alien franchise whose eponymous monsters Stan Winston also helped design, Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud fell apart as its sprawling story got too big for its own good. The battle between the families is engaging and Pumpkinhead looks great, but the connective tissue just isn’t there.\nAs a result, Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud is effectively two passable movies that only occasionally intersect and become something good. One is a grisly Western tragedy about star-crossed lovers from feuding families while the other is a gruesome supernatural horror movie that wants to showcase its famous monster. There are some memorable kills in Pumpkinhead: Blood Feud, which proves that even the weakest outings of the franchise have something to offer. Lance Henriksen’s Ed Harley also shows up for a cameo, although his role is far smaller than it was in 2006’s Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes. Thanks to a downbeat ending, this is the least essential of the series.\nLike the Child’s Play movies, another slasher franchise that survived from the late ‘80s into the ‘90s, the Pumpkinhead movies didn’t prioritize their villain’s backstory until the sequels started. In Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings, Pumpkinhead gains a deformed son in the sweet Tommy, who is swiftly killed off by some of the most monstrous bullies in movie history. While it is undeniably satisfying to see these villains get torn to shreds when Tommy is revived in the form of Pumpkinhead, the unrelenting bleakness of Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings makes this sequel a tough watch.\nThe sequel’s antagonists are so inhumane that it is tough to care about their fates, making this a lesser entry in the series. Fortunately, some creative kills ensure this isn’t a complete waste of time. While other direct-to-video horror sequels feature innumerable sequels that fail to justify their existence, the trim runtime of Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings and its nasty gore make the movie worth a watch. However, the rest of the series has stronger character work.\nBy rights, Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes should have been a disaster. For one thing, it is a made-for-television sequel released around the same time as cheap, in-name-only cash-ins like Lake Placid 2. For another, its director, Jake West, was previously best known for low-budget British horror comedies. Despite these limitations, Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes is a gory joy. Not only does the original movie’s Lance Henriksen return as Ed Harley, but he is also joined by horror royalty Ed Bradley. The Hellraiser franchise villain plays a bizarre anti-villain in the form of Doc Fraser, an amoral mortician who is caught harvesting the organs of the dead.\nUnfortunately for Fraser, he made the mistake of carrying out his crimes in the same small town where the original Pumpkinhead hero Ed Harley once lived. Soon enough, Harley is revived as Pumpkinhead and the original movie’s hero becomes the killer in this sequel. Since Fraser has to go on a bloody murder spree of his own to cover his tracks, this sequel is an unusually morally ambiguous spin on the franchise’s simple plotting. Fraser is no one’s hero, and Harley’s take on Pumpkinhead is comparatively morally justified in his actions, making the story of Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes a gory fun time that also plays with the franchise’s formula.\nThe original Pumpkinhead is by no means perfect, but it is still the strongest horror movie in the series so far. Lance Henriksen gives a stellar central performance as a grieving father who will go to any lengths to avenge his son’s death, and the tragedy of his loss means that Pumpkinhead’s slow-burn revenge story feels earned. In many ways, the opening half of Pumpkinhead plays out like a more vengeful spin on Stephen King’s Pet Sematary, as a parent’s grief drives them to unimaginable extremes. However, once the kills start, the franchise’s real selling point becomes obvious.\nWhile every sequel gives Pumpkinhead plenty of screen time, the monster is never more effective than he is in his big-screen debut. Pumpkinhead builds up to its big reveal slowly and, when Stan Winston’s creature is finally unveiled, the movie has the confidence to show off the beast in numerous lengthy set-pieces. Where many horror movies shy away from this approach, the original Pumpkinhead proves that a great monster can withstand plenty of time terrorizing viewers onscreen without diluting its scare factor. As a result, Pumpkinhead remains the best film in the franchise to date thanks to its unique combination of tragic horror drama and pure monster movie chills.\n"}
{"title": "Broadway Legends Talk Writing For Steve Martin On Only Murders In The Building", "date": "2023-10-02 20:00:27", "text": "Benj Pasek, Justin Paul, Marc Shaiman, and Scott Wittman dive deep into “Which of the Pickwick Triplets Did It?” from Only Murders season 3.\nOnly Murders in the Building season 3 has brought fun musical flair to the true crime comedy, with a number of standout pieces like “Look for the Light” that would sound at home in any real-world Broadway show. The song with the biggest story impact, however, is “Which of the Pickwick Triplets Did It?”, the tongue-twisting patter song Charles-Hayden Savage (Steve Martin) is set to perform in the in-show musical Death Rattle. The piece keeps sending Savage to “the White Room”, which begins to strain his relationship with Oliver Putnam (Martin Short).\nWith a musical at the heart of Only Murders in the Building season 3, the songs had to hold up to Broadway standards. That’s why Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the award-winning writers behind Dear Evan Hansen and The Greatest Showman, were hired to write or co-write nearly every song the season, including “Which of the Pickwick Triplets Did It?” For that song, however, they enlisted two more Broadway legends in Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, who wrote Hairspray. Pasek, Paul, Shaiman, and Wittman even wrote songs for the beloved NBC series Smash.\nRelated: Does Meryl Streep Really Sing In Only Murders In The Building? Her Song With Ashley Park Explained\nBenj Pasek, Justin Paul, Marc Shaiman, and Scott Wittman dove deep into the making of “Which of the Pickwick Triplets Did It?” in a fun conversation with Screen Rant. Note: This interview was conducted during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, and the show covered here would not exist without the labor of the writers and actors in both unions. This interview has also been lightly edited for clarity and length.\nScreen Rant: I realized you all have worked on the same project in Smash, which I used to watch week to week and was crazy about, but had you ever [actually] collaborated other than just being involved in the same general thing?\nScott Wittman: No, we didn’t even meet them on Smash. We were all in separate worlds.\nBenj Pasek: But I do know that they were the nice people who allowed us to get the job on Smash, and that was our first TV job ever. I don't know if I've ever said this to you guys, but I hear that you guys were listening and that you approved our song, or whatever. So, they're the reasons why we got our first television show.\nJustin Paul: We had to jump through their hoops to be able to be approved.\nScott Wittman: We did recommend them. I remember saying, “You should get these young whippersnappers.”\nBenj Pasek: Justin and I have loved Marc and Scott forever. We’ve just been fans, and Smash was a huge, huge opportunity for us. It was the first time, honestly, we ever had a song on television, so it was huge for us. But we have just been fans for a really long time and have always wanted to play in the same sandbox, and never thought that we would ever get the opportunity to do so. And then this became an amazing opportunity to do so.\nDoes that mean that, Justin and Benj, that you got them involved in Only Murders?\nJustin Paul: The way that it came about was all this crazy lovely serendipity, which was [that] we went to college with a lovely woman named Sas Goldberg and she and Benj were together--it happened to be at the same place--on vacation. They were just having a conversation and she was like, “When I get back, I'm going back into the writers’ room. I'm joining, this season, the writers’ room for Only Murders in the Building.” He was like, “Oh my gosh, we're huge fans of that show.” And, saying it in Benj’s typical way of just trying to create a path where there isn't one, he was like, “If there's ever a song, if you need a ditty or something…”\nBenj Pasek: I was hawking our wares.\nJustin Paul: And there was no music in the show, necessarily. There was no plot of any of this, but it was like, \"If you ever need something, we will do it. We love this show. We live on the Upper West Side.\" He was just hawking our credentials of why we should be part of Only Murders in the Building.\nBenj Pasek: Then she called back literally a week later and she's like, \"So, not only do they might want a song, but the entire plot around the season hinges upon a fictional musical. I brought up that you guys might be interested in working on it, and they were like, 'Great!’” So, it was very serendipitous in that way. We knew that there were going to be a couple of song moments, and we honestly just used the moment [for] getting to work with some of our favorite folks. [We asked Marc and Scott] knowing the beautiful reciprocity of the gift that they gave us on Smash, but also, we have always wanted to work with Marc and Scott on something. We're such huge fans; this seemed like such a fun opportunity to get to collaborate.\nJustin Paul: We sort of knew this was a great chance to work with some of our favorite writers and our favorite musical theater idols because we can go to them and say, \"Hey, do you want to work with us writing a song for Steve Martin?\" or, \"Do you want to come along and write a song with us for Meryl Streep?\" So, there was that built in. This is a fun show, [and there’s] a great spirit of collaboration on the show itself. It's all about Broadway. They're getting the best people on Broadway; half of them are already on the show, but it's going to be a whole thing about Broadway. There was going to be an episode about a sitzprobe and about curtain coming down.\nIt's so crazy to us that there’s a TV show on now with these guys and Selena Gomez that's centering all around Broadway this season, and so we were like, \"Why don't we continue that spirit? Let's bring along some of our favorite friends.\" These gentlemen kindly said yes to us, even though they were highly skeptical of what the heck that was going to look like. Maybe skeptical of us, I don't know, but they kindly said, \"Yes, let's get in a room and see what the heck happens.\"\nMarc Shaiman: As you can tell from Justin's last speech, the idea of getting a word in edgewise just seemed like... “How will we write together?” But the truth is, we got together and the four of us started writing lyrics in the most fantastic way--the same way Scott and I do it, and obviously the same way that Justin and Benj do it. We were just the four of us throwing out stuff. Usually, I'm very good at remembering. \"I wrote that. I wrote that,\" on things, which is obnoxious. I do remember those things, but in this case, I can look at the lyric and go, \"I think, but I'm not sure.\" We were all just going at it equally, and it was just fantastic.\nScott Wittman: Because we had never written with anyone else--except for Bette Midler a few times where we wrote songs with her--I really felt like getting in a room was like taking all our clothes off together. So, we did that, and it worked out well.\nLogistically, how did you start the song? Was it just lyrics and rhythm stuff? I imagine you don't necessarily need a piano to get started on this kind of thing.\nScott Wittman: Well, everything starts with a story, so we worked from the script and an outline of what the character was, and what the plot of the mystery was. So, we started with Pickwicks and that has a lot of alliteration; that was the beginning of it, I think.\nBenj Pasek: We worked really collaboratively with John Hoffman (Only Murders in the Building co-creator) who was really trying to hone in on, “What is the idea, specifically, of this patter song?” Even the fact that it was going to be a patter song and that the plot hinged around having a really tough song to be able to sing was then a fun challenge for us of, “How do we then reverse-engineer something that would feel like a challenge to be able to perform?” And then, as Scott is saying, “How do we make that incredibly alliterative,” or “How do we allow it to be complex and tongue twisty and all of that?” And that began to inform our process.\nThen, honestly, the four of us were just in a room starting with lyric first. The first line that we wrote was, \"Which of the Pickwick triplets did it?\" And then it's like, \"Okay. What rhymes with ‘did it’?\" It’s like having a flashlight and you can only see a little bit in front of you, and things get revealed, and everyone just is piping up and contributing different ideas, and slowly but surely we got a little bit further down the path together.\nSo much was made of Steve Martin's character not being able to do this throughout the season. How was it when he actually got the song? Is it as much of a challenge as it's made out to be?\nScott Wittman: A challenge to sing? Yes. I think he really loved the song and I think he was very happy when he was done with it; a combination of the two. But he worked extremely hard. I mean, it was hard. It was a lot of pre-records and singing live, and he had to wrap his tongue around all those vowels. So yes.\nI was going to ask if the vocals were recorded live [for the one that was in the show], or if that was pre-record. Or was it a mix? \nJustin Paul: It's a little bit of a mix. Well, what ended up in the TV broadcast is a little bit of a mix. Typically, you're going to go in with a pre-record; that is the plan. What’s actually amazing is that number… I can't remember what caused the delay, but some days got pushed and stuff, and so they ended up having like two or three hours to shoot that number in what was supposed to be a whole day shoot, or something like that. Of course, of all the numbers that get squeezed like that, it's like, “Really? This one?” So it’s that much more impressive when you watch Steve execute it, knowing that he was literally under the gun.\nScott Wittman: It was adorable, too, because Marty had wrapped, and Meryl had wrapped, and they all stayed to watch Steve do it. It was really sweet. It’s a lovely group up there. They really enjoy each other.\nEven watching the show, it seems like that's kind of the energy, which is great.\nScott Wittman: And in my whole life in show business, this is one of the only things we wrote that there were no notes from anyone.\nMarc Shaiman: That's true. I don't know if you've seen the video; the guys have posted some of it. We made a video of just us reciting the lyrics, with Justin and I just playing a little bit, and they just kind of went, \"Yeah, that's it.\"\nJustin Paul: Well, we worked hard on it guys. I think that was hopefully due to the good work that we all did together and also really careful plotting from John in the writer's room. They knew how they wanted to use the song. We had so much direction. I think another thing about the writing process that was so fun for us was [that] I feel like a lot of what we did was reverse engineering, so just sitting around thinking \"What are the most delicious pairings of murder and infanthood? And what are fun rhymes of an investigation and babies? How can we pair these things up?” It was really, in the best way, the one-upmanship of, like, \"What about this?” “Oh no, we can add one more rhyme in there.” Then, once we had all those assembled, \"Okay, this is our arsenal here. How do we put these to use in creating a song?”\nAnd there were some things where we were like, \"This is so good, but we can't squeeze it in.\" But a lot of it was really loving. A patter song… this is sort of a puzzle anyway, so it was really [about] identifying some of our favorite pieces and then putting them together. It was like, \"How zany can we be? How far can we go?\" In video that Marc is talking about, if you listen closely, you'll hear us say, \"Will the baby get fried for matricide?\" We did get one note, and the note was, \"I don't think we want to put on the broadcast the image of an infant and an electric chair, so we're going to say, ‘Will the baby get tried’,\" Which was equally fitting and makes sense to a courtroom and a case and a murder. They didn't want to evoke electrifying a young toddler.\nProps for getting the word “triptych” in a song, too.\nMarc Shaiman: I know. We were all thrilled. We literally were dancing with joy that we figured that one out.\nWas there anything you used as a reference in terms of great patter songs that you wanted to keep in mind as you were writing?\nBenj Pasek: I'm sure lingering all of our heads is “Modern Major General” in some way. I don't know that you can ever escape it, just because it looms large in the pantheon of great patter songs.\nScott Wittman: I'd say Gilbert and Sullivan.\nBenj Pasek: Gilbert and Sullivan or some Lerner and Loewe stuff. I don't know; I think we didn't reference anything directly. I think we all love classic Broadway show tunes as well, so just having a really similar pool of references to draw, even if we didn’t name them… We sort of all identified the same kind of style that we thought it should be in.\nMarc Shaiman: And Scott and I were often told, \"That song is too wordy.\" We do like writing wordy songs. Sometimes, on some shows, we've even been told, \"It's so wordy that the audience will tune out.\" In this case, it was nice to be encouraged to embrace it.\nBenj Pasek: And the moment that was engineered was really about paying attention to the lyric. What was so great about how John and the writers set up the song was that the audience is really invested in, “Can he say these lyrics?” So, it's not something where you're distracted by other stage pictures that are going on, or other things that are happening that are going to detract. It allowed us to put as much dexterity and complicated internal rhyme as possible because the audience's only job, really, is to follow whether or not Charles-Hayden Savage can actually nail the patter song. It really allowed us to maximize that element of it.\nScott Wittman: It created an earworm long before they actually heard it, so that's sort of fun too. I think that the audience enjoyed that.\nMarc Shaiman: And then there’s Steve's performance. I was there that day and had to leave because they kept pushing it back. I couldn't believe I had sat there all day [only to have to leave], but that's typical on a movie or TV. So, I only saw him for the first time in that full version that they put out online. He's just so adorable. It was just a thrill.\nJustin Paul: I wasn't able to be there either. I remember texting with some of the music team, and they were like, \"I don't know what we're going to do, because we're only going to have maybe two hours to get this whole thing.\" Of all the songs in the season, it was intentionally the most challenging of all of the songs [and] of all the moments, and so we were like, \"How are we going to shortchange this?\" But it wasn't shortchanged.\nAt least [for] the folks on the music team, no one had ever seen him perform it. No one had seen him do what he was going to do, so everything that he broke out, all these crazy hand motions and his entire iteration of that song and that performance… I don't think anyone had ever seen before. That's just what he did on the day when cameras were rolling. It is… I say this about the performance, not the song: his performance is iconic. It really is.\nScott Wittman: I was there. He attacked it straight on. It was all in one take too, most of it.\nI love the way that it's presented in the show. It’s played in full and then there are these shots of everyone else trying to solve the murder as [the song is] happening. Did you know that it was going to be presented in that way, and from start to finish? Because I feel like that is rare even in shows that feature musicals; usually there are cut points and things like that.\nScott Wittman: It’s hard to cut away from that song though, because you'd lose the engine. It would stall on the track.\nMarc Shaiman: It was just pleasing to see, \"Oh my god, it's all in there.\" Because yeah, we are used to [projects where] eventually something gets cut or lost. It was also great that they did it as it is on the episode with all the other things going on. Nowadays it's so great that they can also present just him, so that there are these two versions to take in. It's very satisfying.\nScott Wittman: On Smash, we used to learn that if we kept changing keys, they couldn't cut.\nIt doesn't necessarily sound like it, but Steve Martin is such an accomplished musician as well. Did he have any input or suggestions with this at all?\nMarc Shaiman: No. He never said anything like, \"Could that be a C# minor instead of this?\" or anything like that. I think he felt it was enough to just learn the song and be able to perform it. And then we had the evil Ian co-producing the vocal. I never saw anything like Ian--never. I thought I’m something when I'm working with a singer, [like], “Try it again. Try it this way,” knowing that you can comp a vocal and take the best of this and that, but I never saw anything like this. But Steve Martin was incredibly patient and would just try anything any of us suggested. He was like, \"No, no, no. Give me a line reading. Sing it to me the way you think.\" And he would just try it, like, eight different ways. It was phenomenal. He's Steve Martin.\nWho orchestrated this? Because the orchestration is beautiful.\nJustin Paul: The orchestrator was an incredibly talented fellow named August Eriksmoen, who we've worked with before. What's great about August is that his style diversity is really off the chart. Even in our own work, he's done some more contemporary stuff and he's done a lot of classic Broadway kind of stuff, so his abilities really run the gamut. The first time that I saw this chart, I was like, \"Okay, this is going to be [great.]\"\nHe was like, \"Can I go there?\" and we're like, \"Yes, you have to go there.\" We’re so grateful that the show, the network, the studio, [and] everybody really committed to, “We want to make this feel like a big Broadway musical.” You watch on screen and [there’s] that set that they built at United Palace, [we had] an orchestra that was a really nice-sized orchestra record, and got the proper time to do it. It was onscreen an ode to Broadway, and a love letter to Broadway, but offscreen it was as well, from getting Broadway songwriters, to orchestrator, to the orchestra, to doing it the right way. It felt really beautiful that there was such a love and respect for how things get done on Broadway.\nSeason three of “Only Murders in the Building” finds Charles, Oliver & Mabel (played by Steve Martin, Martin Short & Selena Gomez) investigating a murder behind the scenes of a Broadway show. Ben Glenroy (Paul Rudd) is a Hollywood action star whose Broadway debut is cut short by his untimely death. Aided by co-star Loretta Durkin (Meryl Streep), our trio embarks on their toughest case yet, all while director Oliver desperately attempts to put his show back together.

Debuting in the Top 10 most-watched movies on Netflix in many countries, including the U.S., Love Is in the Air follows chief pilot Dana (Delta Goodrem) as she deals with William (Joshua Sasse), ITCM Financial’s advisor from the UK. William ventures to Fullerton in a bid to shut Dana’s family company down. However, seeing the work Dana, Jeff (Roy Billing), and Nikki (Steph Tisdell) do on the ground serving remote communities changes William’s heart.\nJoining the list of Netflix’s best romantic comedy movies, Love Is in the Air makes perfect use of its filming locations, which manage to highlight just how remote the featured islands are. This is precisely why Dana prioritizes air deliveries to remote communities over tours for paying visitors. Love Is in the Air mentions multiple locations, including the quaint town of Fullterton, where Dana and her family live, and various spots like Packers Bay, or Lizard Island. While the filming locations are relatively close to each other and all in the state of Queensland, Australia, the places Love Is in the Air mentions are mostly fictional.\nThe company at the center of Love Is in the Air's story is Fullerton Airways, which according to the Australian rom-com, is based at Fullerton Airport. However, no airport with this name exists in the Whitsunday archipelago, where Love Is in the Air was filmed. Apart from multiple trips around the Whitsundays, Fullerton Airport is the main stage where most of the action happens in Love Is in the Air, making it an important location. It works as an airstrip and also as an accommodation, as it's where William ends up during his stay in Fullerton. He enjoys a front row seat to the comings and goings of the airport.\nRelated: 20 Best Australian TV Shows On US Netflix\nLove Is in the Air’s scenes at the airport were filmed at Whitsunday Airport (Shute Harbour) in Queensland, Australia (via Atlas of Wonders). The private airport boasts a modern hangar, a couple of helicopters, and, just like in Love Is in the Air, a residential area for small aircraft owners. Love Is in the Air makes a point of highlighting how everything is close in Fullerton, and Heath’s bar is where Nikki, Jeff, and Dana all hang out. It's also where William picks up the keys to his apartment. The bar exists in real life under the name The Hangar Cafe and Bar, and it’s mere meters from the runway.\nJeff makes a point of asking Dana to pick up William and show him the panoramic route as he tries to sort out the company’s books. The town of Fullerton's real name can be seen right after Dana welcomes William in her car. Airlie Beach, west of the Whitsunday Airport, doubles as Fullerton in Love Is in the Air. Nestled in Pioneer Bay, Airlie Beach offers the perfect arrival spot for visitors of the Whitsunday Islands, which boast naturalistic wilderness both on the ground and the sea, given their vicinity to the Great Barrier Reef.\nOn their many visits to remote communities, Dana and William see beautiful white sand beaches from above, and while they rarely specify the places they’re flying over, their flight right before the cyclone shows one of the beaches deemed among the most beautiful in the world. The northern side of Whitehaven Beach on Whitsunday Island can be seen on Dana and William’s flight back to Fullerton Airport. The beach, situated on the largest island of the archipelago, stretches over seven kilometers and can be reached by boat or overseen via helicopters and small aircraft flights (via Queensland’s official website).\nRelated: 25 Best Underrated Netflix Comedies\nLove Is in the Air’s end credits offer another shot of Whitsunday Island as Dana flies over it after the group overcomes the challenges Duncan Mitchell throws at them.

They don't need anyone's approval to live their life.\nFemale anime anti-heroes are a surprisingly underrepresented archetype, due to the medium's tendency to turn female characters into helpless damsels in distress, often needing to be saved by their strong male counterparts. Even when that is not the case, they are often either given supporting roles, or act as the love interest of the main character, rather than having their own identity.\nAnime anti-heroes, in general, are not entirely uncommon, but most of them are men, who are typically allowed to have stronger and more dominant personalities, without needing to be considerate of those around them. Regardless, there are also female leading characters who are shown to go around the world as they see fit, without conforming to any rules, and making a name for themselves as some of the best anti-heroines.\nBlack Lagoon's titular Lagoon Company is a group of people typically working for criminal organizations, providing services such as smuggling and piracy. Revy's personality seems perfectly suitable for her line of work, as she is known for being rude, aggressive, and sadistic, often using foul language and killing without any hesitation. However, this destructive behavior is actually fueled by her deep psychological trauma, as she was verbally, physically, and even sexually abused by people who were supposed to protect her. This caused her to desperately seek power, and being impoverished resulted in her obsession with money. However, Revy also seems to have a soft side, occasionally saving her comrades.\nAs the female protagonist of The Future Diary, Yuno Gasai's identity and actions revolve around her love interest, Yukiteru Amano. Despite genuinely caring for Yukiteru and doing everything in her power to ensure his success in the survival game they're playing, her methods tend to be on the questionable side. Many of her problems stem from her childhood; after being adopted into a seemingly happy family, her father ended up being mostly absent, and her mother turned out to be abusive towards her, even locking her in a cage. This caused Yuno to become troubled and develop a twisted personality, often resorting to cruel and violent methods.\nRelated: Future Diary: The Main Characters, Ranked From Worst To Best By Character Arc\nAkame Ga Kill's eponymous anti-heroine, Akame, is a ruthless assassin who kills her enemies without showing any mercy or remorse. However, she is not entirely villainous, as she is shown to care deeply about her comrades, always trying to protect her friends and being affected when she is unable to do so. Her seemingly cold and emotionless nature is a result of her childhood, during which she, along with her sister, was sold to the Empire and forced into a cruel exam. The survivors were then trained by elite assassins to become effective killers, learning killing and espionage techniques, and undergoing difficult training.\nAs the protagonist of the Slayers franchise, Lina Inverse's actions are typically not too different from those of other heroic mages, as she too tends to spend most of her time fighting the forces of evil. What differentiates her from her peers, however, would be her methods; she has a short temper and a tendency to cause great collateral damage when fighting, using black magic derived from beings of chaos, with no regard or consideration for her surroundings. Moreover, coming from a family of merchants, she is always trying to get a good bargain, even forcing people to give her items for free occasionally.\nGunslinger Girl revolves around the Social Welfare Agency, where young girls are given cybernetic implants and used as anti-terrorist agents, working alongside \"Handlers\" who brainwash them into being completely loyal, often at the cost of their memories. Triela became one of the Agency's first cyborgs after living a tragic life as a victim of the mob, routinely drugged and abused, and nearly dying at some point. She is shown to be one of the more compassionate and level-headed characters, often teaching and helping the other girls who are struggling. Though she is seen as an anti-hero because of how brutal she can be, Triela is but a product of her circumstances.\nKoko Hekmatyar is an arms dealer, typically seen traveling with her squad of bodyguards around the world to conduct business. Her personality is difficult to assess, as she rarely shows her true feelings. Her behavior is occasionally immature, but she can also be composed, especially when dealing with business partners. One thing that can be said for sure is that she is determined, as she is leading a secret project known as Jormungand, with the goal of ending war and arms trade. This plan may involve casualties amounting to 700,000 people, but she sees that as a necessary sacrifice, which deserves to be made for the sake of achieving world peace.\nBorn into a family of demon hunters, Shiki Ryougi grew up with two personalities, the stoic and cynical female persona, and the male persona who knows nothing but to kill. After being involved in an accident that leaves her in a 2-year coma however, she realizes that she lost her male persona SHIKI, instead gaining the \"Mystic Eyes of Death Perception\", a supernatural ability that lets her perceive the death of any object or being. The Garden of Sinners follows Shiki's life and the mysteries she is wrapped up in, making no effort to hide just how cruel and merciless she can be when she wants to.\nElfen Lied's protagonist Kaede is a Diclonius, a species with horns and psychokinetic abilities, defined by one of anime's most tragic backstories. Raised in an orphanage, she grew up with the mistaken idea that her parents abandoned her and wanted her dead, causing her deep psychological issues. At the orphanage, she was not only neglected by the staff but also bullied by the other kids. As she matured, her vectors, or invisible telekinetic arms, also developed, and she unconsciously used them to murder people when she felt betrayed and enraged multiple times. Once she learns about love though, she makes the conscious decision to change and atone for her past.\nClare is a Claymore, or human-Yoma hybrid, fighting the demonic creatures called Yoma that torment the lands. Although she can be considered an anti-hero because of her generally cold and blunt attitude, seemingly prioritizing the elimination of Yoma above all else, including the protection of other humans, she proves herself to be rather kind beyond the surface, genuinely caring about her friends and comrades. Unfortunately, she has trouble expressing her feelings due to her traumatic past. After losing her parents to Yoma and being captured and abused by one, she was finally saved by another Claymore, namely Teresa, only to eventually lose her too, left with nothing but a desire for revenge.\nMichiko Malandro, Michiko & Hatchin's co-protagonist, is a strong woman with a troubled past. Growing up in an orphanage, she routinely stole from shops to provide for the other younger kids, feeling responsible for them. After leaving the orphanage, she eventually got arrested, later escaping prison to look for the daughter of her ex-lover, Hiroshi. Saving Hana, whom she would then name Hatchin, from an abusive foster family, the two set out on a journey together. Michiko may have strange ways of showing it, often appearing as abrasive or a troublemaker, not afraid of pointing guns at people, but she truly cares for the ones she loves, trusting them completely.\nThese anti-heroines prove that strong anime female protagonists can be popular too, despite not being particularly common. In fact, their rarity only makes them that more special. Rather than being dismissive or blindly following the expectations associated with the role of a leading character, they prove that there is more than one way to lead a story and set the tone of the action. That's what makes these female anime anti-heroes some of the coolest and most memorable anime characters ever.\nRemus Badescu is a writer for ScreenRant's anime section.

Episode 1 of the new college-focused spinoff saw Golden Boy kill Godolkin University's Professor Brink (Clancy Brown) before exploding in midair. His sudden actions were because of a discovery he made involving the Woods, a secret Supe testing facility beneath Godolkin.\nNow, Vought International has released a video where Vought CEO Ashley Barrett (Colby Minifie) spins Golden Boy's death in Gen V for the media.\nIn the video, Ashley claims Golden Boy's death was due to drug use, which resulted in him having \"a full psychotic break.\" However, later episodes of the series reveal his rampage was fueled by what he discovered about the Woods.\nThe characters in Gen V have had to deal with Golden Boy’s death since it happened at the end of episode 1. This has resulted in Andre (Chance Perdomo) heavily investigating the Woods, discovering its existence and sending Emma (Lizze Broadway) there to investigate. The end of episode 3 saw Emma discover Golden Boy’s brother, Sam (Asa Germann), is alive, just as Andre discovers his father, Polarity (Sean Patrick Thomas), knows about the experiments.\nGolden Boy’s death was the catalyst for students at Godolkin starting their own investigation into the Woods facility. This will likely result in the core students trying to make the experiments known to the public while also trying to understand why they’re being conducted beneath the school. Since Gen V has five episodes left, the answers may not be clear right away.\nHowever, it seems Emma could be discovered in episode 4, which may lead to more direct conflict between students and the school going forward. If that's the case, then the developments that transpire for the rest of the season will likely be extremely unpredictable. By embracing the same dark elements of The Boys that make it so memorable, Gen V will no doubt help to enhance the universe with its own deadly storyline.\nGen V releases new episodes Fridays on Prime Video.\nSource: Vought International/Twitter\n"}

The 1978 movie follows the havoc that is wreaked when murderer Michael Myers escapes from a sanitarium and begins stalking the streets of Haddonfield, Illinois, on Halloween night. After becoming one of the most profitable independent movies of all time, Halloween launched a franchise that now includes 13 movies. In addition to directing the original, Carpenter also co-wrote the screenplay and composed the now iconic Halloween score.\nOn Instagram, Halloween Kills performer Douglas Tait shared a video of a moment when John Carpenter made a surprise appearance at the H45: 45 Years of Terror convention in Pasadena on October 1.\nIn Tait's video, Carpenter poses for a photo with Nick Castle, who played \"The Shape\" (the moniker given to the masked Michael Myers) in the original Halloween as well as Blumhouse's recent legacy sequel trilogy. Carpenter also paid a visit to P.J. Soles (Lynda) and Nancy Loomis (Annie), as well as other performers from the 1978 classic before participating in a panel about his iconic movie.\nThis was not a full cast reunion, as some of the surviving cast members including Charles Cyphers (Sheriff Brackett) and Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode) were not present. However, Carpenter's appearance at the event does feel like something of a full-circle moment for his career. Horror has long been central to Carpenter's work, with titles including The Thing, Prince of Darkness, and Village of the Damned dotting his filmography over the years. However, he hasn't directed a horror movie since 2010's The Ward, which is also his final directorial feature at the time of writing.\nCarpenter is now prepping for the release of his Peacock miniseries John Carpenter's Suburban Screams, which features his return to directing (done remotely, in this case). However, this long-awaited comeback has been building for quite some time. While Carpenter hasn't directed a movie or television project since The Ward, he has never been too far from the horror genre in the meantime.\nMost notably, Carpenter returned to the Halloween movies as a producer and co-composer for 2018's Halloween and its sequels, Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends. However, he has also released multiple albums of his horror-tinged musical compositions, even going on tour to perform them alongside entries from his iconic scores. He also directed music videos for several song releases, co-composed the score for 2022's Firestarter, and made a cameo in the Foo Fighters horror movie Studio 666, presaging his eventual return to the horror genre.\nSource: Douglas Tait/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "How Old Star Trek’s New Vulcan Is Compared To Spock & T’Pol", "date": "2023-10-02 20:16:30", "text": "Star Trek: Lower Decks' T'Lyn revealed her age, but how does she compare to Enterprise's T'Pol and Strange New Worlds' Lt. Spock?\nStar Trek: Lower Decks' new Vulcan, Lieutenant T'Lyn (Gabrielle Ruiz), is of comparable age to Star Trek: Enterprise's Subcommander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) and she is older than Star Trek: Strange New Worlds' Lieutenant Spock (Ethan Peck). T'Lyn was introduced in Lower Decks season 2 as a Lower Decker serving on the Vulcan ship Sh'vhal. When T'Lyn saved her ship during a conflict between Klingons, Pakleds, and the USS Cerritos, she was transferred to Starfleet and stationed on the Cerritos as a provisional Ensign. However, T'Lyn was quickly promoted to Lieutenant, junior grade.\nVulcans are relatively long-lived and can roughly double the lifespan of humans, although some elderly Vulcans can develop Bendii Syndrome, a neurological disease that affects their telepathy. In Star Trek: Lower Decks' late 24th century era, numerous Vulcans serve in Starfleet, but this was a much rarer thing in previous generations of Star Trek. T'Pol was the first Vulcan to join Starfleet in Star Trek: Enterprise season 3, and when Spock became a Starfleet Officer a century later, Vulcans in Starfleet were still relatively uncommon compared to the 24th century. Spock did attend Starfleet Academy, which neither T'Pol nor T'Lyn did, which accounts for why the two female Vulcans were introduced to be much older than the iconic Mr. Spock.\nRelated: Star Trek: Lower Decks Cast Guide - Who Voices Each Character In All 4 Seasons\nIn Star Trek: Lower Decks season 4, episode 5, \"Empathological Fallacies,\" Lt. T'Lyn told Lt. Beckett Mariner (Tawny Newsome) that she is 62 years old, to which Mariner responded, \"62? You look great, by the way.\" T'Lyn's age lines up with T'Pol's, who was 63 years old when Star Trek: Enterprise began, which was set in 2251. Comparatively, Lt. Spock was only 29 in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 1. Spock was born in 2230 on Vulcan, and he is about 36 in Star Trek: The Original Series when Spock is portrayed by Leonard Nimoy.\nSpock chose to attend Starfleet Academy instead of the Vulcan Science Academy, which created a rift between him and his father, Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard/James Frain). Both T'Lyn and T'Pol ended up in Starfleet by circumstance; T'Pol was originally a Vulcan observer on the inaugural mission of the NX-01 Enterprise commanded by Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) and she chose to remain aboard the Earth vessel before eventually aligning her loyalty from the Vulcan High Command to Starfleet. T'Lyn was transferred to Starfleet as a punishment for being \"too emotional\" and \"out of control,\" and she desperately tried to return to the Sh'vhal before deciding to remain on the Cerritos.\nAlthough she is Star Trek's newest (an increasingly popular) Vulcan character, T'Lyn was definitely inspired by her Vulcan predecessors. As a Vulcan in Starfleet, T'Lyn evokes Lt. Saavik (Kirstie Alley/Robin Curtis) from the Star Trek movies, and her headband and hairstyle are reminiscent of the treacherous Lt. Valeris (Kim Cattrall) from Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. Like T'Pol, T'Lyn unwillingly found herself serving on a Starfleet ship, and her dissatisfaction and issues with her Vulcan superiors led her to question whether she is \"Vulcan enough.\" And, similar to T'Pol, T'Lyn has to get used to how humans smell as they offend the superior olfactory senses of Vulcan females.\nT'Lyn and T'Pol are nearly identical ages when they come aboard their Starfleet ships, just like Spock and Tuvok (Tim Russ) are of comparable ages in their early Starfleet careers. Like Spock, Tuvok was 29 when he served on the USS Excelsior commanded by Captain Hikaru Sulu (George Takei) in 2293. Lt. Tuvok was 93 years old when he came aboard the USS Voyager commanded by Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) at the start of Star Trek: Voyager, and Captain Tuvok is 137 when he appears in Star Trek: Picard season 3, circa 2401. Star Trek: Lower Decks' Lt. T'Lyn is hopefully still alive in Star Trek: Picard season 3, and she would be around 80 years old.\nJohn Orquiola is Screen Rant's Star Trek Beat Editor, Senior Features staff writer, and interviewer."}
{"title": "There’s One Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Side Quest You Should Do ASAP", "date": "2023-10-02 20:16:30", "text": "One Phantom Liberty side quest unlocks a whole new way to earn legendary rewards. Here’s how to find and complete it in the Cyberpunk 2077 DLC.\nCyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC brings many new side quests to the open world of Night City, but one in particular shouldn't be skipped. Naturally, the main focus of the Phantom Liberty DLC is on its tense, twisted spy thriller of a story. Even so, some of its side quests do a wonderful job of expanding its world, getting the player acquainted with the notable people, places, and things of Dogtown to ease them along their journey.\nBut not all side quests are exactly the same. While some of them tie into the setting or expand on the story, others are simple, skippable fetch quests that don't offer much beyond material compensation. Still others, though, are more than worthwhile because of the new mechanics, shops, or items they unlock. These rewards can stick with the player throughout the DLC and beyond, changing even the base game of Cyberpunk 2077 in meaningful ways. Those side quests are worth looking out for, but can sometimes be hard to find.\nRelated: One Cyberpunk 2077 Choice Will Ruin Your Phantom Liberty Playthrough\nCompleting the Phantom Liberty side job \"Push it to the Limit\" unlocks a whole new feature in the DLC: the ability to undertake Vehicle Contracts. These are often simple, quick driving missions in which V has to steal a designated car, then drive it to a buyer while swerving around enemies. Vehicle Contracts allow the DLC to showcase the brand-new vehicular combat mechanic, which was added to the game in Cyberpunk 2077's free 2.0 update. Since each one is centered around a different car, these quests also give players an opportunity to test drive some of Phantom Liberty's coolest new vehicles.\nCyberpunk 2077's Vehicle Contracts are also notable for their rewards, which may include crafting components, rare weapons, weapon attachments, and a variety of different Shard types. Shards can be exchanged for different rewards, which are mostly self-explanatory. Money Shards can be turned into eurodollars, and Skill Shards grant a slight XP bump to the relevant ability. Vehicle Contracts may also reward V with Autofixer Discount Shards, which can be traded in for price cuts at Night City's many car dealers. These can stack up to a 100% discount, allowing V to get new cars absolutely free if they save up enough.\nIn order to accept the Cyberpunk 2077 quest \"Push it to the Limit,\" players must first complete Phantom Liberty's story through the main quest \"Spider and the Fly.\" Once V has finished the first three introductory missions and returned to the full open world, they may see a small, blue-green steering wheel icon on the map in Pacifica. If they pull up near it, they'll see a bright yellow car, and receive a call from El Capitan goading them into stealing it. V should hop into the driver's seat and head toward the destination.\nBut before long, a caravan of gang members pull up behind V. They'll do everything they can to stop the car from getting to El Capitan's garage. V can either take out their pursuers or shake them off; with the new vehicular combat mechanic, they can fire weapons out the window to keep the pressure on. If they make enough noise during the first leg of the chase, the police may show up to further complicate things. V doesn't need to arrive unharmed, but they do need to arrive intact, so sometimes it's better to avoid a fight than to drive right into one.\nOnce V parks in the designated garage, El Capitan emerges and congratulates them on a job well done. In short, he wants to repeat the same scheme over and over again, paying V to steal desirable cars and deliver them to exacting buyers across the city. With that, Vehicle Contracts become available all over the map. V can start undertaking them at any time, simply by opening the door of a target car and heading toward the destination. When they do, they'll know they're headed in the right direction if the quest title \"Just Another Story\" pops up in the top right corner of the screen.\nFor the most part, future Vehicle Contract quests don't change much from V's initial brush with El Capitan. Of course, the vehicles themselves are often different, as are the places where they're parked and the locations of the buyers V has to deliver them to. They can be found on the map with the same blue-green steering wheel icon that marks the original \"Push it to the Limit\" quest.\nWhat does make future Vehicle Contracts more interesting, though, are the optional objectives the later ones include. They're not strictly required, but they do directly affect the amount and quality of the rewards V receives, so it's worth keeping an eye on them and at least trying to adhere. There are four possible optional objectives: a time limit, a hostile tail, a hacking challenge, or an \"undamaged\" condition. Satisfying a Vehicle Contract's optional condition means V will be treated to an extra crate full of Tier Five items - Legendary weapons, armor, and attachments - upon completion of the job.\nTime limits work exactly as expected, with a clock constantly ticking down until the extra rewards expire. Sometimes, V will instead be pursued by the car's rightful owner, rival thieves, police, or all of the above, as they were in the introductory Vehicle Contract \"Push it to the Limit.\" At other times, they'll have to complete a hacking mini-game before they can even get into the car. The most difficult optional objectives, though, require V to deliver the car completely unharmed. The slightest dent or scratch, and they can wave goodbye to the extra rewards.\nWhile the other side quests in Phantom Liberty are pretty limited in terms of scope, \"Push it to the Limit\" unlocks a whole new category of side activities. Vehicle Contracts might not be the easiest or most popular feature, but they provide a wonderful tour through some of the DLC's new features, and the rewards are more than worth the effort. Even though it's technically optional, the Cyberpunk 2077 side quest \"Push it to the Limit\" should be every player's first priority.\n"}

Director Larry Charles (Borat) and writers Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp have brought the earnest bravado of Broadway (or more accurately a half-hour performance born from Upright Citizens Bridage training) to the big screen with a star-studded cast and show-stopping numbers. Jackson and Sharp, who also originated the original show, star as two identical twins who accidentally reconnect at work and set out to reunite their family.\nTheir parents are played by Megan Mullally (Will & Grace) and Nathan Lane (The Birdcage), who give some of the most outlandish performances of their career — which is really saying something. Dicks: The Musical also stars Megan Thee Stallion as a \"lady boss\" who will take no disrespect from her underlings and Saturday Night Live's Bowen Yang as the movie's fabulous and fashion-forward incarnation of God. If that sounds like the recipe for a good time, just wait to see how wild it gets as the show goes on.\nRelated: The 20 Best Musicals Of All Time\nScreen Rant spoke with stars Megan Mullally & Nathan Lane about getting into their Parent Trap-esque characters for Dicks: The Musical, finding their voices for set, and cozying up to the animatronic creatures known as the Sewer Boys.

I did, for sure.\nMegan, I love the voice that you found for Evelyn. How did you find her, and then connect that to your singing?\nMegan Mullally: Oh, thank you. Well, it came to me in a dream. [Laughs] I don't know. I always just have a very weird, ephemeral way of coming up with characters, I guess. Not logical; more just my gut.\nNick was running lines with me before we ever started, and I was doing it, and Nick liked it. And then when we first started rehearsing, there were a few people maybe who didn't like it; producer types, in that realm, and maybe it was suggested to me that I not do it. And I said, \"Well, I am going to do it,\" and I did it. So, that's how it happened.\nNathan, Harris and the Sewer Boys is his own little family melodrama there. How close did you have to get to those puppets?\nNathan Lane: That's the sequel. Harris and the Sewer Boys: Dicks Continued.\nWell, very close. I had to spit ham into their mouth. Yes, close. I got close physically and emotionally. That's what happens when you rescue Sewer Boys. It's such a bizarre thing. The Sewer Boys had a history because, in the original sketch, they were just referenced. You never saw them, and it was suggested that perhaps he was having sex with them.\nOh?!\nNathan Lane: That very reaction was what I believe A24 and Peter Chernin Entertainment thought, too. In fact, a group of men went, \"Oh?!\" And they said, \"That's where I believe if there is a line on this film, this is where we're going to draw it, and Harris cannot be having sex with anyone with Boys in their name.\" The notion of human actors playing them, guys from Cirque de Soleil swinging in the cage, that was done away with, and it had to be puppets.\nI hope that no puppeteers were harmed in the making of throwing ham at the Sewer Boys.\nNathan Lane: I don't think so. I think I had a pretty good aim. But these aren't sophisticated puppets. I mean. Maybe I vaguely remember some sort of animatronic bit, where maybe their mouths might move a little. I don't know. But, essentially, it was just two or three people with sticks going like this. It was a lot of this; just people doing that. And so they would go like this.

{"title": "Are Any Of The Ghosts Real In A Haunting In Venice?", "date": "2023-10-02 20:30:28", "text": "Ghosts are at the heart of Kenneth Branagh’s A Haunting in Venice, but are the supernatural forces actually present or can they be explained away?\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for A Haunting in Venice.\nWhile most of A Haunting in Venice’s mysteries are neatly tied up, the story remains elusive when it comes to the reality of its titular haunting. The film, Kenneth Branagh’s third outing as the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, finds itself blending genres and breaking with numerous series conventions. In A Haunting in Venice, a retired, disillusioned Poirot is invited to witness a séance at the home of an opera singer who wishes to commune with her late daughter. However, the macabre evening takes an even darker turn when the psychic medium is found dead, with a retired Poirot forced to take on the case.\nA Haunting in Venice is the first of Branagh’s three Hercule Poirot movies to change its name from the original book’s title, and it diverges from the source material in other ways. Agatha Christie’s novel Hallowe’en Party takes place at an English estate rather than a Venetian Palazzo. While the central mystery is largely the same, the book does not feature a séance, nor do ghosts play a major part in the story. The decision to focus more heavily on the supernatural elements imbues A Haunting in Venice with an affecting atmosphere. However, it’s unclear whether the film’s many ghosts are another misdirection or a confirmation of the supernatural.\nWhile A Haunting in Venice’s cast of characters spends the entire movie being menaced by apparently supernatural forces, the vast majority of these occurrences can be rationally explained. The troubling visions of ghosts and sounds of children’s laughter that Poirot hears throughout the film are in line with the legend that the Palazzo is haunted by the spirits of children, and the deceased Alicia Drake appears to Poirot multiple times throughout the film, both as a child and in her drowned form. However, these visions can largely be explained as the result of drinking tea laced with Rowena Drake’s (Kelly Reilly) hallucinogenic honey.\nOther supernatural occurrences can be explained with a plot spearheaded by Tina Fey’s Haunting in Venice character, Ariadne Oliver, in order to generate material for a best-selling book about Hercule Poirot being stumped by the medium Joyce Reynolds (Michelle Yeoh). Ariadne and Poirot’s ex-detective bodyguard, Vitale (Riccardo Scamarcio), feed Joyce information about the Alicia Drake case and about Poirot’s life in order to give her the appearance of psychic clairvoyance. Joyce’s accusation that someone murdered Alicia Drake is contrived as a means of injecting drama into Ariadne’s planned book. Unfortunately, their lie proves prescient, resulting in Joyce’s murder at the hands of Alicia Drake’s killer.\nWhile the plot rationally explains away most of its hauntings, some vaguely supernatural occurrences are purposefully left unexplained. The young Leopold Ferrier (Jude Hill) seems to actually be imbued with the ability to speak with the Palazzo’s ghosts. Leopold claims that the spectral children told him Joyce Reynolds is a fake, a claim that proves true. Leopold also seems capable of hearing the children’s laughter like Poirot does, implying that it’s not an auditory hallucination at all. While Rowena Drake’s death is apparently the result of her slipping over the balcony, a split-second manifestation of the drowned Alicia Drake appears to pull her over.\nWhat’s more, the teacup in Alicia’s room may be a signal of her spectral presence. The falling teacup causes Poirot to find a photo that sets A Haunting in Venice's ending in motion by triggering the realization of Alicia’s true killer. However, the teacup isn't jostled or moved in any way. Having been in the same position for months, it happens to fall at the precise moment that leads to Alicia’s murderer being brought to justice. All of these individual details are small, but they paint a larger picture of a supernatural force that is difficult to dismiss.\nThe ambiguity of the ghosts in A Haunting in Venice is central to the film’s themes of faith and cynicism. At the outset of the story, Poirot’s past dealings have brought him to a point of utter disillusionment wherein the existence of ghosts, God, or any kind of cosmic justice seems impossible. However, this airtight certainty is keeping the detective from living his life. The events of A Haunting in Venice — both the real and the apparently supernatural — force him to acknowledge that he could be wrong about the nihilism of the universe. Ultimately, the only way to honor the ghosts of the past is to accept their existence.\n"}

Unimaginably vast, the city covers the entire eastern seaboard of the United States, stretching from the northernmost part of America (including parts of Canada) to the southernmost tip of the Florida peninsula. The megalopolis is also densely populated, serving as home to hundreds of millions of people.\nThe sprawling supercity made its first appearance in the Judge Dredd universe in the late 1970s via comic stories by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra published in 2000 AD. Since its introduction, Mega-City One would see its massive population take hit after serious hit. Various wars and pestilence over the decades would significantly reduce the number of people living in the city.\nRelated: Judge Dredd Art Shows What Even Movie Fans Missed About Mega-City One\nJudge Dredd’s city started as an extended urban area stretching from Washington, D.C. to the Big Apple in the late 2020s. It was intended as a metropolitan area that connects the nation’s capital to New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and other East Coast states, providing housing and work for those living in and around the region. Its population would balloon in the next few years, laying the foundation of what would become the first American mega-city. It would quickly expand in size to accommodate the unstoppable growth of its population, enveloping Massachusetts (and beyond) in the north, Florida in the south, and parts of Ohio in the west.\nIn 2070, the global Atomic War transforms the majority of the United States into radioactive wasteland. Mega-City One survives the nuclear war because of its experimental laser shield technology. But it soon finds itself attracting millions of refugees from less fortunate American cities. The situation forces the city to resort to building towering apartment blocks that can house more than 50,000 people. Block construction over the next 30 years causes Mega-City One’s population to reach 800 million by the start of the 22nd century. By the mid-2100s, however, that number would be reduced to half its size.\nDue to the high crime rate within Mega-City One, death is almost like a daily occurrence for its citizens. Going into the 22nd century, however, the already hardened population would be further traumatized. In 2104, several block wars would erupt across the megalopolis, resulting in major casualties. But that is actually just a diversion manufactured by the Soviet Judges of East-Meg One in Russia to launch a nuclear attack on the southern sectors of Dredd’s home turf, taking 150 million lives. The ensuing radioactive fallout, nuclear winter, and starvation of this event (dubbed the Apocalypse War) would further inflict a massive death count.\nJudge Dredd would later put an end to the war by giving East-Meg One and its no-good Soviet Judges a taste of their own medicine. But the Apocalypse War causes Mega-City One’s population to drop from 800 million to 400 million. Barely just rebuilding after a nuke attack, the city would again face another adversity in the early 2110s thanks to evil witches who turn Mega-City One into a Necropolis ruled by undead judges favoring slaughter over street justice. With Dredd retired (and later becoming amnesiac), the corrupt Justice System would lead to 60 million deaths by 2112.\nIn 2126, terrorists get their hands on a dozen nuclear weapons and set them off around Mega-City One, instantly killing 4 million. Still reeling after yet another nuclear bombing, the city would be beset just a year later by the Half-Life epidemic, a psychic disease that turns people into murderers, taking another million lives. But these events pale in comparison to 2134’s Day of Chaos, wherein a biological WMD wipes out nearly 90 percent of Mega-City One’s population. From 400 million inhabitants three decades before, that number drops to about 40 million by the mid-2130s.\nStill, those major events don’t keep the megalopolis down for long. By the start of the 2140s, Mega-City One would see its population recover relatively quickly to breach the 100 million mark, taking into account the constant influx of immigrants after the events of the Day of Chaos. By the year 2145, the population estimate is around 130 million. But if Mega-City One's history in Judge Dredd teaches anything, that number will likely take another major hit soon.\nGuile Canencia is a freelance writer from Cebu, Philippines.

{"title": "Friday The 13th: Every Filming Location In The Horror Movie Franchise", "date": "2023-10-02 20:41:26", "text": "Friday the 13th has used a variety of locations to depict Camp Crystal Lake over the years. Here's where each movie in the franchise was shot. \nWARNING: Spoilers ahead for Friday the 13th.\nThe Friday the 13th series is one of the most iconic franchises of the horror genre due mainly to its iconic setting of Camp Crystal Lake, which was shot in various locations. Jason Voorhees owes much of his villainous notoriety to his wooded hunting grounds that have served as the site for dozens of his gruesome killings in his notorious hockey mask. Camp Crystal Lake is an essential component of the Friday the 13th series since it was where the vengeful horror legend was born. It has become nearly as iconic as its evil resident slasher Jason, considering how the fictional summer campground established a thematic standard for modern slasher films and the horror genre in the past few decades.\nCrystal Lake's heavy forest setting provides dense coverage for Jason to hide under the cover of darkness as he picks off his unsuspecting victims one by one. The simple log cabins at Camp Crystal Lake provide limited hiding spaces for those unfortunate enough to get caught in Jason's violent grasp, most of whom are smoking, drinking, or engaging in other forms of youthful debauchery. The lake itself is the place where Jason drowned due to his counselors' negligence and marked the original story of Jason's dark upbringing. Given the significance of Camp Crystal Lake to the overall story of Jason Voorhees, here are all the Friday the 13th shooting locations listed by the franchise's chronology.\nRELATED: Every Friday The 13th Movie Ranked By Kill Count\nThe real-world setting of the first Friday the 13th film is by far the most famous. The grounds used for Camp Crystal Lake is a Boy Scout retreat called Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco located in Hardwick, New Jersey. The camp is still operating to this day, but unfortunately, that means that fans can't visit the site without getting in trouble for trespassing. However, No-Be-Bo-Sco occasionally holds elaborate Crystal Lake Tours on select Friday the 13th days complete with props and memorabilia.\nNearby Blairstown, where Crystal Lake's own town was shot, also pays tribute to the film with an exhibit at the Blairstown Museum that expanded to a full-on Friday the 13th museum. Locals express that the date of Friday the 13th has become a sort of holiday for the community and the town holds a \"Jason Fest\" to celebrate the film's legacy. The Roy's Hall concert venue in Blairstown typically screens Friday the 13th on these days as well as appearing in a shot of the film itself. Interior shots were also shot next door to Blairstown in Hope.\nThe sequel moved its filming locations from New Jersey to Connecticut, shooting in the rural and heavily wooded county of Litchfield. The village of New Preston provided the backdrop for downtown scenes including the casino where the counselors visited the bar. The cabins along Camp Kenmont's North Spectacle Pond, located just outside the town of Kent, were where Jason stalked his prey at Camp Crystal Lake. In addition, the city of Waterbury, located in the much more urbanized eastern part of Connecticut, was where audiences visited the house of the sole survivor of the first film, Alice Hardy.\nUnfortunately, the sets for this entry have not been nearly as well-preserved as those for the first film. Alice's house in Waterbury has been demolished, although interior scenes were shot in what is now a rehabilitation center in Torrington. The casino in New Preston was a popular nightlife spot for years before completely burning down. Camp Kenmont is still active but the property was sold to another owner. The residences on North Spectacle Pond called Bromica Lodge were also destroyed.\nPart III marks the first time that a Friday the 13th film was not shot on the East Coast since the crew needed a more controlled environment to regulate the movie's 3D effects. Instead, production took place in Veluzat Motion Picture Ranch in Santa Clarita, California with its own constructed barn, cabin, and lake. The ranch is still used to this day as a production site, but the cabin that was used in the film burned down in 2012. In addition, the scene with the biker gang was shot at what is now the Green Valley Cafe in the Santa Clarita area.\nRELATED: 10 Jason Voorhees Cosplays That Should Be Inspiration For A Friday The 13th Reboot\nThe opening to The Final Chapter was also at Veluzat Ranch but the rest of the film takes place in different locations. The expendable teens went skinny-dipping in the waters of Zaca Lake while they hiked along the trails that surround the area. Strangely, the Zaca Lake Lodge marks the third time so far that a Friday the 13th shooting location burned down, this time more recently in 2016. The place is a popular filming site with its ties to Hollywood productions going all the way back to the silent era. The lake was also where the Universal Monster classic Creature from the Black Lagoon was shot. In addition, the residence of Tommy Jarvis and his family is a privately owned house in Topanga, CA.\nProduction for the Friday the 13th series remained in California in various locations around the Los Angeles area. As opposed to the other entries in the franchise, a chunk of the action was shot in the middle of an urban area, albeit in the idyllic Franklin Canyon Park, tucked inside the Beverly Hills portion of the Santa Monica Mountains. The Pineway Halfway House where Tommy Jarvis is institutionalized is a privately-owned property called Rancho Rosito located in Camarillo, California. Corey Feldman's cameo was shot in his own backyard as he was too who was busy shooting The Goonies to appear on set.\nFor the sixth film, production was primarily moved down south to Georgia. The town scenes, including the sheriff's office where Tommy Jarvis fails to convince the law that Jason is back from the dead, were shot in Covington. Located outside of Atlanta, the small city shares common ground with Rob Zombie's Halloween II which was also shot there. The camp scenes took place in Camp Daniel Morgan around Hard Labor Creek State Park's Lake Rutledge a couple of miles east of Covington. Luckily, the camp still exists and holds occasional tours and screenings, perhaps because Jason Lives is so well-beloved by Friday the 13th fans.\nA point of contention exists over which cemetery Jason emerged from at the beginning of the film. Fansites often state that it was Covington Cemetary, but screencap comparisons and recovered call sheet documents reveal that it was actually Old Madison Cemetary in Madison, GA. It's comforting to know that what is considered arguably the most entertaining entry in the series has had its shooting locations comparatively well-preserved.\nRELATED: 10 Ways Jason Lives Saved The Friday The 13th Franchise\nProduction for The New Blood stayed in the south but moved over to neighboring Alabama, specifically within Baldwin County and around the city of Mobile. Byrnes Lake was chosen for the primary outdoor location, although the cabins were all constructed for the film only to be torn down once production ended. There was even a gator wrangler hired to be on set in case the beasts attacked the cast and crew but fortunately, the gators weren't active during the time of the shooting. A number of interiors were also built in Los Angeles for filming and the crew went back to Topanga Canyon, California for the interiors of the house.\nJason's trip to New York City infamously doesn't even take place within The Big Apple for the majority of the movie. Despite the fact that Jason Takes Manhattan was the most expensive Friday the 13th film to date, its $5 million budget still wouldn't cover the would-be cost of shooting entirely in New York. Production took place mostly in Vancouver and surrounding areas within British Columbia as well as with some interior shots in Los Angeles. The only scene that was legitimately shot in New York was in Times Square, which attracted a sizable crowd of Friday the 13th fans to watch Jason actor Kane Hodder perform in the hockey mask.\nThe crew returned to southern California to shoot the ninth installment in Thousand Oaks. The town contained the Canyon Ranch Studio for outdoor production, as well as nearby urban locales such as Joey B.'s Diner. The Voorhees residence where Jason goes to hell was filmed at a private house in the suburban West Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles, specifically on Eagle Mountain Street.\nRELATED: 10 Best Summer Camp Movies\nThe horror sci-fi crossover Jason X takes place entirely on a spaceship. The film crew used a soundstage to construct the sets in Toronto, Canada. There are no Camp Crystal Lake locales to be found here beyond a virtual simulation that's created for part of the movie. However, Jason X includes a fun cameo appearance where director David Cronenberg gets stabbed and showcases one of the franchise's most creative kills with Jason killing someone in a vat of liquid nitrogen.\nAfter years of teasing audiences and studio meddling, the big crossover between two icons of the slasher sub-genre, Freddy vs. Jason, was born. It was shot in and around Vancouver, using an impressive amount of on-location settings compared to the past few previous films. Jason's shack was located along the shore of the picturesque Buntzen Lake, although the set was demolished after filming. However, there were also some interiors and street shots that were filmed on a Universal Studios lot in Hollywood.\nRELATED: How Does Freddy vs. Jason Still Hold This Horror Record After 20 Years?\nThe 2009 remake of Friday the 13th took the action to Central Texas around the Austin area. Neighboring Bastrop provided outdoor recreation areas for camp scenes on Friday the 13th, while Austin, Round Rock, and Wimberley contained on-location structures like houses and stores. The city of Austin itself conveniently holds film studios for a more controlled environment as well. Additionally, the crew also traveled to Camp Fern in the East Texas town of Marshall to shoot more on-location outdoor scenes.\n"}

Goyer, showrunner of the Apple TV Plus show Foundation, teases how the Mule will impact season 3 of the hit science-fiction story.\nFoundation showrunner David S. Goyer teases how new villain the Mule will shake up a prospective season 3 of the hit Apple TV Plus series. First released on the streamer in 2021, Goyer's series is loosely based on source material from acclaimed author Isaac Asimov. The explosive Foundation season 2 finale recently aired on Apple TV Plus last month, setting up an even more thrilling story to come with Mikael Persbrandt's the Mule poised to be a central figure.\nNow, as audiences await news regarding the not-yet-confirmed Foundation season 3, Goyer teases in an interview with TVLine how the Mule will factor into the story going forward. The showrunner hypes up the villain's immense power, promising that things are only going to get more intense in the episodes to come. Check out Goyer's full comment below:\n\n“Yes, he is super scary. He’s magnitudes of order more powerful than Tellem. When Asimov created [the Mule], it was a character that flipped the whole table over. When the Mule enters the story properly in [a potential] Season 3, that’s completely what he does… As crazy as the end of Season 2 is, Season 3 is even crazier. You haven’t seen anything yet.”\n\n“Yes, he is super scary. He’s magnitudes of order more powerful than Tellem. When Asimov created [the Mule], it was a character that flipped the whole table over.

Despite these strong reviews, however, the sci-fi show hasn't actually be renewed for season 3 yet. Season 2 was confirmed back in October 2021, before the first batch of episodes had even finished airing, and the lack of a renewal in the same time frame for season 3 could be interpreted as somewhat concerning.\nThat being said, the impact of the WGA strike in this case cannot be understated. Beginning earlier this year in May, the writers strike is almost certainly why Apple has not yet announced season 3. With the strike now over, it's entirely possible that an announcement is imminent. Goyer himself is evidently very confident in the show's future, recently revealing that he has charted a course for Foundation up to season 8.\nWhat's more, Foundation remains a surprisingly affordable series, at least for what it is. The budget for season 2 has yet to be made public, but season 1 cost only $45 million, a very small sum considering what competitors are spending on the likes of The Rings of Power and Stranger Things. With a season 2 budget that is probably a little larger but still relatively modest, and with impressive performance on various popularity metrics, it's looking likely that Goyer will indeed get to explore the Mule's impact on the story in Foundation season 3.\nSource: TVLine\n"}
{"title": "Everything Rick & Morty's Creators & Crew Have Said About Justin Roiland's Recast", "date": "2023-10-02 20:50:30", "text": "Adult Swim is continuing Rick and Morty, recasting Justin Roiland’s characters for season 7. Here’s what the creators and crew say on the subject.\nIn attempts to ease their viewers' concerns, the creators and crew of Rick and Morty have spoken candidly about the process of recasting Justin Roiland for season 7. Co-creator Roiland, who voiced the titular interdimensional adventurers, was fired from Adult Swim's hit series following a series of abuse allegations. Adult Swim decided, however, to continue the series, opting to recast Roiland's characters.\nJustin Roiland created Rick and Morty with Dan Harmon, who also functions as the show's primary writer. After six highly successful seasons, the show will return with Rick and Morty season 7. However, the Rick and Morty cast will feature two new actors in Roiland's roles. Nevertheless, writers and producers have stated they are confident in maintaining the level of quality, some even claiming season 7 is an improvement.\nRick and Morty producer, Steve Levy, has confirmed that the new actors portraying Rick and Morty will sound like Justin Roiland. Asked whether the show would change the voices following Roiland's recasting, possibly addressed by the show's multiverse plot lines and meta-narratives, Levy stated that the voices would remain the same. Levy commented that \"the characters are the same characters,\" and the transition into a new cast would be seamless (via IGN).\nIn a recent interview, Rick and Morty co-creator, Dan Harmon, discussed his professional relationship with Roiland throughout the show's history. Despite creating the hit series together, a divide between the two quickly developed after Harmon employed several fellow writers from Community for Rick and Morty season 2. Roiland slowly withdrew from the writers' room, as Harmon observed: \"I’d come to find out later that it was like, ‘Oh, Harmon brought in his Harmon writers,’ and, man, that is not how I saw it.\" The pair's relationship would never recover and, reportedly, they have not spoken to each other since 2019.\nDan Harmon also discussed his reaction to the Justin Roiland allegations. Harmon initially declined to comment on the abuse allegations but has since decided he cannot remain silent and expressed his sympathies and remorse. Harmon also has stated his regret over not commenting earlier, saying:\n\"It’s other people’s safety and comfort that got damaged while I obsessed over a cartoon’s quality. Trust has now been violated between countless people and a show designed to please them. I’m frustrated, ashamed and heartbroken that a lot of hard work, joy and passion can be leveraged to exploit and harm strangers.\"\nAdult Swim President Michael Ouweleen also clarified that the cast for Rick and Morty season 7 would not be imitators and explained audiences won't notice Justin Roiland's recast. Despite stating that the new Rick and Morty voices will sound like Roiland, Ouweleen reiterates that the Rick and Morty protagonists would remain the same, in every respect, despite very minor differences in performance. Ouweleen likened the circumstance to successive Bugs Bunny actors: \"It's not Mel Blanc! And yet we recognize the character. I even think that for Rick and Morty we will do even better... It will be fine. It'll be great.\"\nWriter and producer Steve Levy has suggested Rick and Morty season 7 is better without Roiland involved. While commenting on the writing team behind Rick and Morty season 7, Levy expressed great enthusiasm, praising the team for maintaining the same level of quality as the previous beloved seasons. Both Levy and Ouweleen have asserted that the season will certainly not suffer creatively without Roiland, with Levy stating:\n\"The work that we’re doing across the board has only gotten better. When the new season comes out, we’ll focus on how amazing it all turned out. We hope the fans will realize that this is the same old show, maybe even better!”\nSteve Levy has also stated the reason they decided Rick and Morty would continue without Roiland. Levy acknowledges the hardworking writing team who have contributed greatly to Rick and Morty's success over the years as the primary factor in continuing the series. Levy says:\n\"It would have been very easy to just say, ‘I’m done and I don’t want to do anything with this show anymore.’ But our crew said, ‘No, we’re not going to let one person drag down all of our hard work.’ This show is created by this team — this family of incredibly hardworking people, and we are going to push through and show the world that we aren’t going to miss a beat.\"\nOuweleen has wholly supported the plan to recast Rick and Morty for season 7. While commenting on the importance of vocal performance in animation, Ouweleen reiterated his support for the Rick and Morty writing team and the recasting efforts. Ouweleen said:\n\"Listen: voices are obviously super important in an animated series. And, of course, none of us wanted to go through what we went through. But I've been in animation for a long time, and I know that what makes a series is its different parts coming together. If the voices are obviously a big part, there is also the writing of the characters, their design... I have reason to believe that the transition will go well.\"\nDiscussing the future of Rick and Morty, Dan Harmon has revealed talks with Warner Bros. Studios to make a feature-length Rick and Morty movie. Referring to it as a \"super episode,\" Harmon drew a comparison with the South Park movie, Bigger, Longer, Uncut. Harmon also suggested that Rick and Morty could continue for decades, drawing a comparison with long-running animation, The Simpsons.\nRELATED: 10 Rick & Morty Story Ideas That Would Be Perfect For Dan Harmon's Movie\nThe first glimpse at the actors cast to replace Roiland has been revealed in Rick and Morty's season 7 trailer. The trailer provides several snippets of dialogue from each of the titular characters, which seemingly have adhered to Levy and Ouweleen's assertions. While there are some very minor changes in performance, the characters are essentially the same. While clearly not imitations, they are very clearly still Rick and Morty.\nAdult Swim has elected not to reveal the names of the actors cast as Rick and Morty until the season premiere on October 15, 2023. This comes after the performers featured heavily throughout the season's trailer. Despite perpetuating the casting mystery a little longer, it is unlikely to be an earth-shattering revelation, as Harmon has said the actors are \"unknown.\" Nevertheless, Rick and Morty season 7 is eagerly awaited, with many keen to know if the series will be the same without Roiland.\nRichard Craig is a musician and writer based in Brighton, UK. Recently completing an MA degree in Music and Sound Art, Richard has written extensively about movie genre studies and film soundtracks, paying particular attention to the horror genre and appearances of folk music. Richard's Bachelor's degree dissertation was chosen for publication in the first major academic collection on the folk horror genre, The Routledge Companion to Folk Horror. Released in October 2023, Richard's chapter explores the relationship between the Estonian horror movie November, and Estonian rune songs. Richard is also an accomplished film score composer, and most notably performed a live soundtrack to the 1922 silent film essay Haxan: Witchcraft Through the Ages. "}
{"title": "Can 200+ Improvements Fix Payday 3's Disaster Of A Launch?", "date": "2023-10-02 21:00:28", "text": "Payday 3's launch has been one of the worst of 2023, but developer Starbreeze Studios has revealed its plans to fix the cooperative shooter.\nPayday 3 was finally released on all current-gen consoles and PC - and was included as part of the main Xbox, PC, and Ultimate Game Pass tiers - on September 21, 2023. The title was highly anticipated by fans of the heist shooter series who had waited just over a decade since the release of its predecessor, Payday 2, but unfortunately, it has suffered from one of the worst launches of the year so far. Developer Starbreeze Studios seems intent on turning things around, though, promising over 200 improvements are on the way.\nPayday 3 picks up many years after the Payday Gang's crime spree in Washington DC in 2013's Payday 2. The group appeared to have retired after this, but were forced back into action to deal with a threat in New York, and much like the previous titles before it, Payday 3 would see players engaging in a variety of heists both in single-player with AI teammates or in online co-op with a team of up to three other players.\nRelated: \"Smart, Fun, And Chaotic In Every Way\" - Payday 3 Review\nDespite having a single-player option, the Payday games are primarily designed for online cooperative play. Therefore, the fact that the game's matchmaking was completely broken at launch was a major issue. Another issue was that the game - as is a growing trend in the industry these days - required players to be constantly online regardless of whether they were playing solo or with others.\nPayday 3 also suffered from frequent server crashes, which has left a huge number of players unable to play the game completely. As a result, those who bought the game on Steam reviewed the game en masse to vent their frustrations with it currently sitting at an overall Mostly Negative score, and positioned within the top 50 worst-rated games on the platform, with one Steam user dubbing it \"Payday 3: Main Menu Simulator\"​​​​.\nRelated: \"I Think I Would Be A Horrible Bank Robber\" - Payday 3's Lead Producer Interview\nOn September 25, Almir Listo, global brand director for Payday 3's developers, Starbreeze Studios, addressed the need for the game to always be online when responding to a comment on a Twitch stream on the official PAYDAY The Game channel. Regarding an offline mode, Listo said, “We cannot give, right now, a clear yes or no answer on this topic because it’s four days since launch. We did not foresee the incredible difficulties you had logging into the game. And we will address that, and answer that properly, as soon as we can.”\nStarbreeze Entertainment has since announced a plan for fixing the title on its official website. The plan consists of over 200 quality-of-life improvements coming this month, with an unspecified number of further improvements, bug fixes, new content, and functionality coming at later dates throughout the Fall before the Syntax Error DLC launches in Winter.\nThe update also addressed the game's matchmaking issues, stating that fixes had been made on September 26 and September 29 and that Payday 3 is \"stable\" and has had \"good performance\" after the completed maintenance. Starbreeze Entertainment's CEO Tobias Sjögren went on to thank the community for its patience with a launch that was \"not the start [Starbreeze] wanted\" and explained that the studio's business model is \"a marathon and not a sprint\", which indicates even further, regular updates and enhancements to the game to support Payday 3's live-service roadmap.\nWhen it actually works, Payday 3 can be a solid title that more than holds up to the standards of its predecessors, so hopefully these fixes will be enough to save it. For example, titles such as Cyberpunk 2077 have had disastrous launches but have been redeemed by a number of updates since. However, in a time when there are so many other titles on offer, with October alone being full of new major releases, publishers are running more of a risk of killing their games at launch by forcing studios to release them in broken or unfinished states, especially if they're dependent on fans coming back regularly for live-service content like Payday 3.\nSources: Steam, PAYDAYTheGame/Twitch, Starbreeze Entertainment\n"}
{"title": "Star Wars Visions Season 3: Story, Updates, Release Date Prediction, Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-02 21:00:28", "text": "While Lucasfilm hasn't announced Star Wars Visions season 3, here's everything we know about the project and when it will most likely be released.\nThe first two seasons of Star Wars: Visions on Disney+ provided a unique spin on the Star Wars universe, leading viewers to anticipate the announcement of season 3. With only nine episodes per season, each with a short runtime, there is plenty of room for Star Wars: Visions to continue telling new stories. The variety on display from each animation studio offers a refreshing perspective on the franchise in an era where many Star Wars TV shows feel the same.\nAlthough Star Wars: Visions is considered non-canon, the show may influence the main Star Wars timeline, just as the old Expanded Universe continues to influence the current canon. Many Star Wars: Visions episodes were set in a different timeline, especially in season 1, but many episodes from season 2 seemed as though they could fit in the canon timeline. With so much creativity and potential to impact the larger franchise, there are plenty of reasons to be excited about a potential Star Wars: Visions season 3.\nRelated: How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order\nWhile the release of Star Wars: Visions season 3 is highly probable, Lucasfilm has not officially confirmed it. This is understandable since Star Wars: Visions season 2 came out in May 2023, and there are plenty of other shows to keep fans busy and upcoming Star Wars movies to get audiences excited. It will likely be some time before Lucasfilm needs to announce any details about Star Wars: Visions season 3.\nThe popularity of Star Wars: Visions season 1 and 2 is the most significant reason for season 3 to happen. As a massive multimedia franchise, Star Wars can sometimes feel repetitive and hard to keep up with, but Star Wars: Visions focuses on unique standalone stories. Each studio has complete freedom to use a different animation style and experiment with how to tell a Star Wars story.\nBased on past release dates, Star Wars: Visions season will probably be released on May 4, 2023. Season 1 dropped in September 2021, but season 2 came out on Star Wars Day in 2023, a much more effective release date. Star Wars: Visions season 3 may be a long way out, but Star Wars fans have plenty of content to look forward to in the meantime, and it will surely be worth the wait.\n"}
{"title": "Marvel Heroes Show Off Their Winter Apparel in New Ski Chalet Cover Series", "date": "2023-10-02 21:00:28", "text": "Marvel Comics heroes like Storm, Captain America and White Widow hit the slopes in new winter apparel for a series of ski chalet variant covers.\nFall may have just arrived, but a new line of ski chalet variant covers from Marvel preview several heroic favorites in the wintry months to come. Iconic heroes like Storm and Captain America are joined by rising stars such as White Widow and Spider-Boy for this series of snowy portraits. Fashion-inspired variant covers are not new to Marvel Comics, which has made waves with its haute couture-infused Hellfire Gala covers for the past three years. Of course, no one necessarily needs a special occasion to be fashionable, and this surprise showcase of winter apparel is a welcome treat.\nMarvel recently announced the series alongside a preview of five out of the total seven ski chalet variants.\nLucas Werneck's variant for Thunderbolts #1 and Russel Dauterman's cover for X-Men #29 debut on December 6. The following week, Greg Land's contribution for Captain America #4 arrives. The next three covers all hit the shelves on December 20, featuring J. Scott Campbell on Amazing Spider-Man #40, Pablo Villalobos for Doctor Strange #10, and Humberto Ramos' variant for Spider-Boy #2. David Nakayama concludes the festivities on December 27 with a cover for Spider-Woman #2.\nNakayama and Campbell's covers have not been revealed yet, but Marvel's announcement still provides the five other variants. The result is a veritable feast for the eyes. Werneck brings a signature level of beauty and grace to his action shot of the White Widow Yelena Belova. Land, often critiqued for the use of tracing in his comic work, delivers a pleasant surprise with his fresh rendition of Steve Rogers in a retro ski suit. However, Dauterman's Storm is perhaps the most notable of the series thus far, as the snow-robed Wind-Rider is transcendent. Ororo Munroe has proven quite the muse for Dauterman, as he designed Storm's current costume and has brought the consistent rendering of her natural hair texture into the mainstream at Marvel.\nWhile Marvel has certainly been working more fashion-inspired concepts into its variants in recent years, this trend is nothing new. Just as many of Marvel's writers in the '70s were authors who could only find consistent work in comics, numerous artists in the same era were fashion illustrators taking on side gigs in comic work. This trained eye for design is why so many iconic character looks and costumes have endured from that era until today. Arguably though, the zenith of the fashion industry's influence on Marvel Comics was the annual Marvel Swimsuit Special that ran from 1991 to 1995. What's old is new, and Marvel is certainly feeling fashion fever once again.\nOnly two covers have yet to reveal their take on heroic hilltop apparel.

{"title": "For All Mankind: Astronaut Confirms Horrifying Death In Apple TV+ Sci-Fi Show Is Realistic", "date": "2023-10-02 21:05:11", "text": "Astronaut Chris Hadfield breaks down the accuracy of shooting a gun on the moon in a scene from the acclaimed Apple TV+ series For All Mankind.\nAstronaut Chris Hadfield has confirmed the accuracy of a death in the series For All Mankind. The series follows an alternate reality in which the Soviet Union landed on the moon before the United States and the space race never ended. Each season has taken a time jump that delves further into what a continued competition between the world's superpowers would look like if they kept striving for the stars.\nAhead of the release of For All Mankind season 4, Hadfield breaks down a scene for Vanity Fair where he is shown a scene in which an American astronaut shoots a Soviet astronaut on the moon.\nHe discussed how gunfire on the moon is much more accurate as opposed to on Earth, citing the lack of air and oxygen, thus making the bullet shoot straighter and farther. Along with confirming the accuracy of the gunfire in the scene, he went on to explain how the impact of a bullet on a space suit was also true to life:\nIt's a hundred percent oxygen inside a spacesuit, so everything burns. We have had a fire inside a spacewalking suit. It was in test at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and even the aluminum was burning inside the suit. Fortunately, there was not a person in the suit. You don't want any sparks to be even possible inside a hundred percent oxygen environment.\nWhile earlier in his review of For All Mankind Hadfield bashed it as \"excruciating to watch\", he was impressed with the shooting scene. Hadfield had previously researched how guns would fire on the moon for his fiction thriller, The Apollo Murders. His praise comes not only from the point of view of an astronaut, but also as a storyteller. And compared to the accuracy of movies like Moonfall, For All Mankind has a lot going for it.\nDespite calling some of For All Mankind \"cartoonish\" after only a few episodes, the narrative of the show does at times supersede realistic science. This isn't the only film in which Hadfield pointed out inconsistencies. Notably, he commended on Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 for the scene that shows Star-Lord floating through space unprotected. Hadfield chalked this up to a viewer's experience, stating that it would have been done to more entice audiences. Another interesting scenario that Hadfield felt would be accurate if it ever occurred was the concept of someone born in space as shown in The Expanse.\nWhile For All Mankind may not hold up in all aspects, the show has taken an interesting premise and still clearly puts forth an effort in the topics it handles. Hadfield's critiques do make the show more interesting, especially when he points out the parts that line up with scientific accuracy.\nSource: Vanity Fair\n"}
{"title": "Why Daryl Dixon & Codron Can't Be Friends According To Walking Dead Star", "date": "2023-10-02 21:19:29", "text": "The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon star Romain Levi explains why Daryl and his character, Codron, can't be friends after what Daryl did to his brother.\nWarning: SPOILERS ahead for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 4! \nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon star Romain Levi has opened up about why his character, Codron, can never be friends with Daryl. In episode 1 of the spinoff series, Daryl kills Codron's brother, resulting in the Pouvoir Guerrier pursuing Daryl for revenge. The pair have fought twice so far, with Daryl gaining the upper hand or escaping Codron's grasp each time.\nSpeaking with Collider, Levi explained that, because Daryl killed Codron's brother, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon likely won't feature the pair becoming allies. He described how difficult it would be for Codron to forgive Daryl because his brother was such a major part of who he was. Check out what Levi had to say below:\nWhat happened between Daryl and his brother, it’s not easy for Codron to forgive or be respectful. In a way, to forgive someone is to accept what happened, and Codron doesn’t accept the situation. His brother was a part of himself, really, and Codron will never be the same after that. His brother was the only human being that he was very close to. And what would his brother think, if Codron were friends with Daryl? I’m not sure he’d be so happy about that. So, I won’t say yes he can or no he can’t because it’s not so easy in this situation.\nCodron's path of revenge against Daryl has only grown stronger as the Walking Dead series has progressed. This includes Codron going directly to the leader of the Pouvoir, Genet, to get a group of soldiers to help him in his quest to kill Daryl. His vengeance is fed into by Genet, who wants Daryl dead for destroying important research aboard one of the Pouvoir's ships before the start of the series.\nCodron's new faction in The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon wants Daryl dead just as much as he does. This means that, even if his allegiances were to change, he is still under orders to kill Daryl. He may also be tasked with killing Laurent, since Genet wants the boy dead for the optimism he brings the Union of Hope. If he were to succeed, this would further drive a wedge between him and Daryl.\nHowever, Genet's plan to kill Laurent could also be what makes Codron decide to stop hunting Daryl. The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon trailer teases Codron will hold Laurent at gunpoint, but it's unclear if he will kill the boy. Perhaps Codron will realize the monster he would become by killing a child, deciding to stop seeking revenge against Daryl not for himself, but for Laurent. However, with Daryl and Laurent escaping Paris in episode 4, anything could happen as season 1 reaches its apex.\nSource: Collider\n"}
{"title": "How Many People Actually Died In Pompeii", "date": "2023-10-02 21:21:26", "text": "Because Pompeii focuses on individual characters more than the community, the movie may leave viewers wondering about the real event’s death count.\nAfter watching Pompeii, viewers may be left wondering how many people died in the real-life tragedy the film is based on. The action romance movie tells the story of a Celtic gladiator named Milo who falls in love with a woman named Cassia and escapes slavery. Pompeii's story unravels in the days leading up to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. By the end of the movie, all the main characters have perished.\nThough scientists praised the movie for its relatively realistic depiction of the volcanic eruption and the city, Pompeii's true story had a vastly different aftermath. Mount Vesuvius impacted a wider area than what's shown on-screen, and the death toll looked quite different. Numerous people died due to the eruption, which included multiple waves. However, some escaped the impact and went on to live elsewhere.\nRELATED: 5 Best (& 5 Worst) Movies About Volcanoes\nPompeii doesn't specifically reveal how many people died in the tragedy, taking a narrative approach instead. In real life, approximately 2,000 people died in Pompeii due to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Unfortunately, the death toll included many more individuals than those located in Pompeii. The number is much higher when counting the deaths of people in Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae, Torre Annunziata, and other villages in the region (via Britannica). In total, History estimates that the number could be as high as 16,000 casualties.\nThe movie Pompeii opens with a quote from a letter in late 107 A.D. — not 79 A.D., the year of the eruption — written by Pliny the Younger, a Roman lawyer and author, to a historian named Tacitus. Combining his words and the images of the \"Two Maidens\" of Pompeii, the opening helps frame the events of the movie. The quote reads:\n\"In the darkness, you could hear the crying of women, the wailing of infants, and the shouting of men. Some prayed for help. Others wished for death. But, still, more imagined that there were no Gods left, and that the universe was plunged into eternal darkness.\"\nConsidering Pliny the Younger witnessed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius firsthand and survived to write about the event in letters, viewers can surmise that people survived the events of Pompeii. However, the movie doesn't actually depict any survivors. Instead, Milo and Cassia end up dying due to the fireballs and pyroclastic flow, even though they attempt to leave the city.\nRELATED: 10 Best Disaster Movies Ever, Ranked\nDespite the Pompeii movie's portrayal of events, volcanologist Claudio Scarpati and his colleagues found that 73% to 92% of citizens successfully escaped the town during the initial signs of Mount Vesuvius' eruption. It's unknown exactly how many of that percentage survived in the long run because people outside the walls of Pompeii, especially those in the nearby city of Herculaneum, died due to the second wave of pyroclastic flow (via NBC News). It's heavily debated by scholars how many people escaped the tragic aftermath of the eruption. Ultimately, despite what the movie Pompeii implies, it's approximated that several thousands of individuals lived.\nSources: Britannica, History, NBC News\nDani Kessel Odom (they/them) works as a Core Features Shift Writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "Malfoy's Missed Redemption: How Draco's Deleted Deathly Hallows Scene Would Have Ruined Harry Potter's Twist Ending", "date": "2023-10-02 21:30:28", "text": "A Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 deleted scene would have given Draco Malfoy a redemption but also could have ruined the plot.\nA deleted scene from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 would have redeemed Draco Malfoy, but it might have ruined Harry's twist ending in the process. The Slytherin student was Harry's Hogwarts rival for most of the Harry Potter series, but after joining Lord Voldemort, Draco discovered that he didn't enjoy Darkness as much as he had thought. Still, the character never truly got a redemption, instead choosing to be passive in the Second Wizarding War. The Harry Potter movies attempted to remedy this by adding a heroic scene for Draco Malfoy, but it was ultimately removed from Deathly Hallows Part 2's final cut.\nAt the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, what everyone presumed was Harry Potter's body was carried by Hagrid to the Hogwarts courtyard. Voldemort hoped that the Boy Who Lived's death would squash the resistance at the Castle, but he was wrong. Of course, Harry was actually still alive. In a deleted scene from this sequence, Draco Malfoy sees Harry get to his feet and rushes across the courtyard to toss him his wand. This scene never made it into the film, a fact that Draco fans have lamented for years.\nRELATED: Harry Potter Cast - Where Are They Now?\nDraco Malfoy was far from a true villain in Harry Potter, but he certainly had some rough moments. Deeply prejudiced against Muggle-borns, he established himself as a not-so-pleasant person the moment that Harry Potter met him. However, things changed for the character in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Voldemort had made him a Death Eater to punish his father, Lucius Malfoy, and gave him the seemingly impossible task of murdering Albus Dumbledore. The pressure of this began to tear Draco apart.\nThough he wasn't nearly as nasty after this in Harry Potter, and Harry even mentioned in the books that he felt a good deal of pity for his old rival, Draco never had a moment in which he took any sort of stand against Voldemort. Instead, he passively shrunk into the corner and waited for the horror to end. The deleted scene in Deathly Hallows Part 2 would have definitively answered whose side Draco was on and would have proven that he had it in him to be a hero. Of course, such a thing never happened in the books either, and it was for an excellent reason.\nWhen he entered the Forbidden Forest in Deathly Hallows, Harry already had Draco's wand. In fact, this was a key detail of this impactful moment. Though Draco hadn't known it, he had been the master of the Elder Wand since the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, when he disarmed Albus Dumbledore before Snape killed him. Though it wasn't the Elder Wand itself, Draco's wand became a sort of symbol of the wand's ownership. Therefore, when Harry wrenched it from Draco's hand at Malfoy Manor, the Elder Wand shifted its loyalty to Harry.\nThis moment at Malfoy Manor was included in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, so it's unclear how the deleted scene in Deathly Hallows Part 2 would have explained why Draco suddenly had the wand again at the Battle of Hogwarts. Even with some justification, though, this would have presented a significant problem. Wand loyalty doesn't transfer when a witch or wizard willingly gives their wand to another individual—there are countless times in Harry Potter that a borrowed wand was noted to not work properly for the borrower. Therefore, if Draco had given Harry his wand, Harry wouldn't have become master of the Elder Wand and would have lost his battle against Voldemort.\nAs previously mentioned, the deleted scene in Deathly Hallows may have come with some justification for how Draco got his wand back. Of course, he couldn't have forcefully acquired it from Harry because then the Elder Wand's loyalty would have shifted back to Draco. However, if Harry had somehow dropped the wand at the Battle of Hogwarts, and Draco picked it up, returning it to Harry in a big moment of bravery and redemption might not have messed with the Elder Wand's loyalty. Still, this would have been pretty muddy ground for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 to wade through.\nWand loyalty may have been the key to Harry Potter's ending, but many questions remain unanswered about how it works. For example, even dropping a wand could be grounds for lost loyalty. Still, if Harry had dropped Draco's wand, would that have affected the Elder Wand - or would he have had to drop the Death Stick itself? It's all a little too complicated, which is likely why Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 deleted this scene to begin with. Ultimately, Draco was better off with an ambiguous redemption, no matter how great it would have been to see him join Harry's side.\n"}
{"title": "Nightwing & Superboy as Pokémon Trainers Proves DC NEEDS to Organize a Crossover", "date": "2023-10-02 21:30:28", "text": "In recent years, DC Comics has shown incredible creative foresight in its crossover content, but a Pokémon crossover would be a great opportunity.\nDespite DC Comics' willingness to take on crossovers and teams-ups with non-traditional partners or explore putting its heroes in situations outside the primary canonic DC universe, new fanart exposes its need to collaborate with Pokémon, one of the most popular and widely known franchises on Earth.\nNow the worlds of DC Comics and Pokémon have been brought together in works of fanart by the artist malenjoyer. In a pair of posts on Instagram, malenjoyer imagines Dick Grayson's Nightwing and Conner Kent's Superboy as Pokémon trainers with their Pokémon ready for battle.\nWhile malenjoyer's art is fascinating in and of itself, an equally interesting element to the illustrations is the suggestions it makes for DC - Pokémon crossover. Judging by the feedback both illustrations have gotten so far, it's a crossover event that would be quite popular with the fans.\nThe need for a DC Comics/Pokémon crossover is made all the stronger when considering the publisher's impressive recent history of non-traditional collaborations. \"Non-traditional\" in this context refers to crossovers that are not just between superheroes, but can include a range of content. Brian Buccellato and Christian Duce's upcoming Justice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong miniseries is a perfect illustration of the creative crossovers DC has been willing to explore. Indeed, this series is not your grandfather's crossover. As the title suggests, the story involves the DC's Justice League taking on Legendary Pictures' Monsterverse royalty. It's not the kind of crossover one would expect from a comic book publisher, but it is one that makes sense from a thematic and entertainment perspective.\nDC Comics has also found success in expanding the horizons of its superhero line-up by putting them in alternate reality situations that do not normally include heroes. Daniel Warren Johnson and Juan Gedeon's The Jurassic League limited series is emblematic of how DC has been successfully experimenting with this material in recent years. The story reimagines the Justice League as composed of a group of super-powered dinosaurs who resemble Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Similarly, their enemies - like the Joker - are also super-powered dinosaurs with human characteristics.\nThere are other series that demonstrate that further express DC's creative willingness to take on next-gen crossovers, collaborations, and alternate universe stories. For example, there's James Tynion IV and Matthew Rosenberg's DC vs. Vampires, which see DC heroes confront a plague of vampires. There's also Kenny Porter and Baldemar Rivas' DC Mech, which has heroes suiting up in giant mechanical robots to fight their battles. Incidentally, DC Mech draws from the same rich world of anime and manga that Pokémon is from.\nAll this content reinforces the idea that DC needs to establish a crossover with Pokémon. As malenjoyer shows in his art, tabbing a Pokémon to a specific DC hero has the potential to create a landmark crossover. First, there's Pokemon's current global popularity. Matching it with an equally popular DC hero or villain is a recipe for success. Who wouldn't want to see a Batman versus Joker Pokémon battle? Second, there's the ease of two-world integration. In Pokémon, anyone can be a Pokémon trainer or owner. So, it wouldn't be strange for a hero to also be one too. Third, it's a collaboration that offers an extremely broad range of story options. There are no limits to the stories that can be generated from a collaboration. All things taken into consideration, a DC Comics - Pokémon crossover seems like a match made in collaboration heaven. This leaves fans to wonder why one has not occurred yet and demand that one NEEDS to occur soon.\nSource: malenjoyer via Instagram (1, 2)\nMarcel Green is a writer for Screen Rant's Comics and Anime Sections."}
{"title": "Sister Wives: Christine Left LuLaRoe (8 Ways The Company's &quot;Culty&quot;)", "date": "2023-10-02 21:48:19", "text": "Sister Wives star Christine Brown's been linked with LuLaRoe, but she's actually cut ties with the firm. Was the clothing business too \"culty\"? \nSister Wives star Christine Brown isn't affiliated with LuLaRoe anymore, and since the searing documentary LuLaRich aired, she may be trying to distance herself from the company. In season 18, Christine's reinventing herself. She left Kody Brown, and seems quite happy to be free of him. However, she does resent him at times, especially when he mistreats her close friend Janelle Brown. Christine's so over polygamy with reality show star Kody. However, embracing life without the patriarch isn't the only change that she's making. In love and business, she's evolving.\nSister Wives season 18's featured some memorable drama so far, but Janelle's issues with Kody probably deliver the most riveting onscreen entertainment. Janelle and Kody are having serious problems, and although she thinks he's \"hot,\" she wants to go to couples' counseling with him. Janelle doesn't see another way out of their problems, and she's really losing hope. Christine's focusing on the future, but she's willing to be friends with Kody. He thinks she's playing some kind of game, but more often than not, Christine's 100 percent sincere. A straight shooter, Christine values directness in others. She's all about emotional honesty. She may consider LuLaRoe a little too shady.\nRelated: Did Christine From Sister Wives Get Engaged Too Fast? (Will David Woolley Let Her Down Like Kody Did?)\nIn LuLaRich, people who tried to sell the company's leggings and other products were often disappointed by the quality of the merchandise that they received. Some got stinky leggings because the fabric was moldy and rotting. It's not uncommon for people to sink a lot of their savings into building LuLaRoe ventures. There's a cult mentality that gets recruits excited about being a part of the organization. This may drive overspending. Said recruits sell the products from home, and when quality is poor, they're much more likely to lose money.\nChristine's an honorable person who may not want to risk linking her name with the company anymore. She's got a new man, David Woolley, and doesn't seem to be strapped for cash. Her place in Utah, which was shown in season 18, looks very nice. Janelle's the one who's having money issues. Christine's engaged, and that means that she's probably sharing expenses with David. That may be another reason why she chose to stop promoting LuLaRoe.\nLuLaRich showed the dark side of a seemingly sunny company. This firm appears to primarily target women, promising them income, clout and perks. However, those who want to sell LuLaRoe need to spend money in order to get started. That's the first red flag. When people need to buy the products that they sell, it's often the hallmark of an MLM scheme.\nMulti-level marketing (MLM) is about drawing people in at the bottom of the pyramid. The money that people at the bottom spend helps to line the pockets of the people on top. Without bringing in more people at the bottom, the system falls apart. So, basically, with a pyramid scheme, money's made by recruiting new salespeople who buy products. That's often much more important to CEOs than sales to end users i.e. the people who buy (and wear) the bold and colorful leggings.\nIn other words, the money that the salespeople spend is what makes the company's owners so rich. Anyone who wants to thrive in an MLM needs to aggressively recruit. There can be a brainwashing mindset in pyramid scheme companies. Quite often, LuLaRoe salespeople, such as Meri Brown, are encouraged to pester friends, family and others in order to bring them aboard. Lives have been ruined by MLM companies. People buy into the dream and end up in debt, with their hopes dashed.\nIn LuLaRich, many wrenching stories were captured on film. While some people had positive experiences, those who ended up with nothing were stressed and heartbroken. They fell hook, line and sinker for the marketing patter that LuLaRoe owners Mark and DeAnne Stidham deliver, and deeply regret being so naive. Some have homes filled with unsold merchandise, including defective products that no one is likely to buy.\nSince the company gets such bad press now, it's not that surprising that Christine stopped promoting it. It's actually a pretty smart decision. It's a choice that's easy to respect.\nPart of the whole cult mentality's selling a dream. Cult leaders know how to dazzle their \"marks.\" They promise whatever the person doesn't have. In a typical cult, a vulnerable person who feels lonely will be made to feel like an integral part of a group. However, there's always a price to be paid down the line. For example, the cult member might be asked to do unpaid labor (as in Scientology's Sea Org) or cut off any friends and family members who criticize the cult. A cult member might also be asked to give money to the organization.\nWhile LuLaRoe isn't a bona fide cult, it has a lot in common with a true cult. People who want to be rich are drawn in by glitzy success stories from members. As well, the company puts on events where the dream is intensively sold to the team. For example, the Puerto Vallarta get-together shown above sends the message that life as a LuLaRoe representative means fun in the sun, freedom from financial worries, and good times with coworkers.\nIf a person buys enough products and sells them, they might be included at this type of VIP event. Then, they can live the dream. Of course, few make the cut. Those who never scale those heights may find that they've blown thousands (or even tens of thousands) of dollars on products and never really turned a profit. For every LuLaRoe success story like Meri's, there are many \"fails\" that don't get publicized. That's why the Washington State Attorney General sued LuLaRoe. The company had to pay 4.75 million USD in damages, as per Yahoo.\nAbove, a happy model extols the virtues of \"twirl-worthy moments,\" as per LuLaRoe at Instagram. The woman wearing the ruffled LuLaRoe frock seems confident and serene. She's there to make other women want what she has. While LuLaRoe representatives may really get that \"twirl-worthy\" feeling at first, it's just too good to last. The joy linked with joining the company is often fleeting.\nIn the life cycle of a cult, members start out strong, fully believing in the reality that's shoved down their throats. However, as time passes, many cult members get cynical. They notice abuses that make them question the lives they've chosen. Disillusionment's quite common, and people who escape from cults often feel traumatized. Some never move past their pain.\nWith LuLaRoe, there's also been disillusionment. For example, when representatives tried to return defective leggings and the like, they were given a hard time, and many were stuck with the flawed merchandise. They weren't taken care of. A cult chews up and spits out members, and it seems like LuLaRoe's done the very same.\nShould Meri be ashamed of pushing LuLaRoe designs on her Instagram followers? Maybe. While she seems to be having a positive experience with the company, she must be smart enough to know that famous and influential LuLaRose reps get VIP treatment. To create a comparison, Tom Cruise is going to enjoy life as a Scientologist more than the average Joe will. Tom will be treated with kid gloves, but other members may be treated like slaves.\nWhen Meri promotes such as a culty company, that's actually been legally penalized for its business practices, she may be sucking in women (and men too) who won't get special treatment. They may pour their savings down the drain in order to try and live Meri's reality. Christine left the company, and Meri's still a part of it. Meri loves the conferences and everything else that LuLaRoe provides. However, she may be willfully ignoring some painful truths about the firm.\nMeri and Christine promoted LuLaRoe, and, as previously mentioned, Meri's still doing it. In their promotional posts, they made the company look like the answer to their prayers. When people see LuLaRoe reps succeeding so wildly, and fail the get the same results, they may feel very bad about themselves. Of course, a reality TV show star has a much higher chance of making money in an MLM company. Fame is currency that can be leveraged to get the most from new business opportunities.\nMeri isn't a typical LuLaRoe member. Thanks to appearing in 18 Sister Wives seasons, she's very famous. Her online platform is massive, and that means that she has a pool of potential LuLaRoe recruits at her fingertips. The average person who's starting out with the company won't have any of that. In a sense, this company sells the stories of its stars, and sets recruits up to fail. Without success in an MLM, a person is basically nobody. Everything revolves around money and the status that selling brings. When someone fails, they may feel excommunicated.\nPromising the moon and then failing to honor return policies is bad business and shady. It's the type of gaslighting that leads to court cases and other negative outcomes. Good companies will accept returns of defective products. Sketchy firms will make it almost impossible for people to get their money back. Phones will go unanswered. Messages left on social media will be ignored and/or deleted. Bad companies do this stuff all the time.\nIn a cult, a leader will also gaslight underlings, making them believe that they're the problem. A leader retains power by inspiring, or by instilling fear and doubt. It's typically one or the other. A good leader will care about underlings, while a bad one won't value them, except as a means to an end.\nChristine knows all about bad leadership. She experienced it with Kody. The uber-patriarch didn't do much to steer the Brown family forward. He favored Robyn and neglected the other wives. When they complained, he twisted things around to make them feel like villains. It could be argued that a plural marriage can be a sort of micro-cult. A leader calls the shots and wives obey. If they don't, they may be punished. At the least, they'll learn what gaslighting really means.\nDevotees like Meri probably don't get fleeced because they add so much value, but a typical LuLaRoe initiate will be strongly encouraged to spend, spend, spend...perhaps, until it hurts. Cults are known for fleecing followers. Some cult leaders live like royalty while their underlings have very little. There's always a huge chasm between the highly successful VIPS and those at the bottom.\nA worthy organization is not going to have this dynamic. There will be more fairness, and those who need help will get it, rather than being ignored. There's no such thing as a good cult, and there may be no such thing as a good MLM either. When Meri promotes the LuLaRoe \"good life,\" she's probably not helping her followers. They might end up wasting a lot of money trying to grab brass rings. Since Christine's finished with the company, she can focus on promoting more positive things. However, Christine's link with Plexus dietary supplements is also controversial.\nInfluencers often push shady products, such as diet teas and \"pink drinks.\" They do it for money. As long as their followers perform research, to find out the truth about what their favorite stars are promoting, they should make smart choices. If they don't, they may end up feeling ripped off.\nIn Sister Wives season 18, Christine's spreading her wings and leaving the past behind. She left LuLaRoe behind too. By sealing herself off from the bad vibes that Kody and the clothing company bring, she's doing what's best for herself. Now, she can focus on things that make her happy.\nSources: Yahoo, LuLaRoeInstagram\n"}
{"title": "Halloween: Where Is Haddonfield? Filming & Movie Location", "date": "2023-10-02 21:50:27", "text": "Halloween's Haddonfield, Illinois isn't a real place but rather a creative mix of several locations that create the haunting setting for the film.\nOne of the scariest aspects of John Carpenter’s Halloween is the suggestion that the film's horrific events could happen in any typical American suburban town. In the 1978 horror classic, that town is the fictional Haddonfield, Illinois located in Livingston County. While some may make the assumption that Haddonfield is a real town, the film's crew members creatively blended several locations together to create the vision that Carpenter had in mind for his ideal horror setting.\nHaddonfield, Illinois is the perfect backdrop for Michael Myers and his silent reign of terror, being a picturesque and presumably safe autumnal town. Large Victorian homes line the streets along with impressive lawns and plenty of trees, making it an ideal Midwestern town before Michael shows up. Halloween was so effective because it introduced intense threats and elements of fear in an idyllic location. Finding such a perfect town to shoot in might have been difficult if it weren't for the fact that Haddonfield, as Halloween fans know it, isn't a real place.\nRELATED: Halloween’s Franchise Future Is Promising, But It Will Only Work With Michael Myers\nHaddonfield, Illinois may not be real, but it is based on a real town named Haddonfield. The actual Haddonfield is in southern New Jersey, not too far from Philadelphia. Debra Hill, who co-wrote and produced Halloween with John Carpenter, was from Haddonfield which inspired the town's name in the movie. Because of this detail, there has been a common misconception that Halloween was shot in Haddonfield, New Jersey. Interestingly, the towns do look quite similar considering both have plenty of trees and large single-family homes, including some in a similar Victorian style.\nThe actual filming locations for Halloween were entirely shot in Los Angeles, California, and South Pasadena. Shooting for Halloween was done over the course of 20 days mostly in South Pasadena, California with some additional filming in Alhambra, Sierra Madre, and Hollywood in May 1978. Considering that Halloween is supposed to take place in the fall, set designers had difficulties filming in California in the spring. The crew used artificial leaves to cover the ground and were forced to work around consistent sun exposure by finding rare wooded areas. Viewers who pay close attention will notice palm trees in the background of shots at certain points of the movie.\nRELATED: Halloween Can Finally Return To John Carpenter’s Original Franchise Plan After 40 Years & 5 Reboots\nThe real house of Michael Myers used in Halloween is located at 1000 Mission Street, South Pasadena, California, USA. The house is still standing today and is privately owned by a massage therapist, meaning that it does not operate as a tourist attraction for Halloween fans. The house resides next to a railroad and is only accessible by one main road. It does not have any other filming credits to its name. There is a fictional replica of Michael Myers' house that is located in North Carolina where fans can visit and take pictures without entering the property. While Haddonfield may not be a real place, Halloween successfully created the perfect small town for a new horror franchise to be born that continues to this day.\n"}
{"title": "Karl Saint Lucy & Marius de Vries On The Songs & Music Of Dicks: The Musical", "date": "2023-10-02 21:56:34", "text": "Dicks: The Musical songwriters and composers Karl Saint Lucy and Marius de Vries talk turning an unhinged UCB one-act into A24’s first musical.\nDicks: The Musical is somehow even more wild than its name implies, making A24’s first musical feel like a big swing for the production company. It’s a gamble that audiences will likely be glad A24 took; what began roughly a decade ago as a musical performed in a cramped Upright Citizens Brigade theater in Manhattan has morphed into a film that aims for the heart as much as humor. The movie was written by Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp--also its stars and the creators of the UCB musical--and directed by Larry Charles (Borat). \nJackson and Sharp were also the songwriters behind Dicks: The Musical, though they had help. Songwriter and composer Karl Saint Lucy has worked with the pair since their UCB days and returns for the film along with Marius de Vries, an Oscar-winning composer whose previous work includes CODA, Kick-Ass, and Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet. Together, the film’s songwriters have crafted catchy and hilarious pieces for the film’s cast, which includes Nathan Lane, Megan Mullally, and Megan Thee Stallion.\nRelated: The 20 Best Musicals Of All Time\nKarl Saint Lucy and Marius de Vries spoke with Screen Rant about their work on Dicks: The Musical, working with Nathan Lane and Megan Mullally, and more. Note: This interview was conducted during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, and the film covered here would not exist without the labor of the writers and actors in both unions. This interview has also been lightly edited for clarity and length.\nScreen Rant: Karl, I believe you did the stage version of this back at UCB in New York. I'm sure it had to be expanded, but how much changed once more people started getting involved and you had to start thinking about putting it on screen?\nKarl Saint Lucy: Oh, I mean, just about everything. There’s very little from that show that exists in the same form than it did. One of the things that I thought was going to be a challenge when they made it into full-length show is that it was a 30-minute UCB show--all of those shows are, like, 30 minutes long--so a lot of those jokes and the comedy had to do with the fact that they're changing wigs and everything is happening so quickly. So, initially I didn't think it was going to work, because I was like, \"Oh my God, the center of the comedy of the show is the fact that it's so time limited.\" But they worked on it with Larry for a really long time, and I think they did a great job.\nMarius, how did you find your way here?\nMarius de Vries: I was introduced to Josh and Aaron something like seven years ago by our lead producer Kori at Chernin, and at that point the movie was up and in development at 20th Century Fox, back when it was 20th Century Fox, which gave me some pause. I wondered, as things came to fruition, whether someone at Fox might notice that it's not something that they perhaps would want representing the Fox brand. I just had a suspicion that that might be the case. And then, of course Disney came along, and my suspicions were redoubled and indeed right, because we lost that connection. But thank God we did, because we found a new parent in A24 who were nothing but supportive and just allowed us to cause the maximum amount of mayhem without interfering. So hats off to them for their courage and patience in that regard.\nThere was a period where the whole thing was asleep, and we didn't have a director. Then, they found Larry, recontacted me, I picked up the thread, and then we just rolled our sleeves up and started making it. It was a long and twisty journey, but I knew from that first meeting I had in Silver Lake with the twins seven years ago [that] there was something really special here, and I was delighted to have the opportunity to see it through.\nHow did the collaboration work between the two of you and the two of them? Did they do all the lyrics and did you two do the orchestrations?\nKarl Saint Lucy: The lyrics are by the boys. I wrote the melodies and harmonies of the songs. I did most of the orchestration of the songs. Marius, of course, was the music producer for all the songs, and was a hugely influential part of the songwriting process as we did that, and helped to punch up the orchestrations and everything once we were in post-production. Then the score, really, is a marriage of our work. A lot of it is thematic, so it pulls materials from the songs, and Marius did a lot of that work, and I did some of it as well.\nSo, when you hear the underscoring, it might be 32 bars of Marius and then 16 bars of Karl, and then something that we worked on together. I think the music for this really is a great marriage of what both Marius and I brought to this. And, of course, when you're writing a song, you're sometimes making some tweaks to the lyrics and stuff, so there were a few moments where either Marius or I proposed to the boys that maybe there should be a lyric changed. But by and large, they were the lyricists, I was the songwriter, and Marius and I were both the composer.\nMarius de Vries: What's kind of interesting about the process that I discovered as we got into developing new material for the show is that Josh and Aaron [would] kind of put a phone on the table and sing an acapella version of the song. In many respects, it's actually pretty close to how it turned out, so I think you'd agree, Karl, that it's not a traditional “sitting around the piano” song composition process. It's more of a relay.\nKarl Saint Lucy: Exactly. And they always know how the songs are going to stand [and] they know how they're going to move, so having that information coming into the songwriting process was hugely important.\nHow much were the vocals done on set versus in the studio? Because I would've guessed in the studio and then there was an outtake, I think, of Megan Mullally on the set belting something out.\nMarius de Vries: I'd hesitate to put a percentage on it because I haven't dug through it and worked that out, but a lot of it was recorded live. Most of the twin stuff was live on set. A lot of Megan was live on set, and a fair amount of Nathan was. Megan [Thee Stallion] was lip-synced. I'm a big fan, without getting fetishistic about it, of recording on set, because you get a kind of verisimilitude that is very difficult to achieve with pre-records. I was pleased that, even in an extremely condensed 20-day shoot, we were given the opportunity to slow things down and do what you need to do to get good live takes, and that we were able to use a fair amount of them.\nWere there musicals that you two used as reference, either in songwriting or orchestrating? One of my favorite things about this is how sweet the music sounds paired with these insane lyrics.\nMarius de Vries: I wasn't aware of any specific references. In fact, we were just talking about how we believe that one of the strengths of this is that, in spite of [the fact that] we're going for comedy as much as we can in the songs, there's almost nothing that's to do with parody and referentiality. The songs live on their own. Also, there's a great sincerity to the performance and the composition of the songs that helps support the fact that they're also undermining themselves all the time, referring to themselves, and poking fun at themselves. There’s such a strong emotional core to the songwriting that I think that's what makes the show so involving.\nKarl Saint Lucy: To Marius's point, we were not referential to anything, but if you wanted to talk about shows that I think do some of the things that we do, or have some of the same sensibility, I'm thinking of the Full Monty with the score by David Yazbek. This is a show that's very funny but has some really earnest and emotional moments. I don't know that my work sounds like David Yazbek, but certainly I was drawing from those songs. And Seth McFarlane's work, I think was really in my ear a lot for this as well.\nMarius de Vries: I think if I had a North Star, it would've been the Rocky Horror Show. Not in terms of its content at all, but just in terms of its impact and its sensibility.\nKarl Saint Lucy: And Reefer Madness, the musical, too. It’s funny, I watched Reefer Madness for the first time in a few years the other day, and they also have a scene where oysters and spaghetti are being served at the same time, which I thought was so funny.\nI want to ask about some specific songs because, first off, Megan Thee Stallion's song is so great. I think that's going to be one that people talk about, for sure. Do you know if she was involved with the writing of it at all? Did she have ideas or was she just down to do whatever? \nMarius de Vries: We had to turn that number around insanely fast because Megan was cast at quite a late stage, and the material that we had prepared for that moment was in no way suitable for Megan Thee Stallion to perform. We had to give her something. We knew that she'd bring her own thing to it, but this was barely days before we started shooting, and we only had one day of rehearsal with her and two days on set. We had to take something which was basically kind of a old-fashioned showtune and give it some sort of DNA that she'd be able to connect to.\nWe stopped working on everything else, scrambled together a very quick demo, and with profuse apologies, sent it to her and said, \"This really isn't what you're used to, but see what you can do with this,” and she was a champion. She turned it around in a day, sent us back a more or less finished vocal, came in and rehearsed it. The choreographers had to put it up in about 12 hours. 36 hours later we were shooting it. I'm not sure that we all believed that it was actually going to happen as we were doing that, but the gods were smiling on us. Bowen was smiling on us.\nThe next thing I was going to ask was about “Desperate for your Love”, and just generally just getting Nathan Lane and Megan Mullally to do the things that they do in this. How were they? Did they take any convincing?\nMarius de Vries: Nathan would turn out to work every morning and say, \"This is the greatest mistake of my professional career.\" And it was only last night that he finally admitted that it wasn't.\nKarl Saint Lucy: I told him on set that this movie was going to be his apotheosis.\nMarius de Vries: They were both incredibly game, and I think they knew walking into it that the only way to get through this and make it work was to embrace the extremity. So they knew they had to do that, but it can't have been comfortable for them at times.\nKarl Saint Lucy: It was really interesting to watch the different ways that they approach this. Nathan, very Stanislavski, needs to understand where the character is coming from psychologically. There was this whole thing about [how] he wanted his character to be a famous archeologist, so we gave him a pith helmet, et cetera. And then Megan Mullally… she just plays. It's so fun to watch the fact that they have such a different way of doing this work, but somehow it works together. I think that that's part of the secret sauce that makes them such a special part of this.\nReally quickly about the archeologist [thing] that you mentioned, was that just something he wanted to have in his mind to kind of shape the character? Not in the script, not part of the thing, just for him to have?\nKarl Saint Lucy: Well, he wanted it in the script.\nThat’s great.\nMarius de Vries: The hat. He wanted the hat in the script, specifically. He was given the hat, and he pulled it off. I mean, Megan surprised us; she turned out with that extraordinary accent without really having forewarned us at all. Of course, one of the first things we did was to test singing. There was a lot of very frantic discussion about, \"Oh, this is an unusual turn of events to the character,\" but she'd clearly done an immense amount of wise preparation in building that character. She bought it fairly fully formed, and it worked brilliantly.\nFrom the moment she opened her mouth, I was like, \"How is this going to work in a song?\" And it was incredible. You both are in this movie, I believe, [as well]. How did that come about? Did you ask for it?\nMarius de Vries: One of the things I've started doing at this later stage in my career is insisting on having a cameo in pretty much everything I do, because it keeps things a little bit fresh. So, this is by no means my first small role in a big musical, but I don't know how to explain it other than I kept pestering Larry, saying, \"You've got to put me in somewhere.\" Then a scene came up and they were short of a maître d’, and I got a call at five-thirty saying, \"Can you be on set at seven-thirty?\" and so there I was. But I think Karl has a much more significant and important visual role in the film than I do, so perhaps the question is better addressed to him.\nKarl Saint Lucy: It was a lot of fun. I got to be the martini shot that day, so we spent the whole day throwing spaghetti around the set, and then watching the prop cleaners put the spaghetti back on the plate and throw it around again. The whole place just smelled awful, you know, with the lights and everything. It was, like, the last 20 minutes of shooting for that day. Larry was just shouting direction at me, and it was so much fun. Then, afterwards, he came up to me and he was like, \"Was that okay? Are you all right?\" and I was like, \"Oh my God, please shout at me as much as you want.\" It was incredibly fun. I know they wanted to originally put me in a tux, and I'm so glad that they let me wear a kaftan instead.\nWas there anything that didn't make it into the movie that was too much?\nKarl Saint Lucy: In Megan's song, there used to be a moment where she was playing a fish harmonica and air drums, and we worked very hard to work the fish harmonica into the song, and that did not make it, sadly.\nMarius de Vries: Yeah, Megan had a drum solo. I kind of miss that. One day the world will see it. That’s when the movie went from being an 88-minute movie to an 87-minute movie.\nI feel there is a theremin at one point in the score. Did I make that up?\nKarl Saint Lucy: It’s an ondes Martenot, which is similar to a theremin, but it's a keyboard instrument that was very, like Messiaen used it a lot in his Turangalîla-Symphonie. We got the VST (virtual instrument). Originally, the p**sy was supposed to be horrific, so we had this huge cue that was a reference to Jerry Goldsmith's Alien where the ondes Martenot had a really prominent role, but we ended up having to cut that when the p**sy ended up being very cute.\nSo that instrument came in as a thematic instrument for that?\nKarl Saint Lucy: For the p**sy, yeah.\nMarius de Vries: That was the p**sy instrument. And then the ondes Martenot, apart from Messiaen, the most recent expert or virtuoso on the ondes Martenot is Johnny Greenwood who used-\nDo you two each have favorite songs that you were able to work on for this?\nMarius de Vries: I think, for me, the real standout is “Lonely”.\nKarl Saint Lucy: Yeah, me too.\nMarius de Vries: It's kind of the most extreme example of the way that the sincerity and the songwriting is juxtaposed with the ludicrousness of the situation, and I think it pushes that device about as far as it can go.\nKarl Saint Lucy: And I was kind of lifted out of being alone in my apartment through the pandemic to do this, and I think a lot of people on set were sort of feeling lonely. On the day that we got to see that shot, I mean, Megan Mullally's performance was--we were all just weeping. For me, that felt like a real coup. Not only were we getting everyone on set to laugh and sing the songs, but we were also getting them to cry because of, like you said, the sincerity of her performance in that. And Nathan's.\nMarius de Vries: When we did our first set of piano demos just after the pandemic--just at the beginning of pre-production--and sent them to Larry, first of all, amazingly, he liked them all, so we were off to a strong start. I put the “Lonely” song, and he said, \"I immediately wept. Then, I went outside for a walk, and I came back and played it again, and I wept again.\" So we knew that we had a tear jerker on our hands.\nSomething that I loved so much about this is [that] I felt like there were takes where the actors were just laughing at the end of the take, [that were] left in the movie. To me, it just speaks to this thing where this movie's insane, and it's so raunchy, but it's so sweet and has so much heart at the same time. To me, I think that's why it works so well. Is that something that you all talked about, had discussions about, and made an effort to preserve as you were putting this together?\nMarius de Vries: I think there's something about the fact that it was lifted conceptually from that initial 30-minute rowdy comedic stage show and [us] wanting to keep a sense of liveness about it and a sense of theatricality to it across all departments. That breaking phenomenon that you're talking about, I think, is to do with that. And you're right, I think it pulls you into the joint endeavor of just having a wonderful time and enjoying the humor together that is part of the inclusiveness of it. I don't know, Karl, you can probably speak to that better than I can.\nKarl Saint Lucy: I also just want to say that Nathan Lane is also really largely responsible for that, because as we were in development, he kept reminding us, \"Yes, let's go for the jokes, but let's also go for the heart. There has to be a heart to this.\" I think that that already existed in the show, but it was incredibly helpful to have Nathan reminding us of that periodically throughout the process.\nTwo self-obsessed businessmen (writers Aaron Jackson & Josh Sharp) discover they’re long-lost identical twins and come together to plot the reunion of their eccentric divorced parents, in this riotously funny and depraved musical from comedy icon Larry Charles (Seinfeld, Borat) also starring Megan Thee Stallion, Nathan Lane, Megan Mullally, and Bowen Yang as God.\nCheck out our other interviews here:\nDicks: The Musical arrives in select theaters on October 6 before its nationwide release on October 20.\nSource: Screen Rant Plus\n"}
{"title": "10 Reasons Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof Is His Biggest Failure", "date": "2023-10-02 22:00:28", "text": "Quentin Tarantino's weakest movie is Death Proof, his only horror movie to date, and there are different reasons why it didn't succeed.\nDeath Proof marked a first in Quentin Tarantino’s career as it’s his only horror movie to date, and it’s also his biggest failure. Quentin Tarantino has become one of the best filmmakers of his generation but also one of the most controversial due to the violence in every one of his movies. Still, Tarantino’s works have been praised for their narrative and visual style, his mastery in writing dialogue, and more, and though some of his movies are considered among the best films ever made, some haven’t had the same success.\nIn 2007, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez teamed up to bring Grindhouse, a double feature that combined Rodriguez’s horror comedy Planet Terror and Tarantino’s Death Proof, a slasher thriller. Death Proof followed Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), who used his death-proof car to kill young women, as the car was only safe for him. Death Proof is widely considered Tarantino's worst movie, and even Tarantino himself admits it’s his weakest movie – and here are 10 reasons Death Proof was a failure.\nAs part of the Grindhouse project, Death Proof has the visual style of grindhouse and exploitation movies from the 1970s, but unlike its sibling film, Planet Terror, Death Proof didn’t stick to this aesthetic. The first part of Death Proof is in full grindhouse style, with bright colors and the style of an old movie. The beginning of the second part of the story is in black and white, and it suddenly changes to color and good quality, leaving the grindhouse look behind. While this can be explained as part of the Grindhouse project's aesthetic, it gave Death Proof an inconsistent look that, ultimately, impacted the overall quality of the movie and its reception.\nOne of the most praised elements in Quentin Tarantino’s movies is the dialogue. Tarantino’s ability to write dialogue has been praised, which is often heavy on pop culture references, and it’s key in understanding the dynamics, motivations, and personalities of the characters. Death Proof, however, and unlike Tarantino’s previous works, has more dialogue between female characters, as the main characters are all women. Tarantino used the same style he had used for all his male characters in Death Proof’s female ones, which felt off and brought out a weakness in Tarantino’s writing. \nThe first part of Death Proof follows Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito), Shanna (Jordan Ladd), and Jungle Julia (Sydney Tamiia Poitier) who meet Stuntman Mike at a bar, where he claims a lap dance from Arlene that Jungle Julia promised on her radio show. Later, an old friend of Julia, Pam (Rose McGowan), takes Stuntman Mike’s offer for a ride home, but he kills her by speeding and slamming on the brakes. Stuntman Mike then catches up with Julia and company, crashing into their car, and killing them in truly gruesome ways.\nThe second half of Death Proof sees Stuntman Mike targeting a new group of women, but to his surprise, they know how to fight back. However, this second half is slower and lacks the suspense of the first part of Death Proof, to the point where many viewers have shared that they lost interest in the characters and stories throughout the second half of the movie.\nDeath Proof spends enough time with Jungle Julia and her friends in the first part of the movie to make the audience care about them, but the same can’t be said about the second group. While they end up being the heroes of the movie, Death Proof doesn’t do much to make the audience care about them and what will happen to them next, and the character of Stuntman Mike isn’t properly developed, leading to the audience not even caring about the villain. The heroes aren’t exactly likable, either, leaving the audience with no one to really root for.\nQuentin Tarantino is no stranger to starting his movies with a bang, but what happened with Death Proof is that it never recovered from its shocking first act. The rest of Death Proof sees Stuntman Mike going after Abernathy (Rosario Dawson), Kim (Tracie Thomas), and Zoë (Zoë Bell), but the chase and the women’s revenge take too long to happen and reach their peak. Death Proof starts to take off again towards the end, but never truly does so as the movie comes to an end when the women finally get their revenge.\nDeath Proof is considered a slasher movie even if it doesn’t go all the way, but even if it just took the structure of a slasher movie, it still didn’t deliver on that promise. Death Proof leans more towards an action thriller, and though Stuntman Mike’s murders are very graphic and horrible, especially those of Jungle Julia and her friends, Death Proof doesn’t really feel like a slasher movie. Still, Death Proof is considered Quentin Tarantino’s only horror movie to date, even if it falls short.\nDeath Proof’s slow pace made the climax and ending pretty underwhelming. As mentioned above, the movie takes too long to set up the Abernathy and friends' conflict with Stuntman Mike, and by the time they can finally get their revenge, the movie ends. The big moment of Abernathy, Kim, and Zoë beating an injured Stuntman Mike ended up being more comedic than exciting, and the movie ends as Stuntman Mike falls and the women celebrate their win. Of course, this deeply affected Death Proof’s reception with critics and viewers, making it a forgettable movie.\nBy itself, Death Proof still wouldn’t have succeeded, but its failure was made worse by its sibling film, Planet Terror. Unlike Death Proof, Planet Terror fully embraced the horror genre with its zombie apocalypse story and its very graphic scenes. Planet Terror had a consistent visual style, its characters were developed enough for the audience to root for them, and it was packed with action from beginning to end. Planet Terror also had a proper ending, and even had a small tease at the end (though that will never pay off).\nAlthough the idea of a double-feature B-movie style project like Grindhouse sounds interesting, it risked only appealing to a specific audience, even if it counted on the talents of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. Rodriguez delivered on the horror/grindhouse style of the project with Planet Terror, while Tarantino made his interpretation of a slasher movie that, ultimately, would only be exciting for him. Surely, Tarantino ended up admitting that Death Proof isn’t his best work, but in big part, the movie’s failure was because it wouldn’t really appeal to a wide audience, like his other projects.\nPerhaps the biggest problem with Death Proof is that it doesn’t feel like a Quentin Tarantino movie because his style doesn’t fit the movie. As mentioned above, Tarantino’s style of dialogue didn’t fit the female characters, and his trademark long speeches felt off with the overall style of Death Proof. Surely, Tarantino’s style of violence was perfect for it, but that’s about it. Death Proof could have benefited from having Quentin Tarantino as producer, a better script, and a different director, but that wasn’t the case.\n"}
{"title": "Prey Director Dan Trachtenberg On Introducing A New Generation To Predator Lore", "date": "2023-10-02 22:00:28", "text": "Prey director Dan Trachtenberg discusses shooting on location, tapping into Predator lore, and showing Naru's incredible strength in the movie.\nPrey is the fifth installment in the Predator franchise, set hundreds of years before the original movie. Set in the Northern Great Plains in 1719, the movie follows Naru, an accomplished Comanche healer and tracker who yearns to become a warrior. Although overshadowed by her brother Taabe, a skilled hunter, Naru sees her chance for the big hunt, a rite of passage in her tribe. Naru will face a much more sinister and dangerous threat than anything she or the others have seen before.\nPrey is directed by Dan Trachtenberg and written by Patrick Aison. The movie is produced by John Davis, Jhane Myers, and Marty P. Ewing. Prey stars Amber Midthunder, Dakota Beavers, Dane DiLiegro, Michelle Thrush, Stormee Kipp, Julian Black Antelope, and Bennett Taylor.\nRelated: Predator: 8 Ways Arnold Schwarzenegger Can Appear In Prey 2 Despite A 268-Year Gap\nScreen Rant spoke with director Dan Trachtenberg about his installation in the Predator franchise, Prey. He discussed shooting on location and revealed how sports movies were an inspiration. Trachtenberg also broke down the importance of showing the Predator lore to a new audience and tapping into an earlier era of this world.\nScreen Rant: Dan, look, I love Prey! I'm so happy. I got to revisit it over this weekend. October 3, it's coming in 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and DVD. I'm sure everyone can't wait. Can you talk about the world-building and why you decided to start at the beginning of the Predator story?\nDan Trachtenberg: I don't even know if it's the beginning of the Predator story. Great point. It is the beginning of this Predator, the Predator in this movies needs the first time he's ever been to Earth, or it's ever been to Earth. Frankly, I did not come at it from thinking of \"Oh, I'd like to make a Predator movie. What Predator movie could I make? Oh, what if I went to a different...\" It actually was thinking of Naru's story and trying to thinking of a movie that could be as nonverbal as possible, just as action oriented as possible, but also wanting to feel as emotional as that possibly could.\nSo I thought of an underdog story. Taking the engine from a sports film and putting that into this other kind of genre. And then what is your protagonist that we never see? Native American and Comanche in particular. And all of those thoughts, while still wanting for it to have a science fiction component. Period and sci-fi coming together has not always been successful. I was really trying to figure out, well, is there a way that it could be? And that's when Predator came to mind because it wouldn't just be arbitrary and look at the science fiction thing. Actually the predators thematic, that it goes on hunts looking for the strongest thing, and we'd already be focusing on a character whose peers are saying, \"You're not, you're not it.\" And she's wanting to be it and also was questioning herself in my head.\nAnd the Predator doesn't even look at her doesn't even consider her, that was like, okay, cool. That is a movie that doesn't feel like I'm just throwing a hat on that, that really feels like a great mixture. And then it was like, okay, well wait, if this is set in the 1700s and that means that'd be before Predator. Actually, I should say before it was even 1700s it was just, what is pre... As early as possible I wanted to tell a story about this people in this culture that we don't often see usually it's in the 1800s. It's in the western. I just want to be focused on them.\nAnd then I realized there was that gun in Predator 2. I was in the shower when I was thinking, and as soon as I got in the shower I ran to my phone to Google, what was the date on the gun? It's 1715, and it was like, \"Holy crap, there!\" We perfected it beautifully aligned with Predator lore, and what I was already interested in doing with the film.\nThat is incredible. That is incredible that you had that thought in the shower, and had that foresight in mind. I love this character of Naru. Can you talk about how you wanted to differentiate her strength from the other members of the tribe? And also how you wanted to differentiate her from other Predator heroes we've seen in the past?\nDan Trachtenberg: What I love, even though I'm not physically represented at all on screen except for maybe I have a beard now so then there's a bunch of bearded people, this was a very personal story for me. It's my feelings. My heart is beating in the movie. Why I wanted to put it out there, why I'm always interested in this kind of stories. I think that a lot of people feel the way that Naru feels. A lot of people feel like they are capable of more than is outwardly seen yet also question and hope that they have that within them, and hope they have the guts to prove it to themselves and to others.\nIt's why we we do sports. It's why we pursue careers with any sense of ambition. I think anywhere you are in the world that's a very specific feeling that is felt by, I would imagine, almost all of us. So that is why I focused on her. That kind of story is very different than the kind of protagonist that we certainly saw on the original Predator. Arnold represents the wish fulfillment. It's like, oh, I'm watching that and saying, \"Wouldn't it be great if I had all those muscles? If I was that way? Could I kick it?\"\nJust exhilarating to see a character kick butt on screen that is Uber capable. And Naru is the other thing and that is, what if I was there? What if I, but just a little bit better, but could I pull it off? Could I be posed with a seemingly impossible task, still rise to the occasion, figure it out, and handle it? So yeah, that's kind of how that came together.\nWhen I originally watched Prey, when it first came out on Hulu, my girlfriend had never seen the Predator movies before. So this is kind of a new way to introduce such a famous character to her. Were there any elements you wanted to set up with Prey for people who hadn't seen Predator before?\nDan Trachtenberg: Actually the first cut of the movie we did not do our job in making it for people who had not seen Predator. Really took for granted what the rules are of a Predator and so we had to kind of learn the hard way after screening for some friends and family that we had missed that. We very much wanted this to be for anyone. For it to be great movie first and then a kick ass Predator movie second. So what we found was we really need to make sure the movie retaught the audience that it was an alien coming to earth looking for the Alpha following the hierarchy of Predator and Prey on this planet and a Trophy Hunter.\nBefore we articulated that in the movie there was a reaction to the sequence where it kills the bear or someone thought it was a vampire. Because they thought it was drinking the blood of the bear before we had sequences that were it studying the ant, the snake and getting the skull of the wolf and attaching to it. So before those kinds of things were in the movie. It was like \"Oh, I don't know what this is. The shimmering red thing and then it drinks blood.\" So anyway, it took a few unfortunate reminders that this must be a movie for everyone, of course, and we need to make sure all that lore that is established in the other films we have in this one as well.\nWell, it worked because after that I think we binged the next two Predator movies. So it absolutely worked. Now Prey explores intense survival themes. How did you approach capturing the psychological aspects of the character in such a gripping manner?\nDan Trachtenberg: Making sure the movie was very linked to Naru's POV. To making it a very experiential film. So we really only see in large part what Naru sees. Hear and feel it as best we can. So playing with sound, focusing on the noises that she would focus in on, and letting the suspense build around her and towards her. As opposed to it being like the other Predator films [which] are a little bit more of a classic slasher film approach. Where you're meeting a team of people and watching them killed by one. This is a much more specific, single protagonist oriented movie. Which just makes it all feel that much more emotional, and the suspense matters so much more because you care about her and her specific relationships.\nSpeaking of that, this film has such a unique blend of suspense and horror. How did you balance maintaining the tension throughout the story without overwhelming the audience?\nDan Trachtenberg: What I loved about the original Predator was for me growing up, it was the first time I'd seen a real genre combination. That was combining sci-fi, horror, and action. What I love about Prey is that it was a combination of science fiction, horror, and adventure. Adventure films are not a genre that we have too much of these days. Growing up, we had a lot of them, we had a lot of quicksand, slide, swinging from things, and swashbuckle.\nSo I wanted to infuse this movie with a bit of that language as well. Have moments of score that remind us of big epics, that, that I grew up with. So I think that and certainly her relationship with her dog and her relationship with her brother, all the emotional story makes the tension matter more. And then also, when it follows through with the with the action, it's much more of a cathartic release. Because everything's been building up and building up and building up.\nCan you talk about the usage of practical effects and visual effects, and combining them both? Knowing when to us which one when the story called for it?\nDan Trachtenberg: Digital effects when it is literally impossible to do anything practically. Almost the whole movie was shot on location. So there was there was a lot on screen that is in camera. CG stuff was used to just augment what was there from landscape to snowfall to ash in the sky,. There's a bit that I love that we've mentioned in the commentary in the movie that I'd forgotten about through the whole process of releasing the film, that was a big deal while we were making the movie, where Amber, when she climbs out of the water. After escaping from the Predator, she was wearing a wetsuit that was covering her arms. And it was very obvious and unfortunate that we had no other take because it was something that we were just racing to get there. In this pretty gnarly location at the bottom of a ravines and stuff.\nSo we were kind of screwed until we found an awesome digital artist who just in 2D found a way to comp skin onto her arms. So her arms are digital effect in that scene. I don't think many people realize that or would notice that. And then there's bits where to make the predator more believable. it's all suit except when it's hands. We're very tight on his hands and it's sniffing ash know that CG hands because his hands weren't articulating, in the most refined way and sometimes we augmented some of the mandibles and the face here and there. Sometimes that's really just it.\nSo it's always playing a little bit of a zigzag game. You never know when it's going to be practical when it's gonna be real. So when you're seeing a thing, hopefully you're kind of lulled into it and tricked. And I would argue the moments that are blatantly CG are that way because there's no element of practicality to it. What we're at what we're doing is so physically impossible. So it sort of proves that the methodology is sound. That most people don't notice are those that were really combining both things.\nLook, I love home entertainment releases because of audio commentaries. And you have a great one with you. Amber Midthunder, Jeff Cutter, Angela M. Catanzaro. I love audio commentaries, because it's almost like going to film school in a way. It's hearing it from your guys's perspective. If there's an audio commentary that you'd like young filmmakers to check out, what would be your choice?\nBy the way, it was my film school. Audio commentaries.\nWas it really? \nDan Trachtenberg: Oh, yeah. I mean, I also went to film school but I think I learned as much if not more from listening to audio commentaries growing up than I did from movies. There's several that come to mind that were personal to me that I enjoy listening to that I would said, Well, that's probably not the most formative. I think David Fincher did some awesome commentaries. Steven Soderbergh.\nI remember Traffic having a whole walkthrough of their post process that's sort of beyond commentary. It was showing you the AVID if memory serves on the disk that was really insightful. It's a great question there's probably so many more but yeah I would look to the Fincher and the Soderbergh. I remember Nightmare Before Christmas also having a commenter, I think I got that before DVDs, that was super interesting. I remember having a VHS of commentary version that I got to like a comic convention or something, probably was bootlegged.\nSet in the Comanche Nation 300 years ago, this is the story of Naru, a fierce and highly skilled warrior, raised in the shadow of legendary hunters who roam the Great Plains. When danger threatens her camp, she sets out to protect her people. The prey she stalks: a highly evolved alien predator with a technically advanced arsenal.\nPrey is available on 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and DVD on October 3.\nSource: Screen Rant Plus\n"}

Krapopolis has only just started, with the series hitting the ground running. FOX has already renewed Krapopolis for two more seasons ahead of season 1, meaning that the show already has some pretty ambitious plans. While a lot of these details are still under wraps, one Krapopolis detail has fans eagerly awaiting the upcoming seasons.\nKrapopolis is the newest show from Community creator and Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon, with the new series bringing back many of the creative's signature trademarks and stylistic flairs. Krapopolis takes place in pre-civilization Ancient Greece, with the show following King Tyrannis as he attempts to start up the first Greek city. However, Tyrannis is constantly thwarted by his colorful family which includes his mother, the goddess Deliria, and his father, a Manitaur named Shlub.\nRelated: Krapopolis Season 2: Renewal, Release Date Prediction & Everything We Know\nWhile only a handful of gods have appeared in Krapopolis so far, the series clearly has some ambitious plans, as around 120 gods have been designed for the first three seasons of the series. In Screen Rant's exclusive interview with Krapopolis supervising director Pete Michels and lead character designer Andy Ristaino, the duo touched on what's to come for the show's upcoming seasons. Here's what Michels and Ristaino had to say when asked about the show's future:\nPete Michels: [Krapopolis' main characters] do meet a lot of new characters in the upcoming seasons and a lot of new locations also.\nAndy Ristaino: Go to a lot of cool places. We visit more gods and stuff.\nPete Michels: A lot more gods. I think you’ve designed like 120 gods or something.\nAndy Ristaino: Yeah, I’ve designed a lot of gods and a lot of creatures and mythological creatures and things that were never mentioned.\nPete Michels: Yeah, and I think those are the fun things too because we do not just the gods and goddesses and the humans, but there's also monsters. [There are] a lot of interesting monsters that animation lends itself to that were just really fun to do and fun to draw.\nThis is major news, as only a select few gods from the Greek pantheon have appeared in Krapopolis so far. Obviously, more gods were expected to appear, but 120 is an immense number for only three seasons of the show. It's entirely possible that many of these gods and monsters may not make the final cut, but it is a sign of how expansive the world of Krapopolis is intended to be by season 3.\nWith around 120 gods having been designed, it seems like almost any ancient Greek god is fair game to appear in future seasons of Krapopolis. Some of the biggest names, like Hermes, Athena, Poseidon, and plenty of others have appeared. However, characters like Zeus and Hades as well as deep-cut gods that viewers may not know about could also appear. Michels and Ristaino didn't give us any specifics on which gods could pop up, but there are plenty of possibilities.\nRelated: Krapopolis: Concept, Trailer & Everything We Know About Dan Harmon's New Show\nAlthough it is still unknown what gods Krapopolis has in store for seasons 2 and 3, some future monsters have been confirmed. In the Krapopolis Q&A panel at SCAD AnimationFest 2023, Michels and Ristaino confirmed that Pegasus and a Hydra would appear in upcoming episodes of the series. While other monsters and creatures are sure to appear, this is big news for fans of the series, giving viewers something to look forward to in the future of Krapopolis.\nRobert Pitman is a Movies/TV features writer for ScreenRant and loves all things nerdy.

After years of fan campaigning under the hashtag #SixSeasonsandaMovie, it was finally announced in September 2022 that a Community movie was in development for Peacock featuring the return of original stars Joel McHale, Danny Pudi, Alison Brie, Gillian Jacobs, Jim Rash, and Ken Jeong. However, the WGA and still ongoing SAG-AFTRA strikes have caused a plethora of production setbacks and put those plans into serious doubt.\nNow, the latest Community movie update reveals that Harmon is concerned it might not happen at all. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the Community creator admitted that once the SAG-AFTRA strike ends, he's worried the cast might not be able to get back together. In his own words, Harmon says, \"By the time we can recoordinate, what are the odds that everyone’s schedule is going to once again align?\"\nBefore the SAG-AFTRA strike, Harmon says the plan was to shoot the Community movie in Atlanta, which was moved from Los Angeles in order to accommodate Glover's return, \"And Donald was stoked,\" Harmon says. The actor's name was missing from the original announcement in September 2022, though there have been multiple updates suggesting he will return. Glover has several other commitments, including Prime Video's Mr. and Mrs. Smith series and the Star Wars Lando movie, and changing the shooting location to Atlanta was to prevent the Community movie from shooting \"separately at different months in different locations,\" Harmon explains.\nWith no conclusive end to the SAG-AFTRA strike in sight, it's uncertain if the Community cast will be able to reunite for the movie. Once the SAG-AFTRA strike does end, there will be a scramble in Hollywood to secure top talent. This includes Glover, but also McHale who stars in Fox's Animal Control, which was renewed for a season 2, and hosts reality competition series like Crime Scene Kitchen and House of Villains. In light of the stoppage started by the SAG-AFTRA strike, Harmon's comment casts some serious doubt on the fate of the long-anticipated Community movie.\nSource: THR\n"}
{"title": "5 Reasons The Rings Of Power Is Amazon Prime Video's Best Fantasy Show (& 5 It's The Wheel Of Time)", "date": "2023-10-02 22:21:29", "text": "Amazon has two great shows full of magic and adventure, The Rings of Power and The Wheel of Time. But which one is the fantasy show to rule them all?\nAmazon Prime boasts two sprawling series The Rings of Power and The Wheel of Time, each with their own strengths that make them the streaming network's best fantasy show. The Rings of Power focuses on important events during Middle-earth's Second Age that lead up to The Lord of the Rings movies, including the forging of the titular rings, the creation of Sauron's stronghold in Mordor, and the fall of Numenor. The Wheel of Time follows Moiraine, an Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah, who embarks on a quest to discover the identity of the Dragon Reborn, a great warrior prophesied to either save the world or cause its destruction.\nBoth series feature magic, exciting battles, the same directors (Sanaa Hamri), and extensive world-building based on beloved works of fiction by celebrated authors. Certain things like creative license, budgetary constraints, and character development have greatly impacted how they have both been received by fans of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth setting and Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson's Randland from The Wheel of Time books. Both series have strengths and weaknesses that are giving them growing pains ahead of their respective second seasons, but there's no denying that fans of fantasy are fortunate to have so many options right now, on Amazon as well as other platforms.\nEven without the most recognizable faces in The Lord of the Rings franchise, The Rings of Power has several memorable characters. Not only does Galadriel make a huge impression as a much more battle-weary figure, but Elrond emerges as a loyal friend and budding politician whose thoughtful choices shape the fate of Middle-earth. While not every performance rings true, the vast majority of the actors give committed performances that pay homage to the material, with individual relationships, like the one between Elrond and Durin, that humanize larger-than-life figures and build a strong foundation for The Rings of Power season 2.\nLike The Rings of Power, The Wheel of Time has a lot of source material to work with, but manages to be more faithful to it. Modifications, such as truncated time periods or, in the case of Matt and Perin, changes to character backstories and personalities can be explained in-universe with a few words of dialogue or dramatic motivations. It doesn't help that Amazon never obtained the rights for all the necessary Tolkien works before they attempted to adapt The Rings of Power and therefore had to ignore a large portion of it.\nThe Lord of the Rings franchise is known for its painstaking attention to detail thanks to a trilogy boasting handmade chainmaille armor on hundreds of extras and heroes wielding rune-carved blades forged by real blacksmiths. The high budget on The Rings of Power is unmistakable, even if at times it looks a little too pristine. Aesthetically, it's not only beautiful to watch, but distinct from other fantasy series, which are either too gritty like Game of Thrones and The Witcher, or too generic like The Wheel of Time.\nBecause it doesn't have to compress hundreds of years of actions and characters into a single narrative like The Rings of Power with the Second Age, The Wheel of Time has a better story. Not only is the pace better, but it's cohesive and linear without being too confusing even as it leaves circumstances surrounding Rand more mysterious and leaves casual fans wondering who the Dragon Born will be. Moraine is a strong lead character, and her goals sync up with all the supporting cast in ways that make sense, rather than trying to find ways to connect characters like Galadriel to less compelling characters, like the Harfoots, in The Rings of Power.\nWhile die-hard Tolkien fans will find a series based on appendices jarring, The Rings of Power does have a certain amount of creative freedom. The series builds a foundation for prominent events in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and aside from having to compress its time period by having certain characters alive who would have otherwise been separated by years, it isn't as constrained. The Wheel of Time has to turn 14 books, and some of them fairly massive, into a television show, while The Rings of Power has to hit certain milestones and then fabricate what happened between them.\nOne of the main problems with The Rings of Power is its pacing, which often comes across as plodding and monotonous. The Wheel of Time keeps things moving at a brisk clip, which translates into much higher completion rates for viewers. As a fantasy series, The Wheel of Time understands how to make episodic structure work for its overall narrative, rather than The Rings of Power's tendency to make some episodes completely disparate from others.\nWhereas The Wheel of Time stumbles with its CGI and Trollocs that don't look quite finished, The Rings of Power boasts incredible visual effects on par with The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Rivendell and Numenor are dazzling, and every environment bursts with a vitality that makes Middle-earth seem real and lived in. Locations that were seen as dark ruins, like the Mines of Moria, are seen in all their glory, full of bustling industry and part of one of the most thrilling communities in the series that focuses on the dwarves.\nSauron is a formidable villain in The Lord of the Rings, but as he's presented in The Rings of Power, he's operating in the shadows as more of a charming puppet master. The Wheel of Time has villains that are not only more apparent, but also more entertaining to watch as they work out their schemes. The members of The Forsaken still have a lot of damage to do in Season 2, but watching powerful characters like Lanfear has given the series charismatic darkness to counteract the light.\nIt should come as no surprise that the battle sequences in The Rings of Power are as pulse-pounding as anything in The Lord of the Rings. Not only do they showcase grand special effects, but they also feature expert horsemanship, stuntwork, and practical strategic elements. On top of that, they're beautifully shot, making the violence and bloodshed at times almost like a fever dream, or in other cases, a nightmare of ash and flame.\nDialogue in fantasy series can often be ropey or overly verbose, with characters speaking in ways that don't flow naturally or make a lot of sense. The Wheel of Time includes dialogue that not only sounds how characters speak in the books but even lines verbatim from them that work in the appropriate situation. This helps keep it focused without lines that take viewers right out of the drama, which even the best fantasy series like The Rings of Power can't always prevent, but should make an effort to do so in order to remain immersive.\n"}

Find out if the winner used the veto to save Felicia or Mecole from the chopping block.\nWARNING! THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR BIG BROTHER 25!\nThe Big Brother 25 Power of Veto ceremony has occurred, and winner and current Head of Household (HOH) Cameron Hardin didn't use it, leaving his original nominees, Felicia Cannon and Mecole Hayes on the chopping block. Cameron came roaring back into the Big Brother house after being evicted unanimously, winning the Do or Die competition, and resurrecting his game. He did this after besting Jared Fields in the Resurrection Rumble. He won HOH the same night he returned to the game, and then the Power of Veto two days later. This is Cameron's third HOH win of the season.\nThe Big Brother 25 live feeds have revealed that Cameron chose not to use the Power of Veto in order to save either Felicia or Mecole. Cameron had been considering backdooring Cory Wurtenberger, but said that he wouldn't do it if his Fugitive alliance members, Matt Klotz and Jag Bains weren't on board. While Matt was in favor of the idea, Jag had reservations, and didn't think they should evict Cory yet. Therefore, Cameron decided to follow through with his original plan to evict Felicia this week. Cameron told Bowie Jane that it would cause too much chaos in the house if he nominated Cory at the ceremony.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nDespite trying to convince Cameron that she's not a threat to him, and that she'd vote for him if she made it to the jury, Felicia was unsuccessful at making her pitch to him. Cameron told her that she might not be his biggest threat, but she is the biggest persuader in the house. He doesn't want her to go to the jury, and this is the last week before the Jury of 7 begins. Matt and Jag have an agreement with Cory and America Lopez, so it's no wonder that Jag wanted to keep Cory safe. Between Felicia and Mecole, the houseguests will almost certainly evict Felicia.\nCameron's second HOH was very shocking as he floored the houseguests by nominating Felicia and Izzy Gleicher instead of the expected Jag and Blue. However, this time, Cameron didn't have a reign of chaos, but instead had a much more straightforward approach. This is good gameplay for him, especially since he was unanimously evicted from the house last week. He's smart to play a bit more conservatively right now to ensure his safety when he's ineligible to play for the HOH next week as the outgoing one.\nIf Felicia exits the game, she'll join Kirsten Elwin, Reilly Smedley, Hisam Goueli, Red Utley, Izzy, and Jared as the houseguests who didn't make it to the jury. They're one of the strongest groups of pre-jury competitors in Big Brother history, and it's surprising that so many of them didn't make it to the jury. Felicia has had a great run on the show, and she's a fierce competitor. Perhaps she can turn things around before Thursday's live eviction and keep herself in the Big Brother 25 house longer.\nBig Brother 25 airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT, Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EDT, and Thursdays at 9 p.m. EDT on CBS.\n"}

Christian, a 30-year-old from Minnesota, described himself as the life of the party in episode 4 of season 6 of the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off. Christian said he liked to drink cocktails and loved to make people laugh. He’s been called “starry-eyed Christian” for moving too fast in relationships. During the pandemic, Christian even eloped with a woman, only for him to get the marriage annulled later that year.\nChristian fell for Cleo, who is originally from Italy and lives in London, while he was scrolling on Instagram. Cleo has autism and is a trans woman. Christian had apprehensions about meeting Cleo in person, mostly because his family judged her. Christian took a while to show intimacy towards Cleo. He also tried to flirt with other women in her presence and lied to the cameras when asked if he and Cleo had slept together. Cleo still managed to forgive Christian for his mistakes. They stayed together through the finale to the Tell All, becoming one of the few successful couples of 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 6.\nChristian proposed to Cleo on the 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days Tell All Part 2. Before he professed his love to Cleo and asked her to be his wife, Christian also made their relationship official on Instagram. Shortly after Part 1 of the reunion aired on TV, Christian posted about Cleo on his IG. He shared a photo of the two of them clinking cocktail glasses. “Cat’s out of the bag! I can finally post about Cleo and I without spoiling it for y’all fans of the show!,” Christian wrote in his caption. The photo was not taken when Christian went to England to meet Cleo but was taken during her visit to America.\nChristian has a lot of secrets up his sleeve, including things he’s never revealed to the audience on the show. This includes the persona that he sometimes puts online. In one such post, Christian dressed up as a “U.S. Secret Service agent on the Kennedy detail” for his Instagram. Christian’s black and white photo fetched him several compliments from his followers.\nChristian’s flirty behavior didn’t get a stamp of approval from his cast members. For instance, Amanda Wilhelm called him out for trying to make excuses to justify his actions. She wanted him to admit what he did was wrong. “I just don’t see it,” said Christian. But Christian also hung out with Amanda and the rest of his cast members from America in New York after the Tell All for cocktails. “I'm so glad I met everybody and had a chance to connect with them personally,” Christian wrote about a group photo with his co-stars. He called them wonderful people who put themselves out there.\nChristian also showed off his dancing skills on Instagram to his friends and followers in a September 2023 post. Christian captioned the photo “Shana Tova!” which is a popular phrase that means \"Happy New Year\" and directly translates to \"Good New Year\" in Hebrew. Christian performed a traditional dance with a friend in the picture and seemed to be fully immersed in the act when the photo was clicked. Several fans wished Christian a happy new year in his comments section.\nChristian considers camping one of his pastimes. Christian’s Instagram does reveal a different side to him than what he chose to portray himself as while meeting Cleo. Perhaps things would have been different if Cleo was the one to come to America and Christian was the one showing her around. When Christian posted a video from one of his camping trips to Northern Minnesota, he showed a raging river and declared that he would rather stay there than in “civilization.” Not to be missed was Christian’s tough and rough look with a shaggy beard, a beanie, and large, yellow aviators.\nChristian’s introduction on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days showed him getting ready for a Halloween party at a friend’s place. Christian dressed up as “Chet Steiner,” a 70’s newsman. He donned a red wig and a blue suit with an orange shirt and interviewed the guests at the party as he chugged on beer and showed off his '70s dance moves. Christian surely loves to dress up and is skilled at mimicry, and in a post from August 6, 2023, he did just that. Christian imitated Rick Grimes from The Walking Dead as he mouthed, “There’s walkers… out there… Carol, watch out.”\nChristian leaves no stone unturned to prove that he brings the party with him wherever goes. With an interest in cocktails and an affinity for alcohol, Christian loves sharing his favorite kind of drink creations with the world as he flaunts his party lifestyle. In August 2023, Christian posted a stellar-looking cocktail on his Instagram page. The smoky drink was from Baldamar restaurant in Roseville, Minnesota. Christian wrote that the unique cocktail was called, “Smoky Old Fashioned: N.Y.F.O.F. (Not Your Father’s Old Fashioned).” Created using bourbon, the cocktail also used cherry liqueur with cherry wood smoke.\nThe wildest and eeriest post on Christian’s Instagram page is his Jack Torrance tribute. Back in November 2019 when he was several years away from becoming a sensation on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days, Christian channeled his inner The Shining antagonist to put on display his acting chops for his IG followers. Christian joked that when it gets cold, and the cabin fever sets in, he chases his nephew around like Jack Torrance from The Shining. A follower had even asked Christian why he was not in Hollywood yet. “Actually going in January” was Christian’s cryptic reply.\nSource: Christian Allgood/Instagram, Christian Allgood/Instagram,Christian Allgood/Instagram,Christian Allgood/Instagram,Christian Allgood/Instagram,Christian Allgood/Instagram,Christian Allgood/Instagram,Christian Allgood/Instagram\n"}

After months of striking, the WGA and Hollywood studios have finally reached a deal allowing members to resume writing movies and TV shows and engage in negotiations for new projects, meaning there could be a rush of new project announcements as studios are finally able to finalize deals needed to green-light stagnant projects.\nThe writers strike began after talks with studios on a new deal fell through due to major sticking points such as streaming data transparency, streaming residual structures, restrictions on studio use of AI in movie and TV writing, and more. Fortunately, most of those issues have been addressed in the new WGA basic agreement, meaning writers can begin writing again and Hollywood's temporary standstill comes to an end.\nRelated: Why Writers' New Streaming Residuals Are So Different From TV & Movies\nThe 2023 WGA strike started on May 2nd and ended on July 27th, during which time all writers ceased ongoing work and halted discussions for future work, putting many productions on halt. The beginning of the SAG strikes in the middle of July slowed production down even more. In addition to freezing active projects, this also meant contract talks for future projects could begin or be finalized during that period. Putting movie and TV production on ice for long enough eventually gave the writers the leverage they needed to get the deal they wanted from the studios, and with SAG discussions ongoing, hopefully, actors' demands will be similarly satisfied soon.\nDue to a halt in negotiations, some big franchise plans had to be put on hold, especially for big cinematic universes like DC Studios and the MCU, where numerous projects are constantly in development. Now that writers can resume negotiations, expect a rush of project announcements and rumors to begin again as Hollywood tries to make up for lost time. This can already be seen with reports such as news of an incoming X-Men movie from the MCU. While news about actors won't start until the SAG strikes come to an end, you can expect an arms race to lock up writing talent as the Hollywood machine spins back up again.\nWhile the end of the strikes will likely result in a brief surge of project announcements, that doesn't mean Hollywood will necessarily return to full speed immediately. 2023 has also seen a number of massive flops from big-budget content, meaning some studios may be rethinking their blockbuster plans or slowing down development on future projects as they reconsider their approach. So, while a number of in-development projects were halted for a few months are finally going to start generating headlines thanks to the conclusion of the strikes, that may not be indicative of the kind news cycle to expect in the coming months.\n"}

From subtle but shockingly brutal heroes like Kate Pryde to magically manipulative clones like Mother Righteous, the X-Men universe is filled with characters unlike any other.\nThe X-Men are currently experiencing the horrific Fall of X era, with the mutant heroes scattered throughout the cosmos after a bloody defeat at the hands of the mutantphobic organization Orchis. As the mutant's war against Orchis is waged on multiple fronts, a handful of X-Men characters have clearly been established as the most powerful of the current era. Unsurprisingly, many of these iconically powerful mutants are women, and most of the mutants on this list are considered Omega-level, meaning there has been no recorded upper limit to their abilities.\nThe X-Men's Kate Pryde has often used her phase-shifting powers for defensive maneuvering, but time and time again she has shown the truly devastating impact her ability can have. The Fall of X era has Kate, who has long been a voice of peace and reason on Krakoa's now-defunct Quiet Council, once again donning her ninja persona and becoming Shadowkat, to take down Orchis from the shadows. Pryde is now the only living person who can use the Krakoan Gates, a huge advantage against Orchis, and her grief at the fall of Krakoa has been reflected in her increased brutality, viciously murdering a group of Orchis soldiers without any hesitation.\nCharles Xavier's son David Haller, better known as Legion, was a long-time villain of the X-Men until he gained control over his multiple personalities and stabilized his powers in X-Men Legacy. Since the Krakoan Age Legion has been an outright hero, creating the life-saving astral plane on Krakoa called the Altar, and helping to protect the mutant nation repeatedly. Legion's vast reality-warping abilities would be invaluable against Orchis, but unfortunately, David disappeared from the universe during a battle with Mother Righteous. Hopefully, Legion - who is surely still alive somewhere in the Multiverse - makes an appearance once again during the Fall of X to help save Krakoa and beat Orchis once and for all.\n Bobby Drake, better known as Iceman, is an Omega-level mutant capable of vast negative temperature manipulation, with no upper limit to his control over freezing water. Designated as \"Omega Two\" by Nimrod, Iceman has shown just how powerful he is in the Fall of X era. After being seemingly murdered by Nimrod at the Hellfire Gala, Bobby's partner Romeo was able to reconstitute him out of his dispersed vapor in the air, proving that Iceman is practically immortal. Since then, Bobby has been using his endless ice powers to assault Orchis from all sides, fighting back against his evil oppressors.\nThe mutant-hunting Sentinel robot Nimrod has been an enemy of the X-Men for decades, leading to the annihilation of mutantkind across multiple Multiverses and timelines. The creation of Nimrod is inevitable in every universe, and Nimrod coming online is often the first sign of a coming mutant genocide. Orchis was finally able to bring Nimrod online, and since then the devastatingly intelligent and powerful advanced Sentinel has defeated the X-Men on multiple occasions. Most recently Nimrod slaughtered the newly announced X-Men at the Hellfire Gala and almost murdered Iceman. The X-Men have a lot to fear from Orchis, and Nimrod is one of their most terrifying and formidable allies.\nMother Righteous, recently revealed to be a clone of Mister Sinister's late wife Rebecca, is one of the more intriguing X-Men villains in recent years because of her penchant for magic. Righteous has thus far kept her villainy a secret from most of the X-Men, gaining their trust and favor through the Sins of Sinister timeline. Mother Righteous is able to manipulate and control people by getting them to thank her, giving her immense power over the many Krakoans who gave her thanks after SOS. The full history and power of Righteous' magic is unknown, but she is one of Krakoa's biggest threats of the modern age and is well on her way to achieving her goal of reaching \"Dominion\" status.\nIsca the Unbeaten is one of the most fascinating Arakki mutants to debut during the X-Men's Krakoan Age, due to her disloyal and unrepentant personality, and her devastatingly powerful mutant ability. Isca, who is the younger sister of Genesis, is unable to lose... ever. Her Omega-level ability seems to be reality-warping in nature, because while sometimes Isca will simply be given the skills she needs to win, other times the world around her literally shifts, allowing her to never lose. That being said, Isca's overconfidence will always be her downfall, as the brash mutant can still be manipulated by those around her for their own purposes.\nOroro Munroe has always been a Goddess, and Storm's time as leader of the Brotherhood of Arakko has reestablished her role as X-Men leader and Omega-level icon. Storm has accomplished an almost endless supply of spectacular feats since the dawn of the Krakoan Age, and the highly respected former Queen continues to astonish. During the Fall of X Storm is going head-to-head with Genesis as she wages war on Storm's Brotherhood and the rest of Arakko to gain control over the mutant planet. Ororo's weather manipulation, strategic prowess, and compassion are unmatched in modern Marvel Comics, and Storm will surely continue to be the hero mutantkind needs for years to come.\nGenesis - wife of Apocalypse, mother of the original Horsemen, and ruler of Amenth - has emerged as one of the X-Men's most powerful enemies during the Krakoan Age, first acting as a major antagonist of the X of Swords event. Genesis who is an Omega-level manipulator of plant life, is also the wielder of the Annihilation Staff after the Golden Helm of Annihilation was transformed by Saturnyne. Annihilation's power allows her to control the demonic hordes of Amenth and manipulate the wills and desires of those around her, making her a wildly dangerous foe. In the Fall of X era the ancient warrior is waging war against Storm and her Brotherhood for control of planet Arakko, proving Genesis is a brutal force to be reckoned with.\nAn Omega-level universal seer and member of Arakko's Great Ring, Lactuca the Knower has powers similar in some ways to the X-Men's Manifold. Like Manifold, Lactuca is a \"Universal Shaper\" - the highest level of reality manipulator - and is able to sing to the universe to communicate with it, considering the universe to be their \"mother.\" Lactuca has vast powers like universal communication, teleportation, flight, and most importantly spatial omnipotence, allowing them to know the position of all things in the universe and see everything at once. Lactuca is the one mutant that Genesis fears, as Genesis is unwilling to battle Lactuca after they teleport Storm and her allies away from the Great Ring.\nJean Grey has always been one of the X-Men's most powerful heroes, particularly after gaining a connection to the ancient primordial entity known as the Phoenix Force, which has made Jean into what many consider a cosmic deity. Known as \"Omega One\" to Nimrod and Orchis, Jean's endless empathic, telepathic, and telekinetic abilities make her an incredibly formidable fighter, and her connection to the Phoenix has made her essentially immortal. While Jean was killed by Moira X at the Hellfire Gala she has remained alive in astral form, most likely in the Phoenix's White Hot Room, and is soon set to return to Immortal X-Men, perhaps once again in full control of the Phoenix Force's primordial power.\nThe X-Men have always been home to vastly powerful heroes and villains, but the Fall of X era has really ramped up the displays of Omega-level powers and unrepentant violence, from both sides of the battle lines. From magical manipulation to reality warping, to being the avatar for a cosmic entity, the X-Men's many characters have perhaps never been more powerful, or more ready to use their incredible abilities to defeat their enemies.\n"}
{"title": "8 Star Trek Characters Who Died In A Series Premiere", "date": "2023-10-02 23:00:27", "text": "Star Trek series premieres introduce new characters, starships, and the premise of the show, but sometimes they also leave a body count behind.\nStar Trek series premieres introduce new characters, starships, and the premise of the show, but sometimes they also kill off characters and leave a body count behind. Star Trek: The Original Series was heady science fiction for its mid-1960s era, but it was also an action-adventure series to suit the audience and network demands. Shootouts, fist fights, and character deaths were regular occurrences during the original five-year mission of Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and the Starship Enterprise.\nStar Trek has spanned 11 live-action and animated series since 1966, with a 12th series, Star Trek: Starfleet Academy, already announced, on top of 13 live-action theatrical feature films and a made-for-streaming movie, Star Trek: Section 31, on the way. By and large, Star Trek shows feature an ensemble cast of characters who quickly grow beloved by fans, and most series are set aboard a starship except for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Star Trek series premieres tend to be grand affairs, many two-hour feature film length, that reinforce the franchise's themes of exploration, discovery, and co-existence. But sometimes, Star Trek series premieres are steeped in violence and war, and people die. Here are some notable casualties of Star Trek's series premieres.\nRelated: Star Trek: The Original Series Cast & Character Guide\nLt. Commander Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) was the helmsman of the USS Enterprise and an old friend of Captain James T. Kirk. When the Enterprise entered the Galactic Barrier, Mitchell was struck by strange energies that activated his latent ESP abilities. Mitchell was quickly changed, developing psionic powers like telekinesis, telepathy, and matter manipulation. To stop this malevolent danger to the ship, Kirk attempted to maroon Mitchell on Delta Vega. In response, Mitchell rebelled, killing crewmember Lt. Lee Kelso (Paul Carr). Kirk fought and finally killed Mitchell by burying him under tons of rock.\nDr. Elizabeth Dehner (Sally Kellerman) was a psychiatrist serving aboard the USS Enterprise and, like Lt. Commander Gary Mitchell in Star Trek: The Original Series \"Where No Man Has Gone Before,\" Dehner was also changed by the strange energies of the Galactic Barrier. Dehner developed similar psychic powers as Mitchell, which became clear after Captain Kirk tried to maroon Gary on Delta Vega. Dehner sacrificed her life so that Kirk could kill Mitchell. In his log, Captain Kirk noted that both Mitchell and Dr. Dehner had died in the line of duty.\nAlthough \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\" was the second pilot of Star Trek: The Original Series, it aired later on NBC due to the time needed to complete its visual effects. \"The Man Trap\" was the first episode of Star Trek to actually air on NBC and many fans still consider it Star Trek's series premiere. In \"The Man Trap,\" a salt vampire took the form of a woman named Nancy Crater (Jeanne Bal) and killed people by draining the salt in their bodies. Among the salt vampire's victims were Enterprise crewmen Darnell (Michael Zaslow), Green (Bruce Watson), and Sturgeon (John Arndt), as well as Nancy's husband, Professor Robert Crater (Alfred Ryder). The salt vampire is finally killed by Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley).\nStar Trek: Deep Space Nine begins with a flashback to Star Trek: The Next Generation's Battle of Wolf 359, and the death of Jennifer Sisko (Felicia M. Bell), the wife of Lt. Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks). Jennifer and Ben were stationed on the USS Saratoga with their young son, Jake (Cirroc Lofton), but Ben could only save their son from the Borg attack. Sisko still mourned Jennifer 3 years later when he was made station Commander of Deep Space Nine, and her death defined both Ben and Jake in the early seasons of DS9, although both accepted her loss and moved on with their lives.\nRelated: Every Star Trek Premiere Episode Ranked Worst To Best\nThe series premiere of Star Trek: Enterprise (originally titled just Enterprise) introduced the 22nd century crew of the first Starship Enterprise, the NX-01 led by Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula). But Enterprise was kicked off by the deaths of aliens landing on Earth. Two Suliban agents pursued a Klingon courier named Klaang (Tiny Lister, Jr.), who crashed in Broken Bow, Oklahoma. Klaang killed his pursuers by blowing up a corn silo, but the Klingon is then seriously injured by a farmer. Returning Klaang to the Klingon homeworld then becomes the first mission of Captain Archer's NX-01 Enterprise.\nStar Trek: Discovery's two-part series premiere, \"The Vulcan Hello\" and \"Battle at the Binary Stars\" erupted into a tragic and bloody affair as the resurgent Klingons declared war of the United Federation of Planets. Fleet Admiral Brett Anderson (Terry Serpico) led the USS Europa to the Binary Star system to answer Commander Michael Burnham's (Sonequa Martin-Green) belief that the Klingons were mounting an attack. Burnham was proven right when a Klingon Cleave Ship rammed into the Europa, destroying the starship and everyone aboard, including Admiral Anderson.\nThe most tragic character death of Star Trek: Discovery's series premiere was Michael Burnham's commanding officer, Captain Philippa Georgiou (Michelle Yeoh) of the USS Shenzhou. Georgiou was Burnham's mentor whom Michael mutinied against in her desperate attempt to prove the Klingons were about to start a war. Georgiou and Burnham mounted their own offense on the Klingon Sarcophagus Ship where Phillpa was murdered by the Klingon leader, T'Kuvma (Chris Obi). Captain Georgiou's body was left behind on the Klingon ship as Burnham escaped, and the USS Shenzhou was destroyed by the Klingons. Although Captain Georgiou was mourned, her Mirror Universe counterpart, Emperor Philippa Georgiou, became a main character in Star Trek: Discovery's first 3 seasons.\nStar Trek: Picard's series premiere, \"Remembrance,\" ended with the violent murder of Dahj Asha (Isa Briones) by Romulan Zhat Vash operatives. Ostensibly a young woman who sought help from the retired Admiral Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), Star Trek: Picard soon revealed that Dahj was synthetic, one of a pair of human-like twin androids built from a positronic neuron recovered from the late Commander Data (Brent Spiner). After Dahj was disintegrated by the Romulans, Picard's mission became about saving Dahj's identical twin, Dr. Soji Asha, from the same fate, and Jean-Luc eventually discovered a race of synthetics spawned from Data's tech living on the planet Coppelius. Tragically, Dahj was the sacrifice that launched Jean-Luc Picard back to saving the galaxy at the dawn of Star Trek's 25th century.\nJohn Orquiola is Screen Rant's Star Trek Beat Editor, Senior Features staff writer, and interviewer."}
{"title": "What’s Going On With Amber Heard In Aquaman 2?", "date": "2023-10-02 23:00:27", "text": "Amber Heard is only minimally featured in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom's first trailer, so what's going on with Mera in the upcoming DC sequel?\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom's first trailer barely features Amber Heard as Mera, the chief love interest of the titular hero Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa). This has likely created some confusion as to why she's not more prominently featured and what her role might be in the upcoming DCEU sequel. However, there's likely a collection of factors behind Heard hardly being seen in the new movie's initial promotion.\nIn the first Aquaman movie from Warner Bros and DC Studios, Arthur Curry and Mera reunited after briefly interacting in 2017's Justice League. Working together to stop Arthur's half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) from conquering the surface world, Mera and Arthur went on a journey to recover the Trident of Atlan which Arthur used to unite the Seven Kingdoms as its new king. To that end, the new trailer for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom implies that Aquaman and Mera took their relationship further, even though Mera herself is barely in the trailer. Here is what's likely going on with Mera and actress Amber Heard in Aquaman 2.\nRelated: Aquaman & The Lost Kingdom: Cast, Story, & Everything We Know\nIn the first trailer for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Arthur Curry is shown in his new status quo as King of the Seven Kingdoms. He's also featured as a new father with a newborn son, the implication being that he and Mera got married and had Arthur Curry Jr. However, Black Manta has returned with new power, having recovered the cursed Black Trident with the ability to seemingly resurrect the dead who then follow his command. Seeking revenge against Aquaman for the death of his father, Black Manta vows to kill Aquaman's entire family in the new footage.\nAs a result, this new trailer features multiple shots of Aquaman's family including his mother, father, and son. Based on the trailer alone, things are looking particularly bad for Aquaman's father Tom with the Amnesty Bay lighthouse in flames as Manta rallies his forces with the Black Trident. Furthermore, things definitely don't look good based on Black Manta's original comics' history, having been responsible for the deaths of both Arthur's father and his son while still a baby. As such, it's quite possible that Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom could get very dark depending on how closely its story on-screen mirrors what's been seen on the page.\nAquaman's half-brother Orm is featured quite prominently as well with Aquaman releasing him from his prison to gain his help against Black Manta and his powerful new trident. As such, it's quite bizarre that Mera is only featured in a single shot that's easy to miss in the new trailer, seen striking a window while appearing to be trapped somewhere in Atlantis. While it's possible that Mera is being kept hidden to avoid a major plot point, some behind-the-scenes details help explain what's confirmed to be a more limited role for Amber Heard's Queen Mera compared to her past appearances in the DC Universe.\nRelated: Every Underwater Species In Aquaman 2\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom's director James Wan recently spoke about Amber Heard and her reduced role in the new movie. According to Wan himself, the DC sequel was always going to have a stronger focus on Aquaman and Orm joining forces as estranged brothers and former rivals rather than Aquaman and Mera teaming as they did in the first movie. Having envisioned the first Aquaman film as \"a romance action-adventure movie\" for Arthur and Mera, the sequel will reportedly be a \"bromance\" instead as Arthur and Orm attempt to reconcile their differences to save the Seven Kingdoms.\nApparently, little room has been left for Queen Mera to be involved in the new quest to stop Black Manta, though she is confirmed to have some sort of role (however minimal it may be). Based upon the single shot of the trailer, it does look as though her life will be endangered thanks to Black Manta and his revenge quest against Aquaman. As such, perhaps Mera will be the one to die rather than Tom Curry or Arthur Jr. as a means of subverting expectations for the upcoming DC movie.\nThe deviation away from Mera likely comes from a desire to focus more on the film's villain beyond Aquaman's uneasy alliance with Orm. It certainly looks as though Black Manta in particular will be getting a much bigger spotlight following what many believed wasn't nearly enough screen time or focus in the first Aquaman. Thanks to the new Black Trident, Black Manta has clearly become far more powerful than he was in the first movie, looking to be more than capable of killing his nemesis and everything he loves (which could certainly include Mera). That being said, actress Amber Heard has argued that her role used to be more substantial.\nRelated: Black Manta's New Costume: 7 Biggest Changes In Aquaman 2 Explained\nDuring her very public court battle with ex-husband Johnny Depp over allegations of abuse and defamation, Heard claimed her role as Mera in Aquaman 2 was significantly reduced by Warner Bros. in response. Despite the aforementioned comments from James Wan to the contrary and testimony from DC Films president Walter Hamada citing a lack of chemistry with Momoa, Heard believed her role was a \"very pared down version\" of what it originally was with multiple action scenes having been taken out, implying that it was the result of her ongoing court battle and the allegations being made by both her and Depp regarding each other's alleged misconduct during their relationship.\nBy all accounts, it does not seem as though the trial between Heard and Depp had very little to do with Mera's smaller role in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom compared to the size of her role in the first film. Not only should the comments from Wan and Hamada be taken into account, but it's also worth noting that filming for the sequel wrapped in January 2022, three months before the beginning of Heard and Depp's demotion trial. It certainly looks as though Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was always going to have a shifted focus away from Mera long before the lawsuits.\n"}
{"title": "If You Love Amazon's The Boys, There's a Comic You Need to Read... But It's Not The Boys", "date": "2023-10-02 23:00:27", "text": "Fans of Amazon's streaming series The Boys who may find the original comics too extreme should check out this alternative Garth Ennis comic.\nThe Boys is known for its over-the-top humor, but for fans of the Amazon streaming series, the original comics may be a bit too extreme. But there is a comic-book option for fans looking for an even better Garth Ennis alternative: his DC Comics series Hitman.\nLaunched in 2006 under the DC imprint WildStorm, The Boys was created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. Telling the story of a group of government operatives trained to keep vain and out-of-control superheroes in line, the series positioned itself to be the ultimate taboo-breaking dark superhero parody — so much so that DC Comics eventually canceled the series after only a handful of issues. Dynamite Entertainment then acquired the series, where it went on to run for 72 issues. While the TV show keeps comic’s irreverent tone, there are some elements of the original that haven’t aged as well and may prove too extreme for fans only familiar with the Amazon adaptation.\nFor those fans of The Boys looking to get into comics, a better alternative might be DC Comics’ Hitman, a 60-issue series created by Garth Ennis and John McCrea. The story stars Tommy Monaghan, a low-level hitman in Gotham City who gets super-powers after being attacked by an alien parasite. Now possessing X-ray vision and telepathy, Monaghan decides to specialize in taking contracts on super-humans and other supernatural threats, gaining the ire of heroes like Batman along the way. The series is laced with the same biting superhero satire that made The Boys a success, but it's still not quite as extreme as that boundary-pushing series.\nThis isn’t to say that Hitman is any less violent or profane. True to Garth Ennis form, the adventures of Tommy Monaghan range from the bleak to the hilarious (and one memorable encounter with a zombie plague in the Gotham Aquarium). While Tommy Monaghan routinely makes fun of superheroes and their inherent jingoistic attitudes, the character later confesses to having a deep respect for Superman, even going so far as cheering Superman up after he failed saving someone from a burning building. Aside from all that, Hitman is just plain funny, with several hilarious take-downs like the Daredevil-inspired “Blind Bastard” or the future version of the ridiculous hero Gunfire accidentally turning his backside into a hand grenade.\nWhile Monaghan’s adventures come to a pretty definitive end after the conclusion of his solo series, Garth Ennis and John McCrea would later return to many of his supporting cast in works like All-Star Section Eight and Six-Pack and Dogwelder: Hard Travellin’ Heroez. Of course, The Boys has grown beyond its juvenile origins to be the type of carefully-considered character study that Garth Ennis excels at. But for those fans looking for something less extreme, they couldn’t do any worse than DC Comics’ Hitman.\n"}
{"title": "Sister Wives: What Is Salsa Brava? (Kody & Christine Have Fought There)", "date": "2023-10-02 23:23:59", "text": "Sister Wives season 18 has seen moments from the personal lives of the Brown family, including some tension-filled scenes at Salsa Brava restaurant.\nSister Wives season 18 has pushed the Brown family to brand new emotional spaces, with some moments taking place outside their homes and in public spaces like Salsa Brava restaurant. While the majority of Sister Wives season 18 has always been filmed in the homes of the Brown family, who have been open and honest about their lives from the beginning of the series. For Kody Brown, his relationships with his wives in plural marriage has been difficult to share publicly, especially with the amount of scrutiny that comes from being open about their family. The backlash has gotten worse as Kody's relationships with his wives have changed over the years.\nAfter Christine Brown's departure on Sister Wives season 17, Janelle Brown and Meri Brown followed suit and left Kody with just Robyn Brown as his only remaining wife. While Robyn has never wanted a monogamous relationship, she's found herself in one with Kody at the moment being. As things have been difficult with the Browns at home with everyone moving around, there are times when Sister Wives requires an alternate location to film. For some time, a favored spot of the family's has been used in the series when they aren't able to film at one of their homes.\nOne of the most recognizable locations from Sister Wives season 18 is Salsa Brava, a local Mexican restaurant in Flagstaff, Arizona where the Brown family lives. Though they have homes in Flagstaff they could film at, it is often easier for them to meet at a neutral location for some of the mor difficult conversations they need to have. Salsa Brava is kind enough to allow Sister Wives to film, typically allowing them the privacy of the entire restaurant in order to keep things quiet surrounding the plot lines of the series.\nOne of the major moments of the early episodes of Sister Wives season 18 was Christine and Kody's first meeting after she left the family and moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. Kody and Christine decided to meet for a meal rather than her heading over to Kody and Robyn's, as it was far more neutral for them as co-parents. Their conversation was difficult, and they were able to have it more comfortably as they spoke in a private room at Salsa Brava. Though their conversation was civil, it was good to know the pair would've been on equal ground if things had gotten uncomfortable.\nAlthough Salsa Brava is likely one of the few restaurants in the Flagstaff area that felt comfortable shutting down big portions of their premises for the family to film, it also happens to be one of their favorite places to eat. According to Kody, the family has shared many big meals together at the restaurant, long before Sister Wives was a part of their life. Though they typically meet up at the restaurant to hash out tough moments, the Sister Wives cast also enjoy the atmosphere for gatherings.\nSister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT on TLC.\n"}
{"title": "Blade’s New Villain Has a Dark Version of Ghost Rider’s Signature Move", "date": "2023-10-02 23:30:23", "text": "The ancient evil Blade is currently facing pulls a page out of Ghost Rider's book, unleashing a terrifying version of the Penance Stare.\nWarning: Spoilers for Blade #3!The latest adversary to face Blade just pulled a page out of Ghost Rider's arsenal. The adversary in question is named the Adana, an ancient evil whom Blade was tricked into inadvertently bringing into prominence. A warrior he mistook for a foe was actually the key to stopping the Adana, and now that Blade has defeated the warrior, all hope seems lost. Blade has made it his mission to defeat the Adana, alongside a new sidekick of Blade's named Rotha.\nAs they try to find the weapon capable of defeating her, the Adana makes her presence known in Blade #3 by Bryan Hill, Elena Casagrande, Valentina Pinti, KJ Diaz, and VC's Cory Petit. The Adana is confronted by allies of Doctor Strange, hinting at a reunion with his friend Blade.\nThese would-be captors don't put up much of a fight, as the Adana sets their eyes ablaze with fire after urging them to \"see what I will make of this world.\"\nIf readers are to take her words literally, the Adana just inflicted pain by showing her victims a glimpse of a dark future. Anyone familiar with Ghost Rider will recognize that this sounds like a dark twist on his signature move, the Penance Stare. The Stare itself revolves around Ghost Rider staring deeply into the eyes of his latest victim, during which time he forces them to see the sins of their past until these sins become so overwhelming that they burn a hole through the victim from the inside out. While the Ghost Rider's move focuses on the victim's past, the Adana zeroes in on their future.\nConsidering that this would mark the second indirect reference to Ghost Rider during Bryan Hill's Blade run, the similarities between these moves can't be a coincidence. The first reference comes in Hill's Blade: First Bite Infinity Comic series, found exclusively on Marvel Unlimited. The series is a prequel of sorts to Hill's Blade series, acting as a direct prelude to Blade #1. The series does a lot to foreshadow the challenges Blade either will face or continues to face in Hill's series, but the second issue takes space to force Blade to consider his complicated role with teams, namely his past with the Midnight Sons team that included him and Ghost Rider.\nBlade likens the Midnight Sons to a family, but is certain he works better alone. The conclusion of Blade #3 suggests he'll have to get over that obstacle in the next issue's team-up with Doctor Strange, but all signs seem to suggest that the Devil's Bounty Hunter won't be far behind. Given the similarities of their moves, the Ghost Rider's Penance Stare may turn out to be the best way to combat the Adana. At the same time, the Daywalker is currently in search of the Lightbringer, the sword of Lucifer, as the weapon he needs to kill Adana. Blade may need a ride to Hell from an old friend in Ghost Rider to retrieve it.\nBlade #3 is on salw now from Marvel Comics.\nJoe Anthony Myrick (or JAM) is a comics writer who specializes in, of course, covering the big figureheads of the industry (Marvel and DC), as well as lesser-known indy parties and some personal favorites like BOOM!

{"title": "Will The Last Witch Hunter 2 Ever Happen? Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-02 23:44:05", "text": "The original movie was a fun but forgettable fantasy adventure. Will Vin Diesel return for The Last Witch Hunter 2? Here's what we know.\nWith all the uncertainty around a sequel to The Last Witch Hunter, it's understandable why so many have wondered whether there will be a sequel. The original was a fun but forgettable fantasy adventure that suffered from poor critic reviews, which brings into question the potential for Vin Diesel to return for more in The Last Witch Hunter 2. Given Vin Diesel's long-running success with the Fast & Furious franchise, it's hard to imagine a time when he was reluctant to make sequels. He passed on both 2 Fast 2 Furious and xXx 2 to work on other projects although it was his return in 2009's Fast & Furious that boosted his career to a new level.\nDiesel has starred in every Fast & Furious entry since with his most recent Fast X released in May 2023. Diesel also came back for Riddick and 2017's xXx: The Return Of Xander Cage as part of his career trend as a major blockbuster franchise leading man. The Last Witch Hunter had intended to be another potential movie series for the action star in which he plays an immortal hunter tracking down witches in modern-day New York but there has yet to be an official confirmation of any sequel. The Last Witch Hunter suffered a lukewarm box-office release which already put the sequel in doubt. Vin Diesel has shown to be persistent about projects he loves, however, so The Last Witch Hunter 2 could still happen.\nRELATED: How Much Vin Diesel Was Paid For His 8 Fast & Furious Movies\nThere has been very little concrete news about The Last Witch Hunter 2 despite Vin Diesel's verbal confirmation of it. It is still listed as being in the development stage on IMDb, which historically is very up-to-date about project statuses. The last public comment that Diesel made about The Last Witch Hunter 2 was to Collider more than 3 years ago, stating with conviction that The Last Witch Hunter 2 was in the works. “Lionsgate is coming and saying, ‘We’re putting a writer on for the next one.’ That’s kinda cool! … And this is just recent, by the way. But it’s funny that you mentioned Last Witch Hunter because I’m in a meeting with Lionsgate and they’re actively creating the sequel to The Last Witch Hunter.”\nGiven the unprecedented setbacks with the pandemic and the recently-ended Writers Guild Strike, The Last Witch Hunter 2 might have actually already been released by now in a world where neither of those things happened. According to the information in Diesel's statement, The Last Witch Hunter sequel likely would have been released sometime in 2022 or later if Lionsgate had greenlit the project back in March 2020 and Hollywood hadn't shut down immediately after. As far as cutting-edge news on the matter, there is nothing that adds confirmation to Diesel's original claims over three years ago.\nPrior to the release of the original, Vin Diesel informed fans the studio was so excited by the movie they wanted to start prepping The Last Witch Hunter 2 right away. The actor labeled the would-be series the \"Axe and Cross\" franchise and the studio wanted him to block out time in his schedule for a follow-up. Diesel's Kaulder character is actually based on the actor's own Dungeons & Dragons character but has no relation to the recently successful Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves. Rose Leslie, Elijah Wood, and Michael Caine co-starred in the fantasy blockbuster but have not commented on any plans for The Last Witch Hunter 2.\nInitial talks of a Last Witch Hunter franchise immediately went cold following The Last Witch Hunter's release. The film has an abysmal 18% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes and a Metacritic score of 34, which are both poor indications of its franchise potential. With the movie grossing less than $150 million worldwide on a reported $90 million budget, it's possible that Hollywood is much more inclined to keep paying Diesel to appear in more Fast & Furious movies than to try and revitalize the Witch Hunter series. Factoring in marketing costs, it's unlikely the original movie turned much of a profit during its 2015 theatrical run. The fantasy project did particularly poorly in the U.S. too, taking in less than $30 million.\nThe Last Witch Hunter 2 could continue to follow the saga of Kaulder while also expanding the fictional universe with the implementation of additional characters and backstory. The biggest question that would need to be answered from the original movie is whether Kaulder would finally become successful in killing the White Queen. If this were to happen, he would finally get revenge for the curse that the Witch Queen placed on Kaulder in which he was forced to experience the infinite loss of his wife and daughter.\nIn turn, Kaulder would also be giving up his immortality, since the first Last Witch Hunter movie identified that Kaulder would die if the Queen's heart stopped beating. The Last Witch Hunter 2 would have to sort out whether or not Kaulder's life could be separated from the fate of the Witch's Queen's heart, which was last heard as a part of Kaulder's weapon stash in his apartment at the end of the original movie.\nThe weak financial return of the original movie would seem to rule out The Last Witch Hunter 2 but Diesel isn't one to let go of a series he's fond of. The character of Riddick in Pitch Black helped make him a star even after the disappointing box office performance of 2004's The Chronicles Of Riddick in which the franchise appeared to be dead. Diesel refused to give up on it and helped finance a lower-budget follow-up simply labeled Riddick, which proved to be a hit back in 2013. In fact, Diesel was so sure of Riddick's potential that he appeared in a cameo in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift for no payment other than to receive the creative rights to the Riddick franchise.\nDielel pulled off a similar feat with xXx: The Return Of Xander Cage following the box-office flop of 2005's xXx: State of The Union. While xXx 4 and Riddick 4 are currently stuck in development stages, they are still reportedly being planned. The Last Witch Hunter may not have set the box office on fire but Diesel could find a way to keep the \"Axe and Cross\" series going. He could also explore options of the next franchise installment being a lower-budget sequel, video game, or some other form of entertainment through another medium. The Last Witch Hunter 2 doesn't appear to be officially in the works but given Diesel's track record with major movie franchises, a follow-up is always on the table.\nSource: Collider\n"}
{"title": "Will Maleficent 3 Ever Happen? Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-02 23:44:30", "text": "Maleficent: Mistress of Darkness left the door open for a Maleficent 3, but Disney has so far remained silent. Here's everything we know. \nDisney's Maleficent: Mistress of Evil perfectly set up a continued story for the reimagined villain - so will there ever be a Maleficent 3? Based on the famous Sleeping Beauty tale, the franchise stars Angelina Jolie as the titular character. The original Maleficent premiered in 2014 and introduced the new idea that the old villain and her relationship with Princess Aurora were misunderstood. Then, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, released in October 2019, explored how the pair's story progressed after King Stefan's death - and the film certainly left the door open for a threequel. \nMaleficent: Mistress of Evil picks up five years after the death of King Stefan, with Aurora (Elle Fanning) now ruling as Queen of the Moors. The young woman plans to marry her beloved Phillip - the Prince of Ulstead (Harris Dickinson) - but she doesn't fully understand how much his mother, Queen Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer), despises the Moors, their fairy culture, and especially Maleficent. The sequel explores the conflict and ultimate victory of Maleficent over the power-hungry Queen Ingrith, as well as her acceptance of Aurora and Prince Phillip's marriage. Still, there may be more to the story that a Maleficent 3 could cover.\nRelated: Maleficent: Mistress of Evil Cast & Character Guide\nThough there have been rumors regarding a Maleficent 3, Disney has yet to confirm that any of these are true. Though this may seem like bad news, the House of Mouse has also done nothing to shut down these rumors, so there is still hope for the Fae's continued story. After all, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil didn't perform too terribly at the box office, with a worldwide gross of about $492 million. This was a considerable drop from the first Maleficent movie's $760 million worldwide gross but could have been enough to justify Disney diving in to make the story a well-rounded trilogy.\nRELATED: Does Maleficent: Mistress of Evil Have An After-Credits Scene?\nEven if Disney were to confirm a Maleficent 3 immediately, it would likely be several years before the film ever hit theaters. Maleficent: Mistress of Evil was officially announced by Disney in 2015, and the film wasn't released until 2019. This means the earliest likely release date for Maleficent 3 would be 2026 or 2027. This comes down to the franchise's rather ambitious production scope. The second film came with all the thrills of an epic fantasy, and it's likely that Disney would want to top this—and that takes time to achieve.\nFans can expect Linda Woolverton to write the screenplay once again, but Disney may choose to keep the template for the first film and have Woolverton write it herself. The sequel’s script was co-written by Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue, and it's worth noting that Jez Butterworth (Ford v Ferrari) was hired at one point for a rewrite. In general, critics and moviegoers seem to appreciate the franchise’s visual aesthetic, but the script turned out to be a point of concern for Maleficent: Mistress of Evil's critics.\nMaleficent: Mistress of Evil ends with a showdown between the Dark Fae and Ulstead forces. Maleficent nearly kills Queen Ingrith but ultimately spares her life after listening to Aurora's pleas for mercy. Unsurprisingly, Queen Ingrith takes advantage of the moment and fires an arrow at Maleficent, but the plan backfires as the Dark Fae leader transforms into the mythical Phoenix. Queen Ingrith panics and pushes Aurora off a castle ledge, yet Maleficent/Phoenix saves the day once again and promptly turns the Queen into a little goat.\nAs for how Mistress of Evil sets up Maleficent 3, the second installment provides a sense of finality for Queen Ingrith. Still, it's possible that the character could return, if only because of Pfeiffer's on-screen charisma and franchise appeal as a baddie. For the third movie, Disney will likely focus on the marriage between Aurora and Phillip and conjure up a new villain that can command the screen like Jolie. Based on critic reviews, moviegoers are hoping that Maleficent 3 will be more focused on story rather than spectacle.\nMaleficent 3 couldn't possibly happen without Jolie and Fanning—the duos' performances make up the backbone of the Disney movie series. A recast for Diaval, Maleficent's loyal servant, would also be quite a disappointment since the character provides a lot of heart to the first two films. Prince Phillip was already recast in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, with Harris Dickinson taking over for Brenton Thwaites, so it would be frustrating to see yet another actor take on this role. Therefore, these four actors would likely need to get on board for Maleficent 3 to become a reality.\nRELATED: Angelina Jolie Reveals Why She’s Barely In Movies Anymore\nAs for the additional characters of Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, the majority were left with ambiguous endings that could lead to a role in a threequel. Pfeiffer's Queen Ingrith was only turned into a goat in the previous film, and though this was an implied ending for her character, she could always get turned back into a human. Ed Skrein's dark fae character, Borra, could also make a return. Ultimately, assuming the cast is willing to return, there's seemingly nothing stopping the characters of the Maleficent movies from coming together to bring audiences Maleficent 3.\nQ.V.

Since he returned to life after being murdered by Joker, the former Robin has embraced lethal justice, killing Gotham's biggest threats rather than locking them up in Arkham. Jason Todd and Batman have clashed again and again over his lethal tactics, and now the Dark Knight has had enough.\nThe face-off happens in Batman #138 by Chip Zdarsky, Jorge Jimenez, Tomeu Morey, and Clayton Cowles. After having a full-blown fight with the Bat-Family, Batman ends up kidnapping Jason, bringing him back to Bruce's new apartment where Batman puts Jason through a machine that alters his brain. This altered effect is so strong that Jason initially confuses it for Scarecrow's fear toxin. It turns out what Batman has done is simply edit Jason's brain so that anytime Jason experiences increased adrenaline, he is overcome with unbearable fear. Jason honestly can't believe that Batman would go so far as to change his brain, even suggesting that Batman is no longer in control of his actions. The moment is revealed in a preview of Batman #138 from DC Comics.\nBatman and Jason have always disagreed over how to handle criminals. Due to the death of his parents, Batman has been traumatized by the idea of death, he wants to avoid it by all possible means, for everyone. Jason, on the other hand, believes that instilling fear in criminals only goes so far and that sometimes certain evil-doers have to be killed. This philosophical disagreement has kept Batman and Jason at odds for years. Despite Jason trying to give up lethal force a few times, he's always gone right back to it: most recently Red Hood has sworn to kill the Joker, but Batman is done letting Jason choose murder.\nBatman has always been a control freak, but it's generally within reason. What Batman did to Jason completely crosses the line of what Batman typically finds okay, and even recalls a betrayal that he himself found it difficult to forgive. In the infamous storyline Identity Crisis, Batman walked in on the League wiping the memory of Dr. Light. Batman immediately attacked those responsible and had his memory wiped as well - when Batman learned of this, it's what spurred him to create his anti-Justice League protocols. This shows that Batman is clearly not okay with the idea of messing with people's minds, even if they are brutal criminals. However, the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh would be.\nBatman developed the Zur-En-Arrh persona to protect him in cases of psychic attack, but the extremist identity - which sees itself as a pure Batman, without humanity to hold it back - has been messing with his thoughts lately. Zur-En-Arrh set the deadly robot Failsafe on Batman, and now seems to be pushing him to end the threat of Red Hood for good. However, whether Batman is being controlled or not, Zur-En-Arrh is still a part of him, and it's unlikely Red Hood will be willing to forgive Bruce anytime soon. This is especially the case because Batman notes he can't remove things from Red Hood's personality - presumably including his new fear response. Red Hood faces a future where it will be impossible for him to operate as a crime-fighter, and where Batman's betrayal could cut him off from the Bat-Family for good.\nBatman #138 is on sale October 3 from DC Comics.\n"}
{"title": "It Took 10 Years, But G.I. Joe Finally Has A Great Movie Future", "date": "2023-10-03 00:10:27", "text": "Things haven't looked up for the G.I. Joe franchise in a decade. Now, thanks to the new Transformers movie, the G.I. Joe movie future is secure. \nAfter a decade-long wait, the G.I. Joe franchise finally has a great movie future thanks to Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. G.I. Joe Retaliation came out in 2013 to middling reviews, leaving its strength as a franchise in jeopardy, and another G.I. Joe film wouldn't come out until 2021, when Henry Golding starred as Snake Eyes. Due to a combination of factors, including the Covid-19 pandemic, a weak storyline, and divisive creative decisions, Snake Eyes didn't do well, leaving fans wondering if G.I. Joe 3 would ever happen, and the future of the action franchise continued to be in dire straights.\nThanks to Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, it doesn't matter that the previous two G. I. Joe movies bombed. The Transformers franchise has had its fair share of highs and lows, but it's been on an upswing now that the Transformers timeline has a lot of room to explore different characters and storylines. There are plenty of Transformers yet to appear in the films, and now with the inclusion of G.I. Joe characters in the eighth installment in the film series, there's a chance for both franchises to grow together in the ultimate crossover.\nAfter the main storyline there's a surprising twist in the closing moments of Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, where Noah Diaz, the main human character helping the Autobots gets a potential offer from the G.I. Joe. The Transformers' crossover with G.I. Joe sets them up to be part of a bigger universe than they would be on their own. Of course, the tantalizing teaser sets up some big questions about G.I. Joe's movie future, such as how the Joes would work with the Autobots, but the concept has a lot of potential, particularly since both franchises are tied to some of the biggest toy lines in history.\n No characters from the G.I. Joe franchise actually appeared in the film, and it's not clear yet if any of the original cast, like Channing Tatum would decide to return. But given that the series are both very similar in tone, and the Joes have integrated massive amounts of advanced technology into their storylines, it makes sense that in this mid-90s timeline, some of the research in the Joe program could be inspired by Autobot tech.\nThe G.I. Joe movies were heading for a third reboot after Snake Eyes underperformed, but the crossover with Transformers' will mean that the franchise won't have to be carried on its own merit. Bolstered by a stronger IP, it can be part of even bigger events, from the Earth-based to the intergalactic. The crossover also takes the pressure off for a third film which, given its budget and the cost of an ensemble piece, could disappoint at the box office again and kill the franchise for good.\nThanks to Transformers: Rise of the Beasts reinvigorating interest in Michael Bay's films, the Transformers franchise has already had another film in the timeline greenlit. With the strong personalities of the Autobots and Decepticons, combined with the Joes and members of Cobra, there's no end to the storytelling combinations. And now with the G.I. Joes, it's going to be every kid's dream to see their favorite heroes come together with the best visual effects.\n"}

The graphic novel, part of DC's \"Graphic Novels for Kids\" line, retells the story of Oliver Queen's time stranded on an island, as will be familiar to viewers of the CW series, Arrow. Stranded remixes the hero's classic tale, adjusting it for a younger audience.\nGreen Arrow: Stranded – from the creative team of Brendan Deneen and Bell Hosalla – presents a much younger version of the hero, as the thirteen-year-old finds himself having to survive in the wilderness of a desert island.\nOver the course of the book, Oliver develops the skills that will make him one of DC's iconic heroes, and the savior of Star City.\nRelated: \"No Arrows, No Tricks, No Gimmicks\": Green Arrow Finally Beats One of the DC Universe’s Greatest Villains (Again)\nIn Green Arrow: Stranded, Oliver Queen is on a trip with his dad, his dad's business partner, and the business partner's son. He is much younger in this iteration, a fresh-faced teenager, far from coming into his own as a superhero. Oliver has not been very good at the outings his father takes him on. As a result, he is seen as a bit softer and weaker than the son of his dad's business partner, Tyler, who makes fun of him for his seeming lack of skill. However, when their plane crashes on an island, Ollie is the one who must save the group.\nIn past iterations of Green Arrow's origin, Oliver frequently loses his father immediately after shipwrecks, or other similar incidents. He is usually the sole survivor, being forced to save himself before returning to become a hero in Star City. In Green Arrow: Stranded, Oliver has to save his father and their companions by moving past his past hesitations, and applying the knowledge he acquired, but hadn't previously had use for. Green Arrow: Stranded is a youthful and less grim iteration of the hero, allowing his skills and personality to shine in a more positive way than is usually seen with the character\nGreen Arrow has often tackled tough issues, with his older stories having a strong sociopolitical aspect. Green Arrow: Stranded offers a version of the character relatable to young audiences, making this version of Oliver Queen a bright light in DC's offerings since it captures and showcases his abilities and learning period. It may not show Ollie at his height as a hero in Star City, but it does bring positivity to the characte,r given that his recent media versions are grim and full of grief. Green Arrow: Stranded adds a child-friendly, young version of the titular hero that broadens the character's offerings in a big way that DC should continue providing for comic-loving families.\n"}

Self-proclaimed bad boy Sarper is a 43-year-old from Turkey who Shekinah fell in love with after meeting him on a dating app. Sarper was wearing highlighter on his nose on their first date, which impressed Shekinah, who's an aesthetician and makeup artist. Sarper wasn’t shy when it came to talking about his past, claiming he slept with most of his 2,500 dates.\nHowever, Shekinah was going to be his last. Shekinah moved from Los Angeles to Istanbul on the reality TV spin-off. Sarper’s past made him look like a red flag to Shekinah, but she chose to ignore it. Sarper wanted Shekinah to be of a certain weight and dress in the way he liked. Still, the only thing truly problematic about Sarper for Shekinah is how he refuses to make their relationship Instagram official. Sarper is not afraid of his adventurous past, but is he too attached to it to tell the world that he’s quit it for good?\nSarper has been working as a professional model for a year. Someone offered him to model for a brand, and as someone who loves “exposing” his body, Sarper took up the opportunity. He did exotic dancing for seven years and enjoyed it a lot.

Stine's newest Stuff of Nightmares comic introduces readers to a killer with a stunning connection to one of his Goosebumps villains.\nWarning: Contains Spoilers for Stuff of Nightmares: Red Murder!\nThe newest comic from author R.L. Stine is redefining one of his most overlooked Goosebumps books. R.L. Stine has become one of the most successful children's authors in modern history. His success with the Goosebumps anthology franchise skyrocketed him to fame, and the name is recognizable to this day with countless reprints and an upcoming reboot series on Disney+. However, Stine is known for more than just his work on the kid-friendly horror series.\nStarting in 2022, R.L. Stine has been collaborating with comic-book publisher BOOM! Studios and a variety of artists to produce new tales of terror aimed squarely at adults called Stuff of Nightmares. In the latest entry, R.L. Stine and Adam Gorham present readers with Stuff of Nightmares: Red Murder. The story follows a comic creator down on his luck after he finds himself struggling to create something successful following the popularity of his first work, Red Murder. Suddenly, at a local comic convention, someone taking on the persona of his bloodthirsty antihero begins killing attendees. It's an interesting premise for a horror story, but fans of the Goosebumps franchise may notice some similarities to one of Stine's original Goosebumps stories.\nRelated: A Mall Santa is Out for Blood in R.L. Stine's STUFF OF NIGHTMARES: SLAY RIDE\nReleased in November 1994, Attack of the Mutant follows the adventures of a comic fan named Skipper who adores the supervillain the Masked Mutant. However, he soon realizes that his favorite villain may actually be real when he notices a building that looks like his base. Red Murder seems to have taken the premise of this Goosebumps story and recontextualized it for adults. After all, the Mad Mutant is not as bloodthirsty as Red Murder, but it's no coincidence that this is Stine's second time taking on the concept. In a way, it works better here, since Attack of the Mutant isn't regarded as one of the best Goosebumps stories. By reframing the tale for adults, the comic gives the concept new life — while also improving on it.\nThose improvements include a twist ending. The Goosebumps story ends nonsensivally with Skipper bleeding comic book ink, hinting that he himself is probably a comic book character. Red Murder, however, reveals that the killer was actually the author of the story the whole time, believing himself to be his non-existent brother. While this ending can be seen coming from a mile away, it makes far more sense than the twist from Goosebumps. But this opens up its own can of worms\nThe stigmatization of people with Dissociate Identity Disorder (DID) is all too prevalent, especially in the horror genre. Making a person with DID the villain has become a harshly negative trope. This comic may be an improvement on Mutant, but it comes at the cost of some ableist undertones. Despite these issues, it's interesting to see Stine take what didn't work when he tried this story in the past and recreate it for his now-adult fans. This opens up the doors to revamping some other past ideas, such as Why I'm Afraid of Bees and Go Eat Worms. The future looks bright for R.L. Stine and his latest series, and if he can continue doing to other Goosebumps books what he did here, Stuff of Nightmares could be even more popular than his beloved '90s classic.\nStuff of Nightmares: Red Murder is available now from BOOM! Studios.\n"}

Even if things were falling apart, she and Wayne became husband and wife in a ceremony that made Holly happy. Wayne and Holly have avoided sharing any recent photos together on Instagram, but they do follow each other, which is a good sign. The couple seem to be married, even if Holly suggests she’s back in the U.S. with her new updates. Wayne and Holly could be keeping their current relationship status a secret until the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way Tell All. In that case, this seems to be the most successful and probably last marriage for Holly.\n90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\nSource: Holly Weeks/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "90 Day Fiancé Couple's Engaged (Proposal Was Terrible - Here's Why)", "date": "2023-10-03 01:20:28", "text": "A new 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way couple get engaged in the new episode, but the low-effort marriage proposal fails to leave a mark on viewers.\nBrandan DeNucci and Mary Demasu-ay from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way had a mediocre engagement that could've been much better. The 23-year-old had a chaotic journey with his Philippine-born girlfriend. The couple had an obsessive relationship that seemed full of red flags. Nonetheless, they stayed together and decided to make their online relationship official. During the show, Brandan flew to meet Mary in her home country even though he had minimum savings.\nHowever, she repaid him with more doubts, called him out for sitting next to a female passenger, and warned him not to look at other females. Many thought Mary and Brandan would eventually split due to their insecurities. Regardless, the pair shocked everyone by sealing the deal. Recently, Mary revealed she was pregnant with Brandan's baby. The couple looked happier than ever to learn the news and seemed deeply in love. While Brandan and Mary will probably have a happy ending, their proposal and engagement on the show weren't as exciting.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nThere are a few reasons why Brandan's much-awaited proposal wasn't impressive. However, the main reason was a lack of preparation. Most people love planning the proposal, ensuring the timing is right, and making it special for their significant other. However, Brandan didn't do any of that. Instead, he proposed to Mary at the back of their shop. He had no speech and didn't even get on one knee. To make matters worse, Brandan didn't know Mary's finger size and gave her an engagement ring that was too big.\nMany 90 Day Fiancé stars have made mistakes in their relationship. However, Brandan probably surpassed them all by getting the ring engraved. The reality TV star got \"I'm Enough\" inscribed on Mary's engagement ring. He did it as a gesture, hinting at the times they fought and thought they weren't enough for each other. Brandan felt it was a good idea because he didn't want himself or Mary to doubt their relationship anymore. \nAnother big reason why Brandan's proposal flopped on-screen was Mary's reaction. Often, people are happy during these special moments. However, Mary was irritated that Brandan wasn't helping her with household chores. The financial struggle and the baby on the way were other things that stopped her from relishing at the moment. If Brandan had picked a better location, time, and moment, he could've impressed Mary during the proposal. However, his lack of concern or immaturity caused this major milestone to seem like just another day. Still, all that matters is that the new 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 couple is happy.\n90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.\n"}
{"title": "How Saw X's Post-Credits Scene Is A Callback To The Original Movie", "date": "2023-10-03 02:10:28", "text": "Saw X production designer Anthony Stabley explains the connection between the new movie's post-credits scene and the franchise’s original film.\nWarning: This post contains spoilers for Saw X!\nSaw X production designer Anthony Stabley explains how he and his team went to great lengths to create a callback to the original movie in the sequel's post-credits sequence. The latest installment of the Saw franchise takes place between the events of the original film and 2005's Saw II. For the first time, Tobin Bell's John Kramer takes center stage in the lead role as he travels to Mexico for a medical procedure to deal with his cancer. When the experimental procedure is revealed as a scam to defraud the sick, John vows to teach the con artists a lesson using his classic Jigsaw methods.\nThe Saw X post-credit scene shows John torturing the con-man who referred him to the scam medical procedure in the first place. In a surprise reveal, he is joined by Costas Mandylor's Mark Hoffman, a long-running villain of the franchise. However, what connects this scene to the original Saw is that it takes place in the iconic bathroom that served as the prime setting for the 2004 horror classic. In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, production designer Stabley explained how he and his team had to study the bathroom from the original film, saying:\n\"We looked at the tile, we were very precise in the way we recreated that...My set designers were pulling their hair a little because we wanted it to be so true. It's so iconic, so it was something that we were very excited to recreate\".\nSaw X has received the most positive reviews of any movie in the series thus far and earned the highest domestic opening weekend of any Saw film since 2010, a deeply impressive feat for the tenth film in a franchise. It is a return to form for a series that has been hit-or-miss, with many praising the characterization of John Kramer and the depiction of his relationship with his apprentice Amanda, portrayed by Shawnee Smith. Saw X also sharply deals with John's struggles with the for-profit healthcare system, reminiscent of another high point for the franchise, Saw VI, which had John take on the private insurance industry.\nRegarding whether there could be a Saw 11 next, the appearance of Hoffman in the post-credits scene appears to set up another installment in the franchise. The creative team has been careful not to commit to a follow-up, though Saw X director Kevin Greutert told Entertainment Weekly that they were \"superstitious about discussing\" more potential sequels before finding out how this installment performed at the box office. With the new movie earning some of the best reviews of the franchise and looking at a solid box office run, Jigsaw and his games could very well return for more.\nSource: EW\nBorn and raised in New Jersey, Anthony \"A.J.\" Ricci graduated from Rowan University with a degree in Radio-TV-Film.

When Kalani and Asuelu met, he was 23 years old, and she was 29. Kalani lost her virginity to Asuelu. He was the only man she ever loved until he repeatedly betrayed her trust despite the several chances she gave him to rectify his mistakes. Kalani and Asuelu came to the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off to save their marriage. Kalani had already used the hall pass that Asuelu gave her, and she began dating a man named Dallas Nuez.\nNow that Kalani knows Asuelu is beyond the point of forgiveness, she could have chosen to reveal his dark side to 90 Day Fiancé viewers. Kalani and Asuelu had a session with Dr. Janie Lacey. Kalani’s sister Kolini joined the couple as they used therapy to resolve their issues. Kolini was the only person in the world whom Kalani went to for support whenever Asuelu cheated on her, and there had been “numerous” times he cheated. Kolini’s feelings towards Asuelu changed to those of resentment. Fans never came to know why Kolini disliked Asuelu so much, and it was because Asuelu had cheated on Kalani for the length of their relationship.\n“It was like girl after girl after girl,” said Kalani. Kalani may have thought her 90 Day Fiance would change when he came to America. However, within a year, Asuelu started “online cheating.” Asuelu didn’t physically cheat on her. Asuelu was reaching out to different women online. He used to buy their naked pictures. That continued until the time Asuelu went to Samoa and indulged in oral sex with an unknown woman. Perhaps his getting yeast infection on his tongue was the last straw for Kalani.\n“So collectively, he’s cheated like 10-12 times,” revealed Kalani. She said she felt disgusted with herself just hearing herself say that. Kalani had put Asuelu in a position to allow him to hurt her over and over again. Asuelu defended himself by claiming that growing up his parents didn’t teach him that what he did was wrong. Kalani said “almost all of the men in Samoa think it’s okay.” As per Kalani, married men were hitting on her and Kolini when they were in Samoa. Asuelu’s friends who were married were also hitting on her.\nBy the time Kalani found out Asuelu had cheated on her, she was already pregnant and bringing Asuelu to America. She felt like she needed to “suck it up and hide it.” Kalani wanted Asuelu to get along with her dad and with her family members, so she kept it hidden to protect him. Kalani assumed if Asuelu came to America and was around her dad, he would be a “good guy.” But Kalani’s plan of getting Asuelu out of the environment didn’t help him change.\nKalani held onto the belief that Asuelu would change up until his Samoa trip cheating and up until the 90 Day: The Last Resort star moved on to be with another man who cared. Kalani kept warning him that they’d end up divorced while Asuelu kept cheating. Because Kalani never left, Asuelu believed she would never leave him. Asuelu is making it look like he’s admitting to his mistakes, but he may have lost Kalani for good. Their marriage is beyond saving.\n90 Day: The Last Resort airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EDT on TLC.\nSource: 90 Day Fiancé/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "Comedy Show From Monty Python Stars Thought Lost For 54 Years Is Found & Can Be Watched Right Now", "date": "2023-10-03 03:17:51", "text": "Once-lost comedy show A Complete and Utter History of Britain, which features Monty Python stars Michael Palin and Terry Jones, has been recovered.\nA decades old British comedy show featuring Monty Python’s Michael Palin and Terry Jones is recovered after it was thought to be long lost. Jones and Palin were two of Monty Python’s six founding cast members, which also included Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gillam, and Eric Idle. As a comedy troupe, Monty Python begin their act through the sketch comedy show Monty Python’s Flying Circus before going on to make a number of feature films, including Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Life of Brian.\nA 54-year-old pre-Monty Python comedy series called A Complete and Utter History of Britain has been recovered by ITV, according to British Comedy Guide. Featuring Palin and Jones, the six-part spoof documentary aired in January and February 1969. At one point, it was thought that only the first two installments of A Complete and Utter History of Britain had survived past the broadcast, but upon further investigation, ITV realized that the series had simply been \"mis-catalogued.\" Check out the statement from ITV below:\n\"The series had been sitting in the ITV vaults though mis-catalogued for decades, but through the identification programme we were able to make this remarkable find.\n\"We flagged it to our colleagues in streaming, had the film cleaned and restored from the 16mm telerecordings and then finally made available to our viewers for the first time since the original broadcasts.\"\nA Complete and Utter History of Britain was originally shot in seven parts, with the first two later edited down into one for the television broadcast. Content-wise, A Complete and Utter History of Britain was filmed as a spoof documentary of the British Isles. The mockumentary united Palin and Jones, who would go on to help form Monty Python soon after its broadcast. Monty Python’s Flying Circus ended up airing that same year, in October 1969.\nRelated: Every Movie Monty Python Worked Together In (That Isn't Monty Python)\nParodying British history as Palin and Jones did in A Complete and Utter History of Britain would lay the groundwork for later Monty Python work. Several of the troupe's movies poke fun at history, whether it be King Arthur in Monty Python and the Holy Grail or Jesus in Life of Brian. From the sounds of even the title alone, A Complete and Utter History of Britain exists in a similar vein to later Monty Python movies and shows.\nNow, comedy fans can see this pre-Monty Python work through ITVX Premium. The buildup to this moment is significant, as the previous surviving material for A Complete and Utter History of Britain was released on Blu-ray in 2014. Audiences who have gotten a pre-Monty Python tease with those episodes can now see the full show as A Complete and Utter History of Britain is recovered at last.\nSource: British Comedy Guide\n"}

{"title": "&quot;Always Keeps Its 16-Bit Heart In The Right Place&quot; - Pixel Ripped 1995 PSVR2 Review", "date": "2023-10-03 08:01:24", "text": "Pixel Ripped 1995 hits the PSVR2, a nostalgic and brief all-ages adventure through classic gaming that leverages 3D interactivity in inventive ways.\nThe Pixel Ripped series has maintained a consistent following while existing mostly under the radar, keeping perfect pace with new upgrades in VR gaming technology while sticking to its core retro throwback principles over a trio of releases. Pixel Ripped 1995 is the second title in the series, which now enjoys a spiffy PSVR2 update delivering smoother gameplay and some new features for Sony’s flagship headset. For millennial and adjacent gamers who grew up in the wood-paneled television age, Pixel Ripped 1995 hits that sweet spot of nostalgic resonance and good-vibes adventure, even though some of its best ideas could use a little more expansion and attention.\nAs with the other games, players primarily take on the role of a young person interacting with Dot, the hero of the video game realm of Far-of-a-Land. Dot presents most recognizably as Samus Aran of Nintendo’s Metroid franchise, sporting shiny armor and a hand cannon, and any scene in Pixel Ripped 1995 from Dot’s perspective features pixelated 2D graphics smoothly modeled and animated in a 3D space. It’s a consistently cool style that hasn’t really been replicated elsewhere, and the detailed environments from this perspective blend 16-bit textures with all the expectant tricks from immersive VR stationary games.\nPart of Pixel Ripped 1995’s approachability stems from its storytelling, which features a charming Saturday morning cartoon plot arc where Dot seeks the help of the greatest video game players in the \"real\" world to succeed against her arch nemesis, a megalomaniacal goblin named Cyblin Lord. To keep the peace, a cubic MacGuffin known as “The Stone” lies under lock and key in a temple, but Cyblin Lord steals it to subdue and hypnotize the residents of Far-of-a-Land.\nThe narrative progresses over the six chapters of the game, which see Dot and her champion player teaming up; the former typically on a screen and the latter with controller in hand. Pixel Ripped 1995 centers on David, an eleven-year-old video game wiz whose mother constantly harangues him about his constant positioning in front of the screen. Both she and David’s father are well-meaning but uninformed parents, and the game is filled with concerned critiques on gaming pursuits which will feel most familiar to those of a certain age.\nWith those tensions in place, most chapters see David attempting to play a game in his favorite series-within-the-game, Pixel Ripped. These feature various riffs on the 16-bit era and a little beyond, including mascot platformers, the Sega Genesis’ Road Rash series, Star Fox, and other teasing references. There’s a turkey hidden in a predictable wall during a Castlevania-like portion, and one of David’s needling frenemies mentions a secret in a game he learned from his uncle who works for the video game company du jour.\nOf course, there are never any overt mentions of real-life gaming corporations, but Pixel Ripped 1995’s developers clearly grew up among the era’s greats, and the more niche references are sure to resound. Beyond these tips of the hat are the more ineffable cultural details, like trying to play a video game while a parent vents on the phone to a relative about her son’s obsession, or the special thrill of playing an unowned console at a video game store’s kiosk.\nIn most cases, Pixel Ripped 1995 uses these scenarios to add a pleasant twist, complicating the otherwise simple games-within-the-game. In the latter case, Dot merges the game worlds in two different kiosks together, so that weapons picked up in a platformer on one kiosk can be transferred to the hero in the other. Players then have to swap the virtual controllers back and forth to make progress in each of the two games, all while David’s nemesis and a few browsing customers yammer on in the background.\nThis attention to atmosphere is one of Pixel Ripped 1995’s greatest strengths. The reality-bending boss battles that finish off each chapter are another, a set of curious encounters which merge David’s “reality” with Dot’s heroics, ramping up the interactivity further. In one, he tosses banana peels to trip up a two-dimensional boss while controlling a motorcycle-riding Dot, all while dad keeps asking about the commotion coming from the back of the car. In another, he guides her through space hazards wielding her spaceship like a paper plane, which is a strong enough gameplay mechanic to make for its own VR title.\nThe game is quite short, with start to credits requiring approximately three hours in total, though hunting for a series of tucked-away golden cartridges in the game might propel completionists to give it another spin. These collectibles unlock skins for Dot, and a few of their locations are satisfying to solve, though playing through certain chapters to track them all down might be a grueling exercise.\nCertain levels risk dragging the experience down, especially the beat ‘em up chapter. Here, David enters a competition at the local arcade, but the Streets of Rage clone he has to play is absolutely the worst game in the lot. The level boss is easy but noxious, presented as a 1v1 fighter rival, but the simplicity of the action here makes the experience feel broken and much less than the sum of its conceptual parts.\nThe rest of the game fares much better, and the Castlevania section in particular is a genuine treat. Even the stand-in for Belmont with his dopey narcissism could be a sly reference to the cartoon counterpart in Captain N The Game Master; that’s how deeply read the love of gaming is in Pixel Ripped 1995. In many ways the superior update of its predecessor, it’s a digestible VR nostalgia-fest which will resonate most with those of us who remember renting games at the nearby shop and running into a silly name left behind on the last player's save file. With this as the current best version of the game – and a thankfully free PSVR2 upgrade for anyone who still has it in their library – Pixel Ripped 1995 always keeps its 16-bit heart in the right place.\nSource: PlayStation/YouTube\nPixel Ripped 1995 is available on most VR headsets, with this newest edition arriving to PlayStation VR2 on October 3. A digital PSVR2 code was provided to Screen Rant for the purpose of this review.\n"}

Offered during a gig you receive as you explore the new area of Dogtown, this mission tests your stealth skills as you negotiate with some heavy hitters in Night City. Those looking to earn some sweet eddies will want to tackle this task carefully.\nYou will be given this task by Mr. Hands as a Gig side quest that appears toward the central parts of Dogtown close to the Pacifica area. This doesn't occur until you unlock different story endings in Cyberpunk 2077's DLC after completing the tenth main story mission, \"Firestarter.\" Once you travel to the gig location, Mr. Hands will call you to begin the mission with a cautionary tale about the son of a recent client.\nRelated: There’s One Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Side Quest You Should Do ASAP\nThe first part of this quest requires you to travel to the previously mentioned spot in Dogtown to meet with Michael Maldonado, the client Mr. Hands spoke of over the phone. The fixer has apparently spoken highly of V, leading Michael to request your services directly in Cyberpunk 2077. Talking to the man reveals that his son, Eric, has been targeted to be made an example of by the law despite the legitimate business he runs in Night City.\nApparently, an officer from the D.A.'s office named Georgina Zembinsky has been trying to bring down a crime kingpin named Hector Sacristán and forced Michael to testify against Eric. According to Michael, Eric has info that could incriminate Sacristán, which explains why Georgina wanted to put them in a place where he could testify so badly. Michael asks you to talk to Georgina and convince her not to send Eric to jail for this mission in Cyberpunk 2077.\nMichael lets you know that Georgina can be found at the Heavy Hearts club, the same place where he was beaten to testify against his son in Cyberpunk 2077. One of the optional goals here is to avoid raising the alarm while at the club, making this a stealth mission for those who want bonus rewards. To remain as hidden as possible, speak to the bartender and ask them about Georgina.\nThe bartender will say that the D.A. officer is likely in the VIP booth and to meet with a person named Jack in the bathroom for more information. You'll catch Jack in the middle of some sort of deal; go ahead and kindly interrupt him to find Georgina for you in Cyberpunk 2077. For a small price of 550 Eddies, you can get Jack to immediately contact his sources and confirm your target's location in the club.\nJack also happens to be a vendor that you can purchase multiple items from, including several items such as weapons in Cyberpunk 2077 that could help during this mission if you run into any trouble.\nThe moment you reach the VIP section, you will quickly realize that you aren't allowed in to reach Georgina, making it challenging to keep sticking to stealth. You might find Markus, an NPC that gets thrown out of the VIP section in Cyberpunk 2077 right as you're arriving, but you do not need to talk to him. Go up the stairs leading to the VIP space, but remember that you are in a hostile area where enemies could attack if you get caught.\nEnemies have to be looking in your general direction for you to be spotted, making it easy to get to VIP Rooms 1-3. To make it to the higher number areas, though, you need to hack and disable the security cameras on the ceiling to make it to Georgina.\nMake your way to Room 4, where Jack mentioned friends of Georgina were who would know her location. However, if you want to grab a special weapon, head down to Room 6 without getting spotted to retrieve the Crimestopper weapon in Cyberpunk 2077. Found in a suitcase within the room, this powerful gun lets you lock onto an additional enemy and immobilize targets when fired as a tool not found in any black markets in the Phantom Liberty DLC.\nEven if you aren't interested in the Crimestoppers, an Attorney in Room 4 will direct you to Georgina in Room 6 anyway. Continue to disable security systems and use the bars as cover to move stealthily through the VIP lounge until you reach this private space. The room is locked, so you must travel down the stairs at the end of the area to find a fusebox in Cyberpunk 2077 past some guards that can open a secret path.\nSimilar to the end of the \"Push it to the Limit\" quest in Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty, the last part of this mission is simply talking, leading to an interesting decision. No matter what you did to open the hidden path from the fusebox, it will lead to VIP Room 6 on the right. Here, you may finally speak to Georgina, who is flanked by a bodyguard named Hank, who makes the situation far tenser.\nDuring this conversation, Georgina will show V the whole confession from Michael, claiming that the father wasn't harmed and simply sold out his son for some quick money in Cyberpunk 2077. She offers you a deal to let her submit the testimony from an anonymous source so that Michael can be safe from Eric's anger. You can either take the deal or force Georgina to delete the footage if you don't entirely trust her story.\nAgreeing to the deal makes both parties happy, but refusing leads to Hank attacking V unless you have enough Body Attributes to intimidate him. Both decisions end the mission, opening up a passage that leads back to the club's first floor. For either choice, you gain 2,000 Eddies from Michael and another 6,000 credit bonus if you remain hidden for completing the \"Heaviest of Hearts\" mission in Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC.\n"}

This twin-headed chaotic evil must be driven back into the Abyss in the last portion of the story. However, doing this will challenge everything you've learned, testing your mastery over your character's class skills and abilities.\nBefore you take on this powerful enemy at the end of \"The Abyss Looks Back\" story Chapter, complete any side content you haven't done in the DLC already. This will earn you the money needed to buy the best items in this Minecraft content and level up your character's stats to better face off against Demogorgon. The impressive attention to detail on any side quests will also prolong your adventure.\nRelated: \"Impressively Like D&D\" - MInecraft x Dungeons & Dragons Review\nThe best strategy for defeating Demogorgon is to attack until you need to heal, then run away to recover your health before going back toward the boss. Unlike opponents like the early Juggernaut boss fight in Minecraft's D&D DLC, the Demogorgon has attacks that can counter almost every class. The boss' tendril arm attacks hit in an extremely wide range, either around its whole body or in front of it, knocking your character back when they hit.\nWith every physical strike pushing you away, it can be difficult to hit Demogorgon in Minecraft, while its limbs are easily able to attack your character from even far away in the area. As of this time of writing, there have even been instances of characters having to reset the battle because the boss knocks them out of the arena. Stay far away from Demogorgon when you can, and use long-range spells to damage it before it can reach you.\nIf you don't have long-range options, keep in mind that a poisonous miasma close to Demogorgon causes any character near him to take damage over time. One of the demon's heads can also shoot a purple beam that causes the screen to go dark and confuse you. Similar to the Larva Mage boss fight in Minecraft's D&D DLC, a slow effect can also be applied, making your character easier for the boss to attack.\nAs you continue to apply pressure and damage the boss, several allies from the story will begin to weaken Demogorgon with different magic. Stay alive, heal when you need to, and wait for your dragon friend to give you the perfect chance to slay Demogorgon once and for all to end Minecraft's D&D DLC story.\n"}

No matter who you want to end up with, giving the correct answers to Zethino's questions can improve your relationship with your partner-to-be. The love test gauges how well you know your companion and how compatible the two of you may be.\nZethino is a dryad found in Rivington's Circus of the Last Days. She offers a love test for you and one companion of your choice to see how well you know your love. She will ask three questions about your companion based on their hopes, fears, and personalities. You're sure to impress your crush if you get them all right.\nRelated: Every Baldur’s Gate 3 Romance Option, Ranked Worst To Best\nEach love test is structured the same way in Baldur's Gate 3. After picking a companion to take the test with, you will be telepathically teleported to a beautiful grove with a rolling waterfall. A large log crosses the stream made by the waterfall. You stand at one end while your companion and Zethino stand on the other. Zethino will ask her three questions and give her final verdict on your relationship afterward.\nIf you are hoping to romance Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3, you should know her well when you arrive at the Circus of the Last Days. Shadowheart finds comfort in good company and an even better vintage. You will earn her respect by being discreet. Sadly, her deepest shame is that she doesn't know who she is or where she belongs.\nNext on the list is Gale, the Human Wizard, who has a few interesting questions. Starting off with a question that is better suited to a high school icebreaker, Gale would be a shiny red apple if he were a food item. He is happiest while on his balcony in Waterdeep. Lastly, his biggest flaw is that he thinks both he and the world would be better off if he were dead.\nAstarion is a popular romance option in Baldur's Gate 3, so many players will want to invite him to play Zethino's little game. Astarion is happiest when he is elbow-deep in gore. He has a deep desire for revenge, as connected to his vampiric lore. Finally, his greatest fear is breaking a nail (at least, the fear that won't make him hate you). They may not be the deepest answers, but Astarion loves them.\nIf you weren't a fan of Astarion's vain and violent answers, Wyll the Warlock may be your better partner in the love test. On Wyll's darkest day, the best thing to cheer him up would be memories of the first night you shared with him, getting to know one another. He most admires his father, Ulder Ravengard. Because of that, Wyll's greatest regret is leaving his father and city behind.\nLae'zel's powerful skills in battle make her an attractive choice for some players. If you want to take the love test with Lae'zel, you will need to know her deepest desire: to find the truth about Orpheus amidst her queen's lies. Her fondest memory is of your night together. Her legacy will be that of a liberator for the Githyanki people.\nIf you want to romance Zarlach in Baldur's Gate 3, you're in for a fun, bloody ride that likely is not safe for work. Just remember that she hates Gortash above all others. Her perfect day involves bashing baddies interspersed with victory sex. Despite the bloodlust riddling her answers, she hopes to be settled down in a quiet village with a nice partner and a few kids in a decade.\nIf you've decided to romance Halsin in Baldur's Gate 3, the love test is a great way to strengthen your bonds. The first question asks where he is most comfortable, but comfort doesn't come naturally to him. He is most proud of protecting his grove from those who threatened it. Lastly, his greatest failure is allowing the Shadow Curse to blight nature for a hundred years.\nThe last romanceable companion in Baldur's Gate 3, Minthara, likely won't be in many player's parties, but if you're into her evil machinations, you can happily invite her to take the test. There are a couple of different ways you can answer this test, and while both are correct, one provides a stronger romantic outcome than the other. When asked about the Underdark, she misses spiced Ulaver wine and thinly sliced rothe steak. She most admires you of all people. Finally, the worst thing done, in her eyes, is letting herself get captured by the cult of the Absolute.\nIf Orin is still alive at this point, she may appear after the test with a cryptic word or two for you and your companion. However, if you've got all the questions right, that won't matter, as you have gotten one step closer to your desired romantic ending of Baldur's Gate 3.\n"}

{"title": "Should You Give Your Heart To Geppetto In Lies Of P?", "date": "2023-10-04 20:05:27", "text": "Near the end of Lies of P, Gepetto asks for your heart. Whether you give it to him determines what happens next, as well as the game’s ending.\nOne of the final scenes of Lies of P forces Pinocchio to decide whether to turn over his heart to his creator, Gepetto. Pinocchio's mechanical heart, the P-Organ, is part of what allows him to walk the line between puppet and real boy, exploring the desolate city of Krat as a freestanding automaton with a sense of will. It also functions as a complex, customizable skill tree, allowing players to upgrade the P-Organ throughout Lies of P to gain new skills and upgrade stats.\n[Warning: This article contains spoilers for all possible endings of Lies of P.]\nLies of P reaches its climax when Pinocchio storms the Isle of Alchemists and defeats the sinister faction's leader, Simon Manus, in what may be the game's final boss fight. He takes a lift down to a subterranean chamber, where Gepetto stands in wait. He greets his creation, and coos over the terrible ordeal he put Pinocchio through. He promises to put a stop to it; but first, he just needs Pinocchio's heart. There are two dialogue options here: \"Give your heart,\" or \"Refuse.\" This choice directly affects what happens next, and the ending after.\nRelated: Lies Of P: Should You Kill Alidoro?\nRegardless of any other choices made throughout the game, giving Gepetto the P-Organ always results in the same, \"Real Boy\" ending to the game. And that ending begins immediately. Gepetto praises Pinocchio's good behavior, and calls him the greatest puppet he ever made. He promises to turn Pinocchio into a real boy and leave Krat with him, before abruptly and violently removing his heart. Pinocchio crumples to the ground, but remains conscious; he watches as Gepetto tinkers with the P-Organ in his toolbox.\nThe scene fades to black, and then up again on a rainy night under the neon sign of Hotel Krat. Gepetto waits beneath the arch of the hotel doorway, a pile of luggage beside him. A bloodstained Pinocchio emerges, sees his creator, and smiles warmly. Gepetto smiles back with a heavy sigh, as he remarks on how he finally sees Pinocchio as his son. It's a happy ending, sure, but there are some nagging doubts. In a voiceover, Sophia asks, \"Is this truly the future you wanted?\"\nThere are still a few things players can do after beating Lies of P, even with this abrupt ending. Pinocchio can return to Hotel Krat, listen to any available Records, chat with NPCs, and play the piano for an easy achievement. However, besides a slightly disappointing, dubiously happy ending, there's not much else that giving Gepetto the heart unlocks.\nThings get a little more complicated if Pinocchio refuses. What happens here depends on a number of choices made throughout the game, not least of which are those that make up Lies of P's Truth and Lie system. Several important plot points come down to a simple decision between telling the truth and lying, and each time Pinocchio lies, additional points are added onto a hidden measure of his humanity. There are other important choices in Lies of P, to be sure, but the morality and humanity of lies are the main determining factors in how the game ends - along with whether Pinocchio gives Gepetto his heart.\nIf Pinocchio has primarily told the truth, and spared Sophia when he met her on the Isle of Alchemists, players will see the \"Free from the Puppet String\" ending after refusing Gepetto. Once they refuse, Gepetto's words of praise turn to admonishment. He calls Pinocchio useless, and resigns to take the P-Organ for himself. Gepetto then summons Nameless Puppet, a faceless marionette who serves as Lies of P's secret final boss.\nPinocchio and the Nameless Puppet spar, but as soon as it seems like Pinocchio has gained the upper hand, the Nameless Puppet knocks him to the ground and lines up a killing blow. However, Gepetto steps in front of its sword. He dies in Pinocchio's arms with one final insult. Pinocchio destroys the Nameless Puppet's heart, and the game ends on the spot.\nHowever, on New Game Plus, if Pinocchio has primarily lied, gave Sophia peace in death, and stolen the painting \"Portrait of a Boy\" from the Black Rabbit Brotherhood, he can unlock another ending, \"Rise of P.\" However, he must return to the hotel after beating Simon Manus, listen to all the Records in Lies of P, and examine the portrait. He notices the image's elongated nose, and can pry it out of the painting to use it as a weapon: the Golden Lie.\nPinocchio may then return to Gepetto and refuse to give him the heart. The final boss battle is much the same, except Gepetto compares the deceitful Pinocchio to his human son Carlo, and apologizes to him instead of scolding him. However, this does unlock a unique epilogue in which Pinocchio restores Sophia to life, transferring her Ergo and consciousness into a puppet body.\nThe best way to negotiate the Gepetto decision is to give him Pinocchio's heart the first time, and refuse him every time after. Those who want to see all possible endings will need to play through the game at least twice. That's because unlocking the \"Rise of P\" ending requires Pinocchio to collect and listen to all the Records in the game, and some of them are only available by making a one-time choice. For example, lying to Eugénie about Alidoro's identity grants him one Record, while telling the truth grants him a different one.\nTherefore, the most efficient way to see all three endings is to always tell the truth and spare Sophia on a first playthrough, then agree to give Gepetto the heart. After watching the \"Real Boy\" ending, players can load their most recent save file and refuse Gepetto to see the \"Free from the Puppet String\" ending. Finally, they can start a NG+, always lie, and kill Sophia to see the \"Rise of P\" ending.\nBut even for those who don't plan on completing NG+ to see that final ending, it's still worth giving up the heart, then reloading and refusing to see both options. Appeasing Gepetto ends the game in about two minutes, and creates an interesting character moment where Pinocchio questions whether he wants more than just humanity. Then, returning to the pivotal moment and trying the other option unlocks an extra boss and a somewhat more satisfying ending. This way, players can experience the best of both worlds in Lies of P.\n"}

Debuting in 2011, Bob’s Burgers quickly set itself apart from other animated sitcoms thanks to its uncanny ability to make even the most bombastic and wild plotlines seem grounded. Despite its surreal sensibilities the show is completely relatable and feels far closer in tone (somehow) to both King of the Hill and The Simpsons than South Park or Family Guy. After over a decade on the air Bob’s Burgers shows no signs of ending soon, and season 15 has been confirmed by Fox.\nWhile details on the next season of Bob’s Burgers after the current run are scarce, there’s still plenty to discuss around the show’s future. Since Fox was acquired by Disney in 2019, Bob and the rest of the Belcher’s have received a movie and a streaming home on platform Hulu. The future likely has much more in store for Bob, Linda, Jean, Tina, and Louise, and it will start with the upcoming Bob’s Burgers season 15.\nWhile there haven’t been any major updates on the development of Bob’s Burgers season 15 since the renewal was confirmed in January 2023, this is largely due to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Not only was development on the next season of Bob’s Burgers likely put on hold while both the writers and actors unions negotiated a deal for fair working condition with the AMPTP, but both the cast and screenwriters couldn’t promote the show.\nNow that the WGA have reached an agreement with the ATMPTP, with the SAG-AFTRA dispute expected to be resolved soon, it’s likely that more news on Bob’s Burgers season 15 will shortly follow. The current season of Bob’s Burgers only debuted in October, so once the finale airs more updates on season 15 may come soon after.\nFox renewed Bob’s Burgers for season 15 in January 2023, alongside the 14th season. The confirmation of two more Bob’s Burgers seasons came alongside commissioning more episodes of fellow Fox animation powerhouses Family Guy and The Simpsons. \n The official Bob’s Burgers Twitter account celebrated the renewal with a photo of Louise, Tina, and Jean skipping. Fox Entertainment President of Scripted Programming Michael Thorn spoke highly of the renewal at the time (via Collider):\n\n\"With this trio of renewals, we celebrate excellence in animation on Fox, our wonderful, longtime partnership with 20th Television, and the brilliant creators and incredible voices behind these forever favorites. Three-plus decades of 'The Simpsons,' more than two decades of 'Family Guy,' and over a decade of 'Bob's Burgers' proves the enduring power of the animation genre on our network and the infinite fan affinity for these outrageously funny comedy classics.\"\n\n\"With this trio of renewals, we celebrate excellence in animation on Fox, our wonderful, longtime partnership with 20th Television, and the brilliant creators and incredible voices behind these forever favorites.

It’s expected to arrive in the fall 2024 season, possibly in October. From the ninth onwards new seasons of Bob’s Burgers have consisted of 22 episodes, released weekly on Fox. Should season 15 follow the same pattern it will keep Bob’s Burgers on the air until 2025.\nThere have been no announced cast changes yet for Bob’s Burgers season 15. There aren’t any expected either, as the show has managed to keep its core roster of voice actors throughout. Provided there aren’t any unexpected exits in the interim, the cast of Bob’s Burgers season 15 is expected to include:\nJoining the Belchers (and Teddy) for Bob’s Burgers season 15 will also include many returning cast members who voice multiple supporting characters on the show. These include Kevin Kline as Mr. Fischoeder, Zach Galifianakis as his brother Felix, and Laura and Sarah Silverman as twins Andy and Aolly. Megan Mullally will also likely feature heavily as Linda’s sister Gayle.\nThere have been multiple celebrity cameos and guest appearances over the years as the show gained momentum on Fox. The cast of Bob’s Burgers season 15 will also likey include from guest-stars, though none have been revealed.\nNone of the plots or story threads from Bob’s Burgers season 15 have been revealed yet. It’s also quite possible that the scripts haven’t yet been written, given the WGA strike in 2023. Once the episode titles of the next season of Bob’s Burgers have been shared by Fox, along with a trailer, what awaits the Belchers when they return will become much clearer. Until then, however, the storylines in Bob’s Burgers season 15 are a total mystery.\n"}

Debuting on Fox in 1989, The Simpsons is one of the longest running TV shows currently on the air. It quickly became one of the most successful shows in the network's history, surviving until Disney purchased Fox in 2019. Now one of the tent pole franchises for the House of Mouse, The Simpsons is still going strong, with season 36 already confirmed and on the way.\nWhile there’s not much known about The Simpsons season 36 yet, anticipation is already high. New episodes of The Simpsons since the Disney acquisition have widely been regarded as being an uptick in quality for the show, with season 34 in particular being well received by fans and critics. With no signs of the show losing momentum anytime soon there’s plenty to digest when it comes to The Simpsons season 36.\nThere haven’t been any huge updates on The Simpsons season 36 since the news broke in January 2023 that Fox had renewed the show for another two seasons. However, there are two main reasons for this — the 35th season arriving first, and the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes meaning a general lack of promotion of in-development projects throughout 2023. Once the current run concludes there will likely be more information available about the 36th season of The Simpsons.\nThe Simpsons has been renewed for season 36. The renewal announcement came in January 2023 when Fox confirmed they’d greenlit The Simpsons for two seasons, which would extend the run of the show into 2025.\nThe release date for The Simpsons season 36 hasn’t yet been announced by Fox or parent company Disney. Previous seasons of The Simpsons have premiered on or close to the start of October, so a fall 2024 release window for the 36th season of the show is likely.\nUnless there are any surprise recasts, sudden exits, or tragic news like the passing of Marcia Wallace in 2013, the cast of The Simpsons season 36 will be unchanged from prior seasons of the show. This means the cast can be expected to include:\nThe cast of The Simpsons is also known for many celebrity and guest star cameos. The Simpsons season 36 will be no exception, although there haven’t been any reveals yet about who’s the next famous face to make a debut in Springfield.\nThere haven’t been any details yet revealed about what episodes are in The Simpsons season 36. The show has been going on so long that what the episode plots might be is unpredictable, but it might rehash or revisit former storylines (while being self-aware and lambasting itself for doing so, of course). While The Simpsons revisiting former episodes is always a risk, the show has been going so long that it’s inevitable plots focused around callbacks to stories from literally decades ago are going to appear, and the 36th season is no exception.\nIt’s expected that The Simpsons season 36 will feature Treehouse Of Horror XXXV, the infamous Simpsons Halloween special, though nothing’s been teased about which popular horror movies the citizens of Springfield will parody in The Simpsons season 36. The current season of the show is also set to feature the return of Sideshow Bob (Kelsey Grammar), who hasn’t been seen for several years. It’s possible that The Simpsons season 36 will also bring back some former characters from the extensive history of the show for some new storylines.\n"}
{"title": "Mortis Gods Explained: Star Wars History, Powers, Planet & Importance", "date": "2023-10-04 20:05:27", "text": "The Mortis gods are some of Star Wars’ most powerful Force-wielders, and Dave Filoni is using them to unite The Clone Wars, Rebels, and now Ahsoka.\nWarning! This article contains SPOILERS for the Ahsoka finale.\nStar Wars has introduced three powerful beings, the Mortis gods, who look increasing important after Ahsoka. The true nature and origin of the Force has always been a mystery in Star Wars, but it is clearly tied to mysterious beings known as the Mortis gods - beings venerated on Peridea, a planet situated in a distant galaxy. These seem to be tied to the mysterious agenda of dark Jedi Baylan Skoll, suggesting they will be extremely important going forward.\nPreviously, Mortis was thought to be a mystical realm that was separate from the Star Wars universe, much like the World Between Worlds. Nevertheless, depictions of the Mortis gods have been found scattered throughout the galaxy, such as the mural at the Jedi Temple on Lothal. However, Baylan’s discovery of the Mortis god statues suggests Mortis may physically reside on Peridea. It’s no understatement to say that the Mortis gods are some of the most important and allegorical characters in all of Star Wars. And if Baylan has found where they once dwelled, he may have stumbled across the power to harness the Force itself.\nRelated: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nThe three Mortis gods were introduced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars as immensely powerful beings, known as \"Force-wielders.\" The Father, the Daughter, and the Son served to guide the Force along its path in the galaxy. While these beings had a physical presence on Mortis, they also had the ability to shape-shift at will. According to one of them, their purpose was to guard “the power,” meaning the Force itself. The realm of Mortis acted as a conduit through which all the Force in Star Wars flowed, and the Mortis gods were the ones who controlled that flow while ensuring the duality between the dark side and the light side remained.\nThe Mortis gods were venerated throughout the galaxy as legendary. In Star Wars Rebels, Ezra Bridger found a mural of the Mortis gods on the Jedi Temple of Lothal that led to the entrance of the World Between Worlds; there are also inscriptions of the Mortis gods in some of the sacred Jedi texts used by Rey in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Although the Jedi Order clearly once knew of the Mortis gods, belief in their existence appears to have waned. Even the Father said that few still know of the Mortis gods’ existence. According to him, their unique ability to manipulate the Force compelled them to abandon the temporal world.\nIn The Clone Wars, the Father is portrayed as an aged man who maintains the balance of the Force by keeping his children in check. It’s likely he’s been performing this duty for several thousands of years, given the ancient depictions of him on Lothal and Peridea. He believed the realm of Mortis was the only place he could fully control his children and prevent them from tearing the fabric of the universe apart. However, the Mortis arc also revealed that the Father was dying, and that he was losing his grip on the ability to control his children.\nRelated: How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order\nThe Father was the most powerful Mortis god, and the children derived their power and immortally from him. Mortis acted as both a sanctuary and a prison for the three Force-wielders. While the Father was tempered enough to keep the balance, the Daughter and the Son were too far aligned to either side of the Force to be trusted on their own. In other words, though they desired to flee Mortis and exert their power over the galaxy in full, the Father kept them both shackled out of love. In his eyes, the dark and the light must wax and wane equally. If one side gained too much power, then the balance of life was thrown out of sorts.\nThe Daughter of the Father represented the light side of the Force, and the side that the Jedi tended to favor. She had the ability to transform into an enormous griffin. She was the day, and enjoyed giving life to Mortis by causing plants to bloom in the sun. Unlike her brother, who desired more and more power, the Daughter took her role as the light side in somberness. She believed and trusted her Father’s decision in keeping her and her brother captive, and she only exercised her power when her brother challenged her. In her own words, she constantly wishes to do what is selfless.\nInterestingly, the Daughter’s statue that Baylan finds on Peridea has been decapitated. As the light side of the Force, her absence symbolizes the state of the light side during Ahsoka's place in the Star Wars timeline. In The Clone Wars, the Daughter sacrifices herself to save the Father, and then transfers her remaining life into Ahsoka Tano. In many ways, her death represents Order 66 and the fall of the Jedi Order. Just as she died, so too the Jedi were killed. Meanwhile, the Son was left to gain power on Mortis alone, much like how Palpatine was able to rule the galaxy for a time.\nAs the representation of the dark side of the Force, the Son (voiced by Sam Witwer) continually seeks to usurp the Father and take his place as the most powerful Mortis god. There was a part of him that loved his sister, but it may have been solely because she gave his own power meaning. The Son was adept at shapeshifting into many different forms, his favorite being a giant bat. However, he also took on the guise of Shmi Skywalker, Anakin’s mother, in order to tempt him to the dark side. The Son also transformed into a small goblin in order to taunt Ahsoka and infect her with the dark side.\nWhile the Daughter was selfless, the Son was selfish. Like the Sith who derived their power from him, he delighted in decay, darkness, and the power hatred and malice gave him. After the Daughter died, Mortis became a realm of darkness and despair. The plants she’d grown withered due to the Son’s power. In a last-ditch effort to escape Mortis, the Son revealed Anakin’s future as Darth Vader to him, though these memories were later removed by the Father. Nevertheless, the Son’s victory over the Daughter represented the Empire and the dark side taking over.\nVery little has been revealed about where the realm of Mortis was located in the galaxy. Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Ahsoka were transported there by an octahedral monument floating near the Chrelythium system. While there, Obi-Wan said that his scanners couldn’t place where they were in the known galaxy. Ahsoka seemed to think the planet was barely larger than an asteroid. Nevertheless, Baylan Skoll may have proven that Mortis actually physically reside on Peridea. If this is the case, then Baylan is close to discovering the location of the conduit of the Force. Mortis itself amplifies Force-sensitivity, meaning Baylan could take his place as a Force-wielder or even harness the flow of the Force itself.\nThere are several notable locations on Mortis. The Well of the Dark Side was a fiery chasm that led deep beneath the planet’s surface, and was the place where all the dark side in the galaxy flowed through. Elsewhere, the Altar of Mortis housed the Dagger of Mortis, a weapon more dangerous than any lightsaber given its ability to kill Mortis gods. However, the majority of the action in the Mortis arc takes place in the Mortis monastery, which may be the same structure Baylan sees in the distance on Peridea.\nRelated: Star Wars: The Clone Wars Episodes In Chronological Order (Correct Watch Order)\nThe entire Mortis arc in The Clone Wars was precipitated by the Father to determine whether Anakin was truly the Chosen One. Given his failing health, the Father believed Anakin could remain on Mortis as his successor, though Anakin ultimately rejected this offer. Even with their mystical power, the Mortis gods still held the prophecy of the Chosen One in reverence. The Father says that it was foretold Anakin would remain on Mortis and continue to keep the balance. Nevertheless, Anakin's refusal ultimately led to the destruction of Mortis and the end of the Mortis gods.\nThe Mortis arc was intensely symbolic, making it hard to place in the Star Wars timeline. Though Anakin, Obi-Wan and Ahsoka were transported there during the Clone Wars, the days they spent with the Mortis gods did not occur in real time. Upon their return to the temporal galaxy, Captain Rex says that they only lost contact with them for a few moments. In other words, the realm of Mortis may not be bound by time, which would explain how the Father has been able to keep the balance between his children for thousands of years.\nThe Mortis arc takes place in Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 3, episodes 15, 16, and 17. In “Overlords,” Anakin, Ahsoka, and Obi-Wan first arrive at the strange realm of Mortis. Anakin also proved his ability to subdue both the Son and the Daughter simultaneously, solidifying his role as the Chosen One who can control the Force. However, in “Altar of Mortis,” the Daughter was killed while attempting to save the Father from the Son, nullifying Anakin’s need to remain and keep the balance. In “Ghosts of Mortis,” the Father chose to sacrifice himself in order to take away the Son’s power and immortality, allowing Anakin to deal the final blow.\nWhile Mortis itself does not appear, a depiction of the Mortis gods also appears in Star Wars Rebels season 4, episodes 12 and 13. In “Wolves and a Door,” Ezra Bridger and Sabine Wren discover a hidden mural of the Father, the Son, and the Daughter deep under the Jedi Temple on Lothal. By using the Force, Ezra was able to activate a gateway leading to the World Between Worlds, which may be intrinsically linked to the power of the Mortis gods. In “A World Between Worlds,” Ezra managed to save Ahsoka using time travel, though the mural and the Temple ultimately collapse in on themselves at the end.\nIn the brief years between The Clone Wars’ release and Disney’s eventual takeover, Aaron Allston further expounded on the mystery of the Mortis gods in his Fate of the Jedi series. Now a part of Star Wars Legends, Allston introduced an ancient being known as Abeloth, who was the primary antagonist of his works. Originally a mortal woman who stumbled across the three Mortis gods, she eventually took her place as the absent Mother in their family. Unlike the Father, who merely contained his children, Abeloth was able to get them to cooperate. However, as a mortal, Abeloth eventually grew old and longed to be immortal.\nRelated: Is Star Wars Bringing Back Legends' Most Powerful Dark Side Being?\nThough they are now a part of Legends, Abeloth drank from Font of Power and swam in the Pool of Knowledge. And while these acts granted her immortality, they also twisted her into a terrifyingly powerful entity of the dark side. The rest of the Mortis gods, fearing her power, had her imprisoned. However, their deaths in The Clone Wars ultimately freed Abeloth to wreak havoc on the galaxy. Furthermore, it’s possible that Lucasfilm's Dave Filoni means to bring Abeloth to canon; she could be the entity drawing Baylan to Mortis.\nIf Abeloth is not calling to Baylan, then it may be that the Mortis gods are not as dead as The Clone Wars led the audience to believe. Since the Mortis gods are heavily tied to the Force itself, its possible they persist even after their physical forms perished. The Father even tells Anakin that their physicality was merely a reflection of the surrounding energy. If the Mortis gods still exist within the Force, it could be that they’re calling to Baylan to come to Mortis and take their place as the keepers of the power.\nRegardless of whether it’s the Mortis gods or Abeloth who call to Baylan, Dave Filoni faces a difficult decision in wrapping up Baylan’s Mortis plot line. With the unfortunate passing of Ray Stevenson, Baylan’s character remains stuck atop the statue of the Father. His goal of reaching Mortis is in sight, yet he can no longer reach it. Regardless of how Filoni handles the loss, he’s managed to use the Mortis gods to tie together almost every Star Wars project he’s worked on, from The Clone Wars, to Rebels, and now Ahsoka.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka now streaming on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Superman: Legacy Risks Repeating The Snyderverse's Big Batman Problem", "date": "2023-10-04 20:10:26", "text": "Superman: Legacy will repeat one narrative trick the DCEU used with Batman. However, doing so comes with risks the franchise surely wants to avoid.\nSuperman: Legacy will officially kick-start the new DC Universe continuity on the big screen when it releases in 2025, and James Gunn's reboot is emulating a Batman narrative decision from Zack Snyder's DCEU. Not much is yet known about Superman: Legacy, though casting details have started to emerge, confirming several heroes like Green Lantern and Hawkgirl who will officially enter the DCU canon with their appearance. Of course, the focus will be on Clark Kent and his adventures as Superman.\nPlot details for Clark's next big-screen adventure are still being held under wraps, but we do know that Superman: Legacy won't re-tell Superman's origin story. Per Gunn, who is writing and directing the movie, \"I think we've seen his origin enough in film at this time!\" While the DCEU does show Bruce Wayne's parents getting shot, it does skip his backstory of becoming the version of Batman seen on screen. While it was likely smart to streamline the introduction of a familiar character like Bruce, it also introduced a few problems that Superman: Legacy will want to avoid.\nBatman has starred in enough beloved movies and TV shows that viewers can be reasonably expected to know who he is, why he does what he does, and how he operates as The Dark Knight. Because of this, and because Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne was introduced in a team-up movie instead of his own solo project, the DCEU presented a truncated version of Bruce's backstory. However, since Affleck is shown as a Batman late in his career, most of his work is left up to the imagination. For the most part, this isn't a problem. However, it also meant that certain DCEU character changes were never fully explored.\nNotably, the Batman presented in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is overly violent and jaded, a far cry from the intense but compassionate Bruce normally seen in DC media. Hints are dropped as to why this may be, such as the costume of a dead Robin in the Batcave, but by skimming over important elements of backstory, some of Bruce's characterization comes off as unwarranted, unearned, and unexplained. If Superman: Legacy wants to avoid similar characterization confusion, it must be more careful with what parts of Clark's backstory it chooses to leave out.\nThough his backstory may not quite be as ubiquitous in pop culture as Batman's, the big beats behind who Superman is are similarly known. Enough movies and TV shows have shown or mentioned the destruction of Krypton and why Clark is on Earth that Gunn is correct about it not being necessary to show again. However, given that Man of Steel is the most recent big-screen project to cover Kal-El's youth and that the movie takes big liberties with important plot beats, some might be risky to skip. Most notably, Man of Steel presented a controversial Jonathan Kent, one who was less optimistic and inspiring and more paranoid and unsure.\nRelated: Every Actor Cast In Superman Legacy (So Far)\nWhile Superman: Legacy's story doesn't need to show the destruction of Krypton, Kal-El crash-landing on Earth, or the Kent's raising Clark, his adoptive parents being a positive and formative impact on who he is may be important context for the older Clark seen in the movie. Of course, there are other options. Clark may still have a close and meaningful relationship with one or both parents in Superman: Legacy, or he could reminisce about their time together even without showing them on-screen.\nSuperman: Legacy will also benefit from the fact that Superman's background simply isn't as important to explore in detail as that of an older Batman in the DCEU. While broad strokes about where Clark is from are foundational elements of his person, he doesn't need a complicated chain of events to explain his optimism and belief in the potential of humanity to do good. At his best, Superman is guided by a relatively simple set of morals and ethics that drive him to be as good as he can be, and that's easy to understand.\nAffleck's Batman was presented as a markedly different character than most interpretations in DC Comics. While that was a good thing in many ways, it also raised valid questions about what happened to him that simply weren't answered. Unless Superman: Legacy plans to make dramatic changes to who Clark Kent is as a person, it should be just fine keeping his backstory to a minimum.\n"}
{"title": "How Napoleon's Large-Scale French Battle Rivals Gladiator's Epicness", "date": "2023-10-04 20:14:26", "text": "A new trailer for Ridley Scott’s Napoleon teases the film’s massive practical battle sequences that rival the major battle scenes from Gladiator.\nRidley Scott hypes Napoleon's upcoming practical battle sequences in a new trailer for the upcoming historical epic, and it looks like they're just as epic as Gladiator's. Scott's upcoming collaboration with Apple sees the director chronicling the life, career, and military exploits of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. After first directing him in 2000's Gladiator, Scott reunites with Joaquin Phoenix for the film, with the actor playing the titular role.\nNow, as the Napoleon release date approaches, Sony Pictures Entertainment has released a new featurette-style trailer for the movie, revealing how Scott pulled off the large-scale battle sequences. The film seemingly relied heavily on practical methods, with the director revealing that filming one battle involved \"300 men and a hundred horses.\" Check out the trailer below:\nRelated: Ridley Scott's Epic New Movie Is Flipping What Made Gladiator A $500 Million Success\nGladiator features a number of big fight sequences, with the opening one perhaps being the largest of them all. The film begins with Russell Crowe's Maximus leading the Roman Army against a Barbarian horde in Germania, and the sequence is complete with a horse charge, chaotic sword fighting in the mud, and explosive firebombs. The rest of the film is similarly action-packed, but many of the sequences are somewhat smaller in scale and a little more contained, with Maximus and his companions facing off against various threats within the Colosseum.\nNapoleon, on the other hand, appears like it might have more of a focus on large-scale battles than Gladiator did. Trailers for the movie have already provided a fairly good indication of the types of battle scenes to come, with Napoleon's Russia campaign, in particular, serving as the backdrop for much of the action. Imagines were recently released, for example, of Napoleon leading his army through a burning Moscow.\nThe Battle of Austerlitz, too, has been teased fairly extensively in the film's marketing. The battle, which was one of the most tactically impressive battles that Napoleon ever waged, famously features the French military commander using cannons to break the ice beneath retreating Russian soldiers. It remains to be seen whether Napoleon's battles will exceed what Scott did previously in Gladiator, but the latest trailer is certainly a promising sign that the movie will be truly epic in scale.\nSource: Sony Pictures Entertainment/ YouTube\n"}

Korean TV shows have been among the most successful and well-received works of fiction globally for several years now. Thanks to the streaming era, watching the best K-dramas from anywhere in the world is now far easier, which allows incredible stories and great actors to reach an even bigger audience. From massive pop culture hits like Squid Game to hidden gems, Netflix has some of the best Korean TV shows currently available.\nK-drama episodes tend to be significantly long, with some shows including 60-minute or even 90-minute-long episodes. That said, even successful shows tend not to go on for multiple seasons and are instead wrapped up in a couple of series, which can be helpful for those who are looking for titles to binge. There are great Korean dramas from almost every genre, not to mention series that combine two or three different styles. Here are the 10 best Korean shows on Netflix right now.\nGenre: Romance, Sci-Fi\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Ahn Hyo-seop (Koo Yeon-jun / Nam Si-heon), Jeon Yeo-been (Han Jun-hee / Kwon Min-ju), Kang Hoon (Jung In-gyu)\nOne of the latest K-drama releases on Netflix, A Time Called You is also one of the best K-dramas about time travel. Jun-hee has just lost her boyfriend, Yeon-jun, who was about to become her fiancé, in a plane crash. The character is still grieving when a series of strange encounters begin to happen, leading her to investigate Yeon-jun’s past. What could be just a story about overcoming grief and solving mysteries takes a fantastical turn when Jun-hee somehow wakes up 25 years in the past in the body of a different person. A Time Called You is emotional, instigating, and full of twists that will get viewers theorizing in every single episode.\nRelated: A Time Called You's Ending & Time Travel Explained\nGenre: Romance, Comedy\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Hyun Bin Ri (Jeong-hyuk), Son Ye-jin (Yoon Se-ri)\nThe life of Se-ri, one of South Korea’s most successful CEOs, takes an unexpected turn after a paragliding accident. Se-ri accidentally lands in North Korea and is unable to cross the border. She is found by a group of North Korean soldiers, one of whom believes her story and agrees to help her as much as possible. Se-ri’s energy and naivety compared to Jeong-hyuk’s seriousness makes for a hilarious contrast that sets up an unpredictable love story. Crash Landing on You includes some classic love story tropes, such as “fake dating,” in a Romeo and Juliet-like story that is funny, charming, and emotional.\nGenre: Comedy, legal drama\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Park Eun-bin (Woo Young-woo), Kang Tae-oh (Lee Jun-ho), Kang Ki-young (Jung Myung-seok)\nWoo Young-woo is an Autistic lawyer who graduated as the best of her class and is about to enter a new phase in her career. The character joins a law firm as a trainee, during which she meets new friends and foes. While Extraordinary Attorney Woo tells an overarching story, the show does have an episodic nature in which Woo Young-woo will go from case to case. With engaging pacing and fun cases that will show how incredible of a lawyer Woo Young-woo, Extraordinary Attorney Woo is one of the best legal dramas on TV right now. The show also includes comedy and love stories.\nGenre: Drama\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Song Hye-kyo (Moon Dong-eun), Jung Ji-so (young Dong-eun), Lee Do-hyun (Joo Yeo-jeong), Lim Ji-yeon (Park Yeon-jin), Shin Ye-eun (young Yeon-jin)\nThe Glory, a TV-MA-rated show, deals with heavy themes and is one of the darkest, most violent dramas on Netflix. It follows the story of Moon Dong-eun, who suffered bullying during her school years. The Glory sees Dong-eun as an adult who returns to her hometown seeking revenge against those who hurt her in the past. The show intercalates Dong-eun’s quest for revenge with flashbacks that showcase everything she went through during school. While some of The Glory scenes may be too heavy, the show acknowledges the dangers of bullying in a thrilling story that is also full of twists.\nGenre: Horror\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Song Kang (Cha Hyun-soo), Lee Jin-wook (Pyeon Sang-wook), Lee Si-young (Seo Yi-kyung), Go Min-si (Lee Eun-yoo)\nFor those who may already be tired of zombie movies and TV shows, Sweet Home is a great pick. The show reinvents the post-apocalyptic format with a story about how to survive a “monster apocalypse” that is different from the classic zombie tropes. After a massive tragedy changes the course of Cha Hyun-soo’s life, this recluse teenager finds himself in a city taken over by monsters. Sweet Home is action-packed and features some solid visual effects, and all of the characters are interesting and engaging. Sweet Home was one of the first major Netflix Korean drama hits, and Sweet Home season 2 is set to premiere in 2023.\nGenre: Romance, Fantasy\nAvailable seasons: 1-2\nCast: Lee Jae-wook (Jang Uk), Jung So-min (Mu-deok / Nak-su), Hwang Min-hyun (Seo Yu)\nAlchemy of Souls invites audiences to a world full of magic and action. With 30 episodes between seasons 1 and 2, Alchemy of Souls features extensive worldbuilding and includes dozens of characters. That said, the story is centered on Mu-deok, a legendary warrior who accidentally has her soul sent to the body of a far weaker person, Nak-su. She then starts to work as a servant for Jang Uk, the heir to a wealthy family. Alchemy of Souls’ visuals, characters, and lore all add to a love story that discusses themes like honoring, belonging, and fate. Presumably, Alchemy of Souls Part 2 was the end of the story.\nGenre: Romance, Comedy\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Ahn Hyo-seop (Kang Tae-moo), Kim Se-jeong (Shin Ha-ri)\nFeaturing one of the best K-drama couples in a story full of charming tropes, Business Proposal is a great romantic comedy. Shin Ha-ri replaces her friend on a blind date with specific plans of getting rejected, only to discover the date in question is her boss. Kang Tae-moo is not aware that Ha-Ri is one of his company’s employees, let alone that she is not the person she is claiming to be. To make things more complicated, Tae-moo wants to enter a fake relationship, so that his father will stop arranging blind dates for him. This sets up a hilarious, entertaining show full of sweet moments.\nGenre: Horror, Fantasy\nAvailable seasons: 1-2\nCast: Ju Ji-Hoon (Lee Chang), Bae Doo-Na (Seo-Bi), Ryoo Seung-Ryong (Jo Hak-Joo)\nKingdom is another example of how there can still be fresh, original zombie stories. The show, which is set in the 16th century during Korea’s Joseon period, can be considered a manga adaptation loosely based on Kingdom of the Gods. Crown Prince Lee Chang is tasked with investigating a mysterious disease that is spreading across the kingdom and has already contaminated the king.What could be just a political thriller about conspiracies within the kingdom becomes a monster story when Lee Chang discovers what this virus has done to his father. Scary and action-packed, Kingdom combines horror and fantasy in one of the best Korean shows on Netflix.\nGenre: Horror\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Park Ji-hu (Nam On-jo), Yoon Chan-young (Lee Cheong-san), Cho Yi-hyun (Choi Nam-ra), Lomon (Lee Su-hyeok)\nAll of Us Are Dead can be seen as just another zombie show at first. However, despite the simple premise of a zombie outbreak that has just started, All of Us Are Dead is one of the most entertaining zombie series and one of the best Korean dramas on Netflix in general. The buildup to the zombie outbreak is done incredibly well, and the idea of following a strict set of characters inside just one location for multiple episodes was perfectly executed. All of Us Are Dead’s characters are part of what makes the show great, and the first season works as a standalone story despite an already confirmed season 2.\nGenre: Drama\nAvailable seasons: 1\nCast: Lee Jung-jae as Seong Gi-hun, Park Hae-soo (Cho Sang-woo), Wi Ha-joon (Hwang Jun-ho), Jung Ho-yeon (Kang Sae-byeok).\nSquid Game, themost-watched Netflix show of all time, became a worldwide phenomenon thanks to its engaging, original story about a group of people who accept playing deadly games for a massive amount of cash. From the classic games turned into horrific killing sprees to relatable characters struggling with financial issues, Squid Game connected with audiences from all over the world. The simple premise combined with fast-paced episodes and great performances makes Squid Game one of the best Korean shows on Netflix and a must-see for those who haven’t already, especially because Squid Game season 2 is happening.\n"}
{"title": "&quot;His Brain Looks Like Bubblegum&quot;: Homer Simpson's Treehouse Of Horror Injuries Examined By Medical Expert", "date": "2023-10-04 20:25:29", "text": "A real-life ER doctor reacts to The Simpsons season 13 episode, \"Treehouse of Horror XII,\" examining Homer's bubblegum-looking brain injury.\nHomer Simpson’s injuries in The Simpsons episode, “Treehouse of Horror XII,” are analyzed by a real doctor. Released roughly around Halloween, “Treehouse of Horror” is a series of horror-spoof episodes originating in season 2 and has since become an annual event on The Simpsons. At the time of writing, there are a total of 34 “Treehouse of Horror” episodes in the show's entire run. A sought-after annual entry in the comedy show, the episodes are known for their deployment of movie parody and animation experimentation.\nIn a reaction video from Doctor ER, a real physician examines one such “Treehouse of Horror XII” episode from The Simpsons season 13, explaining the realism (and lack thereof). Breaking down the components of the “Ultrahouse 3000” clip, ER Docter Jordan Wagner explains the extent to which Homer could have gotten hurt due to his sleepwalking. Then, Dr. Wagner details the inaccuracies of the bright pink, pulsing brain portrayed in the episode, which he described as looking “like bubblegum.” Wagner revealed that in his experience, brain matter is more often “grayish, white tissue that’s super soft and super fragile.” Check out the full quote from Wagner below:\n“People do sleepwalk. You have to be careful with that. Some people are a little bit more apt to doing that than others.\nBeing jammed into the edge of the table, depending on where you get hit, you can actually injure your groin. You can actually cause bruising to the lower abdomen, and you can also cause injury to the internal organs depending on how hard you hit into the table.\nOh my god! His brain looks like bubblegum. His brain is out, so everybody can see skull fractures. It wouldn't be necessarily bulging like that. If this does occur, you probably want to have some like wet gauze, something sterile, wet to cover the area and get that person to the hospital ASAP. Oh my gosh, the brain is still hanging out. I’ve seen many injuries, and a lot of brain matter. It’s grayish, white tissue that’s super soft and super fragile. Back of the head, typically it’s the visual cortex area. Also has to do with the balance center of the brain, so you’re going to be off and feel like you have vertigo. Things might not be working correctly. You might have an inability to do certain movements correctly.”\nAs expected from a cartoon take on the brain, The Simpsons plays into visual conventions in this sequence. Much like the commonly portrayed heart shape, the brain is often depicted as a pinkish quality. The Simpsons play into this misleading stereotype, making Homer’s brain appear “bubblegum” pink. This makes sense given the show's comedic sensibilities, and Homer’s exposed brain is immediately identifiable as such despite the anatomical inaccuracies.\nFor all its misrepresentation of the medical details, “Treehouse of Horror XII” has some brilliant parody elements that cement it as one of the best in the perennial show. In this “Ultrahouse 3000” segment, Homer and his family live in a fully automated, futuristic house. This house is manned by a central operating system with voice options, including a “Pierce Brosnan” option, voiced by the actor himself. This mechanism mocks the classic sci-fi movie 2001: A Space Odyssey, whose HAL-9000 operates using similar functions.\nRelated: The Simpsons Pennywise Spoof References A Classic Treehouse of Horror \nThe 2001: A Space Odyssey parody is one of many in the “Treehouse of Horror” series. Originating from a Poltergeist and Amityville Horror spoof, the “Treehouse of Horror” episodes took on everything from Soylent Green to Frankenstein. As is common in The Simpsons, these Halloween episodes prove the show’s ability to pay homage to a vast array of works within movie and TV history. In that regard, “Treehouse of Horror XII” is an archetypical example of the high level at which The Simpsons operates.\nSource: Doctor ER\n"}
{"title": "Ahsoka Revives Colin Trevorrow's Canceled Star Wars 9 Plan (But Makes It Even Bigger)", "date": "2023-10-04 20:30:27", "text": "Ahsoka's finale has revived plans from Colin Trevorrow's canceled plans for Episode 9, though it seems Dave Filoni intends to go even bigger.\nWarning! This post contains SPOILERS for Ahsoka episode 8\nAhsoka's finale episode looks to be reviving concepts from Colin Trevorrow's original plans for Star Wars' Episode 9. Originally titled Duel of the Fates, Trevorrow and his script were ultimately abandoned by Lucasfilm in favor of J.J Abrams returning with The Rise of Skywalker. Now, Ahsoka seems to be exploring some of the original ideas from the first script, albeit in a much bigger context thanks to showrunner Dave Filoni.\nAs seen in Ahsoka's finale episode, Grand Admiral Thrawn has successfully escaped from the extragalactic world of Peridea where he'd been exiled for years, having missed the entirety of the original trilogy's war between the Rebellion and Empire. While Jedi Ezra Bridger escaped Peridea disguised as a stormtrooper on Thrawn's ship, the titular Ahsoka Tano and her apprentice Sabine Wren didn't make it. However, Baylan Skoll chose to stay in search of greater power. As seen in the finale, Baylan discovered major connections to Mortis and the Force gods known as the Ones from The Clone Wars, an idea Trevorrow's Episode 9 would have connected with as well.\nIn Colin Trevorrow's Duel of the Fates, the original script released online in 2020 confirms Mortis would have played a major part in Episode 9. First seen in The Clone Wars season 3, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Ahsoka Tano unintentionally come across this ethereal Force realm. There they meet the Father, Son, and Daughter, immortal gods representing different aspects of the Force itself. While the Daughter represented the light, the Son represented the dark. To that end, The Father was tasked with keeping his children in balance, acting as a fulcrum for the state of the Force in the galaxy overall.\nWhile The Clone Wars' three-episode arc on Mortis confirmed that Anakin Skywalker was the prophesied Chosen One who could have taken the Father's place, it also saw the aforementioned fulcrum being undone with the deaths of all three Force gods. Nevertheless, the realm would have been featured later on in the canon had Lucasfilm stuck with Colin Trevorrow and the original plan for Episode 9. After all, its key significance and strong connection to the origins of the Force itself would have more than justified its appearance in the culminating movie of the Skywalker saga, the perfect means of bridging the Star Wars timeline together across trilogies and eras.\nDuel of the Fates would have seen Rey experiencing a Force vision showing that she was meant to duel Kylo Ren on Mortis. As such, the bulk of Rey's role in this version of Episode 9 was to find the Force realm. After dueling the Knights of Ren and brushing with the dark side, Rey would have indeed faced Kylo on Mortis who'd become even more powerful in his own right. However, Rey would have eventually embraced both the light and dark, achieving true balance as neither Jedi nor Sith. Naturally, this would have been very powerful on Mortis given its own role in the Force's need for balance.\nRelated: 15 Star Wars Easter Eggs In Episode 8\nNow, Ahsoka has brought back the Mortis gods in a pretty big way. Having confirmed to his apprentice Shin Hati in previous episodes of Ahsoka, something had been calling to Baylan ever since they came to Peridea. Baylan then went on his own to find this source of power he believed even the Nightsisters' Great Mothers feared, hence their alliance with Thrawn to leave the remains of their former witch kingdom behind. To that end, one of the final shots of Ahsoka's finale sees Baylan discovering massive statues of the Father and Son along with the destroyed remains of the Daughter.\nThese Force god statues clearly point to a major connection between Peridea and Mortis. However, it could also be more than that. After all, it was confirmed in previous episodes that Peridea was but one name the. myths and legends had given to the Nightsisters' original homeworld. As such, the possibility exists that Peridea and Mortis are one and the same in the Star Wars canon. Furthermore, Obi-Wan did say in The Clone Wars that he couldn't determine where in the galaxy they were or if they were even still in their own galaxy after they were drawn to Mortis by the Father. This does fit with Peridea existing in another galaxy.\nAt the very least, Peridea was a world that was known to the Mortis gods who were likely worshiped by its residents (perhaps even by the Nightsisters). If Peridea and Mortis are later revealed to be separate planets, it follows there could still be points of access to Mortis on the planet itself, potentially providing Ahsoka and Sabine with a new means of escaping the extragalactic world. However, it's also possible that Peridea has a major connection to the Force gods' Legends history and a horrifying new threat to the Star Wars galaxy.\nFollowing this major Mortis reveal in Ahsoka's finale, it's clear that Star Wars is likely setting up returns for The Father, Son, and Daughter in some way. If not them, then perhaps the Mother from Legends who became corrupted as the Force entity known as Abeloth, a being of complete entropy and chaos. Having been imprisoned and contained by the Force gods for millennia, Legends saw Abeloth breaking free in the wake of their deaths and becoming a major threat during the New Republic era.\nKeeping that in mind, perhaps Abeloth is the great power of legend who's been calling out to Baylan. She'd certainly be big enough to scare the Nightsisters' Great Mothers. Seeing as how Abeloth wanted to wipe out the entire galaxy in order to create a new one, perhaps Baylan is seeking her power in his mission to end the galaxy's never-ending cycle of conflict between the light and dark. Naturally, re-canonizing and adapting Abeloth and her history with the Mortis gods would be huge for the Star Wars franchise.\nIt's very important that Ahsoka is now stranded on Peridea as well, seeing as how she carries the essence of the Daughter within her as seen in The Clone Wars season 3. It's why the Daughter's convor owl named Morai has watched over Ahsoka ever since, having made multiple appearances across Tano's journey (including Ahsoka's final episode). As such, seeing Morai on Peridea is a very strong sign that Ahsoka and her apprentice are destined to be on Peridea (to likely stop Baylan).\nRelated: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nIt's very exciting that Ahsoka is reviving the idea of using Mortis and the Force gods in live-action after Duel of the Fates was canceled. However, it's quite evident by this setup alone that Filoni's plans will be much bigger in scale and scope than Trevorrow's were for Episode 9. While Trevorrow's concept sounded quite good, it's for the best that Filoni is continuing the concepts of Mortis and the Force gods instead, having conceived their inception in the first place. If Star Wars is going to do a new Mortis story in any form, it's hard to beat Dave Filoni being the one behind the Ones.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Jacob Elordi's Elvis Presley Is Already Beating Austin Butler In One Big Way", "date": "2023-10-04 20:30:27", "text": "Austin Butler almost nabbed an Oscar for playing Elvis Presley, but Jacob Elordi's portrayal as the King of Rock in Priscilla could be even better.\nPriscilla is the upcoming biopic about Elvis Presley's wife from Sofia Coppola, and Jacob Elordi already seems like a better Elvis than Austin Butler in one specific way. As the title alludes, the biopic focuses on Elvis's wife more than the King of Rock himself, and it explores the toxic relationship between the couple that most other media about them has often sidestepped. In the new movie, Elvis is depicted as a villain, throwing chairs at walls and trying to take control of Priscilla's whole look, even down to how much eye makeup she wears. Priscilla ultimately wants to be her own person.\nPriscilla follows the 2022 hit Elvis, though they're completely different films with different approaches to the same real-life people. Where the Priscilla trailer showcases a harrowing drama, Elvis focused as much on the spectacle of Elvis Presley's life with some thrilling musical sequences. However, it's impossible not to compare the two, especially as their release dates are so close to each other (Elvis was released in July 2022 and Priscilla is out on November 3, 2023). The 2023 movie doesn't shy away from the facts that Baz Luhrmann's Elvis tried to hide, but there's one major comparison between the two movies, and that's Jacob Elordi and Austin Butler's voices.\nBased on the Priscilla trailer, Jacob Elordi's voice already sounds better than Austin Butler's. Elordi's voice sounds more realistic, authentic, and natural compared to Butler's. Butler's Elvis voice sometimes felt like an impression of the King of Rock with all the \"uh-huhs,\" though that still worked because of how intentionally theatrical and over-the-top Elvis is. Interestingly, while Elordi's voice sounds more natural, Butler spent two years in vocal training just to sound like Elvis. Ironically, Butler has been struggling to drop the Elvis accent (via Variety), and it was only eight months after Elvis' release when Butler finally started losing that accent.\nPriscilla isn't Elvis' movie and, in fact, Elvis is something of a villain in the film. The movie doesn't shy away from some dark facts, such as the Elvis and Priscilla age gap - Priscilla was just 14 years old when she met the 24-year-old King of Rock - and there are shots of the young girl learning in school to emphasize exactly that. Nevertheless, while there's no denying that Butler was great as Elvis Presley in the 2022 movie and totally deserved the Academy Award nomination, based on the trailer, Elordi's Elvis is already looking like he could be the better of the two 2020s on-screen Elvises.\nNevertheless, while Jacob Elordi might outdo Austin Butler in some instances, it's a completely different performance. Elordi doesn't have to perform in the same way that Butler did, and Elordi's performance is on a much smaller scale. Ultimately, they're both extremely different portrayals of the same character and while Elordi might excel in some dramatic areas, the Priscilla actor isn't required to commit to the role in the way that Butler did. There's plenty of room on the cinema landscape for two great Elvis performances.\nSource: Variety\nCurrently splitting his time between Madrid and Chicago, Stephen Barker has been a staff writer at Screen Rant since 2020.

Wally West's intense connection to the Speed Force makes him a conduit to a powerful and other-dimensional plane of energy that nobody truly understands. Unfortunately for the Flash, that lack of understanding seems to be coming back to haunt him now that the mysterious Force has seemingly robbed him of one of his most world-breaking powers.\nThe Flash #1 by Si Spurrier, Mike Deodato Jr., Trish Mulvihill, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou opens with two non-titular speedsters – Max Mercury and Impulse – seeking to transcend time and space, as Max has done many times before, using the Speed Force. Unexpectedly, the Speed Force instantly rejects them, hurtling them back with an unexpected ferocity and apparently closing the door on the Flash Family’s dimension-hopping and time-traveling capabilities.\nBased on Wally’s tempestuous relationship with the Speed Force seen throughout the rest of the issue, it’s clear that the Flash is in a dangerous new era of his career as the protector of Keystone and Central City.\nRelated: Flash's New Villains Put a Sick Twist on the Entire Flash-Family\nIn this very issue, the Flash’s ally and employer, Mr. Terrific, tells the hero that “thinking sideways” will get them through their current crisis, and with Wally’s powers on the fritz, that seems to be exactly what he’ll have to do. Wally notoriously hates time travel, and, in the DC Universe, changing the past very rarely has any positive repercussions. Despite all that, that the Flash can always turn back the clock when things don’t go his way has always hung over the character and affected the stakes of his stories. Now that his powers are more erratic than ever, there’s no chance for a do-over should things go wrong for the Crimson Comet, raising the stakes for both Wally and the audience.\nAside from speed, the heroes who have used the mantle of the Flash have always been known for their unique perspective and their abilities to think outside the box. Whether it’s Barry Allen with his famous Flash Facts or Wally’s more instinctual and borderline-mystical connection with the Speed Force, the Flashes’ ability to always use their powers creatively to outsmart dangerous foes is inherent to the Flash Family legacy. Clearly, these heroes are no strangers to thinking sideways, and, as Mr. Terrific says, that’s exactly what Wally West will need to hone that creative edge more than ever — especially if the Speed Force continues to glitch.\nThe Flash is the Fastest Man Alive, but even he has to slow down every now and then. Now that the Speed Force is cracking down on Wally West’s overpowered nature, the stakes are incredibly high for Wally, Max, Impulse, and the rest of the Flash Family. Whether these fan-favorite speedsters ever fully regain their reality-distorting abilities remains to be seen, but until then, the Flash is going to have to think even faster than he can run.\nThe Flash #1 is on sale now from DC Comics.\n"}

Here's every film, ranked.\nThe evil doll Chucky's best movies of the longstanding Child's Play franchise are ranked here from worst to best. The original Child's Play movie started out as a script called Batteries Not Included by writer Don Mancini which was later retitled Blood Buddy. The initial concept was that a boy named Andy was given a doll that was filled with fake blood but would later come alive when Andy accidentally mixed his own blood with it. The doll, who would become known as the infamous Chucky, would come to life when Andy went to sleep, acting out his unconscious desire to kill. The story had intended to be a mystery with viewers unsure if it was Chucky or Andy carrying out the murders.\nWhen Tom Holland (Fright Night) came on board to direct Child's Play the concept was completely changed. A serial killer named Charles Lee Ray transfers his soul into a Chucky doll just before his human body dies. With his soul trapped in a toy, he needs to transfer his evil spirit to a human body or be trapped in the doll for good so he selects Andy as a host. The movie was a smash hit and Chucky would return many times in the years that followed although the tone and genre of each sequel would vary wildly. With a 2019 remake and a 2021 TV series presenting fans with a fresh take on Chucky, let's take a look through the franchise and rank each entry from worst to best.\nRELATED: Chucky: 10 Movies & TV Shows Where You've Seen The Cast\nThe only entry in the franchise that's a true disappointment is 1991's Child Play 3. This sequel was released a mere nine months after the second movie. This rush to shoot a new sequel ultimately hurt the final product. The premise finds Chucky coming back to life 8 years after part two and tracking his old nemesis Andy to a military school. While the setting is unique and Brad Dourif (The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers) is typically excellent as Chucky's voice, the third movie lacks in suspense and new ideas. Outside the occasional inspired touch like a showdown in a funhouse, Child's Play 3 is a relative dud.\nSeed Of Chucky was series creator Don Mancini's directorial debut. He decided to completely embrace a cartoony tone instead of making a straightforward slasher. Seed of Chucky picks up after the ending of Bride Of Chucky, which features Chucky's girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) giving birth to a baby doll. The movie has been accurately described as an over-the-top farce with numerous creative stretches such as Tilly playing both herself and Tiffany and cameos from John Waters (Feud) and Redman. While it's silly and fun in its own right Seed of Chucky hardly feels like a horror movie at all, which is why it's one of the least loved entries.\nRELATED: Child's Play: How to Watch Every Chucky Movie in Order\nDon Mancini returned for 2017's Cult Of Chucky which finds the survivor of the previous film Nica (Fiona Dourif) in a psychiatric rehabilitation center. Cult of Chucky is arguably the most experimental installment of the series and features bizarre visuals and creative deaths likely inspired by Mancini's work on the Hannibal series. The movie also features surprise cameos by previous cast members and ends on an intriguing note that sets up a further story. While Cult of Chucky is a solid and suspenseful entry, it feels a little underwhelming after the home run that was Curse Of Chucky.\nChucky and the Child's Play franchise arrived at an interesting time in the world of slasher films. Major series like Halloween and Friday The 13th were starting to wind down after disappointing sequels. Child's Play 2 picks up two years after the original with Andy taken in by a foster family. The toy company behind the Chucky doll decides to rebuild the destroyed doll which comes to life and seeks out Andy. Child's Play 2 embraces a more comic tone and features a number of fun set pieces. One scene features Chucky a Terminator-style showdown in a toy factory. The sequel doesn't go too far outside the standard but it's a lean, energetic follow-up regardless.\nRELATED: 10 Most Consistent Horror Franchises To Binge, According To Reddit\nThe Child's Play remake has proven somewhat controversial, with creator Don Mancini distancing himself from it while he focuses on the Child's Play TV show Chucky. The movie also marks the first time Brad Dourif hadn't voiced Chucky but with a great replacement in Mark Hamill. Despite this outside drama, the remake is a surprisingly fun reinvention of the Child's Play franchise. It takes the basic concept of a lonely boy being given the Chucky doll only to discover he has advanced A.I. built in which gives him control over gadgets.\nAfter forming a bond with the new Andy, the defective doll takes offense to anyone hurting Andy and starts offing victims in gory yet darkly comedic ways. The cast is also a highlight, especially Gabriel Bateman (Light's Out) as the new Andy. The humor in the remake can be too broad at times and Chucky's backstory is rather thin but the Child's Play 2019 reboot is much better than expected.\nAfter a decade of slashers with a repetitive but unique gimmick like A Nightmare On Elm Street's Freddy Krueger, Child's Play introduced the murderous doll Chucky to the world. The original movie is quite tame for much of its runtime, playing out more like a suspenseful thriller than a bloody horror flick. The central relationship between Andy and his mother is sweet and director Tom Holland milks a good amount of tension from the stalking sequences. The movie might be a touch slow for modern tastes but Child's Play is still a great and efficient thriller.\nRELATED: Does Jade Kill Chucky In Bride Of Chucky?\nFollowing the lukewarm response to Child's Play 3, the series appeared effectively done. Horror movies, in general, entered a weird time in the 1990s. It wasn't until Scream revitalized the genre that studios regained interest. This led to Bride Of Chucky, where Charles Lee Ray's former girlfriend Tiffany brings him back to life once more and they go on a romantic killing spree. Bride has all the gore and creative kills fans could ask for but the comedic interplay between Dourif and Tilly and Ronny Yu's (Freddy Vs Jason) energetic direction is what makes it click. The movie also introduced Chucky's iconic scarred look and is arguably the most popular entry outside the 1988 original.\nFollowing the box-office disappointment of Seed Of Chucky, Mancini considered remaking the original and revisiting his Blood Buddy idea. When untangling the rights proved too difficult, he instead opted for Curse Of Chucky, a tonal reboot that was also the first to go straight to DVD. While this has spelled the death of other horror franchises like Hellraiser, it surprisingly resulted in the best entry in the Child's Play series to date. Everything about Curse Of Chucky works superbly.\nThe best features include Fiona Dourif's strong new heroine Nica, the overall gothic tone, the intriguing family drama, the impressive set pieces, and the surprising links to past entries. Curse of Chucky is a love letter to the franchise and to its dedicated fans, proving that Chucky actually could be a hit again. These qualities solidify Curse of Chucky as the greatest movie in the Child's Play series.\n"}
{"title": "What's Going On With Jonathan Majors?", "date": "2023-10-04 20:51:28", "text": "After his MCU debut as Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Jonathan Majors was arrested for assault. Here's what's going on now.\nAfter his debut in season 1 of Loki as the Kang variant He Who Remains and as Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Jonathan Majors was charged with domestic violence and assault, raising big questions for the future of the MCU. After the defeat of Thanos in Avengers: Endgame, the MCU turned to its next big bad, hiring Jonathan Majors to play the time-traveling, multiversal villain Kang the Conqueror (and all his variants). However, serious charges leveled at the actor now put Disney and Marvel Studios in a tight spot.\n2023 was off to a big start for Jonathan Majors. Creed III debuted to rave reviews and a strong box office performance, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania marked his first theatrical outing as Kang the Conqueror, but in March, Jonathan Majors was arrested for misdemeanor charges of assault, strangulation, and harassment after an altercation with his girlfriend. Majors' attorney insists the actor is innocent of the charges, claiming video evidence and witness testimony will exonerate him, putting a big wrinkle in the future development of the Marvel Cinematic Universe until there's a clear resolution to his case.\nAfter the MCU's Infinity Saga featured Josh Brolin's Thanos, culminating in his defeat in Avengers: Endgame, the MCU was without an overarching antagonist until the introduction of Kang the Conqueror. Kang is a time-traveling supervillain from the future who leverages his superior intellect, advanced technology, and numerous variants to wage war on the multiverse. As teased in the post-credits scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, there are numerous iterations of Kang, with dozens of versions played by Jonathan Majors already depicted on-screen, making him far more difficult to recast than Thanos, who was portrayed by a different actor in his initial tease at the end of The Avengers.\nMajors' first appearance was in the season 1 finale of Loki, followed by a bigger role in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but he had multiple additional appearances slated in the coming years. A post-credits scene from Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania already teased his expanded part in Loki season 2, which is set to release in October, but the next Avengers movie, scheduled for May 2026, has the character's name in the title: Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. It's unclear how Disney and Marvel Studios will react to the charges against Majors, but his big role in the MCU's future makes the issue impossible to ignore for too long.\nMajors was initially arrested in New York on March 25, 2023, under charges of strangulation, assault, and harassment. The NYPD says the arrest was in response to a 911 call from the victim in which she \"informed the police she was assaulted.\" The statement from the NYPD also said the victim \"sustained minor injuries to her head and neck and was removed to an area hospital in stable condition.\" On April 19, a report revealed multiple additional alleged victims of Jonathan Majors were working with the Manhattan district attorney’s office on additional abuse allegations.\nAfter the charges, Majors was removed from ad campaigns for the United States Army and the Texas Rangers, and his role in Nadia Latif's movie The Man in My Basement, in addition to Majors being dropped by his management company and PR representation. Majors is presumed innocent until proven guilty, but the fact that he's being dropped by his representation indicates a lack of confidence in his defense. Even if Majors is innocent, the allegations have already had serious consequences on his career. If he's convicted of the charges, it will only get worse, including criminal penalties potentially including up to one year in prison.\nMajors' lawyer, Priya Chaudhry, claims he's innocent of all charges and is \"provably the victim of an altercation with a woman he knows.\" She says witness testimony and video evidence will fully exonerate Majors. Additionally, Chaudhry claims the charges are an example of racial discrimination by the New York justice system: “This glaring double standard between the treatment of Jonathan Majors, a Black man weighing 200 lbs, and his accuser, highlights the racial bias that permeates the criminal justice system.”\nAfter Majors' initial arrest, Chaudhry released text messages to TMZ featuring the alleged victim apologizing to Majors for putting him in this position and saying she would \"make sure nothing happens about this.\" The text messages from the victim also show her taking blame for the incident and that she told police \"it was my fault for trying to grab your phone.\" Despite the texts deflecting blame from Majors, they still implicitly acknowledge some sort of violent altercation occurred, which, paired with the victim's documented injuries, will be difficult for Majors to dismiss in court.\nDuring the Sept. 15 hearing, Judge Michael Gaffey set Wednesday, Oct. 25 for the next hearing, per Variety. In September, Majors' attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the case and the Manhattan District Attorney's office must respond by Oct. 6; then the defense must respond by Oct. 13.\nOn Sept. 6, a short hearing was held where it was decided that another would be held on Sept. 15, as reported by Deadline. The cause for the latest delay comes from the defense, who stated there were “deficiencies” in discovery on their end. Majors did not appear in person for the Sept. 6 hearing, but did appear virtually.\nPreviously on Aug. 3, 2023, Majors appeared in person in a lower Manhattan courtroom for what was meant to be the start of his trial. However, according to Deadline, Judge Gaffey approved a postponement following Assistant D.A Kelli Galaway's request for more time for discovery. Following the hearing, DA spokesperson Doug Cohen told Deadline, \"We look forward to presenting the full facts and evidence at trial.\" Chaudhry issued a statement after the court hearing:\nFor an excruciating four months, Jonathan Majors, the real victim in this shameful ordeal, has had his life, career, and reputation torn apart. Yet he remains unwavering in his determination to be absolved from this harrowing ordeal.\nPreviously on June 20, 2023, Majors appeared in court for the first time since his March arrest. Shortly after, Chaudhry issued a statement that noted how Majors' legal team had urged the judge to instantly dismiss the charges brought against the actor and initiate proceedings against Grace Jabbari, Majors' first alleged victim, who Majors' legal team now claims attacked him first. Per Deadline, the NYPD has \"no plans\" to make an arrest.\nMajors is just the most recent superhero star to encounter legal trouble and negative press after Ezra Miller, Amber Heard, Anthony Starr, and other comic book actors have faced similar criticisms in recent years. While none of those actors lost their roles due to the allegations against them (with Starr being the only one actually convicted of assault), Marvel previously fired James Gunn from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 over offensive tweets he'd made in the past. Gunn obviously eventually returned to direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, but they may not be so quick to pull the trigger with Jonathan Majors.\nThe allegations against Majors are concerning and should be taken seriously, but Disney and Marvel Studios will likely wait to make any serious decisions about the actor's future until the case has been resolved in a court of law. While the accusations are sure to tarnish his career even if he's ultimately found innocent, Majors wouldn't be the first MCU star in legal trouble. The MCU kicked off by taking a big swing on Iron Man by casting a then-disgraced Robert Downey Jr., and Thanos actor Josh Brolin was also arrested for domestic battery in 2004, although Majors' charges are far more serious.\nWhile Avengers: The Kang Dynasty is still a few years away, Loki season 2 is a far more immediate concern for Marvel Studios. Majors' role as the Kang variant Victor Timely was already teased in Quantumania, but the actor could also portray multiple other variants in the series. Originally expected to release on Disney+ in the summer, Loki season 2 will now premiere on October 6. The reason for the delay is unclear, though it may be an attempt to avoid overlap with Majors' legal proceedings. Marvel Studios has not yet commented on the reason for Loki season 2's delay to October 6, 2023.\nIn the lead up to Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's Disney+ release on May 17, Jonathan Majors' Kang was featured only very briefly in the two trailers Marvel Studios posted online. The focus of the trailers was put more on Paul Rudd's Scott Lang, Evangeline Lilly's Hope Van Dyne and Katherine Newton's Cassie Lang, which makes sense given they're the lead heroes. However, Majors' Kang was a focal point of the promotion for the initial theatrical release of the movie, so his lack of presence in the streaming release promotional material is notable.\nFurther, at Disney's upfront presentation on May 16, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige spoke to assembled advertisers and press about upcoming MCU shows, including Loki. He announced Loki season 2's October release date, spoke about the series, and screened a trailer. According to Axios reporter Tim Baysinger (via Twitter), Feige didn't mention Majors, nor did Victor Timely or any other Kang variants appear in the Loki season 2 trailer. As previously stated, it's expected Majors will have a sizable role in Loki season 2 following Quantumania's post-credits scene, but Marvel Studios may be choosing to downplay his involvement in the marketing of the show.\nNeither Disney, Marvel Studios, nor Kevin Feige have commented on Majors' assault arrest as of the publication of this article. Previously, a Deadline report published on April 17, 2023, stated Marvel had not discussed recasting Majors in the MCU at that time. With the MCU's Phase 5 continuing after the June premiere of Secret Invasion on Disney+, however, Marvel won't be able to stay quiet on Majors for much longer.\nAccording to Joanna Robinson, author of the book MCU: The Reign of Marvel Studios, Marvel changed their plans for MCU Phase 5 and 6 after seeing Jonathan Majors' performance as He Who Remains in Loki season 1 and Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Further, Robinson said she's heard different stories about what the studio plans to do in regard to Majors' role in the MCU following his arrest. Robinson said:\nI was told by someone who works for Marvel, it was not the plan to make Kang the center of everything until they saw the dailies from Quantumania and after his performance in Loki, which was so strong they were like, 'This is it. This is our way forward'... They don’t usually hang this much on one person in the way that they did here. And that has put them in the bind. We do not know what they are going to do. I've heard conflicting stories about they are going to replace him, they’re not even considering replacing him etc. etc. But it’s just one more thing.\nSince Robinson didn't go into further detail, it's unclear what Marvel Studios' original plan for the Multiverse Saga, which concludes with Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars, may have been. It's been speculated Doctor Doom could've been a major threat for Secret Wars, since Phase 6's Fantastic Four movie releases prior to The Kang Dynasty. It's also uncertain what Marvel Studios may do in light of the charges against Majors. Until Marvel Studios releases an official statement, it can be presumed the studio is moving forward with Kang the Conqueror as a major villain in the MCU Phase 5 and 6.\nDuring an interview with Inverse, published on June 28, 2023, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier star Anthony Mackie was questioned about the future of Kang the Conqueror in the MCU after Majors' arrest. Mackie responded to questioning by stating:\nWe're a country that was built on 'everyone is innocent until proven guilty,' that's one of the staples of this country. Nothing has been proven about this dude. Nothing. So everyone is innocent until proven guilty.\nMackie became the first individual within Marvel Studios to make any comment on the arrest and allegations, though he refrained from speculating whether Jonathan Majors would be recast in the MCU's future.\nIn the lead up to the premiere of Loki season 2, producer Kevin Wright was asked by Variety about whether Majors' assault arrest affected the show. Wright explained that it didn't, largely because all filming on the season wrapped in 2022, prior to Majors' arrest. When asked if the arrest led to any discussions of making changes to Loki season 2, Wright said:\nNo. And that mainly came from — I know as much as you do at the moment. It felt hasty to do anything without knowing how all of this plays out.\nBased on Wright's comment, it seems Marvel is waiting to see the result of Majors' trial before making any decisions about how to proceed with his involvement in the MCU. However, it's clear that no changes were made to Loki season 2 due to the arrest of Jonathan Majors.\n"}
{"title": "Will Baylan Skoll Be Recast In Ahsoka Season 2?", "date": "2023-10-04 21:00:31", "text": "The tragic passing of Ray Stevenson means Lucasfilm is faced with an impossible choice; what do they do with Baylan Skoll after Ahsoka?\nThis article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nRay Stevenson's Baylan Skoll was one of the highlights of Ahsoka, but now Lucasfilm is faced with a difficult choice about whether to recast the character. Already no stranger to Star Wars, Ray Stevenson was delighted to be joining Star Wars in live-action. His presence was one of the highlights of Star Wars Celebration 2023, with Stevenson radiating sheer joy as he anticipated the reception of his character, Baylan Skoll.\nRay Stevenson sadly passed away on May 21, 2023, leaving the cast and crew of Ahsoka shaken. Ahsoka's premiere released with a touching tribute - \"For Our Friend, Ray\" - and in interviews his fellow stars have continually stressed their love for him. He was clearly a joy to work with, and is sadly missed. But, unfortunately, the ending of Ahsoka leaves Lucasfilm in a very difficult position - because Baylan Skoll is set up for an important future role.\nThere can be no doubt Ray Stevenson's dark Jedi Baylan Skoll was one of the highlights of Ahsoka. Baylan was a fascinating and complex character, and his motives are still a mystery; he seems to have had great hopes for his Padawan, Shin Hati, only to give them up when he heard a siren song from the ancient world of Peridea. Stevenson gave Baylan a certain intensity and resolve, and the dynamic he shared with Ivanno Sakhno (who played his violent Padawan Shin Hati) was tremendous. But he'll best be remembered for the stunning fight scenes he shared with Rosario Dawson's Ahsoka Tano; Baylan proved to be the one foe Ahsoka couldn't defeat, and he almost killed her.\nRelated: Ahsoka Ending Explained In Full\nThe problem, though, is that Ahsoka has left Baylan's story unfinished. His backstory is a mystery; how does he know so much about Anakin Skywalker, given his transformation into Darth Vader was a closely guarded secret? His motives remain inscrutable, clearly tied to the Mortis gods by Ahsoka's finale, but that in itself sets him up for an even greater role. He was seen stood next to the statue of the Father, a cosmic being who sought to strike a cosmic harmonious balance between light and dark, a hint at his true agenda. All this means there's absolutely no way Lucasfilm can continue this story without Baylan Skoll.\nIt's nothing short of a tragedy that Ray Stevenson passed before he got to see how much Baylan Skoll was loved by viewers. What's more, it's to Lucasfilm's credit that his story was not adjusted in any way, because there's no hint the overarching narrative was changed after Stevenson's passing. This means viewers - as well as the cast and crew - got to say farewell to a tremendous actor, to see his last performance in full.\nRelated: When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline\nBut this also means that Lucasfilm's Dave Filoni has left everything up in the air for Baylan. His story ends on an ambiguous note, with the dark Jedi continuing to explore Peridea, heading toward what seems to be a powerful Force vergence that called to him across the galaxies. What's more, given three other major characters are stranded on Peridea as well, this feels as though it is being set up in a concrete direction. There's no writing Baylan out, and no additional footage that can be refashioned as a homage. The only way to continue to honor Ray Stevenson is now to recast the character, allowing audiences to see Baylan Skoll's future.\nThis is all the more important because Ahsoka's ending kept Baylan as something of a mystery box. Such a mystery only works if the payoff is worth it, meaning Baylan's role in Ahsoka would be retrospectively damaged if Star Wars chose to somehow drop the character, perhaps killing him off-screen. The sense of anticlimax would echo back to the earlier stories, because they are left feeling incomplete and unsatisfying. To preserve Baylan's story in Ahsoka season 1, it is necessary to continue it.\nThis will, of course, be a very difficult and painful process. Ray Stevenson wasn't just a colleague; it's abundantly clear he was a good friend to many in Lucasfilm, and they mourn his passing. There's a sense of intense pressure to get this right. Meanwhile, the Star Wars fanbase - always noted for its divisiveness - will be watching carefully. Baylan Skoll needs to be recast for Ahsoka season 2 (or whatever comes next) - but it won't be easy.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are streaming now on Disney+.\nTom Bacon is Head of Screen Rant's Star Wars coverage. Although he's now dedicated to Star Wars content, he's a lifelong fan of several other major franchises including Doctor Who and Marvel. You can find him on Twitter @TomABacon.

{"title": "10 Best Movies Like The Creator", "date": "2023-10-04 21:00:31", "text": "Gareth Edwards’ The Creator features impressive visuals as it explores the nuances of AI, and there are several other good movies just like it.\nGareth Edwards' latest film, The Creator, has been positively received, and there are plenty of movies just like it for those wishing for more. The science-fiction film takes place in a futuristic world where Western civilization has declared war on AI. The efforts to eradicate AI are combated by the fictional nation of New Asia. An ex-special forces agent is tasked with traveling to New Asia and destroying a new AI weapon. The Creator explores ideas about humanity's relationship with AI, debuting at a time when its core theme couldn't be more relevant.\nThe Creator uses science-fiction as a medium to tell a story about empathy and what it means to be sentient and human. This is a story that's been explored in Hollywood before. While the movie's premise received a mixed response from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, Edwards' visual style was met with near unanimous praise. A similar approach can be seen in Edwards' best movies, as well as in the projects that inspired his work.\nOne of the best science-fiction movies of all time, Blade Runner is the most obvious next stop for fans of The Creator. Ridley Scott's 1982 film is massively influential on the science fiction genre, having popularized a cyberpunk aesthetic that's used in video games, anime, and other mediums. Speaking to Far Out Magazine, Edwards cited Blade Runner as one of his primary inspirations for creating a visually stunning backdrop. Like The Creator, Blade Runner is set in Los Angeles in a world ravaged by nuclear warfare. It also features a hero tasked with hunting AI, who develops more complicated feelings on the matter as the film goes on.\nFor Edwards' signature sci-if visuals, there's no better option than Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. While Godzilla and Monsters have great shots, Rogue One sees Edwards working with his highest budget, bringing to life bright and beautiful worlds. The film tells the story of the rebel team that steals the Death Star plans just before A New Hope. Edwards has mentioned his great affection for Star Wars, and he's cited the design of the original trilogy as one of his chief inspirations for The Creator.\nDirected by Alex Garland and produced by A24, Ex Machina is one of the most popular sci-fi films of the 2010s. The film follows a programmer named Caleb, who is brought to the private estate of his company's CEO, where he's shown a humanoid robot named Ava. Caleb is prompted to interact with Ava and judge whether she's capable of consciousness. While it doesn't have the heavy action of The Creator, Ex Machina features similar themes and ideas. Ex Machina explores the complicated relationship between human beings and AI, as well as the potential consequences of further developing AI.\nAlfonso Cuarón's Children of Men is one of the most iconic sci-fi films of the 21st century. Set in a grim world that's been ruined by environmental issues and war, infertility has become an existential threat. Like with The Creator, Children of Men follows a man traveling with and protecting someone he believes could be the key to saving humanity. In this case, it is the only known pregnant woman on Earth.\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day is one of James Cameron's most influential science-fiction films ever, and its among the best for fans of The Creator. Terminator 2 subverts expectations by making T-800 a protagonist, exploring the ideas of the positive use of AI. While humans are at war with AI in The Creator, the film explores the complexity of the issue, a discussion that's highly prevalent through the ending of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. In addition to sharing similar themes with The Creator, the first two Terminator movies are just incredible sci-fi action features that are must-watch materials for those who enjoy the genre.\nDirected by Stanley Kubrick, 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the most important science-fiction movies ever made. While its pacing is slower than what modern film fans might be used to, it's an essential film that everyone should watch at least once. The influence of 2001 is everywhere in science-fiction and pop culture, from the space scenes in early Star Wars to the opening scene in Barbie. Most notably for fans of The Creator, 2001's HAL-9000 character is one of the earliest and most prominent explorations of AI in cinema.\nAkira is one of the most well-known anime movies in the West, Edwards drew inspiration from the animated classic for The Creator. While Akira doesn't explore AI, it shares similar stylistic choices and ideas, such as a newly formed Eastern nation following a devastating blast, satellite weapons firing blue beams down on Earth, and super-powered children. Akira is set in a futuristic world where science is seeing great progress, but that progress is primarily helping bureaucratic and wealthy bodies.\nSoylent Green is an underrated gem of sci-fi movies, released in 1973 and starring Charlton Heston. The film follows an NYPD detective in a dystopian, futuristic world where the natural resources have run dry. People are reliant on mass-produced, factory-made wafers of different colors and unknown ingredients for their food, with the latest being \"Soylent Green.\" The film explores a ravaged society and ideas of government conspiracy, much like The Creator, which critiques the U.S. government.\nA Perfect World is not a sci-fi movie, but it was mentioned by Edwards, along with Rain Man, as a narrative inspiration for The Creator. The 1993 film, which stars Kevin Costner and Clint Eastwood, sees Costner playing an escaped prisoner who kidnaps a young boy. The prisoner and his captive travel across the U.S., forming an unexpected bond. For viewers of The Creator who were interested in the relationship between Joshua and Alphie, A Perfect World will make a solid follow-up.\nLike A Perfect World, The Road is a film with a similar relationship to the one between Joshua and Alphie in The Creator. The Road follows a father and son in a post-apocalyptic world, surviving and scavenging on their journey toward the sea. The world of The Road is much more grim than society in The Creator, but it's one of the best examples of stories that show the importance of family and companionship in dark times.\nSource: Far Out Magazine\n"}

With the secret knowledge of Yggdrasil now revealed, it begins to paint a picture of why stories and storytelling are among the most important forces in the Asgardian mythology and reframes several crucial tales from years past.\nImmortal Thor #2 (written by Al Ewing, penciled and inked by Martin Cóccolo, colored by Matthew Wilson and lettered by VC’s Joe Sabino) reveals exactly what wisdom Odin learned millennia ago, aka the Odin-Knowledge. In flashback, readers see Odin cut out his eye before Yggdrasil. After, as his pulled into the tree by its roots, he is told by the World Tree: \"Yes. This is the lesson. This is the parable. The story always changes. The meaning always remains. There is always a sacrifice. Always a cost Bor-Son. For the Winter to end. For Spring to come again.\"\nIt seems this wisdom is, at least partially, the knowledge that all stories have common elements. The exact story might change, but their shape remains the same.\nRelated: \"I Have to Try\": Immortal Thor's Writer Promises His Best Work Yet\nIn both Norse mythology and in Marvel’s own version, Odin takes out his own eye at the foot of Yggdrasil, the World Tree. In most retellings he also hangs himself on the tree’s branches. This sacrifice gives him some form of wisdom, secret knowledge and/or understanding of the deepest Asgardian mysteries. In Thor vol. 6 #20-23 (written by Donny Cates, penciled and inked by Nic Klein, colored by Matt Wilson and lettered by Joe Sabino), Odin dies, passing on the full power of the Odin-Force to Thor. Now, sidled with the wisdom of his father, Thor must find a way to balance ruling Asgard with his other responsibilities.\nThe Odin-Knowledge ties directly into the importance of stories for the Asgardians. In Loki: Agent of Asgard #13 (written by Al Ewing, penciled and inked by Lee Garbett, colored by Antinio Fabela and lettered by Clayton Cowles) Loki is remade as not the God of Lies, but the God of Stories. Al Ewing himself has been one of the primary architects of this evolution for Loki, exploring their development throughout Loki: Agent of Asgard, Defenders: Beyond and now Immortal Thor as well. This reveal of the Odin-Knowledge only ties Loki’s status quo more directly into the very fabric of the Asgardian gods.\nThis also adds depth to a crucial Thor story. In Thor: Disassembled (Thor vol. 2 #80-85, written by by Michael Avon Oeming and David Berman, penciled and inked by Andrea DiVito, colored by Laura Villari and lettered by Randy Gentile) Thor repeats Odin’s sacrifice, taking out both his eyes and hanging himself on Yggdrasil to gain that same wisdom. It’s this that leads him to discover that the cycle of Ragnarök is an endless blood-tithe to the parasitic Those Who Sit Above in Shadow.

No matter how impossible their challenge may be, these investigators seem to always know how to gather all the necessary information and find the right answers.\nGreat detectives are always admired across all media, with notable examples being the timeless Sherlock Holmes, and anime is no different, particularly thanks to the popularity of Case Closed's Conan. Proving themselves to possess deduction and analytical skills far superior to their peers, these characters are shown to be some of the most brilliant detectives the medium has to offer, solving even the toughest cases with ease.\nB: The Beginning's protagonist Keith Kazama Flick is a legendary investigator affiliated with the Royal Police Service, who aims to uncover the identity of the notorious Killer B. Though he retired from being an investigator when his sister was murdered, suffering profound trauma as a result, he ended up taking the case at the behest of an old friend. His appearance and behavior often cause people to assume he is lazy, but the truth is that he is a genius when it comes to math and calculations, using his knowledge to accurately predict his target's next moves, and then acting accordingly to ensure he has the upper hand.\nThe events of Id:Invaded take place in a world where something known as the Mizuhanome System exists, allowing people to explore human minds by entering abstract psychological planes that depict their unconscious thoughts. However, only those who have killed others are able to enter these id wells. Akihito Narihisago is one such detective-turned-criminal, who ended up in police custody after taking revenge on his daughter's murderer. Still possessing a profound hatred towards serial killers, as well as his remarkable skills and experience as a detective, he now solves murder cases by using the Mizuhanome System and investigating id wells, getting to know criminals better than they know themselves.\nWhile not a detective per se, given that Houtarou Oreki is still in school, he could easily become one of the best, should he make up his mind to expend the necessary energy. Hyouka follows Houtarou as he uses his exceptional deduction skills to solve mysteries, prompted by the ever-curious Eru Chitanda, whom he has feelings for. He is generally passive and apathetic, living by the idea that he should only do what is necessary, but whenever Eru comes up to him with something she wants to find out the truth behind, he proves that he is significantly smarter than his grades would have one believe, displaying unexpected skills.\nBeautiful Bones -Sakurako's Investigation-'s titular protagonist is Sakurako Kujou, a trained osteologist with a genuine passion for bones and skeletons. Moreover, she was also mentored by a renowned forensic scientist, further increasing her repertoire of skills. Using her rich knowledge and expertise, she often acts as a forensic consultant for the local prefectural police, assisting them in solving murder cases that would otherwise seem impossible. While the scope of the cases she solves may not be particularly large, Sakurako would certainly be able to figure out any mystery involving bones, as no bone can keep any secrets from her and her investigative skills.\nInitially affiliated with the Public Safety Bureau, working for the Criminal Investigation Department's Division 01, Shinya Kougami is a brilliant detective who would go to any lengths to uncover the truth behind any mystery, no matter what there is to lose in the process. At first, he is an Inspector, but after one of his colleagues becomes victim to the murderer they were investigating together, Shinya's feelings intensify and his crime coefficient goes up, after which he is demoted to being an Enforcer. Psycho-Pass' first protagonist combines his knowledge, experience, and instincts with an unparalleled fearlessness, to deal with cases in a way no one else possibly could.\nRelated: PSYCHO-PASS Gives Fans A Full Recap Video Ahead Of New Movie (Exclusive First Look)\nWhile Gosick's protagonist, Victorique de Blois, was already born with seemingly superhuman intelligence, her knowledge was further honed during her childhood, as she was forced to live in the dungeon of the de Blois Mansion, constantly reading books that most adults couldn't even begin to comprehend. She was later sent to Saint Marguerite Academy, where was supposed to remain mostly isolated from her peers. Victorique may just be one of the smartest anime characters ever, shown to not only read and absorb knowledge at tremendous speeds, but also possess unparalleled skills in terms of observation, analysis, investigation, and logic, nearly being able to predict the future perfectly.\nWhile The Millionaire Detective – Balance: UNLIMITED follows a pair of detectives, Daisuke Kanbe is certainly the more interesting of the two. As the titular millionaire detective, Daisuke seems to hold the belief that everything can and should be solved through money, which, as the scion of a billionaire family, he possesses in abundance. Typically solving mysteries in a somewhat aggressive manner, in ways that involve bribery, cutting-edge technology, and showy connections, he always gets to the bottom of a case, no matter how much money it takes. While his methods may be unconventional and occasionally morally ambiguous, their effectiveness is undeniable, proving that his belief about money is correct.\nSet in a dystopian future, Un-Go follows Shinjuurou Yuuki and his associate Inga, as they solve various cases together. While Inga also plays a role in pinning down the truth, thanks to their ability to force a subject to truthfully answer a single question, it is Shinjuurou who can investigate the details and find the perfect question to ask. Some people refer to him as \"The Defeated Detective\", because he was once proven to incorrectly assess a situation, but he seems to have resolved himself not to repeat that mistake since, as he continues to use his extraordinary intelligence and analytical skills to solve case after case.\nPsychic Detective Yakumo's titular protagonist Yakumo Saitou is a seemingly normal college student who has the ability to see ghosts and spirits. Somehow getting dragged into various cases, he always manages to solve the case before anyone else does, including the police, and not just because of his special ability. He is shown to be not only extremely intelligent, observant, and logical, but also absolutely willing to resort to tricks and traps if they allow him to get what he wants. While being able to see ghosts does occasionally help, it has in fact caused him more hardships than fortune in life, which is why he typically hides his crimson-red eye with colored contacts.\nDeath Note's L is perhaps the medium's most famous detective, known for his attempt to discover the identity of the mass murderer known as Kira. Found and taken to an orphanage for gifted children by Watari, who would later become his assistant, L displayed incredible intelligence early on, becoming a reputable detective at a young age. Though his disheveled appearance may cause people to doubt his credibility, he is known as the world's greatest detective for a reason. His analytical and deductive skills are second to none, and he's not afraid to lure suspects into a false sense of security to ensure his success, whether that requires deception or subterfuge.\nEven though not all of these characters may be proper detectives, with some working as independent consultants and others merely solving mysteries on a whim, prompted by circumstances, they all prove to have the necessary intelligence and deduction skills to excel in the field. Perhaps, if they put their mind to it, they could even solve some of anime's biggest mysteries. Whether they aim to identify the culprits behind cruel homicidal cases, or simply seek to explore local mysteries, all of these characters are worthy of being known as the best anime detectives ever.\nRemus Badescu is a writer for ScreenRant's anime section. He discovered his passion for the medium as a child, watching shows like Death Note on late-night TV, and has been enthralled with it ever since. In order to deepen his understanding of the industry, he obtained a degree in Communication & Media from the Erasmus University of Rotterdam, where he also found his passion for writing and analyzing pieces of media. "}

The long-running comedy sketch show, which features a regular cast of comic actors along with weekly rotating guest hosts, is preparing to run season 49 with a cast that includes Punkie Johnson, Chloe Fineman, Kenan Thompson, Heidi Gardner, Ego Nwodim, and Bowen Yang. Season 48 ended early when the Writers Guild of America went on strike, but now that the strike has ended it can return despite the ongoing Screen Actors Guild strike. This is because the cast's contracts are not among those currently under dispute as the union fights for fair pay.\nPer The Hollywood Reporter, an official release date has been set for Saturday Night Live season 49. The show is officially set to return on October 14 with SNL alum Pete Davidson returning as host alongside musical guest Ice Spice. The following week, the episode will be hosted by Bad Bunny, who will do double duty as the musical guest.\nPete Davidson’s return to Saturday Night Live has come rather soon after his original departure. He exited the show in 2022 after eight years as part of the cast. However, he hasn't rested on his laurels since he exited the show alongside other veteran performers including Aidy Bryant, Kate McKinnon, and Kyle Mooney.\nIncluded among his many post-SNL roles are a variety of cameos capitalizing on his notoriety, both from his stint on SNL and his string of tabloid-fodder romantic relationships. These cameos included surprise appearances in the big-budget movies Fast X and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 as well as the Netflix Christmas special Who Killed Santa? A Murderville Murder Mystery. However, 2022 also saw him hold major roles in Bodies Bodies Bodies, Meet Cute, and Good Mourning.\nAs if his 2022 wasn't busy enough between those titles and Saturday Night Live, Davidson has held a variety of roles this year before his return to the stage on the iconic late-night show. Since the year began, he has appeared on episodes of The Freak Brothers and American Dad as well as playing Dumb Money's Kevin Gill and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts' Mirage. He also played a fictionalized version of himself on the Peacock dramedy show Bupkis, more than earning this victory lap on Saturday Night Live.\nSource: THR\n"}
{"title": "Gen V's First Major Death Was Already Teased In The Boys Season 3", "date": "2023-10-04 21:18:32", "text": "Gen V does not hold itself back from featuring two horrific deaths in its first 3 episodes, one of which was even hinted at in The Boys' season 3.\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for Gen V.\nAs shocking as the first major death in Gen V may seem, it was already teased in The Boys' season 3 — here's how. Despite being a show about teenage supes, Gen V ups the ante of The Boys' shock value with unforeseeable character deaths, slambang supe showdowns, and boundary-pushing portrayals of sex. For instance, in its opening episodes, Gen V beats The Boys' gross Ant-Man parody scene by putting Little Cricket's sexual endeavors on full display.\nEven when it comes to character deaths, the spin-off series takes a no-hold-barred approach like its parent series. Its first three episodes have already featured two major character deaths, potentially setting the stage for many more. Despite being surprising, however, one of these character deaths was a long time coming, and The Boys season 3 even hinted at it in one of its episodes.\nRELATED: The Boys: Gen V Soundtrack Guide - Every Song & When It Plays\nIn The Boys' season 3's episode 5, \"The Last Time to Look on This World of Lies,\" Blue Hawk brings up Brink, recalling how he and A-Train trained under him at Godolkin University. Both A-Train and Blue Hawk call him \"Coach Brink,\" hinting at how he has been a prominent figure in The Boys' universe for a long time. Although The Boys does not reveal anything else about Brink, it sets him up as an important character in the live-action franchise's overarching storyline, hinting that he would be a key player in the narrative arcs related to Godolkin University. By setting up Brink as one of the higher authorities at Godolkin, The Boys established how his characterization and, ultimately, his death will be instrumental to Gen V's story.\nA-Train and Blue Hawk's respect for \"Coach Brink\" shows how most Godolkin University graduates love him. Gen V affirms this in its opening episode by highlighting how he looks out for the top supes of the academy by covering up for their crimes from behind the scenes and even ensures that supes like Jordan Li do not feel ostracized at the academy. When A-Train and Blue Hawk were at Godolkin's University, Brink must have pulled some strings for them as well to ensure they did well as supes once they graduated.\nHowever, at the same time, A-Train and Blue Hawk's \"Coach Brink\" reference from The Boys also highlights how Brink is not the kind of man anyone would want to mess with. Even though he does not have supe powers, he holds enough power and influence to be revered by powerful supes like A-Train and Blue Hawk. This again comes into play in Gen V, where Brink earns the trust of many young supes like Jordan Li but crosses all moral boundaries to exploit supes and their abilities by expelling unprivileged students like Marie and being involved in the malicious experiments at the Woods.\n"}
{"title": "Stranger Things Season 5 Will Finally Prove The Show's Real Main Character Isn't Who You Think", "date": "2023-10-04 21:20:32", "text": "Characters like Eleven and Mike have always been considered the protagonists of Stranger Things, but season 5 may shift that perspective.\nStranger Things season 5 has been confirmed as the Netflix show’s final outing, and many audiences are expecting it to shift to focus and reveal a certain character to have been the protagonist all along. In the show’s fourth season, the ensemble cast faced their greatest enemy yet — Vecna — who managed to escape at the last moment. Stranger Things season 4's ending saw the Upside Down bleeding through to the real world courtesy of this villain. It was a shocking cliffhanger that helped build the tension for the show’s fifth and final season.\nWhile Stranger Things has always been an ensemble show, it’s become even more so over the past few seasons. There are plenty of entertaining side characters that fans have come to know and love, but certain individuals have always been in the spotlight, leading most audiences to loosely call them the show’s main characters. However, one specific moment at the end of Stranger Things season 4 suggested that things aren’t quite as they seemed. It's possible Stranger Things is building toward the dark reveal that it’s been somebody else’s story all along.\nSince the beginning of Stranger Things season 1, Mike and Eleven have been the pair at the center of events. This always made sense, as Eleven was the outlier with her supernatural powers, and Mike was arguably the leader of their group of friends. Their importance in the narrative only grew stronger as Stranger Things began to explore Eleven’s backstory more thoroughly, revealing how she was connected to the Upside Down and proving that her character is necessary to defeat the demons that came from it.\nStranger Things set up Mike and Eleven’s romance very early in the show, which further helped solidify them as its main characters. While the surrounding cast might have changed, with new characters joining and old characters leaving between seasons, they’ve always remained at the cornerstone of the narrative. Other characters like Dustin, Will, and Lucas have frequently lost out on screen time in order for Stranger Things to prioritize Eleven’s story. This was necessary in order to fully explain how the Upside Down works and why characters like Vecna are so dangerous.\nAlthough she's been in the spotlight for much of Stranger Things, Eleven isn’t the only character with a tight connection to the Upside Down. Will Byers was among the first people to enter this dark dimension, and it took hold of him. He’s connected to both the Mind Flayer and Vecna, which will surely prove handy during the gang’s final battle. Eleven might have been a useful vessel for explaining the Upside Down and saving the day when nobody else could, but Will has been through so much over the past four seasons, and it might be time for Eleven to step back and let him fend for himself.\nMany fans are concerned that Will Byers might die in Stranger Things season 5, and the theory actually makes a lot of sense. He’s connected with the Upside Down in a way that seems to be impossible to undo, so destroying the dimension might require Will to sacrifice himself. This would definitively prove that Will has been the show’s protagonist all along, as everything he’s been through builds toward that climactic moment. The end of season 4 teased Will’s psychic connection with Vecna once again, proving that it’s going to be important in the future.\nAlthough it seems strange to suggest that Mike and Eleven aren't Stranger Things’ main characters, Will has arguably been at the center of the story from the very beginning. Despite being absent from Stranger Things season 1, Will was the one who set the story into motion with his disappearance. He was the one who bound the group together, even if it happened without him actively doing anything. Mike and Eleven likely wouldn't even be together if it weren't for Will's disappearance, so the claim that he's the show's protagonist isn't as outlandish at it first seems.\nStranger Things' writers also promised to give Will Byers a larger role in season 5, which suggests that something important is in store for the character. Perhaps this is when his true potential will really shine through, allowing him to overcome the hurdles that held him back in the past so that he can fully step into his protagonist role. The show has focused on developing Will Byers' character through his feelings for Mike and his mental health struggles after being trapped in the Upside Down. As such, it'd make sense if his Stranger Things storyline amounts to something big.\n"}
{"title": "The MCU's Deadpool Vs Wolverine Fight Can Only End One Way", "date": "2023-10-04 21:31:31", "text": "The fight between Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine in Deadpool 3 is highly anticipated, but its outcome might be predictable.\nThe fight between Deadpool and Wolverine in the MCU's Deadpool 3 will be exciting, but the outcome likely won't be surprising. With Hugh Jackman's Wolverine joining Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool in the MCU, Deadpool 3 can finally display a live-action battle between the two Marvel icons in all their glory. Deadpool 3's potentially gory fight between Wolverine and Deadpool will be like nothing the MCU has ever seen before, though the aftermath might be of little importance.\nA rematch between Deadpool and Wolverine on the big screen has been brewing since 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, where Wolverine had a tough time keeping up with the monstrosity that took up the Deadpool name, but ultimately came up victorious by beheading him. Years later, Fox's two Deadpool movies gave Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool a makeover, not only fixing his costume and personality but also his abilities. As it stands, Deadpool and Wolverine's MCU rematch may end very differently.\nHugh Jackman's return as Wolverine has been one of Deadpool 3's biggest reveals since the movie was first announced. Despite saying goodbye to the character in James Mangold's Logan, the idea of joining the MCU and crossing paths with Deadpool was evidently too exciting to pass up. And given both character's abilities and shared comic book history, a fight scene where both heroes go all-out against each other is all but inevitable. Deadpool 3's R rating also raises expectations, as the MCU can finally do the characters' brutal nature justice on the big screen.\nShortly after Deadpool 3's first set image featuring Hugh Jackman's Wolverine was made public, more behind-the-scenes footage provided a deeper look at Wolverine's role in the movie. As shown in set photos and videos, Wolverine and Deadpool will fight beside a wrecked Fox logo, which suggests that Deadpool, Wolverine, and possibly other non-MCU Marvel characters will get ripped out of their home universes. Whether this scene is the only fight between Deadpool and Wolverine in Deadpool 3 is yet to be seen, however.\nDeadpool and Wolverine's battle in Deadpool 3 has the potential to become the MCU's most brutal fight so far. However, there's little mystery around its outcome. Wolverine and Deadpool have incredibly fast healing factors that could extend the fight indefinitely. Wolverine has only died once in the X-Men movies, and that was only because of adamantium poisoning in a future timeline. Deadpool has been split in half and shot while wearing a mutation inhibitor, but he also recovered quite quickly. Since expecting one of them to die is futile, the only way Deadpool and Wolverine's fight can end is if they give up or if something else distracts them.\nBesides, Deadpool 3's first set photo features Wolverine and Deadpool walking side by side, which suggests that they will team up at some point in the movie. An R-rated buddy-superhero adventure is more innovative than a straightforward fight to the death, and it makes more sense for Wolverine and Deadpool to join forces to face a bigger threat together. Ultimately, Wolverine and Deadpool's MCU arrival could set up future multiversal storylines for upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe titles like Avengers: Secret Wars, so a death from either character is highly unlikely.\nDeadpool and Wolverine's similar abilities provide many opportunities for creative fight scenes. Unlike most characters, they can land brutal blows and chop each other to bits over and over before the fight ends. The main appeal of the fight lies in how they attack each other, and not how either of them dies. Wolverine and Deadpool's inability to die provides a believable reason for their friendship, and it even acknowledges Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman's playful real-life feud and friendship. Both characters and actors are equals inside and outside Deadpool 3.\nAlso, letting Deadpool and Wolverine survive the events of Deadpool 3 can make them available for future MCU movies and shows. While Deadpool 3's plot may feature Deadpool killing Fox's X-Men universe and all its characters, Deadpool and Wolverine themselves are too popular to kill off in a one-off MCU story. Instead, Marvel Studios could keep them around at least until a franchise-wide crossover event, where they can interact with other MCU characters and receive a final sendoff as satisfying as Iron Man and Captain America's Avengers: Endgame farewell.\n"}

In an interview discussing his latest offering, Hickman suggested readers should expect similar from G.O.D.S.\nSpeaking with Entertainment Weekly, Hickman said that the hardcover edition of G.O.D.S. will be \"House of X-size,\" with much of the writer's signature surplus content appearing for the first time in collected form.\nEven before it reaches its collected form, G.O.D.S. will be eight issues that are, according to Hickman, \"about 12 issues worth of pages.\"\nAs a comic book creator, Jonathan Hickman has become synonymous with world-building. Marvel's trust in him with one of their tentpole franchises was validated by the success of \"House of X\" and \"Powers of X,\" the foundation-shifting, timeline rearranging saga that ushered in the X-Men's Krakoan age, widely regarded as among the greatest X-Men stories to date. G.O.D.S. is Hickman, and Marvel's, attempt to replicate that success at the cosmic level of the Marvel Universe, with the series set to be characteristically dense in style – and complete in form, telling a story with a definite beginning, middle, and end.\n\"I am guilty of writing for the trade,\" Hickman told EW, \"I think about the collection from day one.\" While he went on to clarify that the plan could change as issues of the series are released individually, the \"extra content, the data pages, all that kind of stuff,\" that people have come to expect from his work, \"isn't going to show up until the hardcover.\" The reason for this: issues of G.O.D.S. are already giant-sized, packed with detail, action, and lore. Presumably, if a particularly critical piece of information needs to be delivered to the reader, a data page may find its way into an issue, but currently, readers will have to wait.\nHickman promised that the hardcover collection will \"be a completely different experience than the monthly book.\" The writer may craft his stories with the final, collected version in mind, but he emphasizes \"still maintaining the importance of the monthly book\" during the creative process. G.O.D.S. is an opportunity not just for Marvel to open up an unheralded frontier of storytelling in its fictional universe, but for Jonathan Hickman – who Marvel has also given the privileged task of reinventing its Ultimate Universe – to solidify his status as the most vital comic book creator working in the industry right now.\nSource: Entertainment Weekly\nG.O.D.S #1 is available now from Marvel Comics.\n"}

The service's catalog has a number of options that are award-winning and critically acclaimed, as well as some underrated gems. For a night of suspenseful film viewing, Netflix has plenty of offerings to keep viewers on the edge of their seats.\nRELATED: 10 Best Thrillers Of All Time To Watch Right Now\nNominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and a number of other honors, 2022's All Quiet on the Western Front is a masterful work of high-stakes suspense in World War I. The story follows an idealistic group of young friends who enlist in the German army together. They're immediately shocked by the horrific world of death and violence they find themselves in. Like other modern war films, such as Dunkirk or 1917, All Quiet on the Western Front is filled with incredible cinematography, and it's a sensory overload sure to ramp up tension.\nBerlin Syndrome is one of the most genuinely horrifying films on Netflix, following a passionate romance gone wrong. An Australian photographer traveling in Berlin falls for a local teacher, who then traps and imprisons her in his apartment. The film is a psychological thriller that will leave its audience terrified, even though it doesn't rely on monsters or jump scares. Instead, Berlin Syndrome uses the strong performances of its stars to summon feelings of terror and dread.\nMike Flanagan has earned a reputation for his horror films, like Doctor Sleep, as well as his Netflix series, like The Haunting of Hill House and Midnight Mass. Gerald's Game is one of Flanagan's most terrifying projects, and it is an adaptation of Stephen King's work. The film follows a married couple who travel to a remote lake house to rekindle their romance. Following a violent argument during foreplay, the man dies of a heart attack, leaving the woman handcuffed to a bed and forced to find a way to break free and survive. The premise is unique and daunting, making this an ideal suspense movie to watch.\nLéon: The Professional is a 1994 action thriller about a hitman who reluctantly bonds with a 12-year-old girl after her family is murdered. Léon tries to help the girl, Mathilda, get revenge on DEA agent Norman Stansfield by training her to kill. Gary Oldman's Agent Stansfield is an iconic and likable movie villain, setting the tone for many antagonist performances of the 21st century. The film is highly stylized with a dramatic, violent ending that will get viewers' hearts pumping.\nBird Box is an exciting horror movie and one of the best and most-watched Netflix original movies. Starring Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich, Bird Box is set in a post-apocalyptic world where a mysterious force has killed off a large portion of the population. Survivors can't look at it, so they must be blindfolded at all times to protect themselves. This premise is claustrophobic and terrifying as is, but Bird Box also raises interesting questions about mental health and social behavior.\nMichael Mann is a master of stylized crime films full of beautiful visuals and well-written characters. Collateral brings together Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise, with Cruise playing the film's villain, a silver-haired assassin named Vince. Foxx plays Max, a Los Angeles-based taxi driver who picks up Vince and is offered $600 to make five stops. When Vince realizes he's taking part in a series of hits, the conflict begins. Collateral is an incredibly engaging crime thriller that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish, utilizing strong dialogue and exciting action to tell its story.\nThe 2016 film Nocturnal Animals is a psychological thriller about a woman named Susan, who receives a violent manuscript written by her ex-husband. Seeing the similarities between the novel and their past, Susan is forced to reexamine her life. The film is incredibly dark and has some disturbing scenes, with strong performances from Amy Adams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Shannon, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, as well as great direction from Tom Ford.\nMission: Impossible has changed in many ways over its seven-film run. While it's now known as the action franchise where Tom Cruise tries to outdo himself with insane stunts, the first film in the series is a slower-paced espionage thriller. Directed by the great Brian De Palma, 1996's Mission: Impossible is a well-written thrill ride with an old-fashioned feeling similar to classic James Bond films. The cable drop scene, in particular, is one of the most suspenseful sequences of the saga.\nThe combination of Denis Villeneuve and Roger Deakins guarantees a beautifully shot film, but it's the writing and performances from stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Hugh Jackman, and Paul Dano that make Prisoners a thrilling masterpiece. The film follows Jackman as Keller Dover, the father of a six-year-old girl who's gone missing. When Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki is forced to free the primary suspect due to a lack of evidence, Keller seeks justice on his own. Prisoners is as tense as mystery films get, with Jackman's performance standing out in particular.\nLike Collateral, Heat is a crime thriller from director Michael Mann. The 1995 film sees Robert De Niro as a master thief going head-to-head with Al Pacino, who plays the police lieutenant trying to catch him. It's fun seeing two all-time great actors face off, and Heat is full of excellent writing and incredibly intense action sequences. Heat is one of the best heist movies ever made, and the pacing and build-up make its longer length fly by.\nJaws is one of the most influential suspense films of all time and has been giving audiences a fear of the sea for generations. In Jaws, a giant shark terrorizes a beach town in New England, setting the stage for the film's trio of police chief, marine biologist, and ship captain, to and hunt the beast. Jaws is old enough that its effects are easier to spot, making the shark a bit less threatening. However, the atmosphere, music, and directing from Steven Spielberg still manage to make Jaws a nail-biting experience. It's worth watching on Netflix, especially for those who haven't seen it.\n"}
{"title": "Loki Season 2 EP Explains How Victor Timely Creates Conflict Between Loki, Sylvie, & The TVA", "date": "2023-10-04 21:35:10", "text": "Exclusive: Loki season 2 executive producer Kevin Wright breaks down how Victor Timely will cause Loki, Sylvie, and the TVA to question everything.\nLoki season 2 executive producer Kevin Wright explains how Victor Timely stands out from He Who Remains and will force Loki and his allies to question everything. Victor Timely was teased in the post-credit scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania as the next variant of Kang that Loki will be dealing with. The first season ended with Sylvie killing He Who Remains after a warning about his death, leading to a new multiverse war. The MCU is setting up a major conflict with Kang at the center of it as the next Avengers-level threat in Avengers: Kang Dynasty.\nIn an exclusive interview with Screen Rant for Loki season 2, Wright discussed the new Kang variant, Victor Timely. He explained why the idea of a sci-fi villain being from the past was intriguing to the team. Wright also shared how Victor Timely will force Loki, Sylvie, and the TVA to question their initial thoughts about him and the idea of free will. Check out Wright's full quote below:\nKevin Wright: So it started just in the concept of Victor. I think in what we were trying to do at the end of season one was to get everybody obviously terrified of, \"War is coming. This is going to be scary.\" You see the scary character in Ant-Man and just the idea that the sci-fi villain is not coming from the future, but maybe is this unassuming, slightly eccentric inventor from the past was fun. It allows us to go to exciting places.\nBut really, what was exciting about it from a character standpoint is he is kind of the perfect person to fuel the character conflict between Loki, Sylvie, and the TVA of, \"You're saying something scary is coming. You are saying that you want everybody to have free will, but you're also swearing that you're going to kill the next variant of him to pop up.\" It creates almost a contradiction or a paradox of, if you truly believe in free will, you've got to believe that man's words when he says, \"I'm my own person. I can make my own choices. I'm not the man you think I am.\" And I think it was just for somebody like Jonathan, it just fuels what he does best, which is creating really deep and complex characters.\nHe Who Remains was the first variant of Kang introduced into the MCU, and although he seemed like a clear villain, the more he explained to Loki about the TVA and multiverse, the more complicated things became. He Who Remains made it seem like the TVA was the only thing protecting their universe from the dangers, notably his variants, in the others. His warnings seemed to prove true when Sylvie killed him and the branches of the other timelines burst out from the \"sacred timeline.\"\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Breaks 2 MCU Trends That Have Defined The Last 10 Years\nThe next variant introduced was Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, who proved to be a major threat even at such low power. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania also introduced the Council of Kangs, who have their eye on the \"sacred timeline\" now that Kang is gone. Then comes Victor Timely, the main Kang variant in the new season of Loki. Although he is a Kang variant, Victor Timely is a bit of a mystery.\nInstead of a villain with impressive technological advancements, he is from the past. Victor Timely will also force Loki, Sylvie, and the TVA to question everything they believe. Sylvie wants everyone, notably herself, to have free will. However, this cuts both ways because it means she can't assume Victor Timely is predestined to be evil. Loki will have to grapple with He Who Remains' warning, what it means that there is another variant, and how to protect the world. While the people of the TVA will need to question everything they thought to be true.\n"}
{"title": "10 Great Movies Set At Halloween That Absolutely Aren't Horror Films", "date": "2023-10-04 21:50:37", "text": "Even though Halloween is closely associated with the horror genre, there are a few great movies set on Halloween night that aren't horror-related.\nWhile Halloween is the perfect time for scary movies, there are a few classic non-horror films that are also set on the holiday. Halloween is a time for the spooky and supernatural. The holiday is one of the few times of the year when it is acceptable to focus on ghoulish, macabre, and downright frightening subjects. This prompts many movie buffs to spend most of October celebrating Halloween by watching classic horror movies. However, it also means that the cinematic representation of the holiday is somewhat imbalanced.\nEven though Christmas is a time for family, friends, and peace on earth, there are a veritable deluge of horror movies, action thrillers, and bawdy comedies that subvert this tradition. By contrast, Halloween horror movies dominate the holiday's contributions to cinema. Almost every movie set on Halloween is a horror movie of some sort, whether it is as anodyne and family-friendly as Hocus Pocus or Halloweentown or as chilling as the classic slasher Halloween. Discounting movies with horror elements, there are surprisingly few scare-free movies set on Halloween night.\n2014’s Song of the Sea is a poignant, funny, and inventive Irish animated adventure movie. Although it's technically a fantasy adventure about selkies, much of Song of the Sea is a sweet cartoon dramedy about a pair of mismatched siblings getting into scrapes and coming to each other’s rescue. The most important plot points take place on Halloween night, but there is nothing horrifying about this fantasy movie’s ending. As inventive and charming as it is moving, Song of the Sea is a great animated movie that proves Disney and Studio Ghibli aren’t the only creative powerhouses in the industry.\nDirector Steven Spielberg’s E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial blends family drama, science-fiction, and comedy, but the movie steers clear of horror for the most part. Admittedly, some small children were likely afraid the first time they saw the eponymous alien sprint at the camera. However, it soon becomes clear that he is one of the cutest aliens in cinema history. Despite this, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial’s entire story takes place on Halloween night, and the practice of trick-or-treating is central to the movie’s ending.\nThe Australian drama Boys in the Trees is a lyrical fantasy movie mixed with a coming-of-age story. Although it's far from a traditional horror movie, it is likely the most unsettling movie listed here. With a tone similar to Mike Flanagan’s Netflix shows, Boys in the Trees uses ghosts and spirits as metaphors for trauma and tragedy. However, these never feel forced or clumsy. Instead, this coming-of-age story manages to turn a tale of two friends drifting apart into something that is equal parts life-affirming and heartbreaking.\n2013’s Grow Up Tony Philips is a fascinating non-horror Halloween movie, as the coming-of-age dramedy is also the director’s first departure from the world of horror comedy. Director Emily Hagins is best known for beginning her career with the zombie movie Pathogen, which she directed at the ripe age of 12. However, Grow Up Tony Philips is a very different proposition. A dramedy about the titular antihero coming to terms with his friends growing out of their old Halloween traditions, Grow Up Tony Philips asks viewers what it means to grow up and what teenagers should be willing to sacrifice in the name of friendship.\nWhile Amazon’s Jack Reacher adaptation nailed the tone of the Lee Childs novel series, there is something to be said for the enjoyable silliness of 2016’s Jack Reacher: Never Go Back. This thriller is a classic Reacher adventure as Tom Cruise’s version of the heroic drifter races against time to clear the name of a framed friend. The action-thriller makes good use of the Halloween setting during its climax. While admittedly a by-the-numbers procedural, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is elevated by Cruise’s screen presence and some stylish action sequences that prove Halloween is a holiday woefully underutilized by the genre.\n1997’s Affliction is an intense, emotionally moving effort from indie director and Taxi Driver scribe Paul Schrader. Nick Nolte plays a small-town cop who becomes obsessed with a hunting death that took place on Halloween. He's convinced that it was a murder and that there is a conspiracy to cover up the truth. Like another popular movie no one talks about any more — Mystic River — this grim crime drama offers no easy answers. Dark, brutal, and believable, this soulful thriller might be a harder watch than many Halloween horror movies.\nIronweed tells the tale of a drifter suffering from an unspecified mental illness who returns to his hometown on Halloween night, but viewers shouldn’t be discouraged by this seemingly dark synopsis. Where the superficially similar Spider and Possum mine this setup for nightmarish journeys into broken psyches, Ironweed instead offers a warm, elegiac, and at times, surprisingly sweet story of love and loss. Jack Nicholson is stellar as ever as the troubled lead, but it is Meryl Streep’s spirited turn as his dying old friend that makes Ironweed essential viewing.\nWhile Clint Eastwood is one of the best Western movie directors of all time, he is also accomplished when it comes to smaller, more intimate stories. A Perfect World is one of these, as Eastwood’s camera follows a convict and a sheltered orphan on the run across the U.S. Surprisingly moving, A Perfect World's plot centers around a touching moment where the movie’s troubled anti-hero helps his shy new friend celebrate Halloween for the first time.\n1976’s Kenny and Company was largely overshadowed by director Don Coscarelli’s next effort, Phantasm. However, as a tribute to misspent youth, this 1976 coming-of-age story is worth a watch. Kenny and Company follows a group of kids as they prank, play, and otherwise mess around during one long Halloween night. Essentially a preteen spin on Dazed and Confused or American Graffiti, this nostalgic comedy is a sweet watch for viewers of all ages.\nAlthough 2012’s Fun Size was intended to be a launching point for Nickelodeon star Victoria Justice’s movie career, the comedy proved too raunchy for kids and too anodyne for grownups. However, Fun Size is better than its brutal reviews suggest thanks to Justice’s charming central turn and a scene-stealing role for Evil Dead remake star Jane Levy. The plot, which sees Justice's heroine attempting to find her missing brother, is admittedly thin. Nonetheless, this non-horror Halloween movie offers a PG-13 spin on the Superbad/Booksmart template that is well worth a watch.\n"}
{"title": "Castlevania: Nocturne Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-04 22:00:38", "text": "From the return of a beloved Castlevania character to Erzsebet Báthory’s plan, here is Castlevania: Nocturne season 1’s ending explained.\nWARNING: This article contains SPOILERS for Castlevania: Nocturne.\nFrom Alucard’s return to the Erzsebet Báthory’s plan, Castlevania: Nocturne episode 8 concluded the season with major twists and set up a potential season 2. Castlevania: Nocturne followed Richter Belmont, a descendant of Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades, in a story set 300 years after the original show. After several mentions of the Vampire Messiah and her twisted goals, Castlevania: Nocturne ended with the vampires achieving a major victory, but not all hope was lost.\nAlucard returned in Castlevania: Nocturne episode 8, bringing Netflix’s Castlevania franchise full circle and setting up the next chapter in Richter’s story. While Alucard looked different in Castlevania: Nocturne, this is the same character from the original show. Alucard’s actor was not initially listed as part of Castlevania: Nocturne’s cast, which helped keep the character’s return a surprise. Tera has been turned into a vampire, Richter can now use magic again, and Annette learns that Edouard’s soul has a new purpose. Here is a breakdown of the Castlevania: Nocturne ending, and how it sets up season 2.\nAlucard is the son of Dracula in the world of Castlevania. He was introduced at the end of Castlevania season 1, episode 1, and went on to become one of the show’s main characters. While the Castlevania franchise is focused on the Belmont family, Alucard is a huge part of that universe, both in the games and the Netflix adaptation. Born to a vampire father and a human mother, Alucard is somewhat immortal. Dracula’s son does not age, which makes him the perfect character to bridge Castlevania and Castlevania: Nocturne. Alucard fought side by side with Trevor Belmont in the original series and now appeared to help Richter in Nocturne.\nAlucard is one of the most powerful beings in the Castlevania universe, which is why he did not even struggle to kill Drolta. Alucard’s sword, which he can command from a distance through magic, quickly puts an end to one of the strongest vampires in Nocturne. Alucard’s return in Castlevania: Nocturne’s ending was very much a sequel hook for a potential Castlevania: Nocturne season 2, which has yet to be confirmed by Netflix. Richter, Annette, and Maria have not saved the world from Erzsebeth Báthory, but fortunately, Alucard is now joining them. As the son of Dracula put it, though, he was a bit late.\nWhile Castlevania: Nocturne is connected to Castlevania, the show did not have too many direct connections to the original series. This is because Castlevania: Nocturne is set 300 years after Castlevania, meaning most of the characters audiences followed in the first show have been long dead by now. Richter Belmont is a descendant of Trevor Belmont and Sypha, both of whom were Alucard’s best friends. The Castlevania trio was the heart of the show, and both Trevor and Sypha left a huge mark on Alucard’s long life. This is why the son of Dracula was expected to appear in Castlevania: Nocturne eventually.\nRelated: Castlevania: Nocturne Is Based On These 2 Games (But With One Fundamental Change)\nThanks to Alucard appearing in Castlevania: Nocturne episode 8, the show is now directly tied to its predecessor. While names like Sypha and Dracula were mentioned in Castlevania: Nocturne, the animated series did not focus on things that had happened in the first Castlevania show. Now that Alucard has joined the heroes, there may be more mentions of Trevor and Sypha in a potential Castlevania season 2. In addition, Alucard’s return sets the stage for Dracula to come into play, even though Vlad Tepes had a happy ending with Lisa in Castlevania season 4’s finale. Regardless, Alucard will be an important ally in the fight against Erzsebet Báthory.\nCastlevania season 4’s ending saw both Dracula and Lisa being resurrected. While those behind their resurrection planned on transforming Dracula and Lisa into the Rebus, the heroes managed to stop the creature before it was too late. Dracula and Lisa, now back in the world of the living, were free again. Castlevania ends with Dracula and Lisa hugging each other, suggesting they had a happy ending away from all the pain and misery from their original lives. Castlevania: Nocturne suggests Dracula as a monster that hasn’t been seen for hundreds of years, and there are even those who do not even know who Dracula is.\nThe main Castlevania: Nocturne villain was Erzsebeth Báthory, who is described by her followers as the Vampire Messiah. Erzsebeth, who believes herself to be a goddess, plans to create an endless night in which vampires will no longer have to hide from the sunlight. However, Erzsebeth also wanted to forge a symbolic ally with humans, particularly with the Abbot and the Catholic Church. The final stop in Erzsebet’s plan was to take on a human sacrifice inside the church to cement her powers and officially begin her rule. The Devourer of Light originally planned on taking Maria as a sacrifice, but plans changed after Tera, Maria’s mom, offered herself instead.\nTera, who had already been a victim of the Devourer of Light, offered herself as a sacrifice to save her daughter. Tera, who is a Speaker, argued that she would make for a far more powerful vampire than her daughter. While Erzsebet hesitated, the Vampire Messiah eventually agreed to replace Maria with her mother. This is why Tera stayed behind in Castlevania: Nocturne episode 8. Maria’s mom was bitten and turned into a vampire before Richter and the others had even left the church. While this was a tragic turn of events, Tera managed to save her daughter after the child’s father, Abbot Emanuel, almost got her killed.\nCastlevania: Nocturne’s season finale directly sets up season 2. Similar to the original Castlevania show, most of the conflicts were not resolved at the end of season 1, which mainly served to introduce characters and plot points for future stories. This includes the return of Alucard, who killed Dracula in Castlevania season 2 and now joins the fight against the Vampire Messiah. Tera’s future as a vampire will also be an important storyline in a potential Castlevania: Nocturne season 2. In addition, Castlevania: Nocturne has only now begun to show Richter Belmont’s powers and skills, as the character could not use magic for most of season 1.\nCastlevania: Nocturne’s final episodes also hinted at a relationship between Richter and Annette, which happens in the games. While this could only be a nod to their video game counterparts’ history, this potential relationship could be revisited in Castlevania: Nocturne season 2. Lastly, The Devour of Light essentially won in episode 8, having accomplished her goal of turning a sacrifice into a vampire inside a church. Erzsebet Báthory’s plan of world domination continues, meaning there are more than enough stories for Castlevania: Nocturne season 2 to tackle.\n"}
{"title": "Jujutsu Kaisen Will Force Its Heroes To Fight Without Their Strongest Ally", "date": "2023-10-04 22:00:38", "text": "After the most recent episodes of Jujutsu Kaisen's Shibuya Incident arc, the series' protagonists won't be able to rely on their most powerful ally.\nWarning! Contains spoilers for Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode #9Despite facing arguably their biggest threat yet, Jujutsu Kaisen is now forcing its heroes to fight on without their greatest ally Gojo after a shocking twist in the anime's latest episode. This makes sense from a narrative perspective as Gojo was powerful enough to trivialize most threats in the series on his own, but it is still surprising given his extreme power level and popularity.\nIn Season 2 Episode #9 of Jujutsu Kaisen, the curses were able to enact their ultimate plan to stop Gojo from interfering with them. After tiring the sorcerer out by forcing him to kill a slew of transfigured humans quickly, Geto showed up with a mysterious item known as the Prison Realm. This box was able to capture Gojo as long as he was incapacitated for a mental minute, which Geto's shocking arrival enabled. Despite Gojo's immense power, once he was trapped by the Prison Realm, it seemed he was powerless to escape, even as the villain taunted him, which shows that the other heroes of the story will now have to fight on without him.\nThis is an incredibly tall order especially given the power level of the enemies they must face in Shibuya. While Gojo was able to easily defeat Hanami in that episode, the other Disaster Curses are still free to wreak havoc on a massive scale, and each one has a devastating ability. Jogo can wield massive amounts of firepower, Mahito can transfigure humans with one touch, and the newest introduction Choso appears to be able to manipulate blood. This isn't even including the sorcerer controlling Geto's body, who can call forth several potent other curses to fight at his disposal. These villains are also incredibly disturbing in the Jujutsu Kaisen anime, meaning there is no moral limit on what they might do.\nWith all these powerful threats against them, the good sorcerers will likely be hard-pressed to bring the Shibuya Incident to a happy conclusion. There are many powerful sorcerers in the series besides Gojo, but they are all separated among various teams and none of them are as untouchable. Gojo's Limitless technique granted him both powerful offensive and defensive techniques, and no other sorcerer could match that level of versatility. This leaves them with clear weaknesses that the Curses can exploit, which means that a fair amount of them will likely get killed or extremely injured.\nGojo's sealing represents a major status quo change for the series. Before this point, sorcerers could rely on Gojo to handle any enemy they deemed too dangerous, which gave them a bit of a crutch when dealing with dangerous Curses. Now this support is gone and the heroes of Jujutsu Kaisen must fight against the series' incredibly powerful enemies alone.\nBen Sockol has been writing articles for the comics section of Screen Rant since early 2022.

The Help is an impeccable fighter, able to stand his ground against Batman. Since his original appearance, he’s been one of DC’s most dangerous combatants, and now he’s heading back to Gotham.\nThe Penguin #2 – by Tom King, Rafael de Latorre, and Marcelo Maiolo – finds Oswald Cobblepot working toward taking back his position in Gotham. Unable to do it alone, he seeks out the most powerful henchman in the world: the Help.\nThe Help has not only stood against Batman, he’s had a hand in training several other incredibly skilled fighters and heroes.\nThe Help was first introduced in Batman: Killing Time #3 – by Tom King, David Marquez, and Alejandro Sánchez – where he was hired by Penguin to settle his conflict with Riddler and Catwoman. Now, writer Tom King has brought the character back in The Penguin #2, once more as a reluctant associate of the Penguin. Killing Time #3 established the Help as the most skilled person in the fight immediately upon his entering the frat, as he shot Riddler and defeated Batman. Not only was he able to counter Batman’s moves, he named the tactics and their origin, explaining his own experiences with everyone from Ted Grant to Ras al Ghul.\nIn Killing Time #3, the Help gave a sense that the fight didn't require his full concentration; he had energy left over afterward to be complimentary toward Batman. The Penguin #2 offers further insight into the Help’s history. His students include Lady Shiva, widely regarded as the most lethal fighter in the world. As he and Penguin hunt on the grounds of his home, he mentions being employed by the Queens to train their son Oliver years earlier. Previously, he name-dropped Black Canary as a former trainee, meaning he’s had a hand in both Canary and Green Arrow’s origins. Nearly ninety years old, the Help exceeds Batman in both training and experience.\nAfter the events of Batman: Killing Time, during which he retrieved the incredibly valuable object known as the Eye of Christ, the Help retired, settling in to a life of luxury. Yet, in spite of his imposing skill as a fighter, Oswald Cobblepot was able to force the Help to join him in his campaign for criminal supremacy in Gotham. In The Penguin #2, the eponymous crime lord killed the Help's staff, citing being served and waited upon “wasn’t him.” Now, Cobblepot will take his rightful place in Gotham with Earth’s greatest henchman at his side – ensuring that whoever comes out on top, the Help or Batman, the Penguin may be the only winner.\nCheck out The Penguin #2, available now from DC Comics!\nAshley is a long-time comics nerd, a parent (to a human, a dog, and too many houseplants), and a big fan of all things dark and spooky.

{"title": "The Boys Just Revealed A New Weapon That Could Defeat Any Supe (Even Homelander)", "date": "2023-10-04 22:10:37", "text": "As potent and invincible as Homelander may seem in The Boys, Gen V has finally revealed a powerful weapon that can potentially be used to defeat him.\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for Gen V.\nThe Boys' Gen V just revealed a new weapon that could potentially defeat any supe, including Homelander. Although Gen V seems to follow a self-contained story in The Boys' universe, it has been dropping several subtle hints that could become major plot points in the franchise's overarching storylines. For instance, Gen V hints that Homelander is already on trial after he killed a man in broad daylight in The Boys' season 3. This revelation alone sets the stage for many narrative avenues for The Boys season 4.\nBy highlighting how Brink offers Luke a place in The Seven, Gen V also confirms that Starlight and Maeve's departure from the supe group has left two empty spots for new supes to fill. However, besides these evident references and story setups, Gen V also secretly reveals how one weapon can be used to overpower any supe. The spin-off show's depiction of the weapon and its impact on supes almost confirms that even Homelander would not stand a chance against it.\nRELATED: Gen V Continues An Episode 1 Tradition The Boys Has Followed For 3 Seasons\nA sonic weapon generates high-intensity sound waves that may not be lethal but can cause severe damage to a targeted individual. Most supes not only possess special powers but also have advanced senses that complement their unique abilities. Owing to this, they are more sensitive to the extreme frequencies and amplitudes of high-intensity sounds, leaving them vulnerable to the detrimental effects of sonic weapons. Gen V establishes this in its opening episodes, where Andre fails to stand his ground against a non-supe human who uses a tiny device that generates high-intensity sounds.\nDespite his best efforts to fight back, Andre falls to the ground, struggling to get up because his augmented hearing enhances his auditory perception and prevents his ears from filtering out the sound from the weapon. The fact that the human guard seems unscathed by the sound from his sonic weapon shows how sound waves that non-supe folks can comfortably hear can cause severe damage in supes like Andre. Although Gen V explicitly portrays how augmented hearing is the Achilles heel for many supes, The Boys has previously hinted at this weakness.\nIn The Boys' season 2, episode 8, \"What I Know,\" Frenchie intentionally sets up a loud sonic weapon to distract Homelander while Butcher and Becca rescue Ryan. A regular sound would not have bothered Homelander. However, when he hears the sound waves from the weapon, he instantly flies out to destroy it, proving that Gen V's sonic weapon would also be effective against Homelander. This Gen V revelation not only proves that Homelander has a clear weakness but also highlights how Supersonic was literally a walking weapon against several supes in The Boys and could even kill Homelander with his Sonic Clap powers.\n"}

The fantasy action show was cancelled by Netflix in December 2022, leading fans and Barry himself to rally for its renewal through online and real-life efforts. In August, it was announced that a Warrior Nun film trilogy was happening thanks to the efforts of the campaign.\nNow, Barry has confirmed he will not be involved in creating the upcoming Warrior Nun movie trilogy.\nIn his post, Barry reveals he doesn't know what to expect from future updates regarding the new movies. This indicates the trilogy may not have the same creative team as the Netflix series.\nWhile Barry will not be involved in the upcoming movies, executive producer Dean English will be returning to bring the new installments to life. However, it's now unclear if the films will follow Barry's original vision for Warrior Nun season 3 and beyond, or if the series will go in a different direction. It also calls into question which members of the cast and crew from the original show will be returning.\nThe end of Warrior Nun season 2 saw Ava go through the Ark in order to heal in Reya's dimension as Beatrice quit the OCS.

{"title": "The Exorcist: Believer Can't Compete With The RT Score Of Blumhouse's Other New Horror Movie", "date": "2023-10-04 22:27:48", "text": "While The Exorcist: Believer lands on Rotten Tomatoes with a startlingly low score, a new Blumhouse horror movie earns vastly superior reviews.\nThe Exorcist: Believer's Rotten Tomatoes score pales in comparison to its Blumhouse competition Totally Killer. Both movies are set to premiere on October 6, with The Exorcist: Believer, a legacy sequel about two possessed girls who must be helped by original Exorcist character Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), set to debut theatrically in wide release. Totally Killer, which follows a teenager (Kiernan Shipka) being transported back in time to 1987 and trying to save her mother's friends from a serial killer, will be released as a streaming exclusive on Prime Video.\nJust a few days before the official Exorcist: Believer release date, the possession movie debuted on Rotten Tomatoes with a startlingly low score of 26% at the time of writing. Totally Killer, which also has a new score on Rotten Tomatoes, completely blows the legacy sequel out of the water. Although both scores are due to fluctuate as more reviews are added over the weekend, the slasher comedy is currently more than 50% higher than the other title with a thoroughly Fresh score of 81%.\nWhile this sharp divide between the movies' Rotten Tomatoes scores is surprising, Blumhouse is nevertheless set to dominate the lead-up to Halloween this year. The Fresh score may help boost Totally Killer's profile this weekend for streaming audiences, but the low score for The Exorcist: Believer may not tarnish its ability to draw theatrical viewers. At the time of writing, the Exorcist: Believer box office is still projected to take in an opening weekend of a possible franchise-best $30-$35 million.\nWith these titles set to dominate both theatrical and at-home viewership during the first weekend in October, Blumhouse is kicking off what should prove to be a very fruitful Halloween season. Because Saw X opened slightly earlier on September 29, the month only has one other major wide release horror movie on the schedule. That would be the buzzy video game adaptation Five Nights at Freddy's, which is set to premiere on October 27.\nBecause Five Nights at Freddy's is also a Blumhouse production, it cements in the company's domination over the horror genre during its most important season. Even if the The Exorcist: Believer release comes in below expectations, horror-hungry audiences will have plenty of other Blumhouse options to choose from this month. The Totally Killer Rotten Tomatoes score is merely the cherry on top of what promises to be a robust period at the movies.\nSource: Rotten Tomatoes\n"}
{"title": "10 Coolest Iron Man Armors Tony Stark Built for Other Heroes", "date": "2023-10-04 22:31:41", "text": "Every one of Tony Stark's Iron Man suits are better than the last, and that extends to other heroes who have worn them. Here are the Top 10 coolest! \nIt’s no secret that Tony Stark has created some absolutely jaw-dropping pieces of tech throughout his Marvel Comics history, including and especially his legion of Iron Man suits. While fans have seen Stark donning pretty much every variation of Iron Man armor he’s crafted for himself, they’ve also seen the ones he’s made for other people, and those suits are equally awesome.\nTony Stark doesn’t have any superpowers aside from his inherent brilliance. This means that he relies on his increasingly impressive Iron Man suits to keep up with the likes of Captain Marvel, Thor, or the Hulk. This also means that Stark pretty much has a monopoly on such super-suits in the meta-sense, as they are Tony Stark's unique path towards super-heroism that becomes cheapened with every copy. Technically anyone who wears an Iron Man suit immediately gains all of Iron Man’s powers (minus the inherent intelligence, anyway), so it makes sense that Marvel Comics doesn’t give everyone who isn’t as strong as Captain Marvel or Thor an Iron Man suit. That being said, there have been a few occasions where Iron Man has shared his tech with those around him, and in such occasions, the results were phenomenal. Here are the Top 10 coolest Iron Man armors Tony Stark built for other heroes!\nJames “Rhodey” Rhodes is someone who’s been a significant part of Tony Stark’s life since his debut in Iron Man #118 by David Michelinie, Bob Layton, and John Byrne, even so far as taking up the Iron Man mantle in Iron Man #170. However, Rhodey wouldn’t become a hero in his own right until Avengers West Coast #94, which is when he made his official debut as War Machine. Designed by Tony Stark, the War Machine armor is incredibly reminiscent of the classic Iron Man suit (which Rhodey was familiar with), except it was decked-out with massive weapons and reinforced armor for extra security and power. This is the longest-lasting suit Tony made for another hero, and is easily one of the most significant.\nTony Stark made Black Widow an Iron Man suit on two separate occasions - in two separate universes. The first was in the Ultimate Universe, as shown in Ultimates 2 #4 by Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch. Tony Stark gifted Black Widow her own ‘Iron Maiden’ armor that was stylistically similar to his own, though fully blacked-out in color. Over in the prime Marvel Comics universe of Earth-616 (specifically in Avengers #28 by Jason Aaron and Ed McGuinness), Iron Man designs Black Widow a suit that’s more akin to War Machine armor, though a bit more sleek and with specialty designs that made it stand out as a Black Widow suit - and that armor was dubbed the War Widow.\nIn the Iron Cat series (by Jed MacKay and Père Perez), Tony Stark builds Felicia Hardy aka Black Cat her own Iron Cat armor. Visually, the armor looks more or less identical to Tony’s classic Iron Man design, with the addition of energy claws on the suit’s fingertips, a black mask-like design around the eyes, and cat ears that sit atop the armor’s helmet. This is the first suit on this list that didn’t grant someone with no superhuman powers all the abilities of Iron Man, but rather enhanced the preexisting superhuman abilities of the established hero. The Iron Cat complemented Black Cat’s aesthetic and powerset, while still looking and feeling like an Iron Man suit.\nBrian Braddock, or Captain Britain in Earth-616, was just a regular human in the universe in which he wore a version of the Mark 1 Iron Man suit as shown in What If? X-Men Age of Apocalypse #1 by Rick Remender and Dave Wilkins. In that alternate universe of Earth-93074, Braddock wears the original Iron Man suit, but rather than it being all gray, it is covered in the Union Jack. This armor was designed by the Tony Stark of this reality, but seemed more like repurposed armor than a specifically designed gift, though it was enough to make Braddock a formidable hero.\nWhile Luke Cage is probably the last person who would need the protection of a suit of armor given his powerset, he didn’t say ‘no’ to the offensive upgrades that came with his very own Iron Man suit. In fact, the style of the suit itself reflects that, as it is very minimal with only the necessary placements of armor on Cage’s body that offer superhuman enhancements, like gauntlets for energy blasts, boots for flight, and a helmet to navigate/pinpoint targets. This suit was featured in the Venomverse: War Stories #1 story “Force Majeure” by Aaron Covington and Khary Randolph, where Luke Cage used it to face off against Doctor Doom.\nIn Marvel Comics’ Empyre event by Al Ewing, Dan Slott, and Valerio Schiti, Tony Stark made Reed Richards his own Iron Man suit, complete with Mister Fantastic’s usual costume color scheme and the Fantastic Four insignia on the chest. This entry is especially entertaining, as Reed was very reluctant to wear one of Tony Stark’s suits, but was forced to in a last-ditch effort to save the world. This suit is a cool addition to Fantastic Four canon (as well as Reed Richards’ wardrobe).\nPerhaps the most iconic suit made but not worn by Tony Stark is the Iron Spider Armor, which was created specifically for Spider-Man and made its debut in The Amazing Spider-Man #529 by J. Michael Straczynski and Ron Garney. Similar to the suit made for Black Cat, the Iron Spider Armor complimented Spider-Man’s powers and enhanced them in creative and useful ways - including the extra mechanical arms. This suit not only enhanced Spider-Man’s powers and gave some variety to his many costumes, but it also was a standout aspect of the entire Civil War event.\nThis entry is the purest example of Tony building a suit of armor to protect someone he loves, rather than attack his enemies. Stark made the Rescue Armor specifically for Pepper Potts, who found the specialty suit in Invincible Iron Man #10 by Matt Fraction and Salvador Larroca. It was called the ‘Rescue Armor’ due to the fact that Rescue was Pepper’s superhero codename while wearing the suit. However, the undertones of Tony building the armor for Pepper in an attempt to ‘rescue’ her from the dangers of the world surrounding them is clearly present, making this suit especially significant.\nWhile Tony Stark is a master in developing his unique style of high-tech suit, he ventured into the realm of anime mechs for one storyline, as these suits were more akin to those featured in popular anime series like Vultron or Neon Genesis Evangelion. As shown in Avengers: Mech Strike by Jed MacKay and Carlos Magno, Iron Man developed gigantic mech-suits for every member of the Avengers, transforming Earth’s Mightiest Heroes into the world’s most technologically advanced protectors in truly epic (and undeniably awesome) fashion.\nSimilar to the above entry, this one shows Iron Man using his technological genius to create robotic Avengers. The difference, however, is that the so-called Iron Avengers are immeasurably darker than the Mech Strike Avengers. The Mech Strike Avengers were the core team each with their own fun, giant robot fighter that displayed their logo and costume. The Iron Avengers, however, was a sick attempt at replacing the Avengers with hollow suits of armor that pale in comparison to the originals. In Earth X #1 by Alex Ross, Jim Krueger, and John Paul Leon, the Avengers are dead, and Iron Man attempts to replace them with robots of his own design. This entry is admittedly less of a suit built for someone, and rather a legion of suits built to replace a whole team of 'someones', making the Iron Avengers the most extreme (and sick) example on this list.\nFrom giving his friends and allies an extra power-boost in battle and protecting the ones he loves with a personally-made suit of armor, to literally building an entire Avengers-level mech-squad, it’s easy to see how these are the Top 10 coolest Iron Man armors Tony Stark has built for other heroes.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

This article contains SPOILERS for Reptile (2023)!\nJudy putting Tom's hand in wax at the end of Reptile plays an important part in the thriller's conclusion, but the scene's inclusion is largely unexplained by the 2023 movie. In director Grant Singer's feature-film debut, a detective named Tom Nichols (Benicio del Toro) must work to track down a killer after a young real estate agent named Summer is killed. However, his investigation causes him to unravel all the truths he believes about his life and the institutions he's involved in.\nThis crime thriller – led by Benicio del Toro, Alicia Silverstone, and Justin Timberlake – was released in theaters on September 22 before arriving on Netflix to a mixed critical response. While Del Toro offers a compelling performance, Reptile is frustratingly uneven and much of its plot is confusing. One such perplexing scene in Reptile is when Judy dips Tom's hand in wax and then peels it off; however, there's both a health and symbolic reason for this action.\nRelated: Reptile Cast & Character Guide\nWhile it seems extremely random at first, there's a practical reason for Judy dipping Tom's hand in the wax at the end of Reptile. By this point in the movie, Tom's cut on his hand has healed, but he still feels the impact of this injury. However, paraffin wax therapy offers numerous health benefits that could help Tom's recovery. According to Healthline, paraffin wax baths can increase blood flow, decrease inflammation, relax the muscles, reduce muscle spasms, and lessen pain. By engaging in paraffin wax therapy, Tom hopes to experience less impairment due to his hand injury.\nRelated: Where Was Reptile Filmed? Thriller Movie's Filming Locations Explained\nTom Nichols deals with a hand injury that bothers him throughout Reptile, with this cut representing the physical and psychological toll that the investigation takes on the detective. However, by Reptile's ending, Tom wraps up the investigation and finds the killer, just as he wraps up his hand and prepares for recovery. Additionally, he copes with the inner turmoil of learning that the people he trusted act in corrupt and harmful ways. The wax scene combines the character's background with Reptile's title in order to send a powerful message about healing.\nSnakes, a type of reptile, shed their skin because the outer layer is old, worn, and doesn't fit anymore, which also helps rid them of harmful parasites. This biological process provides insight into the significance of the paraffin wax at the end of Reptile. After going through the investigation, Tom is worn and weathered due to the emotional turmoil. However, he has changed his relationships and beliefs, making him a different person internally. Tom metaphorically sheds his skin in Reptile by removing the wax layer and becoming a new person. Moreover, Judy's involvement proves that she recognizes his mental changes.\nSource: Healthline\nDani Kessel Odom (they/them) works as a Core Features Shift Writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "10 Best Crime Movies On Netflix", "date": "2023-10-04 22:51:42", "text": "Netflix has a strong selection of crime movies, including these fantastic films standing out as the best that the streamer offers in the category.\nWhile Netflix features a lot of crime movies in its library, only a number of them rank among the best that the streaming service has to offer. Many of the best movies of all time come from the crime genre, including classics like The Godfather and Goodfellas. The crime film genre has only grown over the years, and this has prompted heavy competition between streaming services to acquire the rights to classics and produce new hits in this area.\nNetflix has done a good job of balancing its volume of classic crime movies and its production of new films of this type, leading to a strong overall selection. While Netflix's catalog is in a state of constant change, its current roster of crime movies is excellent, which reflects the company's efforts to stay stocked up on this popular genre.\nRelated: 10 Best Mystery Movies On Netflix\nThe Irishman is one of the biggest Netflix originals ever, earning numerous accolades, including an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. Based on a true story, The Irishman is widely considered one of the greatest films of the 21st century so far and is among the greatest of all Martin Scorsese movies. Starring Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci, this mobster movie follows a truck driver who becomes a hitman for a prominent crime family. The Irishman combines an excellent cast of seasoned A-list actors with Scorsese's masterful directing to craft one of the finest mafia movies ever made.\nRelated: Al Pacino's Best Movies, Ranked\nDirected by and starring Clint Eastwood, The Mule is another fantastic crime movie currently streaming on Netflix. The Mule is based on a true story and features an engaging plot and poignant themes. Eastwood stars as Earl Stone, an elderly man who begins smuggling cocaine for a cartel after his horticulture business goes bankrupt. The movie received praise from critics and was a box office success, grossing around $175 million (via Box Office Mojo).\nDonnie Brasco is an American crime drama that follows an undercover FBI agent (Johnny Depp) as he attempts to infiltrate a prominent crime family in New York City during the '70s. The film is loosely based on the true story of Joseph Pistone, who went undercover using the titular alias, and it also stars Al Pacino as real-life mobster Lefty Ruggiero. This riveting story, which earned it an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, is complemented by expert directing from Mike Newell.\nRelated: Johnny Depp's Mob Movies Prove He Wasted Too Much Time On Jack Sparrow\nPublic Enemies explores the Great Depression crime wave and the birth of the FBI through the lens of notorious criminal John Dillinger (Johnny Depp). The movie follows the final years of Dillinger's criminal career while FBI agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) pursues the infamous bank robber. This gripping crime drama was praised by critics and was a success at the box office, grossing over $200 million worldwide (via Box Office Mojo). The performances and script are excellent, and its gritty cinematography puts Public Enemies firmly among Netflix's best crime movies.\nRelated: 10 Best War Movies On Netflix\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie serves as a sequel/epilogue to the iconic TV series Breaking Bad. The Netflix original film follows Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) after the conclusion of the show and features several other returning cast members, including Bryan Cranston. El Camino was widely praised by critics, and it received numerous award nominations for made-for-television movies. El Camino captures the gritty feel of Breaking Bad while telling a characteristically engaging story that makes it a worthy successor to the hit show.\nRelated: The Breaking Bad Episodes To Watch To Understand El Camino\nHeat is a trailblazing movie that follows the struggle between an LAPD detective (Al Pacino) and a successful career criminal (Robert De Niro) as they vie to outwit each other. It is highly regarded as one of the most influential crime movies of its age, giving way to a slew of similar works over the next couple of decades. Heat tells a riveting story which is complemented by outstanding directing by Michael Mann and strong performances from the cast, making it another strong option for Netflix streamers in search of a good crime movie.\nCatch Me If You Can stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks alongside an excellent supporting cast that includes Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, and James Brolin. Directed by Steven Spielberg, Catch Me If You Can tells the mostly true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio), who, according to his memoir, gathered millions of dollars through various cons. The veracity of Abagnale's claims has been widely challenged, but the story he tells is fascinating regardless. This is another Spielberg masterpiece, so it's worth a watch for Netflix subscribers.\nDespite its initial criticisms for being overly violent, Scarface is now considered one of the greatest gangster movies ever made. Scarface stars Al Pacino as Cuban immigrant Tony Montana as he rises to become one of the most powerful drug lords in Miami. Scarface is considered a cult classic, and its gritty portrayal of drug trafficking paved the way for more similarly graphic crime movies. This is one of the best movies on Netflix period, making it an easy inclusion on this list.\nThe Good Nurse tells the true story of serial killer Charles Cullen (Eddie Redmayne), who murdered a still-unknown number of people during his 16-year career as a nurse. The movie follows the case through the eyes of one of Cullen's coworkers, Amy Loughren (Jessica Chastain), who begins to suspect him after one of their shared patients dies mysteriously. This heart-pounding crime thriller keeps audiences on the edge of their seats, as Chastain and Redmayne's captivating performances steal the show.\nLéon The Professional is another fantastic crime film currently available on Netflix. Written and directed by Luc Besson, the movie follows Léon (Jean Reno), a hitman who takes charge of a 12-year-old girl (Natalie Portman in her film debut) after her family is murdered by a corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman). Critics praised the film, and it was a commercial success as well, with its worldwide box office gross nearly tripling its production budget (via The Numbers). This gritty, emotional film is defined by outstanding acting and a well-conceived script that make it one of the best crime movies of the '90s.\n"}
{"title": "90 Day: The Last Resort: Is Angela's Age Affecting Her? ( Maybe It's A Midlife Crisis)", "date": "2023-10-04 22:52:15", "text": "90 Day: The Last Resort's Angela Deem often runs hot or cold. She's moody, erratic, explosive, and possibly going through a midlife crisis. \n90 Day: The Last Resort star Angela Deem's erratic and out of control, and since she's now 57, her age may be changing her personality. Since she's one of the more mature 90DF franchise stars, the fact that Angela still lashes out like an angry child's surprising. Fame may have gone to her head, stalling her personal growth. Sometimes shockingly immature, Angela said onscreen that she finds it hard to express herself with words. Over the years, she's proven that's true. Once, in a fit of rage, she threw a strawberry shortcake at Michael Ilesanmi. She hasn't calmed down much since then.\nRight now, on 90 Day: The Last Resort season 1, Angela's in a good place with Michael, but based on their turbulent history, their happiness may not last. Onscreen, she just celebrated her third anniversary with Michael, albeit virtually. Even via video, Michael was able to excite his much-older partner. Just the sight of Michael makes her, \"cooter tingle.\" While there's nothing wrong with a mature woman having a libido, Angela's signature TMI's just another example of how she goes for shock value. Does she fear getting older and try to compensate with wild behavior? Or is she just enjoying her life?\nRelated: 90 Day Fiancé's Angela Deem Confirms If She Actually Loves Michael Ilesanmi\nAngela's known for reckless conduct, and that's a key indicator of a midlife crisis. On 90 Day: The Last Resort, she flirted with a resort worker while holding divorce papers in her hand. She knows she's acting up while the cameras roll, and that may provoke her to try and one-up herself. While that could explain certain histrionics, with or without 90 Day Fiancé's Michael Ilesanmi, some of it may be the byproduct of aging.\nAngela may not realize that a midlife crisis is driving her behavior... and pushing her to go way too far. Self-examination isn't exactly her strong suit, and that's why she's such an interesting addition to the 90 Day: The Last Resort cast. The show's about therapy, and the extrovert Angela prefers to act out, rather than looking within.\nAngela leaned into her \"wild woman\" persona long ago. On 90 Day: The Last Resort, she's trying to change. This attempt to \"soften\" her personality may not stick, and it may be a sign that she's currently confused about her identity. A person who's having a midlife crisis may find that their sense of self's shakier. They're changing due to aging, and may have trouble reconciling who they are now with who they were in the past.\nDoes Angie still want to be the wild woman? Or is she looking for personal growth that makes her a more serene person? Right now, she's waffling. It's possible that part of her is truly open to change. However, change is hard, especially for a reality celeb who might bore viewers if she calmed down too much. Angela's savvy enough to understand why people are watching. All she really needs to do is be herself without hurting anyone else. If she's authentic, but not getting into physical altercations, she can weather her midlife crisis without serious repercussions.\nIt's unrealistic to expect a lot of maturity from Angela, but sometimes, she's underestimated. She worked in palliative care, at a hospice. That's the kind of work that requires endless empathy and compassion. Also, she's there for her family through thick and thin. Since she does have a lot of different sides to her personality, it may be hard for her to balance her mature and more \"out there\" traits. As she gets older, it could get easier. Sometimes, people \"age out\" of certain things. That may happen to the Georgia peach from Hazlehurst.\nNot too long ago, Angela got into a brawl with a \"pal.\" They fought in a hotel elevator, and Angie seemed to be the aggressor. She gets angry too fast, and never stops to think. In her relationship with Michael, she's been aggressive too. Does irritability lead her to attack? She overreacts to things, and Angela's so easily triggered. While there are good reasons why she's been upset with Michael, as he's an admitted cheater, she chose to stay with him. If a person chooses to stay, they should try to honestly forgive. Angela holds grudges, and midlife irritability may make it even harder for her to hold back.\nShe didn't get cast in 90 Day: The Last Resort because she's a serene woman. She's there because she's a hothead and her marriage is hanging by a thread. While she seems to love Michael, if she's having a midlife crisis, it may be hard for her to keep things on an even keel, like they were in the last episode.\nAngela has talked to therapists on the show, so she's trying. She and Michael are currently happy, but the real issue may be more serious than a midlife crisis. The underlying problem is that Michael may not be sincere. Does he really love Angela? While he's putting on a good show during the 90DF spinoff, a cheater who has repeatedly betrayed his partner may not reform. He could pretend to be different for personal gain.\nFor reality TV show star Michael, there are benefits to staying with Angela. There's money in it, and clout too. Without Angela, where would he be? She suspected he was a scammer, and those doubts may have been something she could have paid more attention to. Instead, she wasted years on Michael. If he doesn't actually love her, it's all so pointless.\nTrying to make things work with Michael may exacerbate any midlife crisis symptoms she's having, and those efforts could ultimately be futile. A \"happy\" spinoff episode doesn't mean long-term happiness. It's quite likely that the problems she's had with Michael will resurface, and when they do, her coping skills may not be good as they are right now on 90 Day: The Last Resort. In the tropical locale, everything may seem solvable, but when the cameras stop filming, life can be very different. Michael and Angela are like oil and water, and making them mix requires enormous effort, which is unlikely to be worth it in the end.\n"}
{"title": "10 Space Movies That Experts Claim Are Wildly Inaccurate", "date": "2023-10-04 23:01:44", "text": "Although space movies transport viewers beyond Earth, experts have found that not every movie set in space is getting the science right.\nWith so many space stories out there, it's no surprise that experts have found that many science-fiction movies get real-life astronauts and the science of space wrong. Although space movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey are often praised for their stunning visuals, providing extremely accurate representations of space is not always prioritized. This may be frustrating for those who know better, but it's often done so that movies can focus on visuals or plot points instead.\nThat said, sometimes realism can help validate a film franchise's internal science. Keeping ideas rooted in reality — whether it's Newton's laws of motion or quantum mechanics — can add authenticity to a space movie. In turn, this can end up helping the plot. So, when real-life details are way off the mark, it can prove jarring for audiences. That's why experts have pointed out the scientific flaws in these space movies.\nIn a BuzzFeed video, astrophysicists Jason Rhodes and Alina Kiessling reviewed a scene from The Last Jedi during which an explosion occurs aboard a ship, sucking Princess Leia out of the hole the blast creates. The pair credited the film for successfully mimicking what would happen during an explosion like this — the exposure to space would pull back anyone and anything — but they noted that more people should have been sucked into the vacuum later on, when a door was opened nearby. Additionally, the experts confirmed that the frost forming on Leia's face was plausible but that her eyes functioning normally was unrealistic.\nRhodes and Kiessling also reviewed a scene from Guardians of the Galaxy, during which Peter Quill exits a spacecraft in order to save Gamora, who is floating in space. Peter removes his helmet and exposes his face, which Kiessling noted wasn't accurate. \"His eyes are still working; they would have frozen instantly,\" Kiessling said. Additionally, once Peter and Gamora are back in a pressurized space, they're immediately fine with no real side effects of their exposure to space. This could be attributed to Gamora's inhuman qualities and Peter's godly parentage, but the science behind this scene is inaccurate from a real-life standpoint. \nRelated: NASA Astronaut Explains What GOTG 3 Got Wrong About Star-Lord Almost Dying In Space\nTo add to this, astronaut Chris Hadfield shared in a 2023 Vanity Fair video discussing the second sequel that \"beyond about a minute and a half there's going to be stuff that happens to you that does permanent, irreversible, and deathly damage [when outside a spaceship without a space suit].\" He explained that because one would expel oxygen, they would essentially have blood with no oxygen. Once that blood reached the brain, they'd become unconscious.\nWhile Wall-E is a beloved and acclaimed movie from Disney and Pixar, it's not necessarily revered for its scientific accuracy. Discussing a scene where Wall-E and EVE are floating around in space, Kiessling explained, “There’s no atmosphere to carry the sound in space,” even though audiences can hear Wall-E and EVE speaking to each other and making noises. Additionally, Rhodes noted that while Wall-E pushing himself with a fire extinguisher is plausible, the precise direction and steering he exhibits while doing it is incorrect. According to Kiessling, “That level of control would not be possible.”\nWhile gunfights aren't the first thing most think of when it comes to astronauts and space, Total Recall is jam-packed with action that requires it. In a scene where Douglas Quaid shoots a firearm, he moves backwards. Rhodes explained that \"unless you are shooting the gun from exactly your center of gravity, instead of just moving in one direction, you would start to spin.\" So, while the scene showcases backward movement accurately as a result of the pressure released when firing, it doesn't account for the physics of shooting at the level of gravity Douglas finds himself in.\nAlthough guns are not unheard of in space, especially in fiction, the way they function is different there. Hadfield told Vanity Fair, \"Guns don't need oxygen to work. It's the exploding gas inside the confines of the rifle that make the projectile come out the end really fast.\" Because there's about one-sixth gravity on the moon, the bullet's fall is slower than on Earth, so it takes longer to hit its target. \"That means the bullet with the same speed horizontally would go further around the moon,\" said Hadfield. During a shootout in the film, however, the speed of the bullets seems to match that of bullets fired on Earth.\nRELATED: Why Passengers' Ending Was So Controversial\nThe same chase scene's shootout also uses diegetic sound to heighten the action, yet the lack of air on the moon makes it so that sound wouldn't carry like that. Additionally, astrophysicist Adam Frank shared in an NBCNews piece that the film's correlation between time, supposed low gravity, and space travel is incorrect, as Roy's three-month journey to Neptune requires constant movement. He explained this as follows:\n\"To get to Neptune that fast, the ship’s engines would have to be running the whole time, meaning Pitt would experience “gravity” because the acceleration produced by his rocket motors (what’s called thrust) would push his back into his chair (or his feet onto the floor).\"\nHadfield discussed how, for the sake of compelling storytelling, Passengers is inaccurate in its portrayal of centrifugal force and gravity. \"If you shut off the spinner [that simulates gravity for the spacecraft], it would continue to spin for quite a while,\" Hadfield said. That's mostly because there's \"nothing to slow the spin down.\" However, in Passengers, when the ship stops spinning instantly, everything starts floating due to zero gravity. Hadfield noted that to achieve this effect, the ship would actually need brakes of some sort.\nAurora swims when this happens, causing water to react to the lack of gravity. Hadfield went on to explain that water typically floats and naturally forms into a ball due to surface tension. While he applauded this aspect of the scene, he emphasized that the resolution is less likely. It would require a lot of force to get the ship spinning again in order to send the water back down once gravity was restored. However, in the movie, it's instantaneous and used to create tension when Aurora is finally able to resurface and take a big breath.\nRhodes and Kiessling agreed that there was little realism in Gravity in terms of science. For the movie to be accurate, Rhodes admitted that Sandra Bullock's Ryan Stone \"would've died in every scene.\" Hadfield echoed that sentiment in the Vanity Fair video as he analyzed the scene where astronauts are caught in an asteroid debris field while repairing the Hubble telescope. He mentioned that the movie's representation of astronauts is \"so different from the people who are actually exploring space,\" citing oddities like Matthew contacting Houston when Ryan is propelled into space, Ryan’s frantic uncertainty about what to do when there’s an issue, and their recreational trips outside their spacecraft.\nRelated: The 15 Best Movies About Being Lost In Space\nHadfield criticized the premise of Life, calling it \"farfetched\" and expressing that, despite Ryan Reynolds' consideration for weightlessness, there are numerous improbabilities. Hadfield said in the 2023 Vanity Fair video that one of three main crises on a spaceship or space station is a fire. So, when Reynolds' character fills up the spaceship with fire and no alarms go off, it's unrealistic. Additionally, the use of an oxygen candle, which has \"a certain chemical in it that if you heat up one end, the chemical reaction releases great amounts of oxygen,\" as a means to eradicate the alien on the ship is undermined by the destructive use of a flamethrower.\nWhile The Martian may be scientifically accurate in some ways, such as Mark Watney's resourcefulness with food, it does contain some dubious science. Hadfield explained that Mars' atmosphere is extremely thin, which is \"the worst part of the whole movie.\" So, in the scene when Mark is tossed around due to a storm, it's unlikely that the large debris pieces would be picked up, blown, or used to knock Mark over. Hadfield elaborated that, because of the thinner atmosphere, \"there'd be so few air molecules going by, that you'd hardly even feel them.\"\nMoreover, the film's mirroring of Earth's gravity with Mars' is also inaccurate. Hadfield shared that Mars' gravity is 38% of Earth's, meaning that \"[Mark would] only weigh one third as much as he does on Earth.\" This indicates that the solidity of Mark's movements and his physique throughout his isolation on Mars are too far from what traversing and living on Mars is actually like.\nHadfield pointed out some issues with First Man, which is a movie about real astronaut Neil Armstrong's life. Like a few other entries on this list, First Man misuses sound in space. When Neil, played by Ryan Gosling, flies an X-15 aircraft in the opening scene, the sound is particularly inaccurate as Neil undergoes a test flight. Hadfield said, \"It's sort of like he's in a pickup truck, driving across a field with this big whiny noise that tells you just how fast he's going all the time.\" He goes on to say this would not be heard in a cockpit and that the extreme vibration is exaggerated.\nWhile space movies often take creative liberties, especially ones that lean more into science-fiction territory, the ones rooted in already-established science can sometimes be a bit too far off from reality. Whether it's in favor of drama, visual scale, or action, it's clear that space movies shouldn't always be treated as the be-all and end-all of astronomy, astrophysics, or life in space. That said, slight deviations from scientific accuracy can still make for enjoyable viewing experiences.\nSource: BuzzFeedVideo, Vanity Fair, NBCNews, Vanity Fair\nWith a BA in screenwriting, film and TV, and media studies, Kelly has explored storytelling from academic and pop-culture perspectives.

And in an End of the Spider-Verse-related comic, The House of Ideas secretly killed off one of these hybrid heroes named Spider-Boy, only to turn around and repurpose his codename for a completely different superhero just recently introduced!\nCombining Ben Reilly’s Spider-Man and Connor Kent’s Superboy into Peter Ross aka Spider-Boy, this hero was one of the more visually appealing characters springing from 1996’s DC vs. Marvel comic event, as he perfectly blended Spidey’s more arachnid-focused outfit with Connor’s “bad boy” leather jacket design. Unfortunately for this version of Spider-Boy, Marvel decided he was better off dead, with the company not only brutally murdering him offscreen, but by the climax of the End of the Spider-Verse event, replacing him with another Spider-Boy, one that holds no ties to Marvel’s “Distinguished Competition.”\nRelated: Iron Man's Amalgam Armor Gave Him Green Lantern's Powers\nPermanently culling the jointly owned Spider-Boy in 2022’s Spider-Man #2, by Dan Slott and Mark Bagley, this issue acted as part two of the End of the Spider-Verse event and explained how the brutal spider-villain of Morlun traveled to another universe looking for a portal device that would allow him to traverse alternate realities more easily. Shown arriving in Loomworld holding the severed arm of a spider-person looking awfully similar to Spider-Boy’s leather-jacketed arm and spider-patterned glove, it’s heavily implied that Morlun killed this Spider-Man and used his device for his own means, effectively erasing a character from Marvel continuity that hasn’t been seen in almost 30 years.\nTossing the dismembered arm to the side now that the OG Spider-Boy’s usefulness had run its course, it’s here where Marvel’s secret elimination of this hero gives way to an all-new, all-different Spider-Boy named Bailey Briggs, adding further insult to injury as the character is officially introduced in the finale to the very story that offed his Amalgam counterpart in the first place. Making perfect sense to kill the first Spider-Boy as Marvel couldn’t feature him in full for this event nor any other comic story due to the understandably tricky legal issues with DC, Bailey inheriting the Spider-Boy moniker is an inspired choice that simultaneously dashes any lingering hopes of seeing the Ben Reilly/Connor Kent version of the character pop up in the Spider-Verse ever again.\nSo while it was already unlikely Marvel or DC would have utilized their shared characters again after the epic event that brought them together concluded, seeing the sneaky way Marvel did away with the Amalgam Universe’s Spider-Boy only to reintroduce the character as a Marvel-owned sidekick is not only a slick way to go about removing Spider-Boy from the overarching conversation, but also acts as the final “appearance” of this hybrid hero entirely. Marvel’s composite Spider-Boy is dead, and although he technically lives on, it’s unfortunately in name only.\nBrian is first and foremost a nerd in every way shape and form.

{"title": "10 Most Unnecessary Remakes Of Classic Movies", "date": "2023-10-04 23:10:45", "text": "While some movie remakes have been successful, others miss the target or add nothing new. And some films should never have received a remake at all.\nIn Hollywood, many remakes of classic movies have been released over the years, but there are a number of remakes that were unnecessary as they either didn't add anything new or didn't honor the source material. Some remakes can retell a classic story, some can add a new twist, and some can re-imagine the story differently from the original. The success of a remake depends on its similarities to the source material, its production, and its connection to both audiences and critics.\nSome movie remakes such as King Kong, A Star is Born, and West Side Story have been released to critical acclaim and regarded as a refreshing take on the original story. Other remakes miss their target and are a bitter disappointment. There are plenty of movie remakes out there that have been seen as entirely unnecessary and unneeded by anybody at all. Here are a few of them.\nReleased in 1980, Alan Parker's Fame centers on students attending New York's High School of Performing Arts, as they progress from their first day to graduation. The 1980 film received praise for its acting, music, and ability to portray the highs and lows of success in a relatable manner to audiences. The film won two Academy Awards for Best Original Song and Best Original Score and is still regarded as one of the best musical drama films of the 1980s.\nThe 2009 remake followed the same storyline of attending a performing arts school while using different characters but was regarded as shallow compared to the original film. It received criticism for its clichéd stories, lack of proper character development, and removing the serious and darker themes that were an essential part of the 1980 film. Critics and viewers alike agreed that this remake tried to take advantage of High School Musical's success and relate to a younger audience, but it lacked the soul and heart that made the original a hit.\nThere were high hopes for 2017's The Mummy; it was intended to be the first in Universal's Dark Universe based on their classic monsters of the 20th century. With Tom Cruise starring as Sergeant Nick Morton, the film sees an Ancient Egyptian queen being accidentally released from her tomb and causing havoc across present-day London. The Mummy is regarded as one of the most legendary monsters of all time, so there were hopes that the 2017 film would bring a new exciting take on the story.\nWhen the film was released, however, it failed at the box office and received a cold response from audiences. Critics felt the movie stripped away all the humor and fun that made the original 1999 trilogy a success. The original trilogy's star, Brendan Fraser, has stated that removing the fun is where the movie went wrong. Despite strong action sequences and an interesting take on the story, The Mummy couldn't connect with viewers, which led to Universal canceling the Dark Universe altogether.\nDirected by Herbert Ross, Footloose is a 1984 musical drama film that follows Kevin Bacon's teenager Ren, who moves to a small town where dancing is banned. With the help of new friends and his new crush Ariel, Ren fights to overturn the town's views on dancing and the right to express themselves through music. The original was a box-office success and is memorable for its popular soundtrack; it received more recognition in recent years thanks to its multiple references in the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise.\nParamount released a remake of Footloose in 2011, starring Julianne Hough and Kenny Wormald. Unlike other remakes, it wasn't a complete failure, receiving moderate reviews and performing decently at the box office. But critics agree that a remake of Footloose just wasn't needed in the modern era and it didn't have the same emotional impact on viewers as the original did.\nProduced by Steven Spielberg, 1982's Poltergeist looks at a suburban family whose home is haunted by a host of ghosts that abduct their youngest child. Thanks to its talented cast, relatable characters, and gripping story, the original Poltergeist delivers pure terror and suspense and is regarded as a horror classic. Heather O'Rourke's line \"They're here!\" is oft-quoted as one of the more memorable lines in the horror genre.\nMany horror movies have received a remake over the years, so it was no real surprise that Poltergeist would end up receiving one in 2015. However, many agree that the remake fell flat, relying too much on jump scares and adding nothing new or exciting to the story. Despite the cast giving their all, the Russo Bros' Poltergeist remakeis largely regarded as a pointless and unnecessary rehash of an already iconic horror film.\nLike Poltergeist, House of Wax is another remake of a classic horror film, the 1953 Andre DeToth film, which itself was a remake of 1933's Mystery of the Wax Museum. The 2005 film sees a group of friends stranded on their way to a football match, and they seek assistance at a wax museum. But they soon find themselves in a fight for survival and must try to escape before they find themselves becoming the wax museum's next exhibits.\nHouse of Wax tries to deliver a new twist to the original story, adding an amount of gore and slash that was not seen in the original two movies. Despite receiving some praise for its casting and new take on the original story, House of Wax was ultimately written off as being too bland and mundane. It certainly couldn't quite hold a candle to the terrors of the original films.\nThere have been many adaptations of Stephen King's works; his first novel, Carrie received its first film release in 1976. The original film, starring Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie, is regarded as one of the greatest horror films ever made. It has had a major influence on pop culture and is considered an inspiration for many horror films.\nRemaking an already iconic film is never easy, but director Kimberly Peirce brought Carrie into the 21st century with a 2013 remake. Chloe Grace Moretz and Julianne Moore did a decent job as Carrie and Margaret White, respectively, and the film tried to embrace a modern setting, but it was jarring that a few old bits of slang were still included in the remake. Ultimately, critics felt Carrie brought nothing new or thrilling to the original story, regarding it as a redundant version of the 1976 classic.\nPlanet of the Apes has seen many film adaptations thanks to its fascinating concept. Its most iconic adaptation is the 1968 sci-fi movie starring Charlton Heston as an astronaut who finds himself stranded on a planet that is inhabited by talking apes. It is considered a classic science fiction film with one of the best sci-fi twist endings ever.\nTim Burton decided to bring a modern take on the story with his 2001 remake. But despite stunning visuals and make-up designs, critics considered the remake a letdown, due to its confusing story, lackluster performances, and unpopular take on the iconic ending. It was such a failure that a sequel was shelved, and it would be another decade before the franchise was rebooted again, this time much more successfully.\nProbably one of the most infamous remakes of all time, The Wicker Man has become a movie that has achieved \"so bad, it's good\" status. Marketed as a horror movie, The Wicker Man has been regarded by critics and audiences as unintentionally funny thanks in part to Nicolas Cage's over-the-top acting and its poorly written script. The unintentional comedic aspect has allowed the movie to become a cult hit and a part of internet meme culture.\nIn contrast, the original 1973 film is considered a cinematic masterpiece. It was praised for its subtlety in its portrayal of horror with the beliefs of Christianity and paganism as well as stunning performances from Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee. The final scene of the movie is regarded as one of the most frightening moments in movie history; considered one of the greatest folk-horror films, the 1973 original stands tall against the abysmal 2006 remake.\nAlfred Hitchcock's Psycho is one of the most influential movies, regardless of genre. Starring Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, proprietor of Bates Hotel and sadistic murderer, Psycho is seen as one of the best psychological horror films and one that laid the blueprint for movies that came after. Psycho's iconic shower scene, where Janet Leigh's Marion Crane is murdered by Bates, left such a mark on visual style in filmmaking that it continues to influence certain shots in modern movies today.\nGus Van Sant's 1998 remake film is notorious for recreating the original as a shot-for-shot remake, copying Hitchcock's camera style and the original script. Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche were seen as greatly miscast in their roles as Norman Bates and Marion Crane, and critics despised the film for its lack of thrills and horror. Winning a Razzie award for Worst Remake, Van Sant's Psycho is a remake that nobody needed.\nRecreating a classic film is no easy task, but the remake of 1959's Ben-Hur was a critical and commercial disaster. Adapted from the novel by Lew Wallace, 1959's Ben-Hur sees Charlton Heston as the titular character, fighting against the Roman Empire and trying to restore honor to his family name. It is hailed as one of the best religious drama films ever made, thanks to its influential musical score, its talented cast, and its iconic chariot race scene. It won a record 11 Academy Awards in 1960 and is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time.\nThe remake failed to make any significant impact, being deemed a pointless endeavor by critics. With the 2016 Ben-Hur remake losing close to $120 million at the box office, audiences clearly felt the same. The CGI effects and modern edits couldn't hold up to the epic cinematography and production of director William Wyler's original film. A misguided and incompetent remake that pales in comparison to its predecessor, Ben-Hur is perhaps at the top of the list of the most unnecessary remakes of classic movies.\nEidhne Gallagher is a writer, creator and researcher  based in Ireland, the Land of Saints and Scholars.  A self-described bookworm, she lived her childhood with her head stuck in a book.

{"title": "A Million Miles Away True Story: What Really Happened To Astronaut José M. Hernández", "date": "2023-10-04 23:20:44", "text": "A Million Miles Away is a biopic based on the life of Astronaut Jose M. Hernandez. From cast to theme, here's how it compares to his real life. \nA Million Miles Away is a biopic based on the life of NASA Astronaut Jose M. Hernandez, and, as with any biopic, it's fair to wonder how closely it sticks to his true story. Directed by Alejandra Marquez Abella, the film is based on Hernandez's 2012 autobiography Reaching For The Stars: The Inspiring Story Of A Migrant Farm Worker Turned Astronaut. A Million Miles Away combines the collaborative efforts of NASA and Amazon Prime with the passion of the film's director. It stars Rosa Salazar as Jose's caring and devoted wife Adela and Michael Peña in the lead role of Jose.\nA Million Miles Away depicts one man's relentless pursuit to make his dreams come true, a concept many can relate to. The film has received a co-sign from the NASA astronaut himself, who has gone on record to praise how \"masterful\" of a job the film's portrayal of his life is. Although the film checks off boxes for style and tone, Abella was allowed some room for poetic reinvention. Here's how the film compares to the real-life story of Jose M. Hernandez.\nJose M. Hernandez was born on August 7, 1962. He was born in French Camp, California (although he considers Stockton, California his hometown) to a family of migrant farmworkers from Mexico. According to an interview with ABC News, Hernandez knew as young as 10 years old that he wanted to fly out to space. After seeing astronaut Gene Cernan grace the moon during the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, he was inspired to be among the stars.\nJose's dreams took him all the way from the fields of California to the halls of the University of California Santa Barbara, where he earned his Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. In 2001, he began his career with NASA when he joined the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. By 2004, he was accepted into NASA's highly competitive astronaut program after reportedly being rejected 11 times. In August 2009, he embarked on a 14-day mission to the International Space Station on the STS-128 and made history as the first migrant farm worker to travel to space.\nSince retiring from his career at NASA in 2011, Hernandez has become a multi-hyphenated success as a philanthropist, author, and CEO of his own engineering company. When he's not promoting the advancements of Tierra Luna Engineering, he can often be found performing outreach for underrepresented youth, encouraging their dreams of pursuing careers in STEM, and exposing them to the fascinating world of space exploration.\nA Million Miles Away chronicles Jose's journey from migrant worker to NASA astronaut. The movie includes major key moments in Hernandez's life, touching on both advancements in his career to his home life in California. Although A Million Miles Away focuses on Hernandez's story, it also highlights integral players and components of his life that helped him become the successful man he is today.\nA Million Miles Away doesn't just showcase Jose's roots as a means to an end, it plays up how Hernandez's background as a Mexican-American farmer influences his career in science, equipping him with the necessary tools he needed to thrive. The film not only depicts a groundbreaking tale, it also glorifies the discipline, persistence, and support he needed to take his life from farm to space.\nA Million Miles Away checks off boxes for style, tone, and attention to detail. It manages to sneak in moments both big and small from real conversations with family members to the moment he gets accepted into NASA. This realistic depiction of success demonstrates how small fragmented moments all play a major role in the outcome of someone's success.\nThe inclusion of moments like his first day of work at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where a receptionist mistakes him for a janitor, is a testament to the kind of roadblocks Hernandez faced as a man trying to achieve the seemingly impossible. In the same interview with ABC, Hernandez admits that he had moments of self-doubt where he questioned whether he was worthy of the opportunities he'd been given. He also suspected that his background as a migrant worker may have been held against him in some capacity.\nHowever, his persistence and unwavering support from his loved ones helped him get to new heights, and in the film, this is especially apparent. Hernandez's network of real supporters is highlighted in A Million Miles Away. From his parents (who reportedly gave up their dreams of being homeowners to help support Hernandez) to his second-grade teacher Ms. Young (who allegedly encouraged his parents to settle in one place), the film features references to real tender moments that shaped the trajectory for Jose and his family. With the help of NASA's clearance, A Million Miles Away was able to secure real-life footage, locations, and technical expertise.\nTo take it a step further, the film's portrayal of Mexican-American culture has made it a hit among the Latino community, something that gives director Alejandra Marquez Abella pride. The film is praised for its authentic portrayal of the Latino community all across the board. A Million Miles Away features Mexican food, music, and celebrations that help capture the essence of the Mexican-American lifestyle. Additionally, the film portrays the strong sense of interconnectedness among family and community that is a driving force in the Latino community.\nAs heartfelt and authentic as the movie is, it does leave out a few details. This tends to happen when someone condenses an entire life into a two-hour film. Although a reference to Hernandez's career at The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory makes it into the film, it neglects to touch on one of his most vital career milestones.\nWhile employed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Hernandez contributed to the creation of a tool that broke ground in cancer screening and imagery. He was the co-creator of the first full-field digital mammography system that detects early signs of breast cancer. Although he reportedly wishes this groundbreaking moment in his career would've made the cut in A Million Miles Away, Hernandez is still fully supportive of the biopic. In essence, while a few things were left out or tweaked, the biopic is about as close to Hernandez' real story as possible.\nSource: ABC News\nIG: @kysheeta_c\n\nKaillaby is a writer from NYC with a passion for anime, movies, and all things pop culture.

Produced by Walt Disney Pictures and released in 1993, Cool Runnings was based on the true story of the first Jamaican national bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Olympics. The sports comedy starred the late John Candy as the former Olympian Irving Blitzer who coaches the four-man bobsleigh team, which includes Derice Bannock (Leon Robinson), Junior Bevil (Rawle D Lewis), Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), and Sanka Coffie (Doug E Doug).\nIn a new interview with The Independent for the film's 30th anniversary, Turteltaub and the Cool Runnings cast opened up about the controversy regarding the characters’ Jamaican accents. The actor credited as Leon says that Disney wanted him to \"sound like a black Aladdin.\" It was also suggested to Turteltaub that the cast sound like Sebastian the Crab, a Disney character with a Trinidadian accent. Read what the cast and director shared below:\nLewis: I saw it morph into the movie that it is now. It was something that had never been told before – Jamaicans in tights? People were like, \"How’s this going to go under the Disney umbrella?\"\nLeon: They wanted me to sound like a black Aladdin. They wanted a Disney version. It was tough because if anybody wants to be authentic, it’s me — but I’m a professional and I had to do the job.\nYoba: They’d say, \"People in Middle America won’t be able to understand you.\" At that time, people had less access to cultural differences and didn’t know how Jamaican really sounded.\nTurteltaub: The next day, I told the cast, \"I’m going to get fired if you don’t sound like Sebastian the Crab. Please don’t get me fired.\" We joked about it but they got it. They understood. \"We’re not going to do Sebastian the Crab but we’re going to make an Americanized version of the movie that people around the world can understand.\" Times have changed a lot in 30 years. There’s zero chance I’d get this job – and I probably shouldn’t get it. I’m on the side of the people who say I shouldn’t have directed this and yet we ended up with a pretty great movie. It’s tricky.\nBefore Turteltaub took over the movie, Brian Gibson was attached to direct a more serious take on Cool Runnings. Once Disney took over the film, they removed all references to sex and drugs and turned it into a family-friendly film. This creative shift caused Gibson to drop out and in turn, Turteltaub was hired, though he had several battles with then-Disney boss Jeffrey Katzenberg, who worried that the characters' Jamaican accents would be difficult to understand. From that point on, this became a point of constant contention.\nRelated: The 90 Best Movies On Disney+ (October 2023)\nKatzenberg and company wanted a more Disneyfied version of the characters' Jamaican accents, a \"black Aladdin,” as Leon says. However, the cast wanted to present a more authentic Jamaican cadence. Katzenberg threatened to fire Turteltaub if he couldn't understand the characters' accents, so the cast agreed to \"make an Americanised version of the movie that people around the world can understand.\" While Cool Runnings would go on to become a beloved feel-good classic, it was criticized for perpetuating caricatures rather than authentic representations of the Jamaican dialect.\nSource: The Independent\n"}
{"title": "8 Witcher Book Moments That Will Help Liam Hemsworth’s Geralt Win You Over", "date": "2023-10-04 23:31:44", "text": "Liam Hemsworth has big shoes to fill as he steps in as Geralt of Rivia in The Witcher, but these 8 book moments can allow him to win fans over.\nLiam Hemsworth has big shoes to fill as he prepares to take over the lead role of Geralt of Rivia in Netflix's The Witcher, but there are eight big moments from the books that can help Hemsworth win over The Witcher's fans. Henry Cavill played Geralt in the first three seasons of The Witcher, inhabiting the role with a natural ease that made him the main attraction of this Netflix original. However, Cavill grew fed up with the show's controversial creative decisions, finally abandoning the show and leading Netflix to replace him with Liam Hemsworth.\nTaking over for Cavill will be no easy task, and The Witcher seems to have already lost a big chunk of its viewership with Cavill's departure, but Hemsworth is an accomplished actor with as good a chance as anyone of revitalizing this struggling franchise. He will have to do his best to replicate the things that Cavill did well, but he needs to put his own spin on the character as well. These eight big moments from the books will give Hemsworth the chance he needs to ingratiate himself with fans and leave his mark on the franchise.\nRelated: 10 Most Important Characters Introduced In Witcher Season 3 (& How They Set Up Season 4)\nOne of the most important parts of Hemsworth's role in replacing Henry Cavill will be how well he handles the action sequences. Geralt's fight with the half-elf, Schirrú, represents a good early opportunity for Hemsworth to show that he is up to the task. Shirrú is one of Vilgefortz's (Mahesh Jadu) hired assassins sent to kill Geralt after Yennefer (Anya Chalotra) reveals his location under torture. If The Witcher season 4 can save the show, this fight against Shirrú can play a big part in that. It may end up being brief, but it's one of the earliest book moments for Hemsworth to demonstrate his swordsmanship in.\nIn The Witcher novels, Cahir (Eamon Farren) begins shadowing Geralt's group after Emperor Emhyr (Bart Edwards) order his execution for failing to capture Ciri (Freya Allan). Geralt saves his life when they stumble onto him in the woods, but he refuses Cahir's help in the search for Ciri. Eventually, after the two are stranded together following Cahir's injury from Schirrú, Geralt accepts Cahir's help and his honest intentions concerning Ciri. This is a heartwarming moment in the books that could provide a good way for Hemsworth to display emotion and compassion, and possibly, ingratiate himself to fans.\nThe Witcher season 3's Cahir twist seems to have started this process early, so it's possible that Geralt's acceptance of Cahir will come earlier than it does in the books. That might be a good thing though since it is a valuable opportunity for Hemsworth to display his emotional range as an actor. This is also a significant moment in the story because, for a time, Geralt wants to refuse everyone's help in the search for Ciri, so the fact that he is willing to accept help here represents a big moment of personal growth for The Witcher's main character.\nGeralt being knighted by Queen Meve (Rebecca Hanssen) of Lyria and Rivia after the Battle for the Bridge is a big moment because it gives Geralt a right to use the title, \"Of Rivia\", which until this moment, he had simply used to make him sound more trustworthy. This is another great opportunity for Hemsworth to show off his acting range as he tries to capture Geralt's mixture of bemusement and pride at being knighted. Geralt has always been scornful of knights up to this moment, but he feels some sort of honor in being recognized by a monarch, leading to an emotionally nuanced moment for Hemsworth to execute.\nThe Battle for the Bridge is an epic confrontation in which Liam Hemsworth's Geralt can show why he is one of the characters who could beat Vilgefortz in the future. Geralt and his company end up getting entangled in this fight when the ferry they are traveling on is trapped between a Nilfgaardian army and an army of Lyrian and Rivian resistance. This conflict comes to a head when Geralt and his friends are forced to depart their ferry and choose a side or risk being killed in the crossfire.\nNaturally, they choose not to fight with the Nilfgaardians, instead choosing to aid the Lyrians and Rivians in their attempt to gain control of a critical bridge that crosses the mighty Yaruga River. Geralt fights with uncontrolled rage, running along the edge of the bridge and cutting down anyone in range. Geralt turns the tide of this battle almost single-handedly, as the close quarters on the bridge force the Nilfgaardians to challenge him one at a time, leaving them with no chance of defeating the magically mutated witcher. Hemsworth can use this moment to prove his swordsmanship is worthy of succeeding Cavill.\nGeralt's final confrontation with Vilgefortz is one of the most epic moments in the entire Witcher book series. This is an absolutely critical moment for Hemsworth's Geralt to nail, but if he does, he can change the narrative around his replacement of Henry Cavill. Geralt fights Vilgefortz for the second time with the help of a protective amulet he receives from Fringilla Vigo (Mimi Ndiweni). The duel happens in Stygga Castle after Geralt overhears that Vilgefortz is hiding out there. This is the biggest opportunity for Hemsworth to prove his worth in the role of Geralt of Rivia.\nRelated: This Witcher Book Character Will Fix The Show's Villain Problem In Season 4\nGeralt will eventually befriend a highly intelligent higher vampire named Regis, whom Geralt has lots of interesting philosophical discussions with. These conversations can allow Hemsworth to display the intelligent side of Geralt that loves to debate intellectual topics. This side of the character has largely been absent from Netflix's adaptation of the series, but Hemsworth can bring this side of Geralt into the show and improve the character as a whole while potentially winning over fans in the process.\nAnother moment with Geralt and Regis that Hemsworth can take advantage of to win over fans is their rescue of an innocent woman being accused of witchcraft. Geralt and Regis manage to outwit the man trying to have her executed, ultimately using Regis' vampire abilities to complete a trial that is invented to be impossible. This is the type of noble deed that makes fans like Geralt in the first place, so Hemsworth needs to take advantage of it and win over fans by showing his ability to portray Geralt's altruistic side.\nOne of the final opportunities Hemsworth will have to win over Witcher fans will be in the Rivian pogrom that takes place at the end of The Lady of the Lake. Geralt nearly dies trying to protect his dwarven friends from the rioting humans, proving again that he is a caring friend who is willing to die for others. Hemsworth needs to depict Geralt's desperation in the face a charging mob without losing his characteristic bravery. This will be a final moment of desperate altruism as Geralt does his best to defend his friends and stop the killing.\n"}
{"title": "1 Far Side Comic Is Hiding a Surprisingly Dark Joke About Charlie Brown", "date": "2023-10-04 23:31:44", "text": "One Far Side strip imagined a universe where all the newspaper comic strips are real - and Charlie Brown has a much darker side than anyone realized.\nGary Larson's The Far Side was a longtime hit in the newspapers – and one installment of the strip suggested it kept its place there through underhanded means. The comic employed dark humor and morbid surrealism over the course of its original 16-year run, and wasn't afraid to tease its neighbors in the funny pages.\nThe \"Far Side's Spy Center\" strip is on the surface a seemingly lighthearted bit, a wall of television screens depicting other cartoon characters, being watched by Far Side regulars: two stereotypical Larson-style humans, a snake, and a cow.\nIt is only as the reader takes a closer look at the TV screens that this Far Side panel reveals its darkest joke: Charlie Brown, threatening to put down Snoopy.\nRelated: Far Side's Most Confusing Comic Has an Incredibly Simple Explanation\nAll the references in this Far Side strip can be hard to catch, but eagle-eyed readers can depict references including Bloom County's Opus realizing he's being watched, and Hobbes about to attack Calvin. Gary Larson himself is apparently under observation as well, appearing in the top right-hand corner of the frame. In the center of the frame, however, good ol' Charlie Brown is threatening to have Snoopy put down. It is a particularly dark joke, which works because it is the diametric opposite of Charles Schulz's Peanuts. The Far Side, no stranger to controversy, made several Peanuts references throughout its run, in typical dark, and bizarre Far Side fashion.\nAnother stand-out Peanuts reference in The Far Side, similarly a dark reference to Snoopy's demise, plays on his iconic \"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\" stories. A fighter pilot stands next to his plane, with his kills painted on the side – including the silhouette of a familiar scarf-wearing dog, on top of a familiar dog house. Additionally, Peanuts character, Lucy Van Pelt, was the subject of her own Far Side joke, this one featuring a group of anthropologists instead come across ancient art, depicting Lucy as drawn by Charles Schulz. At the time of its printing, Peanuts had been running for about 30 years, making this an off-brand homage to the comic's longevity.\nGary Larson often used parody in The Far Side, and it is clear that his references to Peanuts and other comic strips resulted from a love of the medium; being lampooned in a Far Side strip was an honor, not an insult. \"Far Side's Spy Center\" is one of Larson's most visually ambitious strips, as he often favored minimalism in his cartoons. Here, the caption is minimalized, but the references to other comic strips speak volumes, both about Larson's own humor, and what he thought of the humor of his contemporaries. Charles Schulz was without a doubt a major influence on Larson's The Far Side, who in turn paid homage in his own particular style.\nAs far back as she can remember, Casey Connor always wanted to be a Goodfeather writer.

Prime Video, specifically, has a massive selection of action flicks, but not all of them can live up to the standards of its best 10.\nSome of Prime Video's best current movies come from the action genre, though to be fair, some of its worst probably come from the action genre as well. It's particularly easy in action movies to focus solely on spectacle and let the narrative and acting go by the wayside, which leads to some really poor flicks. Luckily, Prime Video is well stocked with movies that manage to avoid that mistake, especially in the case of these 10 outstanding action movies.\nRelated: 10 Best Crime Movies On Netflix\nTop Gun: Maverick is one of the six movies to make $1 billion at the box office since 2020, proving that this sequel film is well worth a watch. Top Gun: Maverick was acclaimed by critics who called it a big step from the first film and praised its striking visuals and audio. The film is probably one of Tom Cruise's best, and the addition of Myles Teller only adds to the quality of the cast. Top Gun: Maverick was tellingly nominated for six Academy Awards, proving that the production of this movie is of the highest quality.\nGuy Ritchie's The Covenant stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim, telling the story of a US Army Green Beret sergeant named John Kinley (Gyllenhaal) and his Afghan interpreter, Ahmed (Salim). Kinley and Ahmed are ambushed by Taliban forces during the War in Afghanistan, starting the film off on an action-packed note. The Covenant received positive reviews from critics and did fairly well at the box office during its limited theatrical release. This is easily one of the best action movies currently on Prime Video, especially for fans of military films.\nAlthough Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves bombed at the box office, it's still a great action movie that's available to stream on Prime Video. Honor Among Thieves received positive reviews from critics despite its poor box office performance, and now that it's on Prime Video, the film's streaming numbers can help recover what was lost at the box office. This film has a lovable blend of humor and dramatic storytelling, interspersed with engaging action sequences and memorable characters, making it well worth a watch for Prime Video subscribers.\nThe Batman, starring Robert Pattinson as the title character, is another worthy addition in the long line of Batman movies. This riveting action filmed was widely acclaimed by critics and performed strongly at the box office, bringing in around $770 million worldwide. The Batman is driven by strong performances from the cast and expertly crafted visuals. The film's dark camera lenses give it an ominous feel that contributes to the film's dark overall feel. The Batman is perfect for superhero fans, and a quality movie for any general action movie fan as well.\nRelated: 10 Best TV Shows on Amazon Prime Right Now\nThe Bourne Identity, the first film in Matt Damon's Bourne trilogy, is one of the best action movies Prime Video carries. This pulse-pounding film takes the audience through a wild, action-packed mystery as an amnesiac Jason Bourne searches for the clues to his identity. Damon's performance complements a fantastic script and a perfect pace that drives interest in the plot without missing out on spectacular action sequences. Prime Video carries the entire Bourne catalog, so those who prefer other movies in this iconic series have those available as well.\nSnowpiercer, starring Chris Evans, released in 2013 to widely spread positive reviews from critics. This Korean-made film follows the passengers of a train that encircles the Earth after a failed attempt at stopping global warming plunged the Earth into a new ice age. The Snowpiercer's passengers are the last remnants of humanity, and after gathering on the train, upper and lower classes emerge, creating tension between the front and back of the train. This riveting film is loaded with eye-popping visuals and powerful performances, making it one of the best action movies on Prime Video.\nSkyfall is easily one of the best James Bond movies, and one of the best action movies available on Prime Video. The performances of Daniel Craig as Bond and Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva carry this riveting film as Bond races against time to stop Silva before he can tear down MI6. Skyfall is packed with incredible visuals as well, and it's generally positive reviews from critics praised the film's expertly choreographed action sequences. This is a strong option for Prime Video subscriber looking for an exciting action flick.\nV for Vendetta is a thought-provoking action film that follows an anarchist's attempts to spark revolution within a totalitarian version of Great Britain. Starring Hugo Weaving, this film was generally well-received by critics and performed strongly at the box office. V for Vendetta's complicated themes are executed brilliantly and the pacing keeps audiences on their toes. This is a fantastically well-considered action movie with much more substance than many other films in this genre.\nSicario, directed by Dennis Villeneuve, is fantastic action thriller that was nominated for three Academy Awards, proving the high quality of its production and directing. Sicario also benefits from some great performances from Emily Blunt, Benecio del Toro, and Josh Brolin. The film follows an FBI agent's attempts to bring down a dangerous Mexican cartel. Sicario's visuals and audio are of the highest quality, and when combined with its strong script and great performances, the result is an action movie well worth streaming on Prime Video.\nThe Lost City uses a fantastic blend of comedy and action to produce a high-quality film that elevates Prime Video's action movie selection. With a star-studded cast that includes Channing Tatum, Sandra Bullock, Brad Pitt, Daniel Radcliffe, and Da'Vine Joy Randolph, The Lost City follows Bullock's mousy romance novelist character. Her life is upended when she is enlisted by a billionaire to seek out a treasure she once wrote about.

{"title": "In Transformers' New Continuity, The Decepticons Won", "date": "2023-10-05 00:00:47", "text": "The recently-released Void Rivals #4 has revealed that the Decepticons are in control of Cybertron, and the ramifications will be massive.\nWarning: Contains SPOILERS for Void Rivals #4!\nSkybound’s new Transformers series is set to debut in October 2023, but the publisher has already revealed that Optimus Prime’s Autobots will have their backs to the wall in the Energon Universe. Appearing in Void Rivals #4, the Decepticon Shockwave is left in control of Cybertron, suggesting that the Decepticons won the Cybertronian war millennia ago.\nSkybound shocked the world when they revealed they had acquired the Transformers license with the surprise appearance of Jetfire in Void Rivals #1, and now they’ve provided a shock of a different kind with the latest Transformer to appear in the Energon Universe. The appearance of Shockwave in Void Rivals #4 by Robert Kirkman, Lorenzo de Felici, Matheus Lopes and Rus Wooten is a major revelation, not least because the Decepticon warrior’s appearance confirms that the Decepticons have won the war.\nShockwave appears on Cybertron as a Skuxxoid bounty hunter attempts to sell off a bounty to the Decepticons. Shockwave turns the Skuxxoid away, saying they don’t have the resources on Cybertron to keep themselves running full-time, let alone to pay for any bounties.\nThe Decepticons ruling Cybertron following some failure on the part of Optimus Prime is something that’s been hinted at since the Energon Universe was first announced, so getting confirmation of that story point is a huge reveal and should amp up the stakes for the coming Transformers series by writer/artist Daniel Warren Johnson and colorist Mike Spicer. The set-up is reminiscent of the original G1 Transformers cartoon, which features a band of Autobots and Decepticons stranded on Earth following the great Cybertronian war.\nAt that point, Shockwave was left in control of the remaining Decepticons on Cybertron while Megatron followed after Optimus Prime to search the universe for more Energon. It further hammers home how Skybound is pulling heavily from Transformers’ G1 era, and it’s not a bad direction for the franchise to take. Having Optimus Prime and his Autobots reeling from losing the Cybertronian war makes for a great starting point for the new series, as they now must overcome insurmountable odds by standing up to the triumphant Decepticons once more.\nWhere the Energon Universe era goes from here is anyone’s guess, but Skybound has certainly given fans plenty to be excited about. By aligning fellow Hasbro property G.I. Joe more closely to the world of the Transformers than ever before, the creators have found a way to relaunch both properties in a way that’s generated unprecedented levels of excitement for both franchises.\nVoid Rivals #4 is on sale now, and Transformers #1 is on sale October 4th, both from Skybound Entertainment.\n"}
{"title": "Drew Barrymore Show Writers Decline To Return After Strike Ends", "date": "2023-10-05 00:37:51", "text": "The Drew Barrymore Show's WGA writers have turned down offers to return after the show nearly resumed without them during the WGA strike.\nThe Drew Barrymore Show writers Chelsea White, Cristina Kinon, and Liz Koe will not be returning to the talk show. During the Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike, The Drew Barrymore Show came under fire for deciding to resume production without its WGA writers. Following extensive criticism and backlash, Barrymore made the decision to not resume the show until the strike ended, only for it to conclude a week later.\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, White, Kinon, and Koe turned down an offer to return to the show, which is slated to return on October 16 for season 4. The Drew Barrymore Show is now interviewing and seeking new writers under the new WGA guidelines.\nWhite, Kinon, and Koe choosing not to return to The Drew Barrymore Show marks the beginning of a change in Hollywood following the end of the WGA strike. With the WGA holding out for 148 days, the writers stood firm until they received a new deal that guaranteed fair pay, better working conditions, and restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence. Even though the strike has ended, the WGA and its members are continuing to fight for what they deserve.\nRelated: Writers' Strike Deal Explained: 8 Biggest Points & Agreements Confirmed\nWhen the talk show planned to return without its WGA writers, it sent a clear message that the writers' work was not valued. They understandably do not want to return to a production that does not fully value them or their work. White, Kinon, and Koe are setting a powerful example, showing that television and film writers do not need to settle, and they deserve productions that value them. The new WGA guidelines that they fought for tirelessly over the course of 148 days not only offers protections and better compensation, but has also set a new precedent across the industry.\nWhen the SAG-AFTRA strike ultimately ends, there will likely also be a shift among actors, with there being less tolerance in the industry for productions where the work of writers and actors are not fairly valued. As for The Drew Barrymore Show, the talk show is unlikely to have a smooth return given their initial decision to return without their WGA writers. Drew Barrymore couldn't have known when the strike would end, but the decision to resume during the WGA strike feels even more unwise and short-sighted given how soon the strike ended after the initial announcement.\nSource: THR\n"}

A Joker playing card was shown hanging taped to a locker. Pickle continued, \"But, now that I'm here, this wild boy's planning on winning it.

The streaming platform has a large library of films, both new and old, and many of them chronicle blossoming relationships and rekindled romances. Whether they're modern classics or newer releases, these movies are sure to evoke some major emotions. As for which feelings they'll conjure, it depends on the type of romance film in question.\nAmazon's got something for everyone, whether it's an entertaining rom-com, like The Wedding Singer, or a more dramatic tale of love, like Chemical Hearts. The streamer's offerings run the gamut, showcasing a variety of different relationships. Some will have viewers cheering the main characters on, while others will leave them with tears running down heir cheeks. If one thing's certain, it's that all of these romance movies will hook the Prime Video subscriber watching them from start to finish.\nRELATED: 10 Of The Most Romantic Movies Ever Made, According To Reddit\nBased on Casey McQuiston's best-selling book of the same name, Red, White & Royal Blue is a newer addition to Amazon's lineup of romance movies. The Prime Video exclusive follows Alex Claremont-Diaz (Taylor Zakhar Perez), the son of the current U.S. president, and Prince Henry (Nicholas Galitzine) of Britain as they begin a secret romance. The politics of their relationship force them to keep things under wraps, but that proves much easier said than done. When their roles threaten to tear them apart, Alex and Henry must choose between people's expectations and each other. Despite all the high-stakes drama, Red, White & Royal Blue is a breezy and fun romance.\nAnother movie based on a best-selling romance novel — this time from author Sally Thorne — The Hating Game is currently available to rent or purchase on Prime Video. And it's well worth the investment. Following corporate rivals Lucy Hutton (Lucy Hale) and Joshua Templeton (Austin Stowell), The Hating Game is the perfect watch for anyone who enjoys a good hate-to-love relationship. As two assistants at the same publishing company, Lucy and Joshua are constantly attempting to outdo one another. However, their intense office rivalry evolves into a steamy attraction. It's one that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats for the movie's full runtime.\nDirected by Eugene Ashe, the 2020 romance movie Sylvie's Love is among the most compelling currently streaming on Prime Video — and it's the perfect option for anyone who enjoys a good period piece. Opening in 1950s Harlem, the film follows the titular Sylvie (Tessa Thompson) as she falls for a saxophone player named Robert Halloway (Nnamdi Asomugha). The pair embark on a whirldwind romance that will sweep viewers up with it. Even after the pair separates for years, their feelings remain strong as ever. This second-chance romance is bound to tug on viewers heartstrings, especially with the standout performances from Thompson and Asomugha.\nRELATED: 10 Films To Watch If You Liked Prime Video's Sylvie's Love\n2022's Bros is another LGBTQ+ romance movie streaming on Prime Video, and Bros truly deserves to be a hit despite its box office flop. Directed by Nicholas Stoller, the movie follows Bobby (Billy Eichner) and Aaron (Luke Macfarlane) as they reluctantly develop feelings for one another — a development that threatens their beloved \"freedom.\" So begins a comical narrative that sees them dealing with their commitment issues, all while an eclectic soundtrack plays and numerous A-listers cameo. Bros is an all-around fun time, and its ending is equal parts realistic and satisfying.\nThose looking for more of Lili Reinhart after Riverdale's series finale should check out Chemical Hearts on Prime Video — though no one should go into this particular romance movie looking for a cookie-cutter happy ending. The film sees Reinhart starring opposite Austin Abrams. The two play Grace Town and Henry Page, and their teenage characters fall head over heels for one another. Unfortunately, like most high school romances, things don't play out as expected. Chemical Hearts showcases stellar performances from both its leads, along with a number of scenes that will leave viewers misty-eyed before the movie is through.\nThose looking for a more fantastical story can relive the hype of 2008's Twilight, a supernatural romance based on Stephenie Meyer's book of the same name. Most people have heard of Twilight by now, but the film follows vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) as he develops feelings for the new girl in town, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart). Cheesy and occasionally funny without meaning to be, Twilight is by no means a masterpiece within the romance genre. However, it's fun and delivers on the intense feelings of its leads. There's a reason the movie became so popular, spawning multiple sequels and building a fanbase that still exists over a decade later.\nThose searching for a lighthearted romance movie on Prime Video should look no further than 2022's Ticket to Paradise, which combines an A+ cast and a stunning setting to stellar effect. Starring George Clooney and Julia Roberts — and yes, that duo is enough reason to check this out — the film follows two divorced parents as they travel to Bali to stop their daughter from making a huge mistake in the name of love. Naturally, this stirs up all kinds of feelings between the two characters, delivering a second-chance romance that will leave even the most hard-hearted viewer in their feelings by Ticket to Paradise's ending.\nA movie that's a bit heavier than the standard rom-com, 2023's Somebody I Used to Know is still worth the watch, if only for Alison Brie's and Jay Ellis' performances. They play Ally and Sean, two exes who have seemingly moved on from one another — though that's quickly called into question when Ally returns to her hometown and they reunite. The fact that Sean is engaged complicates matters, raising all kinds of difficult questions for Ally. These don't lead where viewers might expect, with Somebody I Used to Know turning some of the genre's most problematic tropes on their heads in favor of a more modern and surprising conclusion.\nThe oldest romance movie on this list, Four Weddings and a Funeral holds up as a solid viewing experience nearly three decades after its debut. Streaming on Prime Video, the film follows the English Charles (Hugh Grant) as he courts an American named Carrie (Andie MacDowell), who he continues to run into at weddings and eventually a funeral. The performances from Grant and MacDowell are enough reason to give this a watch, but the movie's focus on fate is also a compelling one that will leave viewers feeling uplifted.\nThe Wedding Singer is a classic rom-com movie, and it's among the most well-known ones streaming on Amazon Prime Video. Starring Adam Sandler as Robbie Hart and Drew Barrymore as Julia Sullivan, this movie is worth watching for its star power alone. Of course, the fun plot, which sees Robbie and Julia realizing they're engaged to the wrong people — conveniently at the same time they meet one another — adds to the viewing experience. The Wedding Singer is one of those romance movies that remains entertaining no matters how many times viewers have seen it. Perhaps that's why its popularity has lasted for so many years.\nAmanda Mullen is an entertainment writer with a passion for all things books, films, and television.

S'More added, \"I thought it was the end of the road, but I was still hungry for a new journey. So that's why I'm here to conquer the Masked Singer stage. This S'More's gonna make you melt.\"\nAfter S'More's performance, another clue was revealed to help figure out his identity. It was a shiny silver film reel that said, \"Starring S'More.\" S'More explained, \"As you can tell, I'm very talented on and off stage.\" This lead to Nicole to theorize that S'More might not only be a singer, but maybe an actor too.\nRelated: All 16 Masked Singer Season 10 Costumes Revealed\nFor S'More's second performance on NFL Night, he sang and danced to a rousing rendition of \"Moves Like Jagger\" by Maroon 5.

He was then shown standing in front of a bubbling cauldron.\nS'More went on to say, \"While I was still in high school, a huge opportunity to work with an industry legend came my way.\" A television set with an M on it was then shown. S'More then looked at a picture of his father, an older S'More, saying, \"But when my dad found out, he told me to turn down the gig. I made the hard decision to move out.\"\nS'More was next seen taking a bow on stage. He said, \"Years down the road, I conquered the Broadway stage, a lifelong goal.\" There was then a Masked Singer game console with a video game controller on the screen. S'More shared, \"There was no way it could get any better, until one night after curtain call, I saw my dad backstage. Hearing him say he was proud of me was really the biggest win I could ask for. So dad, this one's for you.\" \nAfter S'More's performance, he moonwalked on the stage. Then, NFL player DeSean Jackson brought out a clue. It was a bucket full of oranges. S'More explained, \"I've tasted victory before, and it's so sweet. I hope to do so again here at The Masked Singer!\"\nThe Masked Singer season 10 panelists offered some interesting first guesses for S'More's identity. Nicole commented that the first thing that popped out to her was \"step by step.\" She pointed out that they've had members of boy bands such as *NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, and 98 Degrees, and now they were due for a member of the New Kids on the Block, who have a hit song called \"Step By Step.\" Because of this, Nicole guessed that S'More could be Joey McIntyre.\nJenny focused on S'More's instant rise to fame, and guessed Justin Guarini, who was the runner-up to Kelly Clarkson American Idol season 1. S'More's mustache and goatee reminded Robin of Kevin Richardson from the Backstreet Boys. On NFL Night, the panelists continued to focus on boy bands from Florida because of the oranges clue. Nicole guessed JC Chasez from *NSYNC, who originated in Orlando. Robin stuck with his guess of Kevin because Kevin was on Broadway in Chicago. He also thought the game console could refer to the Backstreet Boys' song, \"Quit Playing Games (With My Heart).\" However, Ken thought that S'More could be actor Simu Liu.\nAlthough these guesses make sense, another possibility for S'More's identity could be Ashley Parker Angel, who was a member of O-Town, the group that was formed on MTV's reality television series, Making the Band. The M on the television set might refer to MTV. In addition, the O in O-Town stands for Orlando, which could be represented by the oranges. O-Town was the first group to be signed by Clive Davis to his record label, J Records, so he could be the industry legend S'More was referencing.\nThe angel clue could refer to Ashley's last name. The pizza clue could reference his appearance in the film, Pizza Man. Ashley has appeared on Broadway in Hairspray and Wicked. The cauldron clue could be a reference to Wicked.\nS'More is definitely still melting hearts with his soulful singing and smooth persona. There will certainly be many more clues about his identity because he made it through to the next round of the competition. Whoever S'More turns out to be, the competition is heating up because of his sweet and sizzling vocals.\nThe Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EDT on FOX.\n"}

Gazelle shared, \"Last week, was such a redemptive experience. Now I am ready to tackle the competition because I'm feeling right at home here on this stage.\" As she said this, she was shown being walked out onto a football field without her costume on, where she appeared to be singing.\nGazelle went on to say, \"There were a lot times I didn't know if there was a place for me in the entertainment industry. At just eight years old, I was pressured to change my name to blend in more with the herd.\" A photograph of a young gazelle wearing a pink shirt with white flowers and a Hawaiian lei was shown. Gazelle continued, \"Casting directors couldn't figure out where I fit because of my unique look.\" Sand then blew across the screen to transition to the next scene. A wooden sign that read, \"Threat Level: 3\" was then shown, as Robin commented that Gazelle must be a triple threat.\nA test with a grade of 'A' displayed on a well was then revealed, as Gazelle said, \"I wondered if I could ever truly be myself and pursue my greatest passions.\" Gazelle continued, \"Fortunately, the world is changing, and there are more opportunities every day.\" A blue surfboard was then seen. Gazelle concluded with, \"I'm proud of my heritage, and proud to continue to blaze a trail for little girls who look like me.\"\nAfter Gazelle's performance, NFL player Antonio Gates brought out a clue to her identity. It was a football with the word \"Villain\" written on it. Gazelle explained, \"I'm not actually a villain, but I can play the part. Gazelle's got range.\"\nRelated: The Masked Singer: Cow Identity Prediction & Clues\nAfter Gazelle's first performance, the panelists had some interesting guesses for her identity, including some actresses who are also singers. Jenny thought Gazelle might be Riverdale actress Camila Mendes, while Robin guessed that she was Lucy Hale. Nicole theorized that Vanessa Hudgens might be under Gazelle's mask. Although many fans on social media have been guessing that Gazelle is Carrie Underwood, the clue about her crashing and burning during a national talent competition seems to have ruled her out, since Carrie won American Idol season 4.\nDuring NFL Night, Jenny used the villain clue to guess Gossip Girl's Leighton Meester. However, Ken thought she might be Constance Wu. He got choked up when he made the guess because Constance is a dear friend of his, and Gazelle's voice moved him. Nicole thought that, because Gazelle spoke about not fitting in with the herd and had a surfboard and Hawaiian shirt clues, she might be Auliʻi Cravalho, the voice of Moana in Disney's animated feature film, Moana.\nGazelle's dazzling performance got her through to the next round, in which there will be even more clues as to who she is. Based on Gazelle's incredible vocals in her first performance, Jenny predicted that she would make it to the finals. If Gazelle continues on this path, she will surely race to the top of the competition.\nThe Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EDT on FOX.\n"}
{"title": "The Masked Singer: Cow Identity Prediction & Clues", "date": "2023-10-05 01:15:25", "text": "The Masked Singer season 10 features Cow as one of its competitors. Find out the clues about the singer, and who might be hiding behind the mask.\nThe Masked Singer season 10 features 16 mystery celebrity singers, and Cow is one of them, with many clues to the bovine singer's identity. The reality competition series welcomes back host Nick Cannon, along with panelists Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, and Nicole Scherzinger. In one of the biggest unmaskings in the show's history, Demi Lovato was revealed to be Anonymouse during The Masked Singer season 10 premiere.\nThe Masked Singer season 10 had five contestants in the first Group A competition episode: Cow, S'More, Gazelle, Diver, and Rubber Ducky. Rubber Ducky was eliminated and revealed to be Anthony Anderson. On NFL Night, he was replaced by a Wild Card, Pickle. Future competitors include Anteater, Candelabra, Cuddle Monster, Donut, Hawk, Hibiscus, Husky, Royal Hen, Sea Monster, and Tiki. Here are the clues and identity guesses for Cow.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nAlthough Cow looks like a woman, dressed like a 1950s diner waitress, complete with an apron and red glasses, his voice indicates that he's most likely actually a man. Cow sang a powerful version of \"Bones\" by Imagine Dragons, and commanded the stage through his entire performance. His voice has incredible range, as it soared on the high notes. Cow danced during his performance, getting the crowd going.\nCow's clue package began in black and white in a kitchen. He said, \"Cows like me don't often make it out of their pen. When I was younger, I felt destined to stay home and live out a simple life in black and white.\" The camera then zoomed in on a package that read, \"All New! Two-Step Coffee. Step 1: Add coffee. Step 2: Add sugar.\" Cow continued, \"But I always knew I wanted to stand out. I had big dreams of being a big star, but I used to have a little trouble handling my emotions, until I discovered I could write, and leave whatever I was feeling on the page.\"\nThe camera then panned across a shelf that had some books, and a calendar turned to July 4. Cow pulled out a book with the title, \"Classic Culinary Cuisine for Cows,\" and turned to a page with a recipe for \"Classic Cow Cake.\" The ingredients were \"flour, sugar, milk, eggs, butter, vanilla, baking powder, and heavy cream.\" The scene then turned to color as The Masked Singer season 10 contestant announced, \"After that, everything changed. The gift eventually led me to number one.\"\nCow began to dance around the kitchen gathering ingredients for a cake. The retro pink refrigerator had a magnet that said, \"Welcome to fantastic Las Vegas.\" Cow continued, \"I won Grammys, traveled the world. I made hit after hit after hit. I guess you could say, I was kinda my own cash cow. Anyway, I was always meant to live my life in color, and I'm bringing that same energy to the stage because you're about to see there's no one like me.\" Cow then pulled a strawberry cake out of the oven, with pilot's wings as a decoration on the top.\nAfter Cow's performance, another clue was revealed about him. The clue was a container of popcorn with a movie ticket that read, \"Blockbuster Movie.\" Cow explained, \"One of the better things known about me all started with a moooo-vie.\"\nRelated: The Masked Singer: S’More Identity Prediction & Clues\nFor NFL Night, Cow sang a rousing rendition of Bruno Mars' \"Treasure,\" singing and dancing. Cow's clue package began with him saying, \"Last week was utterly fantastic, and I'm excited to make it this far with the cream of the crop.\" Cow revealed some information about his family, saying, \"Tonight I'm honored to be part of NFL Night, even though I don't have many memories of watching the big game with my dad. He wasn't really around, and I didn't have a lot of positive male role models growing up.\" The camera then panned to a pair of red boxing gloves with a gold down arrow on one of them.\nCow continued, \"I was raised in a house of all women, who made me the sensitive Cow that I am.\" Cow then looked at a picture of himself as a child, posing with a grown-up Cow wearing a hat that resembles Mickey Mouse's Sorcerer's Apprentice hat. Cow also revealed that he's a father. He said, \"Now, as a parent, I know the value of being present for my children. I've always achieved a lot of success in my life, but my greatest accomplishment has always been my kids.\"\nCow was shown with three young cows. There was a piece of paper with a red heart drawn in crayon, along with crayons scattered on the paper. He shared, \"It's so easy to get overwhelmed by the smoke and mirrors of fame, but I told myself early on that I am a family cow first. So when I get on that stage, I'll be thinking of them and treasuring every single moment.\"\nAfter Cow's performance, The Masked Singer season 8 contestant Le'Veon Bell (Milkshake), brought out another clue. It was a pair of black tap shoes, carried out in a giant purple bowl with a gold star on it. Cow explained, \"Much like a Super Bowl Half Time show, I am known for my killer moooo-ves.\" He then showed off some of his dance moves.\nRelated: The Masked Singer: Gazelle Identity Prediction & Clues\nAfter Cow's first performance, Jenny guessed Shawn Stockman from Boyz II Men because he has a biopic coming out, and the group has had a Las Vegas residency and won a lot of Grammys. However, Nicole didn't agree. Jenny was also thinking of Usher. Nicole put the clues together to guess Leslie Odom Jr. because of the July 4 clue that might be a Hamilton reference. Robin said that whoever Cow was, they were definitely a pro, and had been on stage their whole life.\nOn NFL Night, the panelists guessed many different R&B singers for Cow's identity. Nicole mentioned Usher, while Robin guessed Trey Songz, and Ne-Yo. Jenny wondered if Cow could be Mario, but he doesn't have kids. She then guessed Nelly, but Nicole didn't know if Nelly could sing like that. She then said Cow could be Jason Derulo, who can sing, dance, and has a child. Nick mentioned that clearly the Cow knows him because he kept picking on him.\nCow is a seasoned performer, who will have many more clues revealed about him because he made it through to the next round, which is 2000s Night. He's sure to deliver more exciting performances in the weeks to come. As a Masked Singer preview stated, Cow is legen-dairy.\nThe Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EDT on FOX.\n"}
{"title": "The Masked Singer: Diver Identity & Clues", "date": "2023-10-05 01:20:26", "text": "The Masked Singer season 10's Diver is one of the 16 contestants singing in mystery celebrity competition, and there are many clues to his identity.\nThe Masked Singer season 10 features 16 mystery celebrity singers, and Diver is one of the contestants who has many clues to his identity. The Masked Singer season 10 again features host Nick Cannon and panelists Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, and Nicole Scherzinger. During the season premiere, Demi Lovato was revealed to be Anonymouse, which was one of the biggest unmaskings in the show's history.\nThe Masked Singer season 10 features some fantastic costumes including Diver, Gazelle, S'More, Rubber Ducky, and Cow, who competed in the first competition episode. Rubber Ducky was revealed to be Anthony Anderson. He was replaced by the Wild Card contestant, Pickle, on NFL Night. Also singing in the show's milestone season will be Anteater, Candelabra, Cuddle Monster, Donut, Hawk, Hibiscus, Husky, Royal Hen, Sea Monster, and Tiki. Here are the clues and identity guesses for Diver.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nDuring The Masked Singer season 10 premiere, Diver gave a clue about himself stating, \"Usually I'm pretty pumped, but lately I've been lost in the abyss. I might be the most hated creature in the ocean right now. Usually you can find me under the sea, but, for this clue, you'll have to look to the sky.\" The clue was a picture of a cardinal.\nWhen Diver came out on stage to perform, Robin commented that he was tall. Diver sang a rousing rendition of \"Any Way You Want It\" by Journey, with much of the song being sung in a high pitch. His clue package began with him stating, \"Diving into a completely different persona feels like a nice escape.\" Diver then held up a newspaper called The Masked Singer Post with a headline that read, \"Extra! Extra! Read All About It!\"\nDiver confessed, \"I've been everyone's favorite person to hate, and, to be honest, I get it.\" An hourglass with sand pouring out of the bottom then appeared on the screen. He continued, \"I'm the first to admit, I've made mistakes. But, honestly, I did it for love.\" Diver went on to admit, \"It hurts when I get judged by people who never even met me, and I become a scapegoat for every bad dude they've ever known.\" A knight's shiny armor was then shown on the screen.\nDiver then shared, \"But I'm hoping all that will melt away when I hit the stage. Getting to share my voice without the preconceived notion of who I am is really what I need right now.\" Diver then held a compass that pointed to the Midwest. \"So tonight, I'm really getting my head in the game because I'm not ready to go back to the real world just yet.\"\nAfter Diver's performance, another clue was revealed. It was a magazine cover that said, \"Masked Money Money Money.\" The headlines read, \"Diver Opens Another Business!\" and \"11 Million Eyes on Diver!\" Diver explained, \"The more people talk about my business, the more I want 'em out of it.\"\nRelated: How The Masked Singer Season 10’s Anonymouse’s Clues Related To Demi Lovato\nOn NFL Night, Diver sang \"I Ain't Worried\" by OneRepublic. He once again showcased his high vocal register, and also performed a full dance routine. He interacted with the audience, and really got the crowd going. In Diver's clue package, he shared, \"Making my debut as the Diver last week was so rewarding. It felt great to get all the love from the panel and audience: something, as you know, I haven't gotten much of lately.\"\nDiver went on to reveal, \"As a kid, I always wanted to be famous. I modeled, I acted, and, of course, sang. I was always waiting to become a household name. I just didn't know it would be for everyone hating me.\" Diver was then shown watching his Masked Singer performance on a screen.\nDiver continued, \"But I'm here to show the world that I'm more than my mistakes. Being here already feels like a healing experience.\" A pair of red high heel pumps then floated across the screen. Diver said, \"Getting to share my talent, instead of my drama, is exactly what I've needed.\" He declared, \"So, tonight, I'm gonna keep my eye on the ball 'cause I am not ready to take off this mask.\"\nAfter Diver's performance, a superfan in the audience revealed another clue about Diver. He had a black club painted on his chest. Diver explained, \"I'm well-suited for the club. I know how to get the club going! What's up!\"\nAfter Diver's first performance, the panelists had some very varied ideas about who he might be. Nicole guessed that he might be Adam Levine, while Ken declared that Diver could only be Tom Sandoval. Fans on social media agree with his guess. Jenny believed that Diver might be Scott Disick. Based on the clues, Diver seems to be someone from the Midwest, possibly St. Louis, Missouri, because of the cardinal, which is the city's major league baseball team.\nOn NFL Night, Nicole guessed that Diver might be Pete Davidson, while Ken continued to insist that Diver was Tom Sandoval. Robin thought Diver might be Pauly D from Jersey Shore. For their final guesses, Robin stuck with Pauly D, and Nicole agreed with him. However, Ken had his second correct guess of the season, with Jenny agreeing. Diver ended up being Tom Sandoval.\nTom's clues led to Vanderpump Rules, including the premiere night \"pumped\" clue and the red high heel pumps. Tom is from St. Louis, which is why there was a cardinal and Midwest clue. Tom is a singer, who is currently in a band called Tom Sandoval & The Most Extras, which explains the \"Extra! Extra! Read All About It\" clue, in addition to him making headlines.\nAll of the clues about being hated refer to Scandoval, in which Tom was revealed to have been cheating on his girlfriend of nine years, Ariana Madix, with one of Ariana's best friends, Raquel Leviss. Because of Scandoval, Vanderpump Rules season 10 had 11.4 viewers, which explains the number in his premiere night clue.\nPerhaps The Masked Singer can be Tom's redemption story, as he proved that there's more to him than his mistakes. With his impressive vocals and energetic dance moves, he showed off his talents. However, a deep dive into Tom's past may cause some to feel that he has a lot to make up for after cheating on Ariana. Fans will see more of him as he currently stars on Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test season 2. Whatever happens next, as Diver, Tom dove headfirst into The Masked Singer season 10 and gave fans two fun and impressive performances.\nThe Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EDT on FOX.\n"}
{"title": "Jamie Lee Curtis' One Piece Season 2 Casting Talks Will Happen, Insists Showrunner", "date": "2023-10-05 01:28:21", "text": "One Piece showrunner Matt Owens offers a positive update for Jamie Lee Curtis' campaign to play the character Kureha in season 2 of the show.\nOne Piece showrunner Matt Owens has offered a positive update on Jamie Lee Curtis' campaign to play Kureha in season 2. Kureha first appears in the manga's Drum Island Arc as a reclusive doctor the Straw Hats go to in order to help a sick Nami. Curtis will campaign to play Kureha after the Hollywood actors strike is over, as she herself is a fan of the franchise and wants to be involved in its live-action adaptation.\nSpeaking with Deadline, Owens revealed the team behind One Piece season 2 wants Curtis to portray Kureha. He revealed that, while the actors strike is preventing any negotiations from happening right now, there are plans to talk with Curtis about having a role in the show. Check out what Owens had to say below:\nWe have opportunities to stunt cast some roles, some rules that are very important, and it came out that Jamie Lee Curtis is a One Piece fan. As soon as she said that, we were like, okay, we have to try and get her on the show. What can we do? And Doctor Kureha, very luckily, is a character who is coming up in our story, and is someone who is perfect for Jamie Lee Curtis.\nSo we tried to start manifesting this dream of ours. After she won her Oscar, the writers room sent her a figure of Doctor Kureha with a nice note that said, 'Congratulations on your statue, here’s another one to put next to it. Hope to speak to you soon.'\nWhen she reposted that, it got a lot of fan interest, and I commented on it. We’re trying to manifest it. Yes, as of right now, SAG is still striking so there have not been real conversations. But as soon as there can be, I’m ready. I will take her out to dinner, we’ll talk about it. We’ll do all of it because at this point we’re writing for her — we really, really want her to come and play with us in Season 2.\nCurtis announced she wanted to play Kureha in late September, reposting fan art of herself as the doctor in her signature outfit. Since both Curtis and Owens are interested in her hopping aboard for season 2, it wouldn't be surprising if she's cast soon after the actors strike ends. Not only would this reveal how far the story of One Piece season 2 will take the Straw Hats, but it would also guarantee a fitting actor for the role of Kureha.\nBeyond saving Nami, Kureha also introduces the crew to Chopper, a mysterious reindeer who can turn himself into different forms after eating a Devil Fruit. Chopper is trained in medicine just as much as Kureha, prompting Luffy to ask him to join the Straw Hats as their doctor. Because of this, Kureha plays a significant role in the story beyond her primary purpose, making an acclaimed actor like Curtis the perfect casting choice.\nThe fact that Curtis may join the One Piece live-action cast in season 2 also reveals the next season will cover at least up through the Drum Island Arc of the Arabasta Saga. However, since the season will likely focus on the Straw Hats' journey to Arabasta like in the manga, the show may go beyond Drum Island. However much of the manga the next season covers, it appears Curtis will be part of bringing it into live-action form.\nSource: Deadline\n"}
{"title": "All 3 One Chicago Shows Re-Open Writers Rooms Following WGA Strike Ending", "date": "2023-10-05 02:32:23", "text": "All three One Chicago shows - Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D., and Chicago Med - re-open their writers' rooms following the WGA strike's conclusion.\nAll three shows within the One Chicago franchise have officially re-opened their writers' rooms following the end of the Writers Guild of America's (WGA) strike. The WGA's 148-day strike ended on September 27 after the writers negotiated a fair new deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). While much of Hollywood is still on pause due to the ongoing Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) strike, some aspects of production are resuming, particularly when it comes to writing.\nAs reported by Deadline, the writers' rooms for the One Chicago shows have re-opened following the end of the WGA strike. This means Chicago Fire season 12, Chicago P.D. season 11, and Chicago Med season 9 have all resumed writing and are one step closer to returning to the air. In addition to the One Chicago shows, NBC’s Law & Order and Law & Order: SVU and CBS' three FBI dramas are also resuming writers' rooms this week.\nPreviously, the One Chicago shows always premiered new episodes during the fall TV season. However, it has been quite clear for a while that the shows won't make their usual release dates this year. Even though the writing is back on, the SAG-AFTRA strike will prevent filming from getting underway. Still, despite the uncertainty around the SAG-AFTRA strike, industry insiders had a relatively optimistic outlook on the shows' returns.\nInsiders estimated Chicago Fire and its spinoffs' returns in the days leading up to the WGA securing a deal with the AMPTP. While they acknowledged that many factors could impact the timeline, they correctly predicted that writers' rooms would be open by early October. From there, they predicted One Chicago shows could be released as early as March 2024. This might sound fairly speedy, but production on procedural dramas like the One Chicago shows tends to be pretty swift. Plus, with speculation that the SAG-AFTRA strike will resolve soon, it's possible that the shows could make a spring 2024 return.\nHowever, it's important to remember that it's still unknown for sure when the SAG-AFTRA strike will end. Negotiations recently resumed, and the end of the WGA's strike is expected to pressure the AMPTP to also strike a fair deal with the actors. Still, without a confirmed end in sight, negotiations may take longer than expected. Plus, the shows must film enough episodes to keep up with weekly releases once everything is running again. Hence, while a March 2024 release date seems possible for One Chicago shows, it remains to be seen if they can make it.\nSource: Deadline\n"}
{"title": "Wonka Receives Family-Friendly MPAA Rating, But There's A Unique Twist", "date": "2023-10-05 03:27:25", "text": "Wonka's MPAA rating has finally been released, revealing that the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory prequel features some surprising violent moments.\nWonka's MPAA rating has finally been released, and while it isn't too surprising, there's a little twist. The prequel to Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chcolate Factory was directed by Paddington's Paul King and features an all-star cast including Timothée Chalamet, Sally Hawkins, Olivia Colman, Keegan-Michael Key, and Hugh Grant as an Oompa-Loompa. In Wonka, a younger Willy Wonka sets out to make his name as a world-class chocolatier in a rags-to-riches tale.\nWith Wonka's December 15 release date drawing closer, FilmRatings.com has unveiled the MPAA's official rating. While it has expectedly earned the family-friendly PG rating similar to the Gene Wilder-led Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory and Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the reasons for prequel movie's rating are somewhat surprising. The MPAA awarded Wonka a PG rating due to \"violence, mild language, and some thematic elements.\"\nWhile Wonka's rating could raise brows, its reasons aren't out of the ordinary for previous adaptations of the Dahl novel, which each had their own challenging elements. Despite its G rating, the first 1971 adaptation features moments where Charlie is threatened by the seemingly sinister Slugworth, Charlie and Grandpa Joe narrowly escape razor-sharp blades, and Wonka takes everyone through a terrifying tunnel. Meanwhile, Burton's quirky scenes, mild language, and heightened action in the 2005 adaptation saw that movie being given a PG rating like Wonka.\nFor Wonka, the noted violence could be due to it having clear, definitive villains as opposed to abstract concepts and archetypical characters. Willy will have to make his name for himself while avoiding the wrath of the \"Chocolate Cartel,\" an alliance of greedy chocolatiers consisting of Paterson Joseph's Slugworth, Mathew Baynton's Fickelgruber, and Matt Lucas' Prodnose. While the Wonka trailer reveals them confronting Willy in public, they have also been seen trapping him beneath a glass floor while the room fills with liquid chocolate, teasing their dangerous methods.\nWhile it remains to be seen just how Willy and the Chocolate Cartel will come to blows, Wonka's trailers hint that Chalamet's chocolatier will have to quite literally be quick on his feet to not suffer their wrath. Though the movie is being presented as a whimsical musical, the stakes could become quite high. Nevertheless, while some moments may be intense, they won't stop Wonka from maintaining a family-friendly tone.\nSource: FilmRatings.com\n"}

With only 6 chances to get the right answer, players may need a little help.\nWordle is a simple word-guessing game that tasks players with solving a five-word puzzle using letter position clues. Wordle presents the player with six rows of five empty boxes. Simply enter a random five-letter word and the website highlights certain letters in green if they are correct, yellow if they are correct but in the wrong spot, or grey if they are not in the word at all. With this information, players need to try to figure out the word within the six guesses to be successful.\nThese types of guessing games have been around for a long time. One of the originals was called Mastermind, where players are tasked with guessing a row of colored pegs that utilizes the same hint systems found in Wordle. If players would like to try the game for themselves, it can be found on the Wordle website, which creates a new puzzle every day, keeps track of players' win streaks and guess distribution, and has a popular sharing ability.\nComedian Patton Oswalt scored a Wordle win-in-two, even though he only got a single misplaced letter from his starting word. He shared his win from July 15th on Twitter and called it \"Lucky!\"\nWith a new Wordle added every day, players may need a little help with the more difficult words, and having a strong starting word is important. Players may not have time to work out the puzzle solution every day, or perhaps they just want to keep their streak going but are having too much difficulty with the daily word. Whatever the reason, players can find every daily Wordle answer used so far in 2023 below.\nLooking for last year's answers? They're all here below for archiving needs.\nSimple games, like Wordle, are the perfect small distraction for the day. The game itself doesn't take up too much time and is a nice break during the standard morning routine. Being able to compare with friends on social media sites makes Wordle even more addicting by adding the element of competition. With the win streak tracking feature and social media sharing button, Wordle is the perfect little puzzle to spend 3-5 minutes on during a workday.\n"}
{"title": "Our Flag Means Death Season 2 Episodes 1-3 Recap: 13 Biggest Moments", "date": "2023-10-05 07:01:28", "text": "The pining gentleman pirate Stede Bonnet and a heartbroken Ed \"Blackbeard\" Teach return in Our Flag Means Death season 2's three-episode premiere.\nSpoilers ahead for the first three episodes of Our Flag Means Death season 2.\nThe three-episode Our Flag Means Death season 2 premiere on Max is packed with all the humor, heartbreak, and high-seas misadventures that made the first installment such a hit in 2022. In Our Flag Means Death season 1, gentleman-turned-pirate Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby) renounced his family's wealth and aristocratic title for a life of piracy. However, it wasn't all smooth sailing for Stede, who found himself falling for the once-ruthless Captain Blackbeard, a.k.a. Ed Teach (Taika Waititi), against his better judgment. At the end of Our Flag is Death season 1, Stede fakes his death to return to Ed and their pirate life.\nUnlike Stede, though, Ed isn't taking their sudden separation well. Consumed by heartbreak, he ignores his duties as captain of the Revenge, inciting anger from his first mate — and notorious Stede hater — Izzy Hands (Con O'Neill). After being accused of going soft, Ed tosses one of his own overboard to flex his power, dumps all of Stede's belongings overboard, and strands the gentleman pirate's crew on a deserted island. Little does Ed know, Stede is dead-set on being reunited, which is right where Our Flag Means Death season 2 picks up.\nRELATED: Everything We Know About Our Flag Means Death Season 3\nHaving officially renounced his wealth and recovered most of his crew, Stede is trying to make his way in the pirate world. In the Our Flag Means Death season 2 premiere, he pens a message in a bottle to Ed, narrating the ups and downs of his misadventures. Mostly, things have been challenging, though Stede tries to put a positive spin on it all: \"We're in a rebuilding phase as a crew,\" he writes. But what's really driving Stede is his love for Ed and his desire to find the wayward captain. \"To reiterate, we’re doing great,\" Stede narrates. \"I think of you, often.\"\nWhile Stede is turning his heartbreak and hardship into action, Ed isn't handling the separation so well. Instead of being driven by purpose, he's compelled by his off-the-handle emotions and reverts back to his Kraken persona. \"I’m the f***in’ devil,\" Ed announces in true Blackbeard fashion as his crew murders an at-sea wedding party just for kicks. Even to Ed's crew, the violence seems uncharacteristically hollow and aimless, making Blackbeard and Stede's awkward breakup all the more troubling.\nRelated: Who Is Anne Bonny? Minnie Driver's Our Flag Means Death Season 2 Character Explained\nIn Our Flag Means Death season 2, episode 1, \"Impossible Birds,\" Stede and his crew find themselves without many options. Hoping to save enough for a proper ship, they broker a deal with Spanish Jackie (Leslie Jones), a much-feared pirate bar owner who boasts 19 husbands, working for her at the Republic of Pirates. After Stede's crew tries to rob Spanish Jackie of her chest full of precious indigo, they find themselves in a tight spot until the local soup kiosk owner, Zheng Yi Sao (Ruibo Qian), saves them.\nZheng Yi Sao reveals herself to be a revered pirate queen and takes Stede and his comrades about her ship, the Red Flag. Earlier in the episode, the faux soup server explains that she prizes action over ambition, which becomes a running theme for the season. Generally speaking, the captain of the Red Flag doesn't take men aboard her vessel but makes an exception for Stede's crew of \"tender as hell\" guys. At first, that seems like a life-altering favor, but things grow more complicated on the pirate queen's ship.\nAfter Izzy encourages them to dump loads of loot from the Revenge just so they can plunder more, Blackbeard's crew starts to speak up about what's happening aboard the ship. \"We think you’re in an unhealthy relationship with Blackbeard,\" Jim (Vico Ortiz) tells Izzy. But that's not the only friction point. As a heartbroken, angry Blackbeard creates an increasingly \"toxic atmosphere,\" the crew isn't just worried about Izzy, but themselves too. Unfortunately, things don't go well when they voice these concerns.\nIn season 1 of Our Flag Means Death, Izzy had accused Ed of being a \"shell\" of his former self after the once-ruthless captain continually hesitated to kill Stede. Outwardly, Ed has tried to project strength and rehabilitate his soft image, though that's caused him to backslide and take things too far. The friction between Izzy and Ed is still very much there, so when Ed draws his pistol on the crew during the workplace meeting, the first mate has no problem telling Ed that what's ruined him is, \"You’re feelings for Steve f***in’ Bonnet.\" Without a second thought, Ed shoots Izzy.\nRELATED:  10 Memes That Perfectly Sum Up Our Flag Means Death\nWhile aboard the Red Flag, Stede and his crew meet the only other man the pirate queen ever took aboard: Lucius (Nathan Foad). Formerly Stede's scribe and the lover of Black Pete (Matthew Maher), Lucius is somewhat glad to be reunited with his former crew, but the events of the Our Flag is Death season 1 finale loom large. In fact, pushing Lucius overboard was one of the heartbroken Ed's first acts that was meant to prove his still-callous nature. At first, Lucius hides the truth, but after Stede fixates on finding Ed, Lucius points out that Blackbeard might not be the person Stede wants him to be.\nAfter Ed shoots Izzy, he makes Frenchie (Joel Fry) his new first mate. Unwilling to be the next one in the line of fire, he tries to talk down his credentials. But the ever-unhinged, heartbroken Ed demands the appointment and Frenchie has no choice but to accept. His first act as Ed's new right-hand man is to finish off Izzy, but Frenchie and the crew decide to secretly stow Izzy below deck instead. Meanwhile, aboard the Red Flag, Zheng Yi Sao's first mate dubs Nathaniel Buttons (Ewen Bremner) a \"sea witch.\" Perhaps just a funny reference to the pirate's ability to commune with seagulls, it could point toward a future season 2 plot point.\nGiven Frenchie's inability to lie well, Ed deduces that his former first mate is still alive and on the Revenge. Below deck, Jim amputates Izzy's wounded leg just before Ed discovers them. After handing Izzy his pistol and telling him to finish himself off, Ed decides to blow off some steam. He steers the Revenge directly into a raging storm and then shatters the wheel. Still not satisfied, he forces his crew to fight each other and threatens to fire a cannon at the mast, in the hopes of killing everyone on board. Breakups really are rough.\nUnable to tolerate their captain's barbaric behavior any longer, the crew of the Revenge take matters into their own hands and fight back. After knocking Ed to the ground, Jim raises a cannonball high into the air — seemingly to crush Ed's skull. However, the camera cuts away, leaving Ed's fate up in the air. When the battered Revenge washes up beside the Red Flag, the pirate queen's first mate suspects mutiny and suggests they kill Izzy, Frenchie, Jim, and the rest of Ed's crew.\nRELATED: Our Flag Means Death Season 3 Confirmed To End The Show (But That Depends On 1 Factor)\nBack at the Republic of Pirates, Zheng Yi Sao falls for the ever-level-headed Oluwande Boodhari (Samson Kayo), as he and Stede were regulars at the soup kiosk. Previously, Oluwande was romantically linked to Jim, who, in turn, gets involved with Madeleine Sami's pirate character —nothing says romance like amputating a leg together. When Oluwande and Jim reunite during Our Flag Means Death season 2, episode 3, \"The Innkeeper,\" it's clear their connection remains, further complicating Oluwande's budding relationship with the pirate queen.\nWhen it becomes clear that Zheng Yi Sao is going to heed her first mate's advice and kill the remainder of Ed's crew, Stede takes matters into his own hands and devises a clever escape plan. Not only does he bust out the rest of the crew, but he manages to get everyone safely aboard the Revenge. To ensure the pirate queen doesn't pursue them, Stede's crew steals the wheel of her ship. While the escape may be glorious, Stede has clearly made a powerful enemy.\nEarlier in the third episode, Ed washes ashore on a seemingly deserted island. This somewhat tracks with what Izzy and the others say when they're accused of mutiny, claiming they just marooned a \"retired\" Ed. However, Ed's unconscious body lies below deck while his mind and spirit go on a journey of self-discovery. As it turns out, the island is Ed's version of purgatory. There, he meets his mentor, the late Captain Ben Hornigold (Mark Mitchinson).\n\"You’re afraid you’re unlovable,\" the purgatory Hornigold tells Ed when he can't decide whether to return to the world of the living or accept his demise. This ties into Ed's history with his own father, whom he killed, as well as why he took the breakup with Stede so hard. When Ed says he hates Hornigold, the ex-pirate captain points out that he's just a projection of Ed's inner turmoil, pushing Ed to have the hard realization that he actually hates himself.\nAs Ed has his moment of self-discovery in purgatory, Stede finds his body and begs him to come back. In his vision, Hornigold ties a rock to Ed and pushes him off a cliff. Struggling to surface with all that weight dragging him down, Ed thinks about giving in to what's heaviest. But when he hears Stede's voice, Ed fights to return to the light. Unfortunately, episode 3 cuts to the credits after Ed opens his eyes. Can Blackbeard and Stede find their way in Our Flag Means Death season 2? If the sure-to-be emotional reunion is any indication, it seems the two pirates might be fated for each other.\nNominated for an LA Press Club National Arts & Entertainment Journalism Award in 2022, Kate is a freelance entertainment writer and editor.

{"title": "True Story Of Zheng Yi Sao, The Pirate Queen In Our Flag Means Death", "date": "2023-10-05 07:01:28", "text": "Dubbed one of the most successful pirates in history, Zheng Yi Sao is the latest iconic figure to appear in the series Our Flag Means Death.\nSpoilers ahead for the first three episodes of Our Flag Means Death season 2.\nIn season 2, Our Flag Means Death wastes no time introducing Zheng Yi Sao, a pirate queen with an incredible true story that puts the tale of Blackbeard to shame. Of course, the series is accustomed to pulling figures from the pages of history. Created by David Jenkins, the swashbuckling, period rom-com focuses on gentleman-turned-pirate Stede Bonnet (Rhys Darby), who renounces his family fortune in favor of misadventures on the high seas. Soon enough, the captain of the Revenge meets one of history's most notorious pirates: Captain Blackbeard (Taika Waititi).\nWhile Blackbeard, a.k.a. Ed Teach, and Stede are the couple at the series' center, other real-life pirates populate the first 10-episode season of Our Flag Means Death. Most memorably, Will Arnett plays Calico Jack, an old friend of Blackbeard's who encourages the captain to give in to his most reckless impulses. A handful of new additions to the cast were announced ahead of the season 2 premiere: the sophomore outing of Our Flag Means Death has Minnie Driver's Anne Bonny join the crew as well as Ruibo Qian's Chinese pirate queen, Zheng Yi Sao.\nRelated: Where You've Seen Frenchie From Our Flag Means Death\nDuring China's Qing Dynasty, Zheng Yi Sao made a name for herself, becoming one of the most successful pirates in history. A former sex worker, Zheng Yi Sao was known to be a formidable businessperson, which attracted the attention of the pirate Cheng I, who lorded over the Red Flag Fleet. After marrying Cheng, Zheng Yi Sao became immersed in the world of piracy. Even though one of the names history knows her by, Ching Shih, simply means \"Cheng's widow,\" her piratical legacy is even greater, as Our Flag Means Death season 2 suggests.\nWhen her husband died, Zheng Yi Sao stepped in to lead Cheng's fleet, cleverly outmaneuvering his heir apparent and lover, Cheung Po Tsai. According to Atlas Obscura, she commanded a staggering 1,800 ships and 80,000 men — numbers that make Blackbeard's four ships and 300 men pale in comparison. To keep the Red Flag Fleet unified, the pirate queen implemented a strict code of laws, vowing to behead those who broke the oaths. Even with the East India Company, Chinese, and Portuguese fleets on her case, Zheng Yi Sao remained undefeated and, eventually, retired from a life of pillaging in exchange for amnesty (via Google Arts & Culture).\nWhile it's not known if the showrunners have mapped out Zheng Yi Sao's story into Our Flag Means Death season 3, it is clear that the pirate queen will play a crucial role in the second season. Zheng Yi Sao is most well-remembered for commanding a massive fleet. In the first three episodes of Our Flag Means Death's sophomore season, the Red Flag fleet amounts to just a few ships. Given Stede and his crew's betrayal of Zheng Yi Sao, they've made an enemy of the formidable captain, which means it's likely that she'll return with the full force of her infamous fleet.\nWhile the series isn't set in the South China Sea, Our Flag Means Death keeps what's known about Zheng Yi Sao's disposition intact, as she's portrayed as a confident leader and skilled negotiator. However, there are some embellishments: the Our Flag Means Death season 2 villain runs her vessel by relying on the principles of unity, cohesion, and balance. Moreover, in the series Zheng Yi Sao's crew is made up almost entirely of women, which wasn't the case in real life. Regardless of the changes the show makes, Our Flag Means Death stays true to Zheng Yi Sao's spirit, further cementing her legacy as one of history's most accomplished pirates.\nSources: Atlas Obscura, Google Arts & Culture\nNominated for an LA Press Club National Arts & Entertainment Journalism Award in 2022, Kate is a freelance entertainment writer and editor.

Two Dripstone Caverns inside these spaces contain all the resources you could ask for, from iron to diamonds in Minecraft.\nRelated: 10 Best Minecraft Seeds For Diamonds\nThe best Cherry Blossom seeds in Minecraft give you a chance to experience the new biome added to the 1.20 update, which features beautiful pink flowered trees within a new type of forest. This seed puts you on an island of Blossoms, surrounded by every other biome in the game. While you could travel anywhere to create your main base, there's something special about a pristine pink island that sits near such interesting landscapes.\nWhile you may only see it in the distance when you spawn into this seed, this world has a massive Ice Spike biome that stretches for thousands of blocks. With two ruined Nether portals near where you begin, you can also find a River Mansion and several Villages. The abundance of smaller regions around a central snow environment can be great for anyone looking for a cold theme to their Minecraft Survival world.\nShipwrecks can be valuable structures to discover in Minecraft, with this world seed giving you two broken vessels close to the desert island you spawn onto. The chests in these ships give you a great head start in Survival mode, including raw materials, tools, weapons, and maybe even some armor. According to the YouTube creator Minecraft & Chill, other landmarks like an Outpost and Village found in a nearby tundra are places you may also loot for helpful gear.\nVillages, Outposts, and Temples are essential places to travel to during a good Survival run of Minecraft, making this seed popular by including all three early on. Spawning in this world puts you on the sands of a beach next to a Jungle biome with four Temples hidden inside the dense forest. A nearby Village, both in the forest and in the close desert, should give you everything you need to get started very quickly in your adventure.\nThere are a few Witch Hut structures within the Jungle biome of this seed as well, but some dangerous mobs guard them. You may want to get some protection against them before trying to loot their homes.\nOne of the biggest challenges with Survival seeds with tons of biomes is the sheer amount of time it takes to travel to each important location. Thankfully, this world provides an easy solution to this problem, with a vast river connecting almost every Minecraft environment. In addition, a Shipwreck and an interesting collection of Cherry Blossom trees inside an enclosed icy mountain give you some advantages to work with when you spawn.\n\"Warm\" biomes like Deserts, Badlands, and Jungles are all present here, with several Temples in each region to explore to your heart's content. Three of these spaces also give you access to Strongholds underground, which are perfect for those in Survival mode who eventually want to take on the Ender Dragon. There are so many Ruins, Villages, and even a hidden Igloo base in Minecraft that will keep you busy for a long time.\nThis seed has every Overworld biome within just over 1,000 blocks right when you spawn, creating a shockingly even distribution of environments. A large Badlands biome is located next to a large ocean that connects all these places with every type of aquatic biome. Even the incredibly rare Lush Cave biome is seen underneath a large ravine, allowing you to harvest almost every known material in Minecraft.\nThis seed has the greatest potential in Survival mode because of the presence of every biome in the game at equal distances from the island you spawn on. Anyone who will be dedicating a lot of their time to a Minecraft world should be able to visit various unique places to keep the experience fresh. All you need is a boat to go anywhere you could imagine in this limitless seed.\nThe best seeds for Survival in Minecraft provide the resources your character needs to live and a wide variety of places to go that make your adventure constantly exciting through discoveries.\nSource: Minecraft & Chill/YouTube\n"}
{"title": "The Best Cleric Multiclass Build In Baldur’s Gate 3", "date": "2023-10-05 09:00:27", "text": "Playing a multiclass hero in Baldur’s Gate 3 can be beneficial, but you need to know how to build them. Here are the best Cleric multiclasses so far.\nUsing a Cleric Multiclass in Baldur’s Gate 3 is an excellent way of optimizing your character’s potential as a divine damage dealer or a team supporter. Multiclassing is a feature available in Larian Studio’s popular turn-based RPG that essentially allows you to undertake two distinct classes and level them up with a single character. Doing so will open up your list of potential skills, thus giving you completely different approaches to the game. Using some of the best Multiclass combinations allows you to expand your character’s range of abilities, making them a more skilled healer or perhaps a more versatile DPS.\nUsing Multiclasses, however, is optional. They can provide benefits if you are thinking of optimizing the character’s build for a specific archetype that fits a well-rounded party composition. Alternatively, it can also become a mess of stats thrown around, where a character can do many different things but doing all these things rather poorly. As such, players should be using the best Multiclasses available, and part of doing so is using the Cleric as a base, as one of the best classes in Baldur’s Gate 3 – even if it is one of the least popular ones.\nRelated: 5 Best Multiclass Combinations In Baldur's Gate 3\nThe Cleric and Paladin Multiclass combination may be one of the most traditional ones that stem from Dungeons and Dragons, and, once again, it proves its value in Baldur’s Gate 3. Mixing these two classes will allow you to transform your character into an envoy of holy powers, not only dealing a lot of damage but also healing and protecting yourself and your teammates. With the Cleric’s healing and buffing powers, you can make yourself even stronger when jumping into the heat of the battle to start smiting opponents, as Paladins often do.\nCleric & Paladin Multiclass Build\nCleric Level\nAt least 6\nPaladin Level\nAt least 2\nBest Abilities\n \nA fun and devastating strategy is to use the Cleric’s Spirit Guardians and head over to a group of enemies to start beating them up with the Paladin’s various smite abilities. In addition to this, Paladins can also use Bonus Actions starting at level, which allow them to strike twice. This can also be used against bosses like Ketheric Thorm in Baldur’s Gate 3. Because Clerics rely heavily on Wisdom and Paladins often depend on Strength, Constitution, and Charisma, finding the sweet spot can be tricky.\nUltimately, it comes down to your desire to mold them into an offensive light powerhouse or a more support-focused tank with excellent offensive capabilities. Either one works well, as the Cleric and Paladin Multiclass stands as one of the best Multiclasses in the game. Even a stealthier approach with a combat focus on debuffs against enemies can be achieved through a Trickery Domain Cleric and Oathbreaker Paladin Multiclass. In terms of roleplaying campaigns in Baldur’s Gate 3, the Cleric and Paladin Multiclass may be one of the best to use, as Clerics’ and Paladins’ proficiency with the holy light makes for a perfect match.\nIf your approach to the playable character is proper support for the rest of the team, then one of the best possible combinations is a Cleric and Bard multiclass build. This special mash-up will give you healing and protective abilities from Cleric in Baldur’s Gate 3, but the Bard will be the one doing the shining in terms of buffs. In fact, it is recommended for the Domain of Life Cleric to be leveled only a little bit so that you can unlock the essential skills, giving room for the Bard to develop more.\nCleric & Bard Multiclass Build\nCleric Level\nAt least 3\nBard Level\nAt least 7\nBest Abilities\n \nThe main focus of this build will be upgrading your buffing capabilities, which comes at the expense of your offensive powers. That is not to say you will be completely useless in terms of damage output, but this Cleric and Bard Multiclass hero will not be the spearhead of the party. On the other hand, it may be the most important piece of a team composition in Baldur’s Gate 3, as the Cleric Bard mix will protect allies consistently while empowering the main damage dealer to wreck opponents. An additional advantage of this build is applying the occasional debuff to enemies.\nRelated: Baldur’s Gate 3 Classes Are Going To Save Your Campaign From Disaster\nAnother positive aspect of this Cleric and Bard Multiclass build is that the stat spread is much more organized than the one with Cleric and Paladin, which has the risk of going all over the place. With a Cleric Bard in Baldur’s Gate 3, you will want to invest in Charisma and Wisdom. This will, in turn, also allow you to take on the role of the persuasive and deceitful negotiator, capable of talking your way out of most situations, should you have that option. Characters that deal damage tend to steal the spotlight, but this Multiclass mix is second to no DPS.\nIf you want one of the most overpowered Multiclass builds in Baldur’s Gate 3, mixing Cleric and Sorcerer is the solution. Not only are these two of the best classes in the RPG, but they are also complementary to one another. While Cleric will thrive with protective abilities and an occasional buff, the Sorcerer will wreak havoc with its elemental abilities across the arena. This Multiclass is not as tanky as the Paladin Cleric, which can endure many rounds of incoming damage, but it is one of the finest DPS builds available.\nCleric & Sorcerer Multiclass Build\nCleric Level\n5\nSorcerer Level\n7\nBest Abilities\n \nThe Sorcerer alone is already an S-tier class to choose from with its Lightning-based abilities, but mixed with a class that protects itself like the Cleric; you get a master magic user. In addition, both use the same types of weapons and armor, so there is no need to unlock proficiency with heavy armor or certain weapons, for instance. Like the Cleric Bard Multiclass in Baldur’s Gate 3, you will want to invest in Charisma and Wisdom, as the Cleric will play a less important role than the Sorcerer for damage purposes. Nevertheless, this is much more balanced.\nYou will need to increase Cleric to a fairly high level, even if the Sorcerer class is to be the priority. If you focus your character into a Tempest Domain Cleric with a Storm Sorcerer, you may as well be invincible – you even get the ability to fly. This is one of the most broken DPS builds, but a pleasure to play with. Regardless of whether you are looking for more damage output or support capabilities, the Cleric is a great class to use in Multiclass builds for Baldur’s Gate 3.\n"}
{"title": "Assassin's Creed Mirage: How To Decrease Notoriety", "date": "2023-10-05 09:30:25", "text": "Basim’s Notoriety in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage can land him in big trouble, so decreasing it as soon as possible is a necessary evil.\nIn Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, Basim’s Notoriety will change the way you are able to play the game, and it is essential to learn how to decrease that notoriety early. With a high Notoriety, Basim will be easily spotted throughout Baghdad and unable to avoid guards who are furtively searching for him. Fortunately, there are several ways players can decrease Basim's Notoriety throughout the game and ensure he stays unnoticed.\nAssassin’s Creed: Mirage takes place slightly before the last entry in the series, Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla, expanding on the story of Basim to explore how he got from street thief to the Hidden One. This entry in the series is much more focused on stealth like many of the earlier games, and being seen doing something illegal will instantly increase your Notoriety. Players should note that engaging in open combat will increase Basim's Notoriety immediately.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nThere are four levels of Notoriety in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage that will affect how Basim can travel through the city of Baghdad. Starting at the first level, Wanted Posters will appear throughout the city, and some civilians and guards may notice Basim. At level two, guards will likely find you and start patrolling rooftops, and more civilians will recognize you. At the final level, the elite Shakiriyya guard will begin following you, and civilians will regularly notice you.\nBasim should rely much more on stealth mechanics in Assassin's Creed: Mirage to complete missions, as completing tasks without being seen will not raise his Notoriety. However, there are several points in the game, including very early on, where Basim will be forced to do something in the open, or you will accidentally murder someone in front of a civilian you did not know was there. Luckily, there are two main ways to decrease your Notoriety.\nIf you start to get spotted, run for it and hide until things have calmed down. The Notoriety bar fills up incrementally, so disengaging and letting things calm down could keep the bar from reaching the next level.\nThe first and perhaps easiest method to decrease Notoriety is to remove Wanted Posters. They will appear on the bar at the top of the screen when Basim is near one, and Basim can approach and interact with the poster to remove it from the city. However, this can be risky when many civilians or guards are nearby, as getting caught removing it by a guard will not decrease your Notoriety. When Basim's Notoriety is high, Wanted Posters will almost always appear near Basim on Assassin's Creed: Mirage's map.\nThe second main way is to use a Power Token to bribe a Munadi. Power Tokens can be acquired through quests or pickpocketing, and Munadi can often be found standing on a platform in the middle of busy areas. Approach one and offer them a Power Token to spread false rumors about you, and Basim’s Notoriety will decrease immediately. This can be done anytime in Assassin's Creed: Mirage, even in the middle of quests, so take advantage of it if you can.\n"}
{"title": "All Ditto Disguises In Pokémon GO (October 2023)", "date": "2023-10-05 10:00:27", "text": "In Pokémon GO, as of October 2023, Ditto has eight different common Pokémon it can appear as in the wild, ranging from Generations 1 to 6.\nThe hunt for a Ditto in Pokémon GO is one of patience, luck, and travel. Dittos don't appear like most Pokémon. In fact, when you're out walking, you won't see a single Ditto. Dittos disguise themselves as a different set of Pokémon every month. If you're lucky, one of these Pokémon will transform into a Ditto after capture.\nShiny Dittos are even rarer than their regular counterparts. If you catch a shiny Pokémon, it is guaranteed to not be a Ditto. Shiny Dittos have the same disguises as regular Dittos. The shiny spawn rates for a Ditto are about equal to those of rare spawns. There are eight different Pokémon that could secretly be Ditto.\nDitto's disguises are spread between generations 1 through 6, with two Pokémon in Generation 1 and two in Generation 5. Nintendo last updated Ditto's disguise list during the March 2023 Let's GO/Team GO Rocket Takeover. Each copy behaves under the same rules as a real Pokémon of its type, despite being a Ditto.\nThe two Generation 1 Pokémon that Ditto likes to disguise itself as are Diglett and Grimer. As Generation 1 Pokémon, both of these are common in the wild and easy to track. Diglett is the safer bet of the pair, as it loves to spawn in wide-open spaces. This makes it easy for more players to catch Digletts and maybe find their first Ditto.\nSnubbull represents Generation 2 in the disguise line-up and is the only Fairy-type Pokémon on the list. Snubbull's followed up by Generation 3's Corphish, who got an upgrade in September 2023. Corphish now has Razor Shell in its move collection. If bulldogs and crabs aren't your style, you can look for a Starly, Ditto's Generation 4 disguise.\nRoggenrola and Tympole are both Generation 5 Pokémon and more disguise options for Ditto. Roggenrola is usually stronger than Tympole, so if you want to farm one of these two, Roggenrola would be more worthwhile to collect, just in case you find one you'd like to add to your permanent collection. The last character Ditto can turn into in Pokémon GO is Litleo, the humble lion from Generation 6. Litleo is an excellent pick for any Pokémon master building a team off of cuteness due to its big eyes and feline appearance.\nIf you want to increase your chances of finding a Ditto in Pokémon GO, keep an eye on your Nearby tab. If you find one of these eight Pokémon on the list, hurry to their location as quickly as you can. It may take a while, but if you focus your catching efforts on these Pokémon, you may find a Ditto sooner than you think.\n"}

Whatever your reason, whether it's to assist you in a difficult part of the game, unlock certain endings, or outfit your V with the best gear, console commands can make it happen. The possibilities of what you can accomplish with console commands are practically limitless.\nOn the other hand, console commands aren't always about acquiring the best Cyberpunk 2077 weapons, Cyberware, and vehicles or unlocking every possible ending. Sometimes, they're used as a quality-of-life mod. For example, removing the encumbrance on V so that you can spam pick up useless items to your heart's content. Even if console commands aren't your cup of tea, everyone can benefit from them in Cyberpunk 2077.\nRelated: Cyberpunk 2077: Ranking Every Possible Ending From Worst To Best\nAlthough update 2.0 brought many improvements and modifications to Cyberpunk 2077, a console command window was not one of them. As a result, you will need to install the Cyber Engine Tweaks mod by Yamashi to use console commands and cheats in the game. The mod itself has been updated to support Cyberpunk 2077 2.0. And, once downloaded, it's as simple as pressing the Tilda key (~) in-game to open the console commands menu.\nYou can use the Cyber Engine Tweaks mod for other applications, such as a UI, to configure other mods, set up hotkeys, and turn on/off certain game settings you would not otherwise have access to.\nUnfortunately, it's limited to PC players because you must download Cyber Engine Tweaks to access console commands. In other words, Xbox and PlayStation users cannot access or use console commands in Cyberpunk 2077.\nAlthough console commands have many applications in Cyberpunk 2077, most players immediately gravitate toward cheats. Cheats are commands that change your character's performance, such as adding unfathomable amounts of health, money, or XP to them. Here are some of the best console commands and cheats using the Cyber Engine Tweaks mod - though it's merely scratching the surface.\nConsole Command\nWhat It Does\nGame.AddToInventory(\"items.money\", 100000)\nAdds 100,000 Credits into your pocket.\nGame.ModStatPlayer(\"Health\", \"100\")\nAdds health points to V.\nGame.ModStatPlayer(\"Armor\", \"100\")\nAdds armor points to V.\nGame.ModStatPlayer(\"CarryCapacity\", \"100\")\nIncreased V's max carrying capacity.\nGame.InfiniteStamina(true)\nGrants V infinite stamina.\nGame.SetLevel(“Level”, x)\nLet's you change V's in-game level.\nGame.SetLevel(\"StreetCred\",x,1)\nLet's you change V's Street Cred level.\nvs = Game.GetVehicleSystem ()\nOpens the command to allow players to unlock every vehicle in the game.\nvs:EnableAllPlayerVehicles()\nThe player unlocks all the vehicles in the game.\nGame.AddToInventory(\"Items.QuickHackLegendaryMaterial1\", 10000\nAdds 10,000 Tier 5 Quickhack Components to V's inventory.\nGame.AddToInventory(\"Items.CWCapacityPermaReward_Legendary\")\nInstalls a legendary Cyberware Capacity Shard.\nGame.PrevSys_off()\nTurns off getting wanted by the police.\nGame.AddToInventory(\"Items.PerkPointSkillbook\")\nGrants V one perk point.\nAny console command that ends with a numerical value can be modified. For instance - Game.AddToInventory(\"items.money\", 100000) - that 100,000 can be changed to 200,000, 300,000, and so on. Furthermore, if a command ends with an \"X,\" it means you must include your own numerical value of what you want, such as Game.SetLevel(\"Level\", x).\nAlthough these are some of the best console commands and cheats from the Cyber Engine Tweaks mod, it's not nearly all of them. In fact, there are thousands of commands and cheats at your disposal with this mod, all of which can be found online.\nYou can find commands and cheats on that list for practically everything. There are commands for acquiring every weapon, such as the best Katanas. Alternatively, acquiring certain pieces of clothing, such as David's Jacket in Cyberpunk 2077. What's more, unlocking Cyberware, vehicles, weapon mods, and anything else contributes to a more memorable experience in Cyberpunk 2077.\nSource: NexusMods/Yamashi\nRiley grew up in the golden era of Xbox vs PlayStation and has fallen in love with RPGs and action-adventure games as a result.

However, as the story progresses you can choose to become truly loyal and betray your UC Sysdef handlers. This is a stand-alone questline and does not interfere with joining any other faction.\nThe Crimson Fleet will not invite you directly.

{"title": "Assassin's Creed Mirage Map Size: How Big Is AC Mirage?", "date": "2023-10-05 11:00:26", "text": "Assassin's Creed Mirage returns to the franchise's roots with a smaller title set in a stunning recreation of 9th-century Baghdad.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage has been a return to the franchise's roots, with a smaller, more stealth-focused title set in a stunning recreation of Baghdad in the year 861. The title tells the origin of Basim Ibn Ishaq, a character who was introduced in the franchise's last title, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, by which time he was already a Master Assassin on his travels to Norway​​​​​.\nAssasin's Creed Mirage's story brings the series back by returning to the Middle East. Many years before Altair's story in the first Assassin's Creed, which took place during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land (modern-day Israel, Palestine, and Syria), a 17-year-old Basim worked alongside his mentor, Roshan. He would go on to grow from being a common street thief in Baghdad to a fully-fledged member of the Hidden Ones by taking down members of The Order of the Ancients.\nRelated: \"A True Return To The Series' Best\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Preview\nAssassin's Creed Mirage's developers compared the game's map to previous entries in the long-running series during 2023's Summer Game Fest. During this interview, Ubisoft stated that Assassin's Creed Mirage's depiction of Baghdad would be similar in scale to Constantinople in 2011's Assassin's Creed Revelations and Paris in 2014's Assassin's Creed Unity. However, these maps varied quite significantly in size. The Constantinople map was 0.94 km², whereas Assassin's Creed Unity took advantage of the improved hardware available with the release of the PS4 and Xbox One and offered a hugely detailed Paris map more than twice as large at 2.40 km².\nThis comparison was presumably intended to point out a difference between the scale of Assassin's Creed Mirage and the massive maps of the franchise's last three mainline entries, Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla. After years of the franchise using a similar formula with annual releases, Ubisoft opted to change the direction of the series by adding more ARPG elements and showcasing huge open-world maps consisting of parts of Egypt, Greece, Norway, and England. Valhalla's total map size came in at over 99.7 km², which is a far cry from the likes of Revelations and Unity.\nWhile this change has received praise from many, there are members of the Assassin's Creed fandom who have complained that these games feel too large for their own good and would rather see the series return to its roots. Fortunately, Ubisoft seems to be catering to both parts of the fanbase with smaller, stealth-heavy titles like Assassin's Creed Mirage and larger ARPG titles like the upcoming Japan-based Assassin's Creed: Codename Red in the coming years.\nRelated: \"What [Players] Loved First\" - Simon Arseneault On Assassin's Creed Mirage\nAssassin's Creed Mirage's Baghdad map will be around 2.30 km², which is nearer to the size of Assassin's Creed Unity's Paris than Assassin's Creed Revelations' Constantinople. Previously, images of the game's physical copies — some of which included a physical map — revealed that players could visit the surrounding areas outside the city, such as the Abbasiyah, Harbiyah, and Karkh districts, and Alamut. The latter of which should be familiar to long-term fans of the franchise as a major stronghold of the Hidden Ones and Assassins.\nThis led YouTuber DG VFX to make calculations using gameplay footage objective markers. According to these calculations, Assassin's Creed Mirage's total map size is 45 km², with the playable area being 13 km². This makes the game larger than both of the titles Ubisoft previously compared it to, but fortunately, much smaller and more manageable than entries such as Odyssey or Valhalla​​​​.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nWhile the Assassin's Creed series does have its mythical and fantasy elements, it has also been known for its incredibly detailed reconstructions of real-world locations. The most famous example was when Assassin's Creed Unity's depiction of Notre Dame was used to assist in rebuilding the real Paris landmark after a structural fire in April 2019. Ubisoft and its team of designers, artists, and historians who had spent years researching and recreating the cathedral and offered its 3D model to the French government and other organizations involved in the effort. The company also pledged to donate half a million Euros to help with the restoration and encouraged fans to donate as well.\nTherefore, it should come as no surprise that Assassin's Creed Mirage's depiction of Baghdad is following this trend. Assassin's Creed Mirage's Art Director, Jean-Luc Sala — who has a personal connection to the location, having grown up on the other side of the Tigris River from Baghdad in Iran before moving when he was 11 — had previously spoken on the challenge of recreating a 9th-century version of the Iraqi capital with Gamesradar+.\nThe main challenges stemmed from the fact that Baghdad during that time was technically a lost city after being burned down by the Mongols in the 13th Century. Therefore, little is known about the location in that era, and historians actually wished the team at Ubisoft Bordeaux luck with their recreation, warning them that the lack of information would be \"problematic.\"\nThis didn't deter the team, however, who continued to work with historians and scholars around the globe to piece together as much knowledge as they could from archeology and references in literature to recreate the location as faithfully as possible. Sala stated, \"It's not 100% accurate, but this is the best it can show,\" and explained that historians can now use the game's 3D model to talk more about the subject.\nAccording to Sala, Dr. Ali A. Olomi, the esteemed historian of the Middle East and Islamic history, was \"like a kid\" when Ubisoft showed him around Assassin's Creed Mirage's recreation of Baghdad. Olomi had spent his life studying that period and that city, and therefore, Sala stated that it was an incredibly \"emotional\" experience for both the professor and the developers, showing that Ubisoft's hard work and dedication had truly paid off.\nTherefore, while Assassin's Creed Mirage's map may be smaller than other games in the series, it has plenty for players to explore. With the game taking place during what historians have referred to as the Golden Age of Islam, it should also offer a unique experience for those wishing to visit a previously unseen version of Baghdad and its surrounding areas via Basim's story and one that's extremely different from most modern depictions of the Middle East.\nSource: DG VFX/YouTube, Gamesradar+\n"}

The fact that Ben has no recollection of three years passing is a true — I could go nerd out on you and talk Einstein’s theories of time-space continuums, but the reality is he now has to deal with everybody else’s life went on. Where is Addison? What is she dealing with? That mourning and that loss or the belief of that loss and how she kept herself together and the fact that she now has to face somebody that she thought was gone forever is a huge journey for not just Addison, [but also] for Ian, Magic, and Jenn because suddenly they have a chance to bring him home.”\nRelated: Quantum Leap Season 1 Ending & Time Travel Twists Explained (In Detail)\nThe premiere episode saves the clarification on Ben's twist until the last moment. After successfully completing the objective behind his leap, Ian finds Ben. The emotion of their reunion is short-lived, as Ben has all sorts of questions. Ben observes that Ian looks different and is wearing a forlorn expression. With hesitance, Ian shares the reality of the situation: It's been three years. Ben is thought to be dead. The Quantum Leap project is shut down.\nBefore Ben can even process the information, he's sent away on another leap as the NBC reboot balances its weekly stories with the larger overall arc. But in terms of that overall arc, Ben now has a closer connection to Scott Bakula’s Sam Beckett. The updated series has been focused on figuring out what happened to Beckett, who also vanished in the original series. Ben will presumably now learn for himself what that experience can be like.\nThere's also the question of how the new characters will impact the story. There's Hannah Carson, played by The 100 alum Eliza Taylor, a complex woman \"who is more than she appears to be.\" Quantum Leap season 2 trailers reveal that Hannah knows about Ben's secret, which could suggest that the three-year gap has a lasting impact on the team. It could be the case that they'll struggle to get close again.\nSource: TV Insider\nAbdullah Al-Ghamdi joined Screen Rant in 2019.

{"title": "The X-Men's Biggest MCU Challenge Was Subtly Set Up A Year Ago", "date": "2023-10-05 12:00:27", "text": "The smooth introduction of the X-Men faces a lot of challenges, but something that was set up in a movie one year ago might have helped with this.\nWhile the details of the X-Men group's arrival in the MCU remain unclear, a solution to one of the biggest challenges may have been set up a year ago. With theories abounding over how the X-Men will finally make a full appearance in the MCU timeline, there are many questions that need answering, including how the typical air of distrust between mutants and humans will be justified. It is a narratively messy plot point that even plagues the comics, as the difference between mutants and other super beings is often tenuous.\nUntil now, the humans of Earth that don't possess superpowers or galaxy-sized brains have very little reason to distrust their super-powered protectors. The Blip, the Battle of Earth, and many other humanity-saving feats have all but cemented the Avengers and their ilk as protectors of Earth and bona fide celebrities. Although the argument could be made that they entice the trouble they then defend against, the consensus seems to be that without the likes of the Avengers, humanity would be doomed. It surely stands to reason, then, that the mutants would be seen in the same way.\nRelated: Marvel's X-Men Movie: Everything We Know\nThe MCU's biggest challenge with regard to the X-Men now (aside from explaining away their absence over the last several years) is differentiating them from other super-powered beings that have won the hearts and minds of the general population. This could be done through the public vilification of the main villain in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Namor, the MCU's oldest mutant. Aside from inflicting a lot of damage to Wakanda itself, he and the Talokanil had grander designs: to take control of Earth with Wakanda's aid.\nNamor's bad relationship with humankind could be the springboard the MCU needs to stoke resentment against those who call themselves \"mutants.\" The term has not been thrown around too often in the MCU, leaving it wide open to being co-opted by just about anyone looking to besmirch the innocence of mutantkind. Namor could then be the perfect target of a smear campaign against any who would call themselves \"mutants,\" suggesting that any who do so ascribe to the same nefarious anti-human sentiments as Namor. Then all that's required is for Magneto to further widen the rift between mutants and humankind by giving credence to their fears.\nPart of the central themes of the X-Men lore is how they can be ostracized from society due to their unique set of gifts. This is, after all, the driving force behind Magneto and his team of \"bad guys,\" as many retaliate against the bigotry of human beings who consider themselves to be \"normal.\" The theme opens up a plethora of storytelling possibilities, sympathetic villains, and allegories that stand the test of time and help to make the X-Men as popular as it is today. As a group, the X-Men represent a safe haven for their kind, and their fight against those who consider mutants to be either inferior or superior to humans is central to their existence, and something the MCU will need to embrace.\nOllie discovered his love for all things nerdy very early on in life and has only gotten nerdier with age after only discovering the magic of Dungeons & Dragons in his 30s.

{"title": "Dave Filoni Is Completing The Massive Star Wars Story He Started 12 Years Ago", "date": "2023-10-05 12:00:27", "text": "The Ahsoka finale has set up the completion of a massive story arc Dave Filoni started 12 years ago, continuing it from animation to live-action.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nDave Filoni has re-introduced a massive Star Wars story in the Ahsoka finale that he first started 12 years ago, and it has huge implications for the future of the galaxy. The course of Ahsoka season 1 has drawn upon plenty of characters, moments, and other story threads that Filoni first debuted in animation, largely due to the fact that most of Ahsoka Tano's (Rosario Dawson) story has occurred in animation up to this point. Now, the finale of the Star Wars Disney+ TV show has tied the two mediums even more closely together.\nMuch of the interest and intrigue of Ahsoka season 1 lingered with Ray Stevenson's Baylan Skoll, and what power or entity the dark Jedi kept sensing on Peridea. He told his apprentice Shin Hati throughout the series that he heard it calling to him even before they made it to Peridea, and he described it as some kind of \"beginning\" - a way to end the cycle of Jedi versus Sith. It's now been revealed that it was the Mortis gods calling to him, and their origin goes all the way back to an animated Star Wars series.\nThe Mortis arc was a part of Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 3, which saw Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka, and Obi-Wan Kenobi all mysteriously stranded on the mystical planet with three Force-gods. This is how Ahsoka ended up being tied so closely to the Daughter, the Force-goddess who gave her life so that Ahsoka could live. The Mortis gods were also seen in Star Wars Rebels season 4, as they opened a gate for Ezra Bridger into the World Between Worlds. Now, 12 years after this The Clone Wars arc first premiered, Filoni is continuing its story.\nNot only is Baylan last seen standing on the hand of a statue of the Father, but Ahsoka is also visited by her convor Morai, the owl who's been connected to her ever since the Daughter sacrificed her life for Ahsoka's. The stone statue of the Daughter is also the only one on Peridea that's destroyed, as both the Father and the Son still remain standing. Many viewers have thought this could be pointing towards an introduction to Abeloth, the Mother who was overcome with darkness when she tried to gain the same immortal powers as her family.\nRelated: When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline\nEither way, there's no doubt Filoni plans on completing his massive Star Wars story centered around Mortis in the near future. Ahsoka season 2 hasn't yet been confirmed, and even if it doesn't happen, this story could be told in Filoni's The Mandalorian-era movie. All roads for the future of Ahsoka are leading directly back to Mortis, and given its importance in The Clone Wars arc where it first debuted, what unfolds next with have a huge impact on the fate of the Star Wars galaxy.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are now streaming on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "10 Best PlayStyles in EA Sports FC 24", "date": "2023-10-05 12:00:27", "text": "PlayStyles are the latest addition to Ultimate Team in EA Sports FC 24, giving specific boosts to the top stars reflecting their real life abilities. \nEA Sports FC 24 is here and the latest title in the series sees the introduction of PlayStyles to separate the very Elite footballers. Replacing the previous Traits system, PlayStyles-specific attributes have been given to the best players in EA Sports FC 24 to boost aspects of their play on the pitch. In addition, PlayStyles+ takes it to another level with certain players, such as Marcus Rashford with a Power Shot, receiving an even bigger boost, making these stars more valuable to players in Ultimate Team.\nCards in Ultimate Team can learn new PlayStyles by completing Evolutions, allowing you to tailor your own abilities to the best players if they don't automatically start with one. Combining this with the updated Chemistry system in EA Sports FC 24 gives you freedom when building a team. In total, there are 34 PlayStyles, all tied to certain aspects of play on the pitch, Scoring, Passing, Ball Control, Defending, Physical, and Goalkeeper. Here are the 10 best PlayStyles currently in EA Sports FC 24.\nRelated: EA Sports 24: Release Date, Editions, & Pre-Order Bonuses\nThere are lots of passing-based PlayStyles that midfielders can especially take advantage of, including Pinged Pass. It increases the speed at which passes travel to their target without making it harder for the receiver to control the ball. While the best passes of the ball can already do this, if they have this PlayStyle it can open up teams quicker. It also gives you opportunities to play longer balls, that would normally be intercepted with ease.\nThe dead ball PlayStyle does exactly what it says on the tin. While most players online tend to play the ball short from free-kicks around the edge of the box, it can be worth having a player with this trait in your team to have direct shots on goal.\nThe accuracy of free kicks and the line that is drawn on the screen showing the ball path are both increased, meaning if you know what you are doing you can score a high percentage of the time with them. While free-kicks do take practice, having a Dead Ball specialist can make the difference in tight games.\nSpeed has always been a key attribute across sports titles and those players with the Rapid attribute have an even greater increased speed. They are also able to keep control of the ball while dribbling at a higher speed. Top stars such as Kylian Mbappe have the Rapid PlayStyle and it will make them even harder to stop this year.\nCombining this with other PlayStyles has the potential to change a number of stars to become overpowered cards and the majority of those playing online will look to take advantage of this.\nThe Technical PlayStyle increases speed during Controlled Sprints and enables precise wide turns while dribbling. Dribbling is more effective in EA Sports FC 24 than in previous entries in the series, which makes the Technical PlayStyle even more powerful. Players such as Lionel Messi, who already excel at close-control dribbling, are now even harder to take the ball off.\nLast-second movements with the ball can give players that opening to pass or shoot and this PlayStyle will allow that.\nIn the late stages of matches, stamina plays a huge role, with players struggling to stay at top speeds the longer the game lasts. The Relentless PlayStyle reduces fatigue loss during the game and gives players more of a boost at half-time. A great option for those in the middle of the park, it can make a huge difference in the final ten minutes or in any games that go into extra time.\nInterceptions are a key part of football and can make a huge difference in matches on EA Sports FC 24. The PlayStyle increases the chance to intercept a ball, as well as the distance a ball can be intercepted. Players automatically intercept well in this year's game and this takes it to another level.\nHaving this on a defensive midfielder can pick off a lot of dangerous passes and in turn start a counter-attack quickly.\nSkill Stars have previously determined what special moves a player can make in the FIFA series. However, the new Trickster PlayStyle enables the execution of unique flick Skill Moves. For those who like to show off on the field including a player with this PlayStyle will open up new options and ways to beat defenders.\nLots of the top stars including Heroes and Legends available in EA Sports FC 24 have the Trickster ability, so for those who can afford them, they are worth it.\nWhile several of the best defensive players are already capable of blocking a lot of shots, those with the Block PlayStyle, such as Liverpool defender Virgil Van Dijk, have enhanced blocking range and an increased success rate of blocks. Like interceptions, a lot of this will be done automatically when defending, but those with the PlayStyle will feel impassively for the opposition. When using players with the Block ability, no extra action needs to be taken, but their presence when defending will be felt.\nFor a number of years, Finesse Shots have been overpowered in the FIFA series. On certain games in particular any shots from around the edge of the box would fly into the top corner. While this isn't the case with normal Finesse Shots in EA Sports FC 24, those with the PlayStyle attribute can score from a host of different positions and angles.\nChelsea's star striker Sam Kerr is one such player to have this PlayStyle and if you give her room to shoot outside the box it could easily end up in the top corner.\nWhile all of the PlayStyles have their uses, the Power Shot is the best and most effective. In the most important areas on the pitch, Power Shots can be extremely effective, but they take time and space to use. With this PlayStyle players will shoot faster, meaning defenders will have less time to react.\nPower Shots, if on target, are rarely saved by goalkeepers and this will allow you to get your shots off quicker in EA Sports FC 24.\nSimon is a Gaming Guides writer for ScreenRant focusing on FIFA and Pokemon.

Debuting in 2021, the Showtime original horror series follows the girls of the WHS Yellowjackets soccer team as their plane crashes in the Canadian wilderness, and have to resort to extreme measures to survive. The series also follows some of the girls 25 years later as they are still dealing with the fallout of their dark past. Endlessly creepy and brilliantly acted, Yellowjackets only got better in its second season, despite some very conspicuous changes to the main cast.\nThe character of Akilah is only featured in the flashback storyline, but her deft Girl Scouts abilities made her something of a team leader despite their obvious limitations. It hasn't been revealed what was the ultimate fate of Akilah in the Yellowjackets timeline, but it could be speculated that she didn't make it judging by the fact that she has not appeared in the present day. The role was originally played by Keeya King, a Canadian actor who gained acclaim for playing the role of Violet in the Syfy Channel series Van Helsing. Recasting on TV is common, but the sudden change was an odd departure for the creepy series.\nFans of Yellowjackets immediately noticed a change to the supporting cast of the series when Keeya King was replaced by Nia Sondaya in the role of Akilah for season 2. As previously stated, recasting is a common practice in TV, but the departure of King was never officially explained by those involved with the show. However, Sondaya proved herself to be just as capable in the role as she grew the character who teetered between sanity and madness as she found herself swept up in the frenzy of the other girls.\nAkilah in season 2 went from just a helpful rookie with a bit of Girl Scouts experience, to a full-fledged character as she became a follower in the group's eventual descent into cannibalism. The ending of Yellowjackets season 2 left Akilah in a fascinating position, and she will likely grow more when season 3 finally rolls around and the season might also reveal her final fate. As for King's departure, it could have simply been a matter of scheduling, since the talented young actor has been quite busy since she left the cast of Yellowjackets after season 1.\nRELATED: Yellowjackets Season 2 New Cast & Returning Character Guide\nA consummate show business workhorse, Keeya King has kept herself quite busy since leaving Yellowjackets, and she has seen the size of many of her roles increase since playing in the prestigious series. In 2022, King starred in the Tubi TV original thriller film Rush For Your Life where she played journalism student Tasha who goes undercover to expose the secrets of her college's sororities. In the same year, she played the small role of Nikki in the Bruce Willis-led geezer teaser action film, Detective Knight: Rogue.\nKing's final role in 2022 was a three-episode stint on the Canadian legal drama Diggstown, and she landed another film role in 2023 when she starred in Pride: Seven Deadly Sins, a TV movie. In the Lifetime original, King played the role of Ella, which once again allowed her to expand her horizons as a dramatic actor. While she has yet to star in a project that has rivaled Yellowjackets on its critical success since she departed, it's clear that Keeya King has no issues getting work.\nDalton is a freelance writer, novelist, and filmmaker from Orlando Florida.

With her power to rearrange the molecular structure of all matter, Atom Eve is one of most powerful heroes in any universe, something that is shown off to stunning effect in new cosplay honoring one of Invincible’s premiere superheroes.\nShared via Instagram by photographer Pat Loika, the photos depict cosplayer Kira Kelly mid-flight as Atom Eve.\nCreated by Robert Kirkman and Corey Walker, Eve’s classic superhero design is perfectly captured by Kelly's cosplay, with its bright, primary colors and a simplistic silhouette. Check out Loika and Kelly’s brilliant work below.\nRelated: Invincible's Last Line Redefines the Meaning of Omni-Man's \"Think, Mark!\" Speech\nRunning for 144 issues, Invincible was one of the most popular independent comics of the past several decades. The story of teenager Mark Grayson, son of the world's most famous superhero, featured the character following in the footsteps of his father Omni-Man, becoming the eponymous \"Invincible.\" Atom Eve is depicted throughout Invincible as Mark's one true love, a hero as formidably powerful himself, and a strong, capable love interest. Cosplayer Kira Kelly delightfully brings Eve to life, with some excellent Photoshop effects completing the effect, allowing Atom Eve to show off her matter manipulation powers with some swirling atom energy designs.\nInvincible was notable in how it followed its characters in real time, staying with Mark as he graduated from high school, went off to college, and eventually settled down and started a family with Atom Eve. In a world dominated by Marvel and DC, Invincible's ability to build its own universe of superheroes to stand alongside the Big Two was a remarkable achievement.The world of Invincible was filled with heroes and villains who felt iconic the way the best Marvel and DC characters do. There’s Atom Eve, of course, along with fellow heroes in the original Teen Team, like Robot, Dupli-Kate, Monster Girl and Atom Eve’s original boyfriend, Rex Splode.\nUnlike the Marvel and DC universes, these characters were able to grow and change in real time, making them feel like real people who were living actual lives on the page. This is one reason why Atom Eve and Invincible’s story resonates with so many readers, and why Kira Kelly's collaboration with Pat Loika, bringing to life a dynamic representation of Atom Eve, is one of the most engaging cosplays of the year. With Invincible having a second life thanks to its current Amazon Prime Video adaptation, the series' characters are still at the forefront of many fans memories, something Loika and Kelly's cosplay expertly taps into.\nSource: Pat Loika, Kira Kelly\n"}

These songs serve as a musical canvas for the darker and more complex characters in the Disney roster, allowing them to express their nefarious intentions with style and flair. These songs often encapsulate characters' motivations, fears, and aspirations, becoming integral to the overall narrative.\nAs proven by the best Disney songs of all time, the emotional depth conveyed through music allows audiences to more profoundly connect with the characters - even if they're extremely nefarious villains. Disney songs that reveal the villains' innermost desires convey just the right amount of context for adults - without crossing the line in movies made primarily for children. Both enthralling and disturbing, iconic Disney villain songs are a testament to the studio's ability to infuse even the darkest characters with a certain charm. In the musical world of Disney movies, even the most evil of villains have a chance to steal the spotlight with their wickedly enchanting melodies.\nRelated: 10 Animated Disney Movies With The Most Songs, Ranked\nThough The Jungle Book's King Louie isn't much of an antagonist, he's still technically a Disney villain, and his song is inarguably better than any other villainous tunes in the movie. Performed with lively flair, \"I Wanna Be Like You\" is a whimsical plea from the smooth-talking orangutan to Mowgli, expressing a desire to learn the secret of humanity's fire, in order to become more like humans.  \"I Wanna Be Like You\" is notable for its catchy beat, tune, and infectious rhythm with swing jazz elements, and King Louie's performance effortlessly captures the essence of fun and mischief prevalent throughout The Jungle Book.\nPerformed by the lovable bear Little John, one of the most likable members of the Robin Hood cast, \"The Phony King of England\" is a good old medieval hoedown. It isn't sang by a villain, but it's about the movie's main antagonist, the self-serving lion Prince John. A lively and humorous tune that explains the relationship between the common folk and their cowardly lion monarch, the song encapsulates the film's theme of standing up against injustice. \"The Phony King of England\" isn't that well-known compared to other iconic Disney villain songs, but it's quite a clever and well-disguised nod to folk protest songs in the real world.\nSang by the villainous Brom Bones, this song narrates the legend of the Headless Horseman, a ghostly rider seeking a replacement for his missing head in The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad. The eerie and ominous lyrics create a sense of foreboding and excitement, combined with a darkly melodic traditional pop tune that balances the themes. The song is also performed by the legendary Bing Crosby, who voices not just Brom, but also the narrator and Ichabod Crane in the movie. Largely underrated, both \"Headless Horseman\" and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad went on to inspire Disney's latter, more famous musical numbers.\n\"You're Only Second Rate\" from The Return of Jafar is performed by the charismatic antagonist Jafar himself. This song unfolds as Jafar, having returned in his quest for revenge, revels in his wickedness, malevolence, and magical prowess. In the signature style of the Aladdin franchise, the song combines Arabian influences with a Western orchestra, the perfect epic backdrop to a villain of Jafar's stature. Genie is on the unfortunate receiving end of \"You're Only Second Rate,\" and apart from the clever wordplay being funny and entertaining, it also underscores how easily Jafar can dominate Genie in a contest of magic - making the villain all the more frightening.\nRelated: Aladdin 2: The Return Of Jafar Is The Best Disney Sequel\nCruella de Vil doesn't sing her eponymous song in 101 Dalmatians. Instead, video game designer Roger comes up with \"Cruella de Vil\" on the spot at home, as his wife Anita's boss Cruella comes over for a visit. While trying to come up with the lyrics for a jazzy melody, Roger gets inspired by Cruella's impending presence, resulting in a darkly humorous and smooth tune that uses Cruella's own name as its catchy hook. With Roger's voice, the rhythm of the song is hypnotic, and serves as the perfect introduction to one of the most evil, memorable, and complete villains in Disney history.\nRelated: All 101 Dalmatian & Cruella Movies Ranked, Worst To Best\n\"Mine, Mine, Mine\" from Pocahontas is a bold and brassy musical number that epitomizes the greedy ambitions of Governor Ratcliffe. In this song, Ratcliffe expresses his desire for gold and riches as they embark on a journey to the New World - and even betrays Ratcliffe's true intentions of somehow claiming the British throne. The upbeat tempo and triumphant orchestration highlight Ratcliffe's imperialistic mindset and unchecked avarice, contrasting sharply with the film's themes of harmony and understanding. The lyrics emphasize the conquering mentality of the colonial expedition, echoing the historical narratives on which the film is based.\n\"Be Prepared\" from The Lion King is secretly one of the darkest moments hidden in a '90s children's movie. With Scar explaining his evil and meticulous plans while assembling his army, \"Be Prepared\" is an epic war anthem that illustrates Scar's cunning nature and the impending threat he poses to the Pride Lands. What's even darker is that the song was inspired by The Lion King artist Jorgen Klubein sketching Scar as Adolf Hitler. After seeing this sketch, the directors where inspired to use scenes from the Nazi propaganda film Triumph of the Will in order to give chilling life to the marching scenes in \"Be Prepared.\"\nWith its New Orleans jazz-inspired vocals and riffs, \"Oogie Boogie's Song\" set a new high standard for catchy Disney tunes - while also being perfectly suited to giving the villainous Oogie Boogie his most crucial moment in the film. One of the best songs from The Nightmare Before Christmas, \"Oogie Boogie's Song\" is an aptly soulful gem sang by the eponymous boogeyman of Halloween Town. The song is a lively, swing-inspired piece with dark undertones, blending whimsy and malevolence seamlessly, just like Oogie Boogie himself. The epitome of macabre and charming, this tune deserves the praises it has garnered over the years.\n\"Gaston\" from Beauty and the Beast is a boisterous and humorous musical number that serves as an ode to the film's primary antagonist, Gaston. Performed by Gaston himself and his fawning sidekick LeFou, the song celebrates Gaston's egoistic and testosterone-driven prowess. The upbeat and lively tune, accompanied by a tavern full of enthusiastic townsfolk, creates a jovial atmosphere that contrasts with the film's more somber moments. The lyrics humorously highlight Gaston's exaggerated self-confidence and how he's idolized by the locals, hinting at an antihero underneath the comically arrogant figure. Contextualized with the plot of Beauty and the Beast, \"Gaston\" highlights the eponymous villain's underappreciated complexity.\nRelated: 10 Disney Villains Who Were Almost Heroes\n\"Hellfire\" from The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a dark and haunting masterpiece that briefly but deeply dives into themes of lust and obsession. In a raw reveal of the character's most turbulent inner conflicts, Frollo's powerful vocals convey a sense of torment as he grapples with his forbidden desires for Esmeralda. The intense orchestration, chilling lyrics, and overall stark dramatic flair perfectly capture Frollo's struggle with its own sense of morality. \"Hellfire\" stands as a unique Disney song, pushing boundaries and exploring darker aspects, showcasing the versatility of the studio's musical repertoire.\nThe Princess and the Frog's \"Friends on the Other Side\" is sang by Dr. Facilier, arguably the most underrated Disney villain of all time. Dr. Facilier uses the catchy jazz-inspired tune to revel in his role - as an intermediary between the world of the living and the dead. From parlor tricks to actual glimpses into the other side, Dr. Facilier wows the naive and selfish Prince Naveen - and corners him into making a deal. After \"Oogie Boogie's Song\" raised the standard for soulfal jazz in Disney musical numbers, Dr. Facilier's \"Friends on the Other Side\" answered the call with this smooth, sultry, and cajun-flavored ode to voodoo.\n\"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" from The Little Mermaid is a spellbinding showcase of villainy sung by the sea witch Ursula. The song begins with Ursula telling Ariel about how she uses her powers to help the unfortunate - but it ends in Ursula's Faustian bargain to transform Ariel into a human in exchange for her voice. The sultry melody, coupled with Ursula's tongue-twisting verses and clever wordplay, captures the character's cunning nature. One of the most iconic Disney villain songs of all time, \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\" is a haunting anthem about making a deal with the devil - but from the devil's abyssal point of view.\n"}
{"title": "One Small Baldur's Gate 3 Decision Makes The Battle At Last Light Inn So Much Easier", "date": "2023-10-05 12:00:27", "text": "The battle at Last Light Inn can be a challenging obstacle in Act 2 of Baldur's Gate 3, but it's possible to smooth things over with one choice.\nThe battle at Last Light Inn can be a challenging and even frustrating encounter in Act 2 of Baldur's Gate 3, but it doesn't have to be. As a deep, choice-driven roleplaying game, Baldur's Gate 3 is all about offering multiple approaches to overcoming the hurdles that it presents throughout the story. Some enemies can be defeated through persuasion rather than battlefield prowess, and certain encounters may never even arise depending on the decisions made beforehand. The ability to choose the order in which the party does many tasks can also be a great way to dodge certain complications that only arise with specific sequencing.\nLast Light Inn is a rare beacon of safety in the Shadow-Cursed Lands of Baldur's Gate 3, but the battle that occurs there threatens that sanctified nature. The Selûnite cleric Isobel provides the protection for the inn through the power of her goddess, and when the Flaming Fist traitor Marcus comes to take her away, the inn will lose that protection entirely. Avoiding this outcome in the battle requires the party to keep Isobel on her feet, a task that can be tricky given her inclination toward exposing herself to danger.\nRelated: Baldur's Gate 3: Should You Save Isobel Or Side With Marcus At The Last Light Inn?\nIt seems counter-intuitive to suggest avoiding a story encounter in Baldur's Gate 3, but when it comes to the Last Light Inn, it can actually be a viable plan. Marcus' arrival at the inn is a planned cutscene moment rather than a background activity in the world, meaning that the party has to initiate a conversation with Isobel for it to ever occur. Going about other Act 2 business instead of rushing to converse with the cleric has the odd side effect of actually protecting the inn rather than bringing it under threat.\nTaking this approach doesn't mean that the Last Light Inn has to be avoided entirely, as Isobel doesn't lurk the common area waiting to spring a cutscene upon the party. It's fully possible to explore everything else to do in the Last Light Inn before venturing out into the rest of the Shadow-Cursed Lands, as initiating the conversation with Isobel requires entering her room and approaching the porch where she performs a ritual. Although some conversational triggers in Baldur's Gate 3 are easy to initiate by accident, this isn't one of them.\nThe story of Baldur's Gate 3 makes it seem imperative to speak with Isobel, as the Shadow-Cursed Lands feature an oppressive darkness that can easily sap health from the party. Isobel, however, isn't the be-all and end-all for curing this issue. The blessing she gives the party will remove them of their need to use generic light sources like spells or torches for the moderately dangerous areas of the shadow curse, but it doesn't protect against the areas where the problem is deepest, rendering it convenient but unnecessary as a navigational tool.\nThe Moon Lantern is the actual key object for protection against the deepest areas of the shadow curse, and this can be safely acquired without Isobel's involvement. Although certain triggers can induce her to offer it to the party, it can also be acquired by venturing out with the Harpers to defeat a patrol that carries a functional Moon Lantern. This is a manageable fight that doesn't make protecting NPCs either particularly difficult or strictly necessary, so it poses little in the way of an obstacle to comfortable exploration of Baldur's Gate 3 Act 2.\nRelated: How To Get (& Fix) The Moonlantern In Baldur's Gate 3\nThe biggest concern with skipping out on the initial conversation with Isobel at the Last Light Inn would be the amount of Baldur's Gate 3 story content that could be lost by the decision, as ignoring NPCs can sometimes lead to parties missing intriguing side narratives. This method does obviously require the sacrifice of the initial key scene with Isobel, but it doesn't cut off any significant moments later in the story. The party can safely speak with her after carrying out an important mission in the Shadowfell, resulting in a different interaction that would otherwise be missed and putting the story back on the same track.\nThe consequences for this choice come back to haunt Marcus rather than Isobel, resulting in his apparent death at the hands of Ketheric Thorm in Baldur's Gate 3. When it comes to the climactic battles and story beats of Act 2, everything will ultimately sync up with the path of saving Isobel in combat while avoiding the potential risks that the battle can incur. It's undeniably the safest way to ensure that the Last Light Inn doesn't fall in Act 2, making it a reasonable option for anyone who wants to protect everyone while avoiding reloads.\nRelated: Should You Enter The Shadowfell Before Moonrise Towers In Baldur's Gate 3?\nDespite all the advantages of not talking to Isobel, it's ultimately just a surprisingly effective alternative rather than a definitive way to play through Act 2. The main downside to this method is the loss of potential XP from the Last Light battle, which could make later encounters a bit more challenging if it prevented a timely level up. It also doesn't feel quite as seamless in the story, as Act 2 is clearly written around the expectation that parties will speak to Isobel first. The later dialogue option is a nice contingency plan that shows consideration for a different order, but its more of a bandage than anything.\nUltimately, there's no wrong way to approach the story at the Last Light Inn in Baldur's Gate 3, as any technique can lead to interesting outcomes. For parties unwilling to risk the lives of the inn's inhabitants, however, talking to Isobel is the most dangerous decision to make. Various patches have made the inn fight less of a struggle than it was at launch, but no method of protecting the Last Light Inn in Baldur's Gate 3 is as surefire as leaving Isobel to her own devices.\n"}

These Tokens are essential, but at that point, there will be no easy way to find or locate Contracts and the game does not give any hint as to when these will become available. It is not until a certain quest becomes available that Basim can find and complete Contracts.\nDue to returning to stealth-favored mechanics in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage, players will have to find ways to decrease their Notoriety and ask for favors from other characters. These are all connected in the game, and players might find themselves frustrated if they cannot find Contracts to earn the Khidmah Tokens. There is another way to do so, but finding Contracts is by far the easiest method.\nRelated: \"A True Return To The Series' Best\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Preview\nDuring the quest to find Ali ibn Muhammad, Basim will be tasked to regroup at the Bureau after freeing a group of rebels. This will be the point in the game where the Contract Board is available for Basim to peruse. Once it is available, interact with the Contract Board at any Bureau location, and accept any number of Contracts you want. There will usually be around five Contracts available for Basim to accept if he has none selected.\nBasim can accept every single Contract on the Board if he so wishes, and this can allow for more choices when exploring the world. It will also allow you to see where on the map the Contract is and the level of the area it is located in. Players can view more details in the menu.\nTo fulfill a Contract, go to the Investigation screen in the menu, and select “Contracts.” There will be a list of all available Contracts that Basim has accepted, select the one you want to do, and travel to the point on the map. Accepted Contracts can be seen on the map of Baghdad as a pinwheel with a question mark in it.\nOnce Basim is close, he can use Enkidu to mark the exact location and from there complete it like you would any other quest. Optional objectives are tracked from the moment you enter the Quest area to the time you finish the Contract. You will not have to return to the Bureau, instead, Basim receives the rewards as soon as he has finished the job. New Contracts will become available at the Bureau when Basim finishes a Contract on his list, which all allow Basim to explore the city of Baghdad in Assassin's Creed: Mirage.\n"}

Derrickson directed 2016's Doctor Strange, which introduced Benedict Cumberbatch's titular Master of the Mystic Arts to the MCU, and after the Phase 3 film's positive reception, Derrickson was expected to return for the much-anticipated sequel. However, despite a great deal of development on Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness taking place, Derrickson stepped down in January 2020, replaced by Raimi, yet both Derrickson and Marvel Studios noted that they were thankful for their collaboration.\nSpeaking once again in an upcoming episode of The Playlist's The Discourse Podcast, Scott Derrickson reiterated that parting ways with Marvel Studios wasn't filled with animosity. He noted that there is \"no bad blood\" between him, Marvel Studios, and Sam Raimi, though mentioned that his vision for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Marvel Studios' vision didn't match. While Derrickson wanted the sequel to be an \"extreme departure from the first film,\" and \"a genuine horror film of sorts,\" Marvel Studios went in a more light-hearted direction, shedding more light on Elizabeth Olsen's corrupted Scarlet Witch as the villain. Read an excerpt from Derrickson's interview below:\nAll I can say is that what we said publicly is exactly the truth... We had real creative differences. You know, the movie I wanted to make and how I wanted to make it was different than–it was just increasingly obvious that we were pulling against each other. And that’s how you make a really bad movie, I think. When the producer or the studio and the filmmaker are making different movies, you end up with a monstrosity and, you know, that’s why I had to bounce... I went to the premiere. I’m still friends with Kevin [Feige] and everything with me and Marvel is really cool... They invited me to the premiere and I went. And I’m friends with Sam [Raimi]. I love Sam, so there’s no bad blood over that.\n ​​​​​​​\nConcept art from Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness revealed details about Scott Derrickson's original plans, which would have focused on a different villain and provided more insight into Doctor Strange's backstory in the MCU. While Elizabeth Olsen had signed on to be involved in Multiverse of Madness prior to Derrickson's departure, the villain of the film would have been Nightmare, the ruler of Marvel Comics' Dream Dimension. After battling Dormammu, the ruler of the Dark Dimension, in 2016's Doctor Strange, Strange going toe-to-toe with Nightmare in the sequel would have been fantastic, though it seems Strange and the Scarlet Witch would have teamed up against the villain.\nThe original Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness would have also shown audiences Strange's sister, Donna's, tragic death in the Wendigo Forest in their childhood, which was mentioned in Raimi's version of the film. It was also reported that the multiverse would have been explored in far more detail, with Strange traveling to numerous new realities, expanding on the dark, otherworldly multiverse that was glimpsed throughout the first film. Sam Raimi's Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was met with a mixed response, but Derrickson's gritty exploration of Strange's persona, and the MCU's multiverse as a whole, might have been more popular.\nSource: The Playlist\n"}

Created by Casper Kelly (Adult Swim), very Short Treks celebrates the 50th anniversary of Star Trek: The Animated Series. The five very Short Treks episodes, which are decidedly not part of Star Trek canon, are animated in Filmation's style from the 1970s, with some modern animation from Star Trek: Lower Decks and Star Trek: Prodigy worked in. Star Trek fans' reactions to very Short Treks ran the gamut from appreciation to disdain, but they also varied in accordance with each episode's release.\nPerhaps the biggest draw for Star Trek: very Short Treks is the all-star cast of current and legacy actors assembled to voice the various characters. Star Trek on Paramount+'s shows are represented by Ethan Peck as Mr. Spock, Doug Jones as Saru, Celia Rose Gooding as Uhura, Noël Wells as D'Vana Tendi, Bonnie Gordon as various roles, and Bruce Horak, who reprises the late Lieutenant Hemmer from Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. Star Trek legacy actors who returned include George Takei as Mr. Sulu, Jonathan Frakes as Commander William Riker, Gates McFadden as Dr. Beverly Crusher, Armin Shimerman as Quark, Ethan Phillips as Neelix, and Connor Trinneer, who played Commander Trip Tucker for the first time since Star Trek: Enterprise ended in 2005. Here are the five episodes of Star Trek: very Short Treks ranked, worst to best:\nRelated: Star Trek's 5 New Shows Ranked, Worst To Best\nThe scatological \"Worst Contact\" is the low point of Star Trek: very Short Treks. The premise of the third comedic short involves Star Trek: The Next Generation's Commander Will Riker, Dr. Beverly Crusher, and an unnamed crewman from the USS Enterprise-D attempting to make First Contact. \"Worst Contact\" rapidly devolves into gross-out humor by the aliens who resemble the Talosians from the first Star Trek pilot, \"The Cage.\" There's not much to enjoy in \"Worst Contact\" besides hearing McFadden and Frakes play Dr. Crusher and Riker again (with Beverly calling Commander Riker \"Bill\").\nYou can watch \"Worst Contact\" here:\n\"Skin a Cat\" is an inauspicious debut for Star Trek: very Short Treks. Set aboard the USS Enterprise of Star Trek: The Animated Series, the short has some clever jokes involving turns of phrase that the increasingly strange alien crew members of the Enterprise take offense to. While Ethan Peck plays Mr. Spock in lieu of the late Leonard Nimoy, Pete Holmes plays a confused, generic starship Captain who doesn't seem to be James T. Kirk (thankfully). The oddball designs of some of the alien Enterprise crew are funny, but the overall experience of watching \"Skin a Cat\" leaves a lot to be desired.\nYou can watch \"Skin a Cat\" here:\nThe presence of a very much alive Lt. Hemmer, and Nyota Uhura wearing a Starfleet Cadet's uniform, confirms Star Trek: very Short Treks episode 2 is set during Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 1. A holiday party aboard the Starship Enterprise turns awkward fast when Lt. Spock unveils a \"blooper reel\" where the jokes are thousands of horrific deaths in a nod to the series premiere of Star Trek: Discovery, crew members being maimed by transporter malfunctions, and Spock getting dumped by his Vulcan fiancée, T'Pring (Gia Sandhu). The gallows humor of Spock not understanding what a \"blooper\" is does come off as funny, and \"Holiday Party\" is a step up from \"Skin a Cat.\"\nYou can watch \"Holiday Party\" here:\nThe final Star Trek: very Short Treks episode ends the series on a musical high note. Going full meta, \"Walk, Don't Run\" is hosted by Star Trek: Lower Decks' Ensign D'Vana Tendi (prior to her season 4 promotion to Lieutenant, junior grade). Unfortunately, the upbeat Tendi runs afoul of Scotty (Carlos Alazraqui), who takes offense to some of the Orion's verbiage. But their arguments, which include an amusing debate about Star Trek: The Animated Series' rec room vs. Lower Decks' holodeck, are diffused by the arrival of Commander Riker and Mr. Sulu, who kick off a wacky musical number. Of course, the song in \"Walk, Don't Run\" can't compete with the quality of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds' musical numbers, but Noël Wells' singing voice as Tendi shines in this homage to animated Star Trek combining the TAS and Lower Decks animation styles.\nYou can watch \"Walk, Don't Run\" here:\nAt a breakneck two minutes, \"Holograms All The Way Down\" is half the length of the other Star Trek: very Short Trek episodes, but it crams in over a dozen Star Trek characters and manages to be genuinely funny. Written by Star Trek: Prodigy executive producer Aaron J. Waltke, \"Holograms All The Way Down\" kicks off by returning to the Enterprise NX-01 with sly wink at Commander Trip Tucker's death in Star Trek: Enterprise's controversial series finale before it turns into a madcap holodeck adventure uniting characters from every Star Trek series, including Star Trek: Prodigy. \"Holograms All The Way Down\" even jokes about Star Trek: Deep Space Nine's classic \"In The Pale Moonlight\" as the holodeck plot spins toward a truly bizarre sight gag. \"Holograms All The Way Down\" is easily the best Star Trek: very Short Treks episode, and it's a loving ode to Star Trek overall.\nYou can watch \"Holograms All The Way Down\" here:\nJohn Orquiola is Screen Rant's Star Trek Beat Editor, Senior Features staff writer, and interviewer."}

{"title": "The Boogeyman Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-05 12:10:26", "text": "The Boogeyman ties up its loose ends and sees Sadie battling the titular monster. We break down the film's ending & the changes from the short story.\nWarning: This post contains spoilers for The BoogeymanThe Boogeyman’s ending ties things up, but teases a potential second chapter to the story. Directed by Rob Savage from a screenplay by ​​Scott Beck, Bryan Woods, Mark Heyman, The Boogeyman is adapted from Stephen King’s short story of the same name. The horror film, which has received mostly positive reviews from critics, includes a final scene that suggests the story may not be over, and that The Boogeyman 2 could potentially be on the horizon.\nThe Boogeyman ends with Sadie (Sophie Thatcher), Sawyer (Vivien Lyra Blair), and Will Harper (Chris Messina) battling the titular creature. The Boogeyman is intent on killing Sadie and Sawyer, and uses Will as bait after killing Rita, Lester Billings’ wife. After a few violent attacks, Sadie and Sawyer set fire to the terrifying creature. Seemingly dead, the house also catches fire, but Sadie and her family are able to make it outside to safety. Sadie and Sawyer return to therapy, and Will finally talks about his grief. After the session, Sadie hears the voice of the therapist, but the closet door is open, indicating The Boogeyman’s presence.\nSadie hears what she believes is her therapist’s voice calling out to her, but when she enters the room there’s no one there. The closet opens on its own and as Sadie draws closer, there’s a sense that the creature is still around, taunting her. She’s pulled back to reality by the actual therapist, and The Boogeyman is never shown. But after a fiery end, could The Boogeyman still be alive? It’s possible Sadie is hearing things after such a traumatic experience. She’s still reeling from what happened, but it could also be that a creature like The Boogeyman never truly dies, haunting its victims until they’re dead.\nThe Boogeyman stays in the shadows and shies away from light, therefore it can only be bested by fire. Fire is the original source of light discovered by humans, and brought people out of the dark at night. Hypothetically, this also kept the monsters at bay, so it makes sense that The Boogeyman, an ancient creature, would be afraid of fire; it’s the one thing that can cause it physical harm. Humans can wield fire to combat it, since the creature can control regular lights, flicking them off at will. It’s why Rita had so many candles lit in her house, which kept The Boogeyman at bay.\nThe monster called The Boogeyman has many origin points. First and foremost, what The Boogeyman is can be traced back to a short story written by Stephen King. The story follows a man named Lester Billings, who is telling a therapist, Will Harper, about the monster terrorizing him and his family. In terms of the movie's lore, The Boogeyman's origins are somewhat murky, but it's clear that it has existed for quite a long time. Furthermore, The Boogeyman seemingly appears after a significant trauma has occurred, or an individual is overcome with grief. The Boogeyman also targets children over adults, therefore, a grieving child like Sadie is the perfect target.\nThe Boogeyman latches onto those who are emotionally vulnerable. The Boogeyman sought out children specifically because they were easier to scare, preying on their weaknesses and emotional exposure in a way that it couldn’t do as easily with adults. Children and teenagers were also less likely to be believed by adults regarding what they were seeing, thus isolating them completely from their support systems. This allows The Boogeyman to lurk and toy with its prey, mimicking the voices children trusted, including their parents, to lure them into the shadows before attacking. Without the emotional vulnerability, the creature wouldn’t be as strong as it is.\nThe creature set its sights on Sadie and Sawyer after following Lester to their home. The sisters were still emotionally raw from the death of their mother a month before, and they were grieving her loss. Their guards were down, making it easy for The Boogeyman to make them its victims. Unlike their father, Sadie and Sawyer were open about their grief. They were also isolated — Sadie couldn’t rely on her friends or Will, who refused to talk about his wife or openly grieve like his daughters, and Sawyer faced The Boogeyman alone at first since no one believed her.\nWhen Lester (David Dastmalchian) comes to Will Harper for help after The Boogeyman killed Lester's kids, the creature continues taunting him until he is dead. Though the nightmarish creature tends to only go after children, it likely went after Lester because he actually believed The Boogeyman existed, and he felt guilty about not being there for his kids. Lester believed his children when they said they saw it, and he was vulnerable emotionally, wanting others to know that the monster existed. Will, on the other hand, was in denial; he was also less vulnerable, closed off emotionally from himself and his kids.\nThe Boogeyman’s ending teases that the creature is not actually dead, and that it could come back to attack Sadie and Sawyer. The Boogeyman is relentless in preying on its victims, and there’s no way to determine whether the monster is permanently dead or if setting it on fire was just a temporary setback. It’s possible the creature could return, terrorizing Sadie and Sawyer until they’re dead before setting its sights on another family. Battling the ancient monster again could be redundant, but The Boogeyman left off in a way that sees Sadie’s family united, which might force the creature to up its game in a sequel.\nStephen King’s short story is wildly different from the film adaptation. Whereas the short story is focused on a long conversation between Lester Billings and Will Harper, The Boogeyman movie expands the story to include Will’s daughters. In the source material, Sadie and Sawyer don’t factor into the story at all; they’re created for the film adaptation. In fact, Lester is the main character, and The Boogeyman short story follows his retelling of the events leading to the death of his three kids, ending with him coming face-to-face with the creature. Everything after that is an addition. It’s only after Lester dies in the movie that the story truly begins.\nThe Boogeyman attaches grief and emotional vulnerability with a monster preying on victims. Despite Sadie and her family getting to a much better place, with Will openly talking about the loss of his wife and The Boogeyman seemingly dying in physical form, the film suggests that grief will continue to be prevalent in one’s life no matter how much time has passed. Discussing it openly and allowing oneself to feel the sadness and loss of a loved one helps, but grief lingers. So regardless of Sadie defeating The Boogeyman and going to therapy with her family, the trauma remains, even if it’s no longer a physical manifestation.\n"}
{"title": "12 Things You Didn't Know About John Wick's Dogs", "date": "2023-10-05 12:10:26", "text": "The John Wick franchise is likely known for 3 things by now; Keanu Reeves being back, Keanu Reeves' Training Regime, and dogs. \nThe John Wick franchise is likely known for two things by now - Keanu Reeves' training regime and the John Wick dogs. It's strange to think a series of action films that have done so well critically and financially are equally popular with fans of high-octane tightly choreographed gun-fu action sequences and lovers of canine companions. Dogs have been so centric to the John Wick films that they've acted as motivation for Wick's revenge, helped him in his recovery, and aided John in fights. The first John Wick movie was all about his dog, as the bad guys killed the pup (Daisy), that was sent to him by his deceased wife.\nThe dog is what sent John Wick on his mission of vengeance to begin with. John got another dog, a pitbull, in the John Wick ending, and he has been his good boy and companion ever since. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum introduces combat dogs, and John Wick: Chapter 4's dog brings the franchise full circle. The dogs have played almost as big a role as any human and are more trustworthy than most. With that in mind, it's no surprise that there are many dog-related facts pertaining to the action series, and there's more to the John Wick dogs than the movies reveal.\nDaisy, the John Wick dog whose death inspired the line \"Yeah, I'm thinking I'm back,\" was played by an animal actor named Andy. It was actually his first role, at eight months old, purchased from a breeder specifically for the film. According to Animal Actors International trainer Kim Krafsky, a beagle was picked because \"There's this thing about them, they're just cute\" (via New York Post). Andy took to the press circuit with the rest of the cast. Following his big-screen debut, Andy took some time off, spending it on the Animal Actors International farm in New Jersey.\nJohn Wick has had two faithful four-legged companions. In the franchise sequels, John is joined by a pitbull named Bubba. Originally though, Wick owned a beagle named Daisy, left to him by his deceased wife who was tragically murdered spurring the events of the first film. Arguably, the death of this John Wick dog was the thing that made his unending revenge kill streak relatable. However, John Wick director Chad Stahelski revealed that they almost didn't go through with the dog's death. The director explained:\n\"We were risking credit cards, a house mortgage, everything. [Producer] Basil Iwanyk put his company up. And then you have that day where you realize we’re doing all this and we’re killing a puppy? I thought we would never come back from it.\"\nUnfortunately, Daisy dies in the first ten minutes of John Wick, but in the film's final scenes, John adopts a pitbull to save it from being put down. This John Wick dog has been played by two different animals in both John Wick: Chapter 2 and John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum. Chapter 2 saw the part played by Burton (who Keanu took to calling Bubba), and then Cha Cha in Parabellum (via Pup Help). John's second sidekick has yet to be given a name, likely because the assassin doesn't want to get too attached. Not even John Wick: Chapter 4 revealed the John Wick dog's name.\nA common saying in Hollywood goes\" \"Never work with children or animals,\" inferring that they will steal every scene they're in, and often make shooting said scenes more difficult. This was definitely the case while filming the third John Wick movie in New York. The animal actor Cha Cha, the second dog who played Wick's pitbull, picked a fight with a horse. Luckily Cha Cha came out of the altercation unharmed. It was likely caused by the onset of chaos due to the stress of shooting in such a loud and high-pressure environment, especially as even the horses were involved in the action sequences.\nIn John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, John Wick calls in a favor from the manager of the Casablanca branch of the Continental Hotel, Sofia Al-Awar (Halle Berry). The character constantly has two Belgian Malinois Shepherds by her side, but these dogs weren't played by only two dogs. They were in fact played by five separate stunt dogs so that different animal actors could be used for different stunts, and so that no individual dog became too stressed or fatigued. The John Wick dogs were named; Santana, Tai, Sam 7, Boyca, and Ikar, and each had a special relationship with their on and off-screen handler, Halle Berry (via The Ringer).\nRELATED: John Wick Chapter 5 - If It's Happening, Possible Story & Everything We Know\nThey might not be John Wick's dogs, but Sofia's Belgian Shepherds steal the show in John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum. They pull off impressive stunts during the Casablanca shootout, but there wasn't an animal handler just off-camera or hiding in the scene. The Belgian Shepherds were basically Halle Berry's dogs. Following her casting as Sofia, Berry had a sit-down chat with the directors, in which they discussed how hands-on the role would be. Not only did she take on combat and weapons training regimes as vigorous as Reaves, but she also spent time training and bonding with the dogs (via The Ringer).\nDuring the filming of their big action set piece in John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, Halle Berry and the filmmakers only really had one problem keeping the dogs well-behaved. The scene was filmed in the North African country Morroco, an area in which stray cats roam in large numbers and care little for Hollywood film sets. According to John Wick 3's Halle Berry, the cats were, \"everywhere, and when my dogs saw cats they went ballistic.\" In an interview included on the film's Blu-ray, Berry goes on to explain that cats would stroll onto the set and the dogs would chase after them mid-scene, disrupting the filmmaking process.\nPractical stunt work is a big part of the John Wick franchise with the vast majority of what's seen achieved by actors and stuntmen. This extends to the John Wick dogs as well. In a podcast, director Chad Stahelski weighed in on the dogs. The director said, \"There's no such thing as a movie dog. It's just a dog doing his thing on set\" (via ReelBlend). As a result, some of the hardest scenes to film involved trained animals. \"When a dog attacks, it's actually trying to injure a person.\" When viewers see a dog attack a character, it's really going for the attack and is not acting.\nIn John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, there is a stunt where one of Sofia's dogs leaps from her back and climbs up a second-story balcony. There was no CGI involved. The film's visual effects supervisor, Rob Nederhorst, pointed out on Twitter that all dog-related stunts were real, including the wall climb (via The Slate). \"The dog climbed up that wall. Our action team was incredible and I am honored to have worked with them.\" It's actually well within the realms of reality for a dog to clear a 5-foot jump with a running start or to scramble up a 15-foot wall, and that's without the added benefit of a Halle Berry leg-up.\nAndy, the animal actor who played the first John Wick dog, Daisy, was only eight months old when he took on the pivotal role in the 2014 movie. In that respect, it's not surprising that he wasn't the most well-trained of animal actors. In the opening scenes of the film, Andy is shown palling around the house with Keanu Reeves, but he often missed his mark. In fact, the only way to entice Andy into jumping onto John's bed and licking his face was to spread bacon grease on the actor's cheeks (via Pup Help).\nWhile the filmmakers loved to praise the stuntwork - humans and dogs alike - and practical effects, there was at least one area with CGI. Trainers point dogs in a direction, and the dogs do what their training calls for, but dogs are not actors. For many reasons, a dog cannot bite an actor in the crotch and do so practically and safely. In the third John Wick movie, the dogs were taught to play-attack the bad guys, but it needed to look real. CGI cones were placed over the stunt performer's crotches, so CGI could make the damage caused by the John Wick dogs look real in the end.\nWhile Mr. Nobody's dog in John Wick: Chapter 4 doesn't have a name and is only referred to in production notes as the \"faithful accomplice,\" Stahelski became extremely close with the dog, or the five dogs, that played the combat-loving canine (via AS). The director revealed, “Not only did I get acquainted with them, I worked to understand their energy and build a believable relationship.” Each of the five trained John Wick dogs had their own specific skill that the faithful accomplice showcases in the fourquel, as Stahelski added, “Each one had a different personality, energy, and skill set. One dog did the tugging, another fetched.”\nKieran has a Bachelor of Arts in Screenwriting and Film Studies, which he mostly uses as a conversation piece and professionally on occasion.

{"title": "Where Was The Boogeyman Filmed? 2023 Horror Movie's Filming Locations Explained", "date": "2023-10-05 12:20:29", "text": "Though The Boogeyman looks like it could have been filmed in any American suburb, the horror flick actually took place in one specific, spooky city.\nThe Stephen King adaptation The Boogeyman has the look of a movie that could take place just about anywhere, making it all the more scary, however as it turns out, the horror film was actually shot in one particular place. The Boogeyman is a 2023 horror movie following teenager Sadie and her younger sister Sawyer as the grief the sudden death of their mother, and at the same time, begin to contend with a shadowy monster inside their home. The film is adapted from a 1973 short story of the same name by horror legend Stephen King.\nPart of what makes The Boogeyman so creepy is the sense that the events of the film could happen to anyone, anywhere. Though the audience watches the Harper family be terrorized by The Boogeyman monster, the smallness of the film's world makes it seem like the viewers could just as easily be the victims. This ambiance is created by building a narrow and generic world through which the film takes place. Audiences follow Sadie at home, at school, and around town, but the movie goes no further than that. Therefore, Sadie's world could just as easily be ours. However, The Boogeyman was filmed somewhere, so where is it?\nRelated: The Boogeyman 2: Is It Happening? Plot Setup & Everything We Know\nAccording to The Cinemaholic, one generic location that The Boogeyman used during filming was McDonogh 35 Senior High School, located in Louisiana. The school is located on 4000 Cadillac Street in the city of New Orleans. Although The Boogeyman is a horror movie, this school is not abandoned or creepy in any sense. In fact, McDonogh 35 Senior High School is still in use, with actual students in attendance currently. It is unclear how production of The Boogeyman affected the school.\nThe use of McDonogh 35 Senior High School comes into play in The Boogeyman during the scenes when Sadie is at school. This mostly occurs near the start of the film, particularly when Sadie returns to school for the first time after her mother's death. In one scene, Sadie is approached by a group of cruel popular girls, and she gets into an altercation with them. Clearly, The Boogeyman's use of this real-life Louisiana school helped in creating a generic atmosphere. Sadie's school looks entirely real, and like any other high school where this could happen to anybody.\nThe rest of The Boogeyman was filmed in other areas of New Orleans, Louisiana. This is an interesting location because of its history of creepy activity, and also, its recognizable locales. In an interview with NOLA, director Rob Savage said \"We wanted this to feel like Anytown, USA — like every Stephen King movie. You want it to feel like it could be anywhere, like it could be your hometown. But when I first got to New Orleans, the aesthetic qualities were so powerful, I was really pushing to get more and more of that in the movie.\" So, despite the fact that Savage desired a broad look for The Boogeyman, New Orleans' unique tones won out.\nApart from McDonogh 35 Senior High School, the rest of The Boogeyman was filmed in and around New Orleans. Presumably, the filmmakers shot vast amounts of the film in the New Orleans suburbs, including the scenes in the Harpers' home like the fiery final sequence at the end of The Boogeyman. Though Savage was taken by the city's spooky atmosphere, the film still feels encompassing enough to be anywhere. In this way, The Boogeyman strikes a balance between being relatable and atmospheric.\nSources: The Cinemaholic, NOLA\n"}

Here are the best medieval TV shows available.  \nThere's been quite the upswing in shows centered around the Middle Ages — or are at least influenced by the culture and events during this significant era, and this has resulted in some of the best medieval TV shows on the small screen. There is more to these TV and streaming shows than just knights in shining armor on horseback or kings and queens battling rebellious commoners or Vikings. These shows bring a piece of history to the small screen with all the drama and action that a viewer could want to not only enjoy the era but learn more about the past.\nIt's not surprising that viewers would be intrigued by such efforts, whether fantasy-based, historical fiction, or an accurate portrayal of real events. After all, this turbulent, dark, and often violent period of human history makes for some gripping settings and engrossing narratives. While Game of Thrones brought a true fantasy-level effort to the show, others have proven to be memorable because they were based on reality. The good news is that there is a wide selection of options for those looking for the best medieval TV shows, whether it be for their tone, their battle sequences, or compelling protagonists.\nRELATED: The 50 Best TV Shows Of All Time, Ranked\nBritannia is one of the best medieval TV shows on Amazon Prime Video and is a good companion show for more popular series like Rome and Vikings. The time frame of this series is 43 AD and the battle between the Romans and Celts. What makes this different from other shows in the genre is the fact that Britannia features warrior women, magical Druids, and Celtic Queens, and gives fans of medieval entertainment a show with a strong female slant. The series ran for three seasons on Amazon Prime Video and ended just shortly after the Roman invasion of Britain.\nVinland Saga brings the world of the best medieval TV shows into the anime format. There are several anime options when looking at medieval stories, but Vinland Saga sits at the top of the list as the best of the best. Based on the Makoto Yukimura manga series, this follows protagonist Thorfinn, a former warrior of a band of pirates led by Askeladd. He is also the son of one of the world's greatest warriors, Thors. Vinland Saga, which just finished season 2, is set in the world of Vikings, this is a revenge story that sees Thorfinn going after the man who killed his father, and his rise into legend as his journey continues.\nThe Legend of El Cid remains one of the best medieval TV shows on Amazon Prime Video. Set in the 11th century, the Spanish historical drama follows the life of Ruy, a young squire who uncovers a scandal that involves a conspiracy to murder and a plan to commit regicide. However, by bringing this to everyone's attention, Ruy puts himself and his loved ones in danger. Partially inspired by the story of the real-life knight and nobleman, El Cid received praise for the way it manages to build suspense and gripping cliffhangers. The fact that the characters aren't one-dimensional has compelled the viewers to stick with the show.\nAlthough it only ran for two seasons, Knightfall stands as one of the best medieval TV shows ever made. Set in the 14th century, Knightfall was a series that explored the lives of several soldiers in the Knight Templar as they tried to keep their power and influence in the Holy Land. While there were a few who criticized the plot and uneven storytelling, many believed that the directors more than made up for it with the battle sequences and the fight choreography. There are also some dynamic characters as well as some compelling and complex villains (which viewers will love to hate).\nWith three seasons and a star-studded cast under its belt, Medici stands out as one of the best medieval TV shows. Chronicling the rise and fall of the infamous Italian family, Medici is a series that is full of corruption, rivalries, and political strife (which has viewers engaged from the get-go). It's not all full of drama either, as the writers also managed to find a perfect balance between romance and action. While Medici wasn't always historically accurate since they had to dramatize a few events for the sake of some storyline, it does provide an insight into how influential and powerful the Medicis were in 15th-century Florence.\nWhether it's the cool battle sequences, the interesting storylines (that are inspired by the Legend), or because it has some of the best characters, Merlin has managed to captivate the audience for years as one of the best medieval TV shows. Although Merlin isn't historically accurate (especially in terms of costumes and doesn't exactly follow the classic tales), some viewers might not care since the show does focus a lot on fantasy and include a lot of mythological creatures. There's not a lot of blood or gore either, so it's great for those who want something light-hearted and fun.\nHoning in on Polo's years in the court of Kublai Khan of the Mongol Empire, Marco Polo mostly diverges from Western themes, focusing instead on China circa the Yuan Dynasty. Although this Netflix series only lasted 2 seasons, it's rich with character drama containing twists and turns, along with lavish set pieces loosely based on Eastern history. Its robust budget of $200 million can be seen in its rich cinematography and sleek production value, making it one of the best looking of the best medieval TV shows on Netflix.\nBeing based on a historical novel, this miniseries crams a wealth of interesting backstories and authenticity into each of its eight episodes. As viewers would imagine from a show based on an English civil war called \"The Anarchy,\" there are plenty of gripping, dramatic moments to be had in one of the best medieval TV shows. The show keeps a narrow focus on the one hand - revolving around the construction of a cathedral while granting a deep and vast narrative involving several unique characters. Lavish backdrops, along with standout performances by Ian McShane and Hayley Atwell, give The Pillars of the Earth an enriching sense of authenticity.\nThe cutthroat era of Europe 1,000 years ago seems rife with potential when it comes to compelling murder mysteries. This British series from the mid-90s takes advantage of this, crafting engaging crime plots dressed in 12th-century English settings. One of the best medieval TV shows, it takes the premise of Columbo and fuses it with Game of Thrones motifs, making for a distinctly entertaining show. Even with the fun potential of the protagonist's background as a Crusader-turned-Monk, Cadfael focuses on dynamic writing and interesting plots to keep its viewers enticed rather than action.\nWhile Michael Hirst is perhaps most known for his work on Vikings, a similarly dense, compelling historical drama of his found its way on BBC years before. The Tudors takes place several centuries after that show, honing in on England in the period between the Dark Ages and Modernity; the Renaissance. This transitional era sets the stage for a wealth of major events, and Hirst takes advantage of this. While The Tudors runs with some creative liberties, the show uses both fiction and history to round out one of the best medieval TV shows about King Henry VIII.\nIt's true that a cartoon centered around talking mice isn't exactly authentic to history. Yet, this whimsical fantasy uses medieval themes to paint this majestic scene while also appealing to kids. This Canadian animation draws from the popular fantasy novels by Brian Jacques, with each of its three seasons comprising a different book. Focusing on a once-poor mouse named Matthias, the show captures the often gritty nature of medieval living, while balancing it with lighthearted humor. A number of colorful characters and fun fantasy themes round out this charming cartoon.\nRELATED: The Game Of Thrones Jon Snow Spinoff - News, Cast, & Everything We Know\nAnyone who loved Game of Thrones, but wanted to see something that was a bit more on the mark historically should seek out the docudrama Rise of Empires: Ottoman, one of the best medieval TV shows on Netflix. Forget about the fantastical demons and monsters from Game of Thrones. The real-life historical events this series focuses on are just as dramatic and exciting as any supernatural attack. Rise of Empires: Ottoman deals with the fall of the Holy Roman Empire and looks at the successors in Constantinople and the creation of Istanbul after the conquest by Mehmed II.\nBased largely upon the reign of Queen Isabella of Castile, Isabel has proven to be quite an underrated addition to the best medieval TV shows. Like GoT, this series shows the rise to power of various major figures of royal families, along with the inevitable drama, struggles, and clashes that come with them. This short-lived Spanish show features terrific performances by Michelle Jenner as Isabel, Rodolfo Sancho as Ferdinand of Aragon, and Pablo Derqui as Henry of Castile. This is enhanced by some authentic Spanish settings and complex societal/political happenings, including the voyage of Christopher Columbus and the Spanish Inquisition.\nWhile there are a number of the best medieval TV shows loosely based on English history of the Middle Ages, BBC Two's The Hollow Crown portrays this period from a more accurate and authentic angle, honing in on major events like the Wars of the Roses. The show draws from the captivating works of Shakespeare's second tetralogy, which includes plays such as The Life and Death of King Richard II. The authentic set pieces, tremendous acting by Benedict Cumberbatch, Judi Dench, and others, and the rich source material offer a solid foundation for this action-tinged drama.\nWhile there are plenty of the best medieval TV shows that focus on the late Middle Ages, The Last Kingdom revolves around the even more violent and cutthroat era of 9th-century England. As it dates back to a time of instability, where Britain is fractured into various (often warring) kingdoms - drama, strife, and outright conflict are guaranteed. It also shows the further destabilizing factor of the Northmen raiders becoming emboldened and mounting assaults on the island. The Last Kingdom sets the stage for some intense and epic battle scenes rarely seen on television. A plethora of enticing narratives and rich characters help flesh out this epic historical show.\nIt's tough to find a more iconic blend of history and mythology than the legendary Robin Hood; a figure who's seen no shortage of adaptations over the years and decades. One of the lesser-known, but nonetheless stronger examples of this folklore hero come in the form of the British TV series, Robin of Sherwood, by Richard Carpenter. While it now seems like a mere distant blip on the radar, running from 1984 to 1986, this drama quietly developed a cult following thanks to its gripping portrayal which blends realism with imaginative mythology, enhanced by an engrossing atmosphere.\nSome areas of history don't even need to be decorated with many fictional or fantastical elements to be entertaining. Such is the case with Vikings, the epic Michael Hirst portrayal of 9th-century Scandinavian society. That's not to say creative liberties aren't taken, yet the grandiosity and fun plots of this action-drama do largely draw from real Viking events and cultural traits. One of the best medieval TV shows, it distills this tale down to a rather simple premise of raiders and explorers seeking a more prosperous new life with new lands. The popularity of Vikings even spawned a spinoff series.\nWhile there are quite a few glimpses into the wondrous and often dark events of the Middle Ages in Europe, this South Korean epic from 2015 demonstrates that the East is similarly rife with thrilling tales of heroism and political strife. The Korean period drama Six Flying Dragons merges real and fictional characters along with settings and premises loosely based on real events. Specifically, it portrays the founding of the Joseon Dynasty in the 14th century, where Neo-Confucianism began to reside over Buddhism, and a cascade of change elsewhere resided over this society, shown through the eyes of Prince Lee Bang Won.\nDespite its brief seven-episode run and the cinematic limitations as a result of the dated '70s production, this French-German swashbuckling tale is nonetheless a rich and entertaining watch. The show follows a Scottish adventurer by the name of Quentin, who finds himself in the midst of a feud that wipes out his entire clan. The series, part of an unofficial trilogy that included King Arthur movie Knights of the Round Table, sees the downtrodden protagonist must find his way in this hostile environment while he heads to France to rendezvous with his only living relative and reach the French court of Louis XI.\nVikings: Valhalla is the spinoff of the original Vikings series and remains one of the best medieval TV shows on TV as it released its second season in 2023. The series takes place 100 years after the previous series ended and details the Norse quest to conquer England after the St. Brice's Day massacre in 1002 A.D. The three Vikings the show focuses on are Harald Sigurdsson, Leif Erikson, and Freydis Eirsdottir. Like the original series, there are a lot of historical characters and events in the series, mixed judiciously with fictional events and characters to create high drama and a very exciting follow-up to the original series as well as the best medieval TV show.\n"}

The anticipation surrounding the arrival of the newest iteration of the X-Men has started to reach fever pitch, even warranting a tongue-in-cheek mention in She-Hulk as Jennifer Walters asks K.E.V.I.N. when they are due as a favor to the fans. Unfortunately, it got no straight answer - but a recent development in the real world has given a pretty big clue, instead.\nNow that the Writers Guild of America strikes have ended, it is full steam ahead on developing the MCU X-Men movie - something which was confirmed by Marvel's recent call-out for writer pitches for its \"anticipated X-Men movie.\" The decision on who will be picked to write the movie will then be decided \"at the top of 2024,\" and it is this that gives a clue on when thee X-Men as individuals will start making their appearances. Specifically, it will probably be in the next two Avengers movies.\nRelated: All The X-Men Movies In Chronological Order\nWith development now in its earliest stages, it's extremely likely that the MCU's X-Men movie will be a Phase 7 release. Every upcoming Marvel movie release so far includes many anticipated MCU introductions such as Blade and the Fantastic Four, meaning the X-Men can hold off on their grand entrance for another phase. This is a good thing for ensuring the anticipation for their arrival builds - but it doesn't mean that none of the MCU's X-Men will appear in other capacities before then. Nor would that make sense.\nDeadpool 3 is looking poised to have fun with a roster of Fox's X-Men, but will likely be used to draw a line under that franchise before moving on with a new cast. With the likes Spider-Man and Black Panther being introduced ahead of their own solo outing, however, it is still extremely possible that the X-Men will be introduced ahead of theirs. Nowhere would this be more appropriate than in Avengers: Secret Wars - and it would be a wise move.\nIn a sense, the MCU has already been laying the groundwork for the introduction of the X-Men by establishing a number of MCU mutants already. The X-Men specifically, though, comprise a lot of iconic individuals, and introducing them all at once would probably be too much for one solo movie. Instead, establishing someone like Wolverine, Professor X, or Magneto ahead of time will help make the group outing easier to manage. Although it is still possible that an X-Man or two might appear before the new Avengers movie, the multiverse focus of each seems to set them both up to be the place that the MCU X-Men will start to be drip-fed to the audience, which is an incredibly exciting prospect.\nOllie discovered his love for all things nerdy very early on in life and has only gotten nerdier with age after only discovering the magic of Dungeons & Dragons in his 30s.

{"title": "10 Horror Movies That Changed The Rules Forever", "date": "2023-10-05 12:30:28", "text": "From Psycho to Saw, these essential spooky movies broke all the rules when they were released, and would ultimately change the horror genre forever.\nThe horror genre is arguably the most inventive genre in movies, and some horror films have been so groundbreaking that they changed the genre's conventions completely. By altering the genre's fundamental aspects and audience expectations, these movies were able to deliver highly effective scares. The result was that they completely changed the horror movie landscape, influencing all that came next.\nHorror is a genre known for pushing the boundaries, but some movies pushed them so far that they broke and were never the same again. From Alfred Hitchcock to Wes Craven, several horror maestros have shaped the genre in very substantial ways. This was only achieved by bucking previous horror movie standards, and completely breaking the previous rules.\nBefore Night of the Living Dead, zombies were voodoo slaves, sometimes (but not always) raised from the dead. Movies like White Zombie popularized the monsters, which while lumbering and mindless, were not the flesh-devourers audiences now know. George A. Romero's first zombie movie, however, changed this forever. Instead, 1968's Night of the Living Dead featured undead zombies hungry for human flesh. While Romero refrained from terming them zombies, a string of imitations were released which were happy to incorporate the designation, and thus, the modern zombie was born.\nThe next major development with zombie movies was Danny Boyle's 2002 movie, 28 Days Later​​​​​. Rather than living dead, these creatures moved very quickly, infected with a rage virus that triggered cannibalistic murder and extreme violence. Like Romero, Boyle was careful not to call his monsters \"zombies,\" and instead opted for the \"infected.\" The result was two-fold: firstly, subsequent zombie movies employed this speedier, more lethal updated zombie; and secondly, zombie movies garnered a connection with infection - leading to a string of contagion movies.\nBefore 1960's Psycho, cinemas would play movies on a loop, and patrons could arrive whenever they desired - staying to watch the beginning of the movie as necessary. Alfred Hitchcock changed this, and not just for horror. Concerned audiences would spoil the ending for themselves, Hitchcock insisted that nobody be allowed entry after the screening commenced. This would ultimately become somewhat standard in all cinema. If this wasn't enough, Hitchcock also made the bold move to kill off the movie's star (Janet Lee) in the opening act. This was later lampooned by Scream, which also used it to undermine the audience's presumption of the upcoming plot.\nIt seems most horror movies these days deploy a last-minute scare, jolting its audience one final time. Typically, these occur after the perceived threat has been defeated - leaving speculation open to the horrors continuing after audiences are safely exiting the cinema. This, however, never existed before the 1976 adaptation of Stephen King's Carrie. Brian De Palma's classic waited until the very end before delivering one final fright, Carrie's hand thrusting its way through the rubble and grasping a survivor. While it may appear like a tiresome trope to modern viewers, this scene startled audiences to their core in 1976. A later famous example comes at the end of Friday the 13th.\nOne of the most enduring images in British horror cinema depicts Edward Woodward (as Howie the police officer) trapped in a giant wicker man, burning to death as the sun sets, during the final scenes of Robin Hardy's The Wicker Man. Audiences in 1976, however, were not used to seeing the protagonist die at the end of the film, and many expected (as would be the case in most other horror movies) an imminent rescue for the hero. This rescue does not arrive though, and Woodward's character perishes in the flames as the pagan islanders sing below. This was highly controversial at the time of release and would be a tactic repeated throughout modern horror movies.\nNow an immensely popular horror subgenre, found footage first appeared in 1980's Cannibal Holocaust, which enjoyed a cult following for years. One movie inspired by this, and that arguably popularized the technique, was 1999's The Blair Witch Project. Alongside the movie, the filmmakers created a swathe of fictional material presented as fact, including websites and documentaries, which explored the movie's themes and purported backstory. Additionally, the actors were marked as missing on their IMDB.com profiles, perpetuating the ruse. This cemented the idea for the public and truly blurred the lines between fact and fiction - a theme that persists in horror to this day.\nJames Whale's classic, The Bride of Frankenstein is a masterpiece in early horror. Released in 1935, the movie was a sequel to Whale's hugely popular Frankenstein, adapting the remainder of Mary Shelley's novel. However, many audiences did not realize, and wouldn't for years to come, that Bride of Frankenstein is a surreptitious spoof of Frankenstein. Packed with campy characters and melodrama, Whale took his own movie and exaggerated the elements he found amusing, contrasting them against Boris Karloff's incredible reprisal as the Monster. This technique would be repeated by Tobe Hooper, who released a sneaky parody of his own horror classic with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2.\nDespite featuring one of the most iconic villains in horror history, Hellraiser made a brilliant, and unconventional, decision to have another antagonist than Pinhead. Though still featured dismembering victims with his trademark chains throughout, Pinhead is a side character in the original 1987 Hellraiser, with the human Frank taking the villainous mantle. Frank appears as a violent degenerate, leching over his brother's wife and child, and orchestrating much of the movie's horrors. Frank is so detestable, that by the movie's conclusion audiences are actually rooting for Pinhead to dispatch the man. In fact, Frank proved such a wretched villain that he would appear in the sequel.\nAnother horror franchise with a secondary character so deplorable viewers root for the villain is Saw, most specifically Saw X. Saw X did such a brilliant job at fleshing out the murderer Jigsaw and his battle with cancer, that when he is duped into fake treatment by the detestable Dr. Cecilia Pederson, audiences feel sorry for him. It is quite an astonishing phenomenon, which transforms the villain fans love to hate, to a villain people just plain love. Saw has always walked the relatable villain tightrope, proffering some justification for the horror committed by Jigsaw, but Saw X reorients him as one of the victims, fully undermining the binary horror convention of good vs. evil.\nAn earlier film that flipped the victim/villain archetypes was Wes Craven's seminal The Last House on the Left. It initially depicts the murder of a young woman by some truly vile characters. Then rather unexpectedly, the movie shifts. The killers seek refuge in a remote house, which, unbeknownst to them, is their victim's home. Deducing what happened, her parents seek their bloody revenge. The movie questions notions of justifiable violence and does so by also placing the audience in the awkward position of cheering for the parents to murder the reprobates. It is a truly disgusting movie that broke several rules in horror, but this one still feels particularly unsettling.\n"}

Breaking ground in a new way, the studios wanted to keep the magic going for as long as possible turning it into a juggernaut franchise, both with and without the original stars. Audiences flocked to theaters to watch the gang engage in debauchery and laugh along at all the jokes.\nAlong the way, the main movies ended, but the studio kept pumping out films connected to the world of the originals, all with diminishing returns thanks to the absence of the beloved original stars. There are nine movies in the American Pie franchise, but there is a new American Pie movie in the works with the original cast returning. The American Pie movies began in 1999 and the franchise is still releasing new movies as recently as 2020. Although the newer movies aren't as beloved as the original films, there are still new stories to be told in the universe and audiences will continue watching the raunchy sex comedies.\nRELATED: The 50 Best Movies of All Time\nAmerican Pie Presents: The Book Of Love follows a group of teens exactly 10 years after the original film took place, finding the infamous \"Bible\" that character Kevin Myers used in the original movie. While it pays homage to the first movie, this is far from the best American Pie movie in the franchise. After destroying \"The Bible\" they must track down every man who has contributed any single move to it over the years to try and put it back together. Along the way, they run into Jim's dad Noah Levenstein (Eugene Levy) who is the sort of through-line from the original cast to the younger kids in the \"Presents\" portion of the films.\nThe Book Of Love ranks at the bottom of the DTV sequels to American Pie because by this time, what made the original movies so charming has been mostly lost. Critics mention that the movie tried to return some of the charm of the originals, but it was still just mostly a copy and paste of the ideas that were at one time original and fresh.\nErik Stifler is the cousin of Steve and Matt Stifler from the main franchise and his girlfriend just gave him a free pass to do whatever he wants in one weekend, so he heads off to a college campus to run in The Naked Mile. Erik is not like the hard-partying members of his family and this is meant to help break him out of his shell and so his other crazy cousin Dwight who is already in college tries to acclimate him to the party scene.\nThis whole frat raunchy scene and the connectivity of having it be a Stifler is another way the studio and writers kept the franchise pushing ahead without main cast members attached to the plot line. The movie was not hated like the latter released Book Of Love which didn't star a \"Stifler\" but was also not beloved by audiences. The movie tries to deliver self-aware humor with college craziness, but critics agreed it fell short in the end.\nBeta House was the only American Pie spin-off film to be a direct sequel to the one that came before it. Audiences responded well to Dwight and Erik Stifler, so they were both brought back for this one. Erik left for college and tried to bounce back from his breakup, but the story then went in the same direction as most American Pie movies. This isn't a bad movie, but it isn't anything that movie fans haven't seen before. It checks off most of the college movie tropes one by one, all the way down to the toga party. There are plenty of better college movies out there, and that holds this down from being one of the best American Pie movies.\nFour friends are about to graduate from high school and finally decide to take charge of their lives and get what they want in their senior year. Whether it's losing their virginity or blackmailing the principal, Annie, Kayla, Michelle, and Stephanie spend the raunchy movie doing whatever it takes to find success. The movie arrived in 2020 and tried new approaches, focusing more on the women characters.\nThe change of focus to the women makes it just different enough to stand out from the rest of the best American Pie movies, as far as the spinoffs go. On a side note, Eugene Levy didn't return for this movie, and his absence is felt as he's appeared in every other movie in the franchise.\nThe first movie following the initial trilogy, American Pie Presents: Band Camp was a bit bigger than every American Pie movie made after it with both Eugene Levy and Chris Owen returning as Noah Levenstein and Sherman respectively. The movie follows Matt Stifler who is ordered to attend band camp following a prank and hijinx ensue. Actor Tad Hilgenbrink actually did a pretty great job mimicking Seann William Scott's mannerisms as Stifler. The cast overall was pretty well-rounded for a direct-to-video release, but it was hard for audiences to move on in just two years' time from the cast that had been there since the start.\nThe third film was meant to be the last American Pie movie in the entire franchise. It showed a lot of character development for Steve Stifler, yet there was a big Oz-sized hole in the gang that fans had come to know and love. Groups that are that tight-knit just don't function as well when they are not whole. Each film gave more screen time and more character development to different characters, and it seemed intentional, until the third when Oz was gone and Kevin was essentially non-existent.\nThis was seen by many fans and critics as the weakest in the best American Pie movies. While it is about Jim's wedding, these events are supposed to be group effort films and this left some key players on the sidelines.\nOf the best American Pie movies, this one is the most laugh-out-loud funny of the entire franchise due to the rapid-fire nature of the raunchy jokes. This film was made at a time when nothing was off-limits, many of the jokes would not be okay in today's climate whatsoever. At the same time, the second movie dealt with a lot of issues that many teens deal with in real life when going off to college. The core of the film, staying connected no matter what changes is actually extremely beautiful and that is why many fans connect so deeply with it to this day.\nThe jokes flowing freely make it feel like it could be any group of friends at any house just holding onto their youth. It also helps that all the friends are still in full force here, something the next movie mistakenly changed. The main story here is Jim and Michelle's romance, and that really helps ground a movie that throws just about everything at the audience for a laugh.\nRegarded by many fans and critics as the closest to the first one in tone as well as humor, the fact that everyone returned to the cast was enough to get fans to head back to theaters for an international box office total of $234 million (via Box Office Mojo). The cast seemed to not miss a beat as they delivered quick-witted lines just like no time had passed as well as those heartfelt group moments the franchise had become known for. The writers also made sure to drop in some moments that were fresh to the franchise as well as acknowledging the age of everyone involved in a comedic way. It even picked up three Teen Choice Award nominations.\nThe best of the American Pie movies was a raunchy comedy that brought back the genre in a viable way as a box office smash as well as a genre in which audiences were ready to receive stories again. Not since Animal House had a raunchy comedy lifted the genre in such a way that it became the talk of all of Hollywood, and that is why this remains timeless movie. The first American Pie movie followed a group of friends and their dating and sexual relationships as they finished high school and prepared for the day they would end up moving apart.\nWhat really carried the movie was the cast, which included Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan as the key romantic couple that carried the franchise, at least through the theatrical American Pie movies. This movie was also the one that received the most accolades, including nominations at the MTV Movie Awards and Teen Choice Awards and several wins at the Young Hollywood Awards.\n\n"}
{"title": "Why Bradley & Laura Broke Up Before The Morning Show Season 3", "date": "2023-10-05 12:50:27", "text": "The Morning Show season 3 had already revealed that Bradley and Laura broke up during the time jump, but episode 5 finally explained what went wrong. \nAfter getting together in The Morning Show season 2, Bradley and Laura broke up before season 3 began, and a flashback episode finally explained why, how, and when. The Morning Show cast grew with the addition of Julianna Margulies in its sophomore season as Laura Peterson, a legendary journalist at UBA and Bradley’s love interest. The Morning Show season 2 set up an interesting dynamic between them as Laura had been out as a lesbian for decades while Bradley wasn’t ready to claim her sexuality publicly. Yet, they’d found a way to make their relationship work, only to break up before The Morning Show season 3.\nThough Bradley and Laura started the season having already broken up, there is plenty of time left for them to get back together, especially after The Morning Show season 3, episode 4 where they admitted they still had feelings for each other. However, they also spoke about how miserable Bradley was in Montana, where she and Laura were during the pandemic. The Morning Show season 3, episode 5 took viewers back in time to Laura's ranch to understand why.\nAt the end of The Morning Show season 2, Laura, who has a heart condition, left New York City for her ranch in Montana as an extra measure of caution against COVID-19. Bradley had agreed to join her, but her brother going missing in the finale delayed her trip. In The Morning Show season 3, episode 5, they started off their time in Montana together on a positive note, using the time in isolation to get to know each other and relax away from all the drama they’d been confronted with throughout the season. However, it also meant moving in together more quickly than they might have otherwise.\nBradley and Laura first met at the 2020 Democratic presidential caucus in early February and were living together in Montana by the end of March. Bradley had admittedly never been in a relationship for more than a few months her entire life, while Laura had a reputation as a “player.” With the added difficulties that isolation can have on one's mental and emotional state, it wasn’t exactly surprising that Bradley and Laura broke up during the pandemic before The Morning Show season 3.\nRelated: The Morning Show Season 3 Is Fixing 8 Problems That Ruined Season 2\nAs if trying to make their relationship survive the pandemic and isolation in Montana wasn’t hard enough, Bradley’s mother passed away from the coronavirus in The Morning Show season 3, episode 5. Laura had attempted to get her help through her connections with certain doctors and clinics, but Bradley knew her mother didn’t really take care of herself even when it came to seeing her own doctor, something that Laura couldn’t fully understand. Bradley’s mom’s death understandably marked a shift in their dynamic as she wasn’t willing or ready to accept the help she needed and that Laura tried to offer.\nIn The Morning Show season 3, episode 5, they eventually had an intense argument that led to both of them saying some pretty awful things to each other. Bradley accused Laura of being \"elitist,\" hating her mother, and judging her family, which contributed to her not being as close with her mother in the months before she died. Laura reminded Bradley that she was the one who’d constantly talked down on her family and said that she must actually be relieved that her mother was dead. While they continued their relationship for a while after this fight, it no doubt was the breaking point.\nEven when they were happy together in Montana, their differences posed problems for Bradley and Laura's relationship in The Morning Show from the beginning. They were in very different stages in their lives and careers, with Laura being a successful veteran at UBA and Bradley still trying to prove herself. While Laura attempted to be supportive of Bradley, it could occasionally come across as condescending, as she couldn’t truly understand how Bradley’s messed up childhood was impacting her present and future in The Morning Show.\nRelated: The Morning Show Season 4: Renewal, Release Date & Everything We Know\nBradley and Laura spoke about this in The Morning Show season 3, episode 5, and Laura promised that she’d work on being less judgmental, but Bradley didn’t give her much of a chance once her mother died. Since their breakup, Bradley has gotten some much-needed therapy and the coveted job on UBA Evening News while Laura is co-anchor at Your Day, America, which has eliminated some of their differences. Still, if Bradley and Laura are going to try and make their relationship work again in The Morning Show season 3, they will have to find some middle ground.\n"}

Jesse Simon, grandson of legendary artist Joe Simon, has launched a string of successful Kickstarter campaigns to bring ShieldMaster, co-created by Joe, to life. Now, Jesse has launched a new campaign for a new book that will resurrect other Simon characters. Furthermore, this project comes with an introduction by the legendary Alan Moore.\nSimon Studios has launched a Kickstarter for the book, entitled ShieldMaster: Blast to the Past. Simon provided a synopsis for the book, along with the variant covers, shared below. Blast to the Past meta-plot involves Jesse and his father Jim attending a comic book convention in the present day. They are hurled back in time to 1963, where John F. Kennedy needs protection. Kennedy asks the Fighting American to provide security. The Fighting American then brings together a group of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby characters, such as Captain 3-D, The Fly, and Private Strong. The book will feature covers by industry legends such as Tom Morgan and Joe Rubenstein.\nJoe Simon is one of the architects of the American comic book field, whose career spans nearly 80 years. Simon, with Jack Kirby, helped create Captain America, among many other legendary characters at a variety of publishers. Talent runs in the family, and both Joe’s son Jim and grandson Jesse are comic book creators as well. ShieldMaster began as a collaboration between Joe and Jim, and earlier this year Jesse formed Simon Studios to bring this legacy creation to life. After running two highly successful crowdfunding campaigns, Jesse is now set to introduce a new generation of fans to these classic Joe Simon and Jack Kirby characters.\nShieldMaster: Blast to the Past is jam-packed not only with many Joe Simon/Jack Kirby characters, but top talent as well. In addition to the aforementioned introduction by Alan Moore, Joe Rubenstein and Tom Morgan are providing variant covers. Rubenstein invokes Neal Adams’ classic cover to Superman vs Muhammad Ali and Morgan captures these great characters in action. ShieldMaster: Blast to the Past will also feature a painted cover, previously unreleased, by Joe Simon himself featuring his iconic characters. The Kickstarter campaign also features rewards allowing fans to be drawn into the comic. ShieldMaster: Blast to the Past is a labor of love, many years in the making.\nRelated: Star Wars' Dark Droids Event Can Bring Back Alan Moore's Vengeful Droid God\nJoe Simon and Jack Kirby are genre-defining creators, whose work continues to electrify new audiences 80+ years after they started their careers.

{"title": "&quot;Where Did The Bullet Go?&quot; One Of Walking Dead's Biggest Tragedies Has Real Doctor Very Skeptical", "date": "2023-10-05 12:59:39", "text": "ER Doctor Jordan Wagner expresses some skepticism about what the results would be from one of The Walking Dead's biggest tragic injuries.\nER Doctor Jordan Wagner has analyzed a tragic scene from The Walking Dead, expressing skepticism that the character involved would have survived. The zombie series is filled with plenty of horrific death scenes and major characters being permanently injured within the post-apocalypse. Some of these brutal scenes involve injuries that characters survive, but which change them for the rest of the show.\nIn a video from his Doctor ER YouTube channel, Wagner reveals the chances of survival after Carl gets shot in the eye during The Walking Dead season 6, episode 9.\nWagner's analysis, which starts at 6:36, focuses on how the bullet from Ron's gun entered Carl's eye, making it unclear if he would have survived the incident in real life. Check out Wagner's analysis of the classic yet tragic scene below:\n\nWoah! Where did the bullet go?I'm assuming the bullet went into his eye. We'll never be able to recover that, the eye trauma is done. There's no more globe. Now you just have a hole. But now the issue ends up being, where did the bullet go once it actually passed through the eye? Was it going at an angle that it went out the side, or did it go straight through to the back, going through brain tissue?In this situation, put pressure to the wound. Obviously you can't get to a hospital at this point, so hopefully you're not having brain swelling due to the trauma which can cause you to be altered. And then did it actually go into the balance center of the brain, or into the brain stem?The balance center of the brain is your cerebellum. If it hits the brain stem, there's not a lot of survival, because that's where all your autonomic nervous system type function is.\n\nWoah!

If it hits the brain stem, there's not a lot of survival, because that's where all your autonomic nervous system type function is.\nWhile Wagner highlights the many issues that could arise from Carl getting shot in the eye, Rick's son eventually recovers from his injury. While the bullet easily could have damaged his brain, Carl is shown to be fine in season 6, episode 10 following a two-month time jump. While Carl eventually died in The Walking Dead season 8, he was bit by a zombie, which had nothing to do with his eye injury.\nBased on Wagner's statements, it seems unlikely Carl would have survived getting shot in the eye in real life. His analysis indicates the bullet would have been lodged deep in Carl's skull, meaning he would have received brain damage that may not have been treatable in the post-apocalypse. The likelihood the bullet hit Carl's brain stem also indicates a low chance of survival if he'd been shot in real life.\nHowever, just like in The Walking Dead, Carl losing his eye could have resulted in a miraculous survival if the bullet didn't lodge deep enough to pierce his brain. While in real life this may not have been as possible, the event can still be considered realistic despite the low chances of it ever happening. Even so, as Wagner indicates, Carl's survival would still depend on how good his treatment would be.\nSource: Doctor ER/YouTube\n"}

The upcoming Apple TV+ series will see the Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Gary Goetzman reunite to produce another World War II series. The trio previously collaborated for 2001's Band of Brothers and its 2010 companion series, The Pacific.\nNow, Apple TV+ has revealed that Masters of the Air will be premiering on the streaming platform beginning Friday, January 26, 2024. The series will begin with two episodes before airing one new episode every week, ending on March 15. In addition, the first images from the series were released, which can be viewed below:\nProducer Goetzman also released a statement about what to expect from the series, which can be read below:\n'Masters of the Air' is a salute to the brave men of the 8th Air Force, who, through their courage and brotherhood, helped defeat Nazi Germany in World War II. Tom [Hanks] and Steven [Spielberg] have always wanted to visualize cinematically what our author Don Miller has called, this ‘singular event in the history of warfare.’ We’re thrilled that Apple TV+ has given us the opportunity to combine the efforts of so many talented people, on-screen and behind the camera, to tell this important story.\nMasters of the Air is based on Donald L. Miller's book of the same name, documenting the real-life actions of the US Air Force's 100th Bombardment Group - also known as the Bloody Hundredth. As Goetzman indicated, the miniseries will follow the real-life events the 8th Air Force was involved in during World War II. The miniseries will recount the history of the Bloody Hundredth in the form of a war drama.\nThe cast for Masters of the Air underscores how emotionally potent the performances in the series will be. Major cast members include Austin Butler (Elvis), Barry Keoghan (The Banshees of Inisherin), Callum Turner (Queen and Country), Anthony Boyle (Tetris), and Sam Hazeldine (Slow Horses). However, the ensemble cast of the show will feature dozens of actors portraying the many young men that were part of the Bloody Hundredth.\nWhile Masters of the Air has broken a Band of Brothers tradition by airing on Apple TV+ instead of HBO, Spielberg, Hanks, and Goetzman's involvement indicates the series will be just as memorable. With plenty of talented actors taking on the roles of World War II Air Force soldiers, the series is promising an emotional retelling of the Bloody Hundredth's history. The extent of the series' intensity will be revealed once it premieres next year.\nSource: Apple TV+\n"}
{"title": "Ahsoka's Replacement For Her Broken Lightsaber Was Set Up By Star Wars 5 Years Ago", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "Ahsoka Tano may have lost her shorter shoto-style lightsaber in the Ahsoka finale, but Star Wars Rebels already set up its eventual replacement.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nAhsoka Tano may have lost one of her lightsabers in the Ahsoka finale, but Star Wars has already set up its replacement. The Ahsoka finale saw one of the show’s toughest lightsaber duels yet. In a last-ditch attempt to stop Grand Admiral Thrawn from returning to Star Wars’ prime galaxy, Ahsoka, Sabine Wren, and Ezra Bridger stormed the Nightsisters’ fortress on Peridea. There, they encountered many obstacles, including a new-and-improved version of Morgan Elsbeth. As a reward for all of Morgan’s efforts in the race to get home, the Great Mothers bestowed a gift upon her, including an additional helping of dark magick, as well as a powerful sword known as the Blade of Talzin.\nReprising their fight from The Mandalorian season 2, Ahsoka and Morgan went head-to-head in a duel that proved to be one of Ahsoka’s most exciting yet. What made it so thrilling is that it's clear that even for someone as skilled as Ahsoka, Morgan was not an enemy easily overcome. Morgan even managed to destroy one of Ahsoka’s two lightsaber hilts – the shorter, shoto-style one – by cutting it in half, forcing Ahsoka to fight with just one lightsaber. Yet, despite Morgan’s best efforts, Ahsoka prevails and kills her adversary – but what will she do now after losing one of her weapons?\nThough the Ahsoka finale makes it clear that Ahsoka could potentially rebuild her lost lightsaber with all the equipment that Huyang has stored aboard their ship – Ezra manages to quickly construct a brand-new lightsaber, too – there’s a chance she may decide not to. In the now partially retconned Star Wars Rebels epilogue, Ahsoka meets Sabine on Lothal in a resplendent white robe while carrying a simple, yet elegant white staff. The Ahsoka show has canonically depicted Ahsoka’s transformation into Ahsoka the White after her ordeal in the World Between Worlds, but the staff has yet to make an appearance. Now that one of Ahsoka’s lightsabers has been destroyed and she and Sabine are stranded on Peridea, she may end up creating that new staff after all, using it as a replacement for her second lightsaber.\nRelated: When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline\nAhsoka has changed as a result of her journey in the Ahsoka show. In the World Between Worlds, she chose life, reconciled with her past, and embraced her future. Stranded on Peridea, a place with a deep and mysterious connection to the Force – as demonstrated by the Great Mothers’ powers, the statues of the Mortis gods, and the appearance of the owl-like creature, a convor known as Morai – Ahsoka may yet change even more. It’s possible that, by connecting to the Force in a new way on Peridea, Ahsoka may decide to become something beyond being a Ronin or a Jedi. She may choose to forego her lightsabers altogether, fully embracing the Force as her closest ally.\nRELATED: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nIn the Star Wars Rebels epilogue, there’s nothing to suggest that Ahsoka still carries her lightsabers with her. Her transformation into Ahsoka the White is meant to symbolize her new-found wisdom, strength, authority, and compassion, mirroring Gandalf’s journey in The Lord of the Rings. To be a leader, and to protect the galaxy, Ahsoka doesn’t necessarily need her lightsabers. Those are weapons used for close combat, and Ahsoka could be more and mean more. Ahsoka’s transformation was foreshadowed when the Daughter – essentially a living conduit for the light side of the Force – gave her life so that Ahsoka may live in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Now, after the Ahsoka finale, Ahsoka has all the tools she needs to become who she was always meant to be.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Gen V's Main Character Powers Have 1 Big Thing In Common (That The Boys & The Seven Don't)", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "Gen V may be a spinoff of Amazon Prime Video’s superhero series The Boys, but this new show has something that its predecessors did not.\nWarning: This article contains mentions of self-harm, eating disorders, drug abuse, and suicide.\nThe latest installment in The Boys franchise, Gen V, is already proving that it isn't like its predecessors by creating a major connection between its main characters' powers. Gen V is the third series in The Boys franchise, which is based on a series of comics of the same name, written by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. While The Boys explores the corruption of the world's top superheroes and the vigilante group intent on taking them down, Gen V focuses on a group of young supes training at the Vought-run Godolkin University.\nThough Gen V is firmly rooted in The Boys timeline, the series is already much different than those that came before it. The show has an entirely new cast with completely new priorities and aims. However, one especially significant difference between The Boys and Gen V is the connections between the series' supes. While The Boys introduced a set of heroes that were all unique from each other, the characters in Gen V all have one thing in common that links their powers together. This commonality has never been seen before in The Boys or The Seven, which means Gen V could exemplify how the franchise is evolving.\nRelated: Gen V Season 2: Renewal Chances, Release Date Prediction & Everything We Know\nWhat makes Gen V stand out is the fact that all the main characters' powers stem from their mental health conditions. While these supes are powerful, their abilities are all inextricably linked to the personal problems they are facing. This often leaves the characters feeling drained or hurt after using their powers. The connections are as follows: Marie must self-harm to use her blood magic, Emma purges and binges food to shrink or grow, Jordan's powers parallel the identity struggles of a transgender individual, Luke's powers lead him to take his own life, and Cate's abilities are referred to as \"pushing,\" a term often used in relation to drug abuse.\nOne character that doesn't quite fit the mold of this theory is Andre. Andre Anderson is a popular kid at Godolkin University with powers of magnetic manipulation. In his personal life, he is under intense pressure to succeed due to his father's incredible reputation and power. Though it is a stretch, Andre's powers could correlate to his need to charm others, thereby pulling them toward him. His magnetism could also feel like a sort of physical pressure that aligns with the mental one he faces. Either way, Andre's connection to this theory still has time to make itself known later in the series.\nOverall, Gen V's power connection is a hint at what the series is really aiming to say. While The Boys is a superhero and action series through and through, Gen V seems to be less about the superhero side of things, and more about the struggles young people face within the setting of a superhero world. The focus is not necessarily on what these characters can do, but how they do them, and what the cost is to their personhood. This is a topic that is not as prevalent in The Boys, and so is a great area for Gen V to explore, especially through the lens of a younger cast.\nAnother aspect of Gen V that fits with this idea is the dean of Godolkin University. Indira Shetty is the dean of Godolkin, but she isn't a superhero at all. She is actually a behavorial therapist. This fact makes her all the more important when considering the problems each main character is dealing with. These characters don't need help with their powers, but with their mental health conditions, and ironically, Shetty is more equipped to handle such issues. Overall, Gen V seems to be setting up a situation in which these young supes have to handle their personal problems before they can become true heroes.\nThe fact that Gen V's characters are connected via their mental health conditions and related powers makes the series stand out from The Boys. The series' focus on mental health makes the tone entirely different to The Boys, which leans much more into violence and chaos. Overall, these differences are good because they set the shows apart from each other and prove that the franchise can be dynamic. Gen V may be a spinoff of The Boys, but it doesn't have to be a carbon copy, and in fact, its differences are what make it better.\n"}
{"title": "Strange New Worlds Season 3 Should Go Gangster Like TOS & TNG", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds should follow in the footsteps of TOS and TNG, and let its characters take on the gangster genre.\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds should take on the gangster genre, following in the footsteps of Star Trek: The Original Series and Star Trek: The Next Generation. Both previous Trek series made excellent use of the gangster genre in the classic episodes TOS season 2, episode 17, \"A Piece of the Action\" and TNG season 1, episode 12, \"The Big Goodbye.\" \"A Piece of the Action\" sees Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) visit a planet with a culture based on 1920s-era Chicago. Kirk and Spock dress the part as mobsters and have fun interacting with the eccentric locals.\nIn Star Trek: The Next Generation's \"The Big Goodbye,\" Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) takes on the persona of fictional hard-boiled detective Dixon Hill in the first Star Trek holodeck episode. Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) and Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) also get in on the fun, dressing in period wear and embracing the fictional story they find themselves in. The characters of Strange New Worlds have had their fair share of wacky adventures, and they would have a blast taking on a story of mobsters and murder mysteries.\nRelated: Star Trek: Strange New Worlds Cast - Every New & Returning Character In Season 2\nWith the gangster episodes of TOS and TNG, Star Trek proved that it can do that particular genre really well. Not only does the concept give the actors a chance to wear fun period costumes, but it also allows them to portray a different version of their characters. Gangster or hard-boiled detective stories may not seem to have a lot in common with Star Trek, but something about the combination really works. The detective genre is an easy genre to reference, with plenty of recognizable tropes and cliches. It would be so much fun to see Anson Mount's Captain Christopher Pike and the rest of the crew of his Enterprise dress up in period costumes and embrace their inner mobster.\nAlthough the Enterprise of Strange New Worlds does not have a holodeck, there are many ways they could justify a mobster storyline. The most obvious solution would be for Captain Pike and the Enterprise to visit Sigma Iotia II, the same planet Captain Kirk and Spock visit in \"A Piece of the Action.\" When the Federation made first contact with Sigma Iotia II 100 years before Kirk visited there, they left behind a book entitled Chicago Mobs of the Twenties. The inhabitants of the planet then formed their entire society based on this book. With a behind-the-scenes team as creative as those behind Strange New Worlds, they could undoubtedly come up with a fun and interesting way to incorporate a mobster story into the show.\nOver the course of its two seasons so far, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds has done a fairytale-inspired episode, a space pirates episode, an alternate future episode, two comedy episodes, a courtroom episode, a time travel episode, an amnesia episode, a crossover episode, and Star Trek's first ever musical episode. That is a lot of different genres to cover in 20 episodes, and yet, Strange New Worlds has done a wonderful job of making all of these premises work. The main reason these episodes work so well comes down largely to the incredible cast.\nOf course, the writing has to be solid for these various stories to work, and it undoubtedly has been. But the actors take the writing to another level with their performances, never failing to put their whole heart into every outlandish premise. The writers and actors of Strange New Worlds understand the characters well, and even the most gimmicky episodes move the plot forward and offer insight into the characters. Star Trek: Strange New Worlds has proven that it can do many different genres well, and the wonderful cast should get the chance to go full gangster like the casts of TOS and TNG before them.\n"}

Beyond that is the most challenging of all: defeating Team GO Rocket Boss Giovanni. As a result, your Pokémon will need to be in tip-top shape, because there are lots of battles coming your way this October, and Leader Cliff is one you need to watch out for.\nThankfully, Team GO Rocket Leader Cliff has the same Pokémon GO lineup from September. In fact, he's had the same lineup for the last four months in a row. Therefore, any trainer who's previously battled Leader Cliff will know what to expect this October and should be able to quickly wipe out the character's three Shadow Pokémon.\nBeating team Leader Cliff will net Trainers with 1,000 Star Dust, two bundle items, and the possibility to catch one of the Leader's Shadow Pokémon.\nTeam GO Rocket Leader Cliff's starting Pokémon is a generation one Rock- and Flying-type Aerodactyl. Following that, Cliff will either bring out Water- and Psychic-type Slowking, Psychic- and Flying-type Gallade, or Rock- and Grass-type Cradily. Finally, in the third wave, Cliff has the possibility to pull out a Rock- and Dark-type Tyranitar, an Ice- and Ground-type Mamoswine, or a Ghost-type Dusknoir, according to PokemonGoHub.\nWave\nCliff's Pokémon\nType\nWeaknesses\nBest Pokémon Counters\n1\nAerodactyl\nRock & Flying\nElectric, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Water\nTyranitar, Rampardos, Raikou, Magnezone, or Swampert\n2\nSlowking\nWater & Psychic\nBug, Dark, Electric, Ghost, and Grass\nMagnezone, Raikou, Gengar, Torterra, or Hydreigon\nGallade\nPsychic & Flying\nFlying, Ghost, and Fairy\nGengar, Togekiss, Giratina, Gardevoir, or Xurkitree\nCradily\nRock & Grass\nBug, Fighting, Ice, and Steel\nMachamp, Lucario, Terrakion, Mamoswine, or Metagross\n3\nTyranitar\nRock & Dark\nFighting, Bug, Fairy, Grass, Ground, Steel, and Water\nMachamp, Lucario, Swampert, Terrakion, or Togekiss\nMamoswine\nIce & Ground\nFighting, Fire, Grass, Steel, and Water\nMetagross, Swampert, Machamp, Hydreigon, or Terrakion\nDusknoir\nGhost\nDark and Ghost\nGengar, Hydreigon, Tyranitar, Darkrai, or Chandelur\nRegardless of who you face in waves two and three of Cliff's battle, the Pokémon GO team you'll want for this fight is Lucario, Tyranitar, and either Togekiss or Gengar. Starting with Lucario, whose Fighting- and Steel-type are both weaknesses for Aerodactyl.\nAs a result, Lucario should make quick work of the first wave and then should only be played in round two if Cradilly appears. If not, save Lucario for wave three due to the fact the Pokémon counters both Tyranitar and Mamoswine.\nRelated: How To Beat Giovanni In Pokémon GO (October 2023)\nIn round two, you'll want to bring out Tyranitar. Although the Pokémon really only counters Slowking, he'll also counter Dusknoir in wave three should you face him. Nonetheless, finishing off your team with either Togekiss or Gengar will cover all your bases. Togekiss is Fairy and Flying-type, which counters Gallade and Tyranitar. Gengar, on the other hand is a Ghost- and Poison-type, which counters Slowking, Gallade, and Dusknoir.\nWhile battling Leader Cliff with this setup is somewhat a matter of getting the right matchups, when the stars do align, you'll easily walk through his team of shadow Pokémon in Pokémon GO.\nSource: PokemonGOHub/Zeroghan\nRiley grew up in the golden era of Xbox vs PlayStation and has fallen in love with RPGs and action-adventure games as a result.

The Starz drama has already delivered two critically acclaimed seasons and deserves another installment.\nFollowing the success of its first two critically acclaimed seasons, anticipation is incredibly high for P-Valley season 3. Based on the play Pu**y Valley, P-Valley is a drama Starz series that explores the lives of the dancers and employees who work at a Mississippi strip club called The Pynk and the struggles they face day-to-day both at and outside their profession. P-Valley features a talented cast of actors such as Brandee Evans, Nicco Annan, and Shannon Thornton who all consistently give fantastic performances.\nAt the end of season 2, the main protagonist Mercedes Woodbine (Evans) officially retires from The Pynk and starts a new journey in her life. Additionally, Lil' Murda (J. Alphonse Nicholson) and Uncle Clifford Sayles (Nicco Annan) officially decide to reveal their secret romance to their friends and loved ones. The season 2 finale has left a lot of storylines open-ended, but how the show plans on exploring these character arcs is still left up to speculation as not much about P-Valley season 3 has been confirmed.\nRelated: 10 Underrated Series On Starz (That Are Secretly Great), Ranked\nIn May 2023, it was announced that P-Valley season 3 would completely halt production due to the WGA (Writers Guild of America) strike. Series creator Katori Hall stated that she supports and provides solidarity for the picketing writers, stating \"We will not be filming until a fair deal is reached\" (via Deadline). While the writer's strike recently officially ended on September 27. 2023, production on P-Valley season 3 will remain halted until the SAG-AFTRA strike comes to an end as well (via NPR).\nIn October 2022, two months after the season 2 finale, it was confirmed that P-Valley would be returning to Starz for a third season. Hall said in a statement, \"I am blessed beyond measure for this opportunity to write the next chapter of P-Valley. With its complex, dynamic and beautifully flawed characters, this show is a love letter to marginalized communities in the American South who rarely see themselves reflected on screen, and it brings me immense joy to know that it has been embraced by folx worldwide.\" (via TV Line)\nWhile P-Valley season 3 has been greenlit, it is difficult to speculate when the next entry of the show will be released due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike keeping production of the series shut down. However, should the strike end in 2023, it is possible that P-Valley will be released sometime in mid-to-late 2024.\nWhile P-Valley has yet to make any major confirmation regarding its season 3 cast, it is very likely that most of the main characters from seasons 1 and 2 will be returning. The only actor confirmed not to appear in P-Valley season 3 is Elarica Johnson, who played Autumn Knight, because her character decided to move away at the end of season 2. According to Katori Hall, Autumn has reached the natural end of her character arc, saying \"She was a woman who came in on the wind and her leaving on the wind.\" (via EW)\nIt has yet to be revealed what P-Valley season 3's exact story will be. However, it is very likely that the show's third outing will focus on both Mercedes and her personal journey after retiring and the romance between Lil'Murda and Uncle Clifford. Hall has stated that she has particularly detailed plans for Mercedes, stating \"I want her to have everything. I want her to have a wonderful relationship with her daughter. I want her to have a wonderful relationship with her mother. They probably need to go to therapy.\" (via Elle) However, whether Mercedes will get everything she's after remains uncertain.\nTimothy Lee is a writer and avid movie/TV/anime fan who has been working at Screen Rant since 2023.

{"title": "5 Best Gigs In Cyberpunk 2077 Phantom Liberty", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "Cyberpunk 2077’s spy narrative through Phantom Liberty is amazing, but all of the other optional gigs that V can do add a lot to the experience.\nAside from the main storyline of Cyberpunk 2077's spy thriller DLC Phantom Liberty, the expansion also has several new gigs that V can choose to take on along the way. Gigs are entirely optional but often can provide some good rewards and experience, in addition to providing some colorful backstory and lore for the game. They can often be triggered by entering an area or through story advancement, and are frequently started with a phone call, but they do not need to be completed immediately, so V can circle back when ready.\n[Warning: The following article contains mild spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty.]\nThe DLC Phantom Liberty adds a substantial amount of new content to Cyberpunk 2077 through both its main story of political intrigue and spy escapades, and also the many side jobs and gigs available that are crafted to enlarge the experience. Most of these gigs offer just as much depth of morality and philosophy in their choices, except possibly the gig \"Waiting For Dodger,\" and provide valuable insights into the lore of Dogtown. Below are a few of the best examples of gigs that V can take on in Phantom Liberty.\nRelated: \"Electrifying, Emotional, And Full Of Twists\" - Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Review\n\"Dogtown Saints\" is a gig in Phantom Liberty where players have to rescue Dr. Anthony Anderson, and gives players the first real opportunity to work with Mr. Hands in this expansion. Mr. Hands was previously a large part of Cyberpunk 2077 and continues his role as a fixer in Dogtown, and also becomes a bit more important to the overall plot than he was previously. In \"Dogtown Saints,\" Dr. Anderson is a ripperdoc who works pro bono to help the downtrodden people of Dogtown who don't have anywhere else to turn. His life is in danger, and Mr. Hands and Odell Blanco want V's help to save him. This is a gig that can be done early on in the DLC, as soon as V leaves the Dogtown hideout.\nTo get the result that makes Mr. Hands the happiest, it's best to try to keep everyone alive. The quest has a lot of moral ambiguity, however, which can lead to some thoughtful and philosophical pondering. Naturally, helping save the doctor to be able to reopen the clinic for the citizens of Dogtown is a good thing, but it's also interesting to think about who has the right to make certain choices. The immediate rewards are nothing extra special: 8,000 eddies, 1,300 EXP, and 167 street cred, but players should be sure to loot the clinic as some of the containers and fallen enemies in the area can drop worthwhile loot.\nRelated: There's One Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Side Quest You Should Do ASAP\n\"Prototype in the Scraper\" is a gig that V receives from Mr. Hands in Phantom Liberty, which has some moral and ethical decisions for players to make. Essentially, it sounds like a fetch quest at first, being asked to retrieve a prototype implant and the schematics for it. Unfortunately, that prototype is already implanted in someone named Hasan.\nHasan is a thief who V has to track down from a scav den in a Dogtown scraper jail cell. After breaking Hasan out, V has a decision to make about whether to give Hasan and the schematics to Mr. Hands, who will turn them all over to Zetatech, and likely torture and kill Hasan, or V can free Hasan and send the schematics to Mr. Hands. Rewards for either choice are the same, although if V lets Hasan go, then they will get a future side job from him that can lead to an Iconic Tech Pistol reward.\nPhantom Liberty's gig \"Waiting for Dodger\" adds a lot of humor to an otherwise very emotionally-heavy game. Any fan of Cyberpunk Edgerunners will also be interested to see that the main NPC that V works with in this gig is a new Phantom Liberty character, Stella Ramos, who is the sister of Sasha Yakovleva from Edgerunners. Stella's fiancée is an officer who looks to be in trouble at first. The entire situation is filled with sarcasm and humor, which is a fun contrast to the fact that it is involving drug dealing. Particularly if players choose to tell Dodger that the two cops are lying, its consequences are surprisingly light-hearted. The best reward, however, will come from killing Dodger, which provides a Tier 4 Iconic revolver named Rosco.\n\"Treating Symptoms\" is a gig in Phantom Liberty where players get to infiltrate the Voodoo Boys hideout, fight killer robots from NetWatch, and deal with a strange problem of someone threatening to hack into a woman's lungs. It is an incredible story to play through, with options for either stealth or heavy combat, and V gets to deal with some unique characters who epitomize the feeling of cyberpunk.\nUltimately, the choice becomes even more complicated when V runs into another undercover agent who is also in the process of completing a mission. The \"Treating Symptoms\" gig provides a lot of opportunities to have some fun roleplay and will pay out 8,000 eddies as a reward, with possibly an extra 8,000 much later on if V chose to help Alan.\nThe gig \"Talent Academy\" is one of the most deep and thought-provoking quests that are offered as an optional side gig, as the consequences for any possible solution can not only be difficult but for some may even hit close to home in real life. It can be emotional, but is also a very interesting commentary on the real world. In \"Talent Academy,\" Mr. Hands asks V to check out a strange Biotechnica sports facility in Dogtown and steal their data. Eventually coming to the computer of a woman named Fiona, V is caught by Fiona and offered a deal. Either Fiona will give them specific, controlled information to bring back to Mr. Hands in a way that won't hurt her company, or refuse, take all the data, and V can fight their way out. The rewards are the same for either option.\nThe tricky part is that this isn't just a normal company. In Phantom Liberty, Fiona is in charge of a sports academy which is taking advantage of children. Sports teams come there to scout out future star athletes, but the Biotechnica sports facility is not simply training kids but is putting cyberware in the children to improve their performance. The entire gig is written very well with dialogue that can make a person think, and the options presented can affect many lives, including a lot of the children in Cyberpunk 2077.\n"}
{"title": "&quot;Abracadabra&quot;: Superman's Weakness to Magic Unlocked His Most Powerful Form", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "Superman is incredibly powerful, but he does have a few specific weaknesses, including magic — but magic once somehow made him even stronger.\nIt's almost entirely impossible to harm Superman without using one of his very specific weaknesses. Aside from simply hitting him hard enough to bypass his invulnerability, the only way to deal any real damage to the Man of Steel is with either Kryptonite or magic. But when the sun became infused with magic in a strange future, Superman didn't get weaker — he got stronger.\nSince most people don't have the absolutely absurd strength levels it takes to defeat the Man of Steel, the only other options are using Kryptonite or magic. Kryptonite is famously the easiest way to defeat Superman; depending on the story it's either a mild annoyance or will instantly take him out of the fight. The same is true of magic: while Superman is borderline invulnerable, Superman has no defense against magic. This makes it one of the \"easier\" ways to damage him. The other much more complicated solution is to simply remove the sun, as Superman gains his powers from Earth's yellow sun — if he's without it, he's nothing more than a human. So when a group of villains infuses the sun with magic, one might think that would be Superman's worst nightmare, but things don't go exactly as expected.\nRelated: 1 Classic Superman Power Has a Deadly Upper Limit He Refuses to Use\nSuperman's surprising affinity for magic is featured in a dark future from Superman/Batman #82 by Cullen Bunn, ChrisCross, Marc Deering, Brad Anderson, and Steve Wands. After a group of magical villains sacrifice the sun for ultimate power, the magical heroes of DC try to infuse the sun with new life. While this does technically work, the sun begins giving off magical radiation instead of yellow sunlight. This not only shuts down all technology but apparently empowers Superman with magical energy. Instead of Clark being weakened as he usually is, he simply becomes magically adept. It seems that he not only keeps all of his normal powers but even gains a few new ones, as seen when he simply banishes a group of enemies from existence with a single thought.\nWhile most people think Superman's powers are from yellow sunlight, this isn't entirely true. Superman's powers come from radiation, not sunlight specifically. So when this new sun starts giving off magical radiation, instead of weakening Superman, he becomes significantly stronger than usual, just with a different source and outcome. He maintains most of his strength and the ability to fly but also gains new powers such as banishment and a form of \"magic vision\" akin to heat vision. Because of these new powers, Superman can save this dark future and prevent it from ever coming to pass.\nKryptonians have unique biology, and there are many different ways to mess with them. If a Kryptonian is under a yellow sun, they gain significant powers; under a blue sun, they gain even more. If they're under a red sun, they lose all of their powers. But if they're under a Kryptonite sun, it's agonizing pain for them and they lose their powers. If they gain too much yellow sunlight, their powers go out of control, and. apparently, if they're under a magical sun, then Superman becomes one of DC's strongest magical heroes.\nCheck out Superman/Batman #82, available now from DC Comics!\n"}
{"title": "10 Least Likable Characters in One Piece", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:33", "text": "From sniveling brats to oppressive tyrants, One Piece has its fair share of unlikable and despicable but characters but these ones take the cake!\nOne Piece has given fans innumerable beloved characters over the years, each having a unique character design and a signature gag, trait, or laugh that sets them apart from the rest. Regardless, with the series being as vast as it is and with so many characters to choose from there's bound to be some characters that simply aren't all that likable.\nIt is entirely possible to like a character for being an excellent antagonist, as seen with Katakuri, who despite being a major antagonist of his arc, is generally well-loved and respected for wanting a fair fight with Luffy. However, most of the least likable characters in One Piece are simply too despicable to look past despite their narrative role in the series. \nRelated: 10 Strongest Non-Devil Fruit Users In One Piece\nCharlotte Flampe is Big Mom's 77th daughter who was introduced in the midst of Luffy's battle against Katakuri in the mirror dimension during the Whole Cake Island Arc. Flampe is known mainly for her infatuation with Katakuri which borders on obsession as it pushes her to interfere in the battle out of wanting her brother to win. While wanting to help a sibling is far from despicable, Flampe is disliked mostly for her obnoxious, vain personality. What's worse is her infatuation quickly turns into disgust when she learns about Katakuri's mouth. Faced with the reality that Katakuri isn't as perfect as she believed him to be, Flampe turns her nose on him, going as far as to disown him and threaten to gossip about him to the rest of the family.\nSafe to say, Flampe might've been less unlikable if not for her shifty, petty behavior towards her own brother whom she once idolized. It also doesn't help her case that she comes off as quite the nosy brat.\nStelly is Sabo's adopted brother who went on to become the king of the Goa Kingdom. Much like the rest of the nobles there, Stelly looks down on everyone else as inferior to him. Stelly is particularly condescending to Merfolk and Fishmen and holds racist, stereotypical views about them. Not only is Stelly arrogant but also snotty and extremely spoiled as a result of which he often looked down on and insulted even his half-brother Sabo from a young age. Even as an adult, Stelly's attitude towards Sabo remains highly contemptuous, though he did seem shocked when he learned the latter was alive and part of the revolutionaries.\nTo top it off, Stelly also shows signs of being power hungry, evidenced when he saw the empty throne at Mariejois and even though his actions aren't all that atrocious he is still among the least-liked characters in the series.\nAbsalom was a member of the Thriller Bark Pirates with the power of the Clear-Clear Fruit and a penchant for being quite the misogynistic pervert. Even nicknamed 'Erosalam' by the zombies at Thriller Bark, he not only used his fruit to peek at Nami while she was bathing but also abducted her and forced her to marry him all within the little time the Straw Hats spent there. More importantly, Absalom has also expressed how he liked docile women who couldn't fight back like Nami.\nWhile Absalom's behavior is not much different from Sanji's who also used his Germa powers to try and spy on women at a bathhouse, Absalom doesn't have an inkling of respect for women, unlike Sanji. In fact, Absalom's obsession with wanting a bride stems not from romance but from the desire for more of a trophy than a partner which explains his unpopularity in the fandom.\nRelated: 10 Best One Piece Episodes Ranked\nNow the owner of a massive conglomerate, Wapol is the former ruler of Drum Island and the epitome of the word inexorable. During his time on Drum Island, Wapol was a terrible ruler. Besides being incredibly selfish, he is also a huge coward who abandoned his people to fend for themselves when the island was attacked by pirates. More importantly, he destroyed the rich tradition of doctors on the island by keeping twenty of the best ones for himself and hunting down the rest. Wapol's self-centeredness also makes him very petty and arrogant to the point where he did not hesitate to hit a young Vivi simply because her father Cobra had admonished him.\nIn all, there doesn't seem to be any hope for Wapol to redeem himself. Even after losing everything he had after being defeated by Luffy, Wapol went right back to his old, arrogant self after his rise back to money and power.\nSpandam was the ruthless yet cowardly chief of CP9 and the man in charge of capturing Nico Robin. The dislike for Spandam mostly stems from his sadistic treatment of Nico Robin at Enies Lobby where he not only broke his promise not to harm her but also shoved her down the stairs and physically assaulted her. Spandam was ruthless in the sense that he was willing to sacrifice anything to achieve his goal—that is, except himself. When the Straw Hats attacked Enies Lobby he sent the CP9 agents and several subordinates to deal with them instead, proving to be quite the coward despite his arrogance.\nInterestingly, Spandam is one of the earliest examples of the World Government's brand of absolute justice and highlights the worst problems with the Government, as well as its moral grayness. Together with his horrible personality and hypocritical tendencies, this makes Spandam very easy to dislike.\nA simple look at Coco Village and what the Arlong Pirates did to its people is enough to justify why Arlong may not be a fan favorite. Despite Arlong's sentiments towards humans making sense considering the tragic history of the Fishmen, it hardly justifies his actions toward the innocent people of Coco Village as well as the countless other places he ravaged. Arlong not only took all their money but also killed Bellemere and forced a young Nami into working for him. Moreover, he held the village hostage to ensure Nami's loyalty.\nArlong was easily one of the most ruthless, despicable antagonists of the East Blue Saga who wouldn't hesitate to kill even an innocent child. Considering that the Fishmen's past and their strained relationship with humans weren't explored until much later in the series, it does make sense why Arlong may be among the handful of unlikable characters in the series.\nRelated: What Arlong Is In One Piece: Netflix's Live-Action Fishmen Explained\n While nobles are infamously snobbish as proven by Stelly, the Celestial Dragons are a whole different breed among which Saint Charlos stands out most for his arrogance, pretentiousness, and condescending attitude toward everyone around him. However, what strikes viewers the most is his general disregard for life and his poor treatment of his slaves whom he takes pleasure in abusing and tormenting. Saint Charlos represents the worst of the Celestial Dragons, their perceived superiority over every other being on the planet, and everything that's wrong with the World Government as well as the world of One Piece as a whole.\nThe dislike for Akainu stems mostly from his skewed sense of justice. Akainu's belief in absolute justice often causes him to disregard the lives of several marines and innocent civilians. To him, any means are justified as long as he achieves his goal of terminating what he and the World Government deem 'evil'. Akainu's cruelty stands out most during the Ohara Incident where he decimated an entire ship full of civilians off the chance that one of them may be a researcher. In that sense, Akainu's idea of justice is biased towards the Celestial Dragons he serves.\nAdmittedly, Akainu makes for an excellent antagonist and hardly anyone can blame him for killing Ace at Marineford as he was only doing his job. That being said, Akainu's blind obedience to the Celestial Dragons and his ignorance and disregard towards any other life paint him as quite the unlikable character.\nWhile most of One Piece's least likable characters are unlikable because of their actions or beliefs, Trebol is unlikable by virtue of how obnoxious he is. Though Trebol's constant interruptions during Luffy's battle against Doflamingo weren't quite as noticeable in the manga, they could not be any more infuriating in the anime. That being said, Trebol's obnoxious laugh and laid-back persona hide his true, insidious nature, seen when he took advantage of a young embittered and disillusioned Doflamingo and instigated him to a life of crime.\n​​​​\nRegardless of the role Trebol played in Doflamingo's childhood, the fact remains that he's unlikable because he's annoying, meddlesome, and possibly the most repulsive character in the series.\nRelated: 10 Important One Piece Characters Netflix's Remake Will Probably Never Show\nOrochi is easily the most unlikable character in One Piece. In fact, if being a terrible ruler were a competition, Orochi might even give Doflamingo a run for his money. Not only did Orochi underhandedly grab the title of the shogun, but he also sold his people into slavery to a vicious pirate all while starving them by keeping all the resources untouched by pollution to himself. Moreover, Orochi turned on the only man who took him in all out of resentment and his thirst for vengeance. Yet, despite his anger, Orochi could not bring himself to face the Akazaya Nine and Oden, choosing instead to hide behind Kaido like the coward he is.\nOverall, Wano's story is incredibly tragic, and it's hard to believe a man as pathetic as Orochi almost managed to destroy the entire nation which makes it all the more satisfying when Orochi finally meets his fate for his actions.\nAll in all, only time will tell whether any of these characters will get the chance to redeem themselves. Considering Oda's ability to turn characters on their head and the fact that he has surprised readers before with once unlikable characters like Franky even joining the Straw Hats, it's safe to say nothing is entirely impossible. Unlikely as it seems, there may even be a sliver of hope for One Piece characters like Wapol and Akainu.\nMerlyn De Souza is a freelance writer and anime enthusiast with a Bachelor's degree in English Literature.

{"title": "Wheel Of Time: Why The Season 1 Finale Faked Loial's Death", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:34", "text": "Wheel of Time made a surprising choice in the season 1 finale when it pretended to kill off Loial. Here's why that moment was included.\nAmazon’s The Wheel of Time show made a surprising choice when it faked Loial’s death in the season 1 finale, but how did Loial survive? During the episode, the fan-favorite Ogier from Robert Jordan’s novels was seemingly murdered by Padan Fain in a gruesome scene. However, it’s now known that Loial hasn’t been removed from the series after all. Loial’s apparent demise sparked shock from the fans, especially since the character is such an important part of Jordan’s Wheel of Time story. Not only that, but his early “death” felt rather pointless, given that he had hardly been around long for it to matter.\nSince he barely knew Rand and the others, the emotional impact of his death on The Wheel of Time characters in season 2 would have been severely limited. The confusion caused by this decision was cleared up after the finale’s release when Wheel of Time showrunner Rafe Judkins addressed the incident. Though the episode provided no hints that Loial survived the stab wounds he sustained in his encounter with Padan Fain, Judkins confirmed that the character was in fact alive. So, this brings up the question of how did Loial survive.\nIn the season 1 finale, Padan Fain (Johann Myers) appeared to deliver the fatal stab wound to Loial, killing the fan-favorite character. However, shortly after this happened, Wheel of Time showrunner Rafe Judkins confirmed the Ogier didn't actually die. Wheel of Time faking Loial's death in the finale and then confirming his survival immediately afterward was an odd creative choice, but not one that was done without a reason. Judkins’ comments on the matter have shed light on why this moment was included.\nAccording to the showrunner, he wanted to use its Loial fakeout to get fans ready for real character deaths. He explained that while he didn’t truly kill off Loial, some book characters will eventually have to die (even if they live in the source material). His thinking was that if viewers thought Loial was dead (albeit only briefly), they would be “emotionally prepared” for that inevitable scenario [via EW].\n\"I wanted people to be a little on their toes, because real deaths are coming for characters that don't die in the books. We have to, because we can't hold 2,000 series regulars through multiple seasons. It's coming, and I want people to emotionally prepare themselves. The thought that Loial might be gone will hopefully start to get people emotionally prepared, but I couldn't. He's my favorite.\"\nThis reasoning makes sense, especially when considering the size of the series’ cast and how long most of the characters stick around. As the Wheel of Time book series went on, Jordan continuously built on to its cast with new characters and expanded the roles of minor ones. Rarely did the books ever kill off or altogether remove a key character. Instead, dozens of Wheel of Time characters popped in and out and lingered on throughout the series. This was true for not only the biggest players in the story, but also recurring allies such as Juilin Sandar, Galad Damodred, Leanne Sharif, Alanna Mosvani, and Logain Ablar.\nAs Judkins has pointed out, the show just “can't hold 2,000 series regulars through multiple seasons.” A few Wheel of Time characters will have to be written out, which is a book change that Judkins has promised will happen at some point or another. And since keeping every main character around just isn’t a sustainable model for a TV show, it’s understandable that some favorites will eventually meet untimely ends before The Wheel of Time ends. But whether faking out Loial’s death has succeeded in preparing audiences for these unexpected deaths remains to be seen.\nRELATED: The 50 Best TV Shows of All Time\nSadly, Wheel of Time never bothered to even explain how Loial survived the apparent death in the first season. In that season 1 finale, Padan stabbed Loial in the chest and it looked like that was enough to kill him. However, when Loial showed back up in season 2, he looked just fine, as if nothing happened. He doesn't even mention getting stabbed in the chest in the first season, and he just shops up looking happy and fit, as he did before this seemingly life-threatening incident. There was a six-month time jump before he showed back up in Wheel of Time, but it seems strange to think that the show has just ignored his near death.\n\n"}
{"title": "Gen V's Subtle Stephen King Reference Makes 1 Main Character's Story Darker", "date": "2023-10-05 18:00:27", "text": "The Boys' spin-off series, Gen V, makes a subtle nod to a 43-year-old Stephen King story, making one supe's power much darker than it initially seems.\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for Gen V.\nGen V has a hidden reference to a 43-year-old Stephen King story that makes one main character's powers a lot darker. Serving as a spin-off to Amazon's adaptation of The Boys' comics, Gen V drifts away from the source material by adding new characters and storylines to the mix. Despite this deviation, the show stays true to the franchise's essence by not portraying super-powered individuals in a typical light and, instead, satirizing all the moral dilemmas and ethical conflicts they face. To reinstate these ideas and themes, Gen V also drops several easter eggs and references to the story arcs set by The Boys.\nFor instance, the spin-off series not only briefly hints that Homelander is facing legal charges for his public act of violence from The Boys season 3's ending moments but also reveals how The Seven has two empty spots following Queen Maeve and Starlight's season 3 departure. In all of these references, Gen V also surprisingly makes a subtle nod to a character from one of Stephen King's books, which adds more narrative significance to the powers of one of its supes. This clever allusion to Stephen King's work highlights how Gen V offers a rich tapestry of storytelling, making its character beats more impactful.\nRELATED: Gen V's First Major Death Was Already Teased In The Boys Season 3\nGiven how many fantastical characters have telepathic powers that allow them to manipulate others, it is not surprising that Gen V's Cate and Firestarter's Andy have similar mind-control abilities. However, Cate is similar to the Stephen King character because, like Andy, she calls her power \"the push.\" Like Andy's \"push\" powers in Firestarter were \"manufactured\" through unethical experiments performed by a government agency called \"The Shop\" that injected him with a compound named \"Lot Six,\" Cate also acquired her powers through Vought International's evil Compound V experiments.\nBoth characters also experience severe symptoms when they use their powers beyond a limit. While Firstarter's Andy gets nosebleeds, Cate's eyes turn red with blood clots. As Gen V establishes towards the end of episode 2, Cate suffers from brain damage if she does not use her abilities carefully. Although the Stephen King character does not wear gloves like Cate, his \"pushing\" power works best when he uses it on unsuspecting targets. As fascinating as these similarities between Cate and Andy's powers may seem, they make Cate's \"push\" powers in Gen V much darker.\nGen V's references to Stephen King's Firestarter prove that, like Andy, Cate will always carry the heavy burden of internal conflict concerning the ethics of controlling and manipulating others. Like Andy often regrets harming others with his \"push\" powers despite being well-intentioned, Cate will struggle to forgive herself for planting destructive thoughts in other people's heads. And, similar to Andy, even if she tries using her powers for the betterment of society in Gen V, Vought International, like The Shop, will always try to weaponize her and misuse her \"push\" for their personal benefit.\n"}

Here's what we know about the sequel's development status, potential release date, story details, and more.\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley will finally bring Eddie Murphy’s titular ultra-cool law enforcer back for Beverly Hills Cop 4, and after years in development progress on the movie is moving at full steam. The Beverly Hills Cop franchise helped write the formula for buddy-cop action comedies, with Eddie Murphy playing the lead from the very beginning in 1984. Beverly Hills Cop has spawned two sequels so far, with the most recent arriving in 1994. Now, over three decades later, the fourth movie Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley is on the way.\nOnce again starring Eddie Murphy with Mark Malloy in the director's chair, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley is due to arrive on Netflix, as the streamer is teaming up with Paramount to ensure Beverly Hills Cop 4 reaches patient franchise fans. With a cast that includes returning cast members like John Aston and Paul Reiser alongside newcomers like Kevin Bacon and Joseph Gordon Levitt, there are plenty of reasons Axel Foley’s first cast in over three decades is so highly anticipated.\nThe most recent Beverly Hills Cop 4 news came in July 2023, although there was nothing official confirmed by Netflix on what could be a significant move for the Eddie Murphy franchise sequel. According to a report by World of Reel, insider sources claim that Netflix has been test-screening Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley with a view to potentially releasing it earlier than 2024. According to the report, this is to fill a sudden scheduling gap left by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.\nBeverly Hills Cop 4 is currently believed to be in post-production, meaning that a late 2023 release could be possible since - in theory - no further work would be required from the actors, who are still on strike at the time of writing. While the report suggested that Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley has tested incredibly well with audiences there’s been nothing official from Netflix, Paramount, or Eddie Murphy to verify them. If they are accurate, however, it’s possible that the release date of the new Beverly Hills Cop movie could arrive much sooner than expected.\nBeverly Hills Cop 4 was first confirmed back in the 1990s. However, this version wasn’t Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley. There have been multiple failed attempts to bring a fourth Beverly Hills Cop movie to screens, including a version from Paramount that had been slated for a 2016 release, only to be pulled from the studio's schedule a year later. At one point directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah were also attached to a 2020 version of the project, but the original Beverly Hills 4 directors left to work on the now-canceled Batgirl movie.\nThe version of Beverly Hills Cop 4 that’s due to arrive on Netflix was confirmed in 2019 (via Deadline). The final creative team of Mark Molloy directing with Will Beall, Tom Gormican, and Kevin Etten on the scripts wasn’t fully revealed until March 2023, however, despite the new Beverly Hills Cop movie filming in November 2022. The full title of Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley, as well as the addition of Joseph Gordon Levitt and Taylour Paige to the cast, was revealed earlier the same year, in August (via Deadline).\nThere is no Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley release date yet. However, the movie is reportedly currently in post-production, with test screenings possibly even taking place. While a 2024 release date is widely believed to be the earliest Beverly Hills Cop 4 could arrive, a surprise late-2023 arrival on Netflix is still possible.\nThe cast of Beverly Hills Cop 4 features a mix of new faces and returning names from the existing trilogy of Beverly Hills Cop trilogy of movies. Grammy winner and Academy Award-nominated comedy and action legend Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Coming to America) is of course back again as Axel Foley, although this is unsurprising given that the hero of the franchise is a titular one for the fourth entry. Joining Eddie Murphy in the cast of Beverly Hills Cop 4 are:\nJoining the returning franchise cast members for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley are Kevin Bacon, Mark Pellegrino, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Taylour Paige, and Patricia Belcher in undisclosed roles.\nWhile the specifics of the story are being kept under wraps by Netflix and Paramount, there is reportedly a plot synopsis for Beverly Hills Cop 4. A report shared by Moviehole suggests that the story of Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley will see Foley return to LA to investigate a corrupt Beverly Hills police force and a murder connected to them. It’s also been reported that Eddie Murphy’s Axel Foley will have an adult daughter.\nThis has yet to be confirmed by Netflix or Paramount, but many outlets appear to be running with this premise as the plot for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley. It would certainly track with previous entries in the Beverly Hills Cop franchise. It’s also known that Beverly Hills Cop 4 will be yet another buddy cop movie, so Foley won’t be on his own, and his possible partner could be one of his former franchise compatriots or, quite possibly, the rumored cop boyfriend of his estranged daughter.\nZoreb has a passion for cinema and music.

James MacKinnon, Makeup Department Head and Prosthetics, and his team are strong contenders to win the Emmy for Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup.\nJames MacKinnon has a storied history in the Star Trek franchise. Starting in the 1990s series Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, MacKinnon worked as a prosthetic makeup and special makeup effects artist under department head and mentor, Michael Westmore. MacKinnon also worked with Westmore on Star Trek: First Contact. MacKinnon has won Emmys for his work in Star Trek: Discovery and Star Trek: Picard.\nRelated: Star Trek: Picard Season 3 Ending Explained (In Detail)\nScreen Rant had the pleasure to chat with James MacKinnon about Star Trek: Picard season 3's home video release. We discussed his Emmy-nominated work on Picard's Borg Queen (Alice Krige/Jane Edwina Seymour), Worf (Michael Dorn), Data (Brent Spiner), and his overall career creating makeup and prosthetics for Star Trek.\nScreen Rant: Congratulations on your Emmy nominations for Picard. I think every other department, especially the actors, the writers, the directors, got robbed this year, but it's great your department got recognized.\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, they did. They did. They did a great job. I was a little disappointed myself.\nYou have a little cameo in the turbo-lift with Seven of Nine in one of the episodes of Picard. Terry Matalas called you out in the commentary.\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, what's funny is most of the Star Treks that I've worked on in the last 27 years, I've played a little part in each one of them. So I always try to put my face on.\nDo you prefer to be Starfleet? Or is there like an alien love to play?\nJames MacKinnon: Well, I was a Borg in season 2. Sorry, season 1, I was a Borg. And then season 2... what was I? I was something else in season 2. But this one, you actually saw my face. Usually I'm completely under makeup.\nI read that you got to do three aliens from your bucket list in Picard season 3. What were the three?\nJames MacKinnon: Well, to do Worf again, to do Data again, and then to do a Ferengi for the second time. It's kind of fun in this world that I'm in that I actually, as an artist, I get to do them one time, and then products and materials change, and years change, and my artistry changes as well. And I get another opportunity to excel make them bigger, better, but still keep the core look about 'em. And that's obviously with Neville Page and Vincent Van Dyke with VVD effects. So it's a good combination of how to keep the fans happy, how to keep the original looks, but elevate the makeups to current day.\nLet's talk about that a little bit. I know you've worked on DS9. I'm a massive Ferengi fan. I love DS9. It's my favorite of the Star Treks. Tell me about upgrading Sneed from Quark in the 90s.\nJames MacKinnon: Well, that's all foam latex back then. And we're obviously shooting on 35 millimeter film. So you have a little bit of play on the paint jobs, on the materials. And now with 8K, 10K, 12K, all the Ks that they have... And now we're doing silicone. We have to, as artists, step up our game because that sees every little nook and cranny of either a mistake in a paint job, a mistake in an application, anything. A mouth opens too big, a crack happens. And I never liked Jason Zimmerman, our visual effects supervisor, to touch any of my work. But if he has to he will. But my goal is for them not to touch anything so that it's all original and not manipulated. So it's just an opportunity. I always say that 8K is made for NASCAR and Animal Planet, not for women of a certain age and older men. It's too much detail. But as an artist, like I say, we have to step up and make sure that these things look amazing because our fans are so, so passionate that they go, \"Oh, in episode 3, two minutes in, that makeup was crappy, and I saw this...\" So that's my goal: For that not to happen.\nLet's talk about the Borg Queen a little bit. Absolutely incredible incarnation of the Borg Queen. What went into creating literally the gnarliest-looking version of the Queen ever?\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, she's a little [H.R.] Giger. She's got a little... she's been screwed up for the last few years because we haven't seen her for 20-some-odd years, right? Since she disappeared in [Star Trek: Voyager's finale]. And I was on set for that kind of stuff, too. I worked on First Contact as well. So it was kind of cool to watch all that happen - we'll go to a little side story about that with Brent - but just to be able to recreate that, and recreate that cool character again and again, you get that next option. But it's a five-hour makeup. There's 13 prosthetics on her face and her body to create that. As well, Dave Blass is creating that set that she's inside, and then she's attached to that, and we have to glue her into that. That actress [Jane Edwina Seymour] did an amazing job sitting there all day for 18 hours, plus five hours in the makeup chair.\nYeah, what a trooper she was. She does such a great performance.\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, she did. She was amazing. A treat to work with.\nThere's a lot of joking around in the commentary for the finale about how Jack [Crusher] was basically the first Borg with hair. And how jealous Jeri Ryan was.\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, that's true. Yeah, yeah.\nWhat was the decision-making for keeping Jack's hair? As opposed to making him bald as a Borg?\nJames MacKinnon: I think that was a Terry decision. I mean, it works. It's the same as on Discovery when our Klingons didn't have hair, and then all of a sudden, in season 2, they have hair. So there are reasons and changes and all that kind of stuff. The reason why we go certain directions. But I think that was a Terry decision. But [Jack] looked... I actually have some photos where I had him as Locutus in the position and the Borg Queen from First Contact. So I got a couple of great photos of them in that same position.\nAnd you worked with Amanda Plummer to create Vadic as well?\nJames MacKinnon: One of my assistants, Hugo Villasenor, actually did that makeup. What a process! That was fun, too, because Amanda is passionate as a great actress, and [for] what she is going to bring on camera. And did she ever pull that off. I mean, as a makeup artist and an actor sitting together, it takes both of us. Neither of us can do it until we come together, and that [makeup] starts to come on. And it's fun to watch as those makeups start applying, and you take away eyebrows, and you put the scars on, they become that actor in the middle of the makeup session too, as well. And they change as a character, and they start becoming it, and they start talking [as the character]. And Amanda's verbiage changed, and her personality changed because she's similar to that, but not really. She's a little more quiet and stuff. But that was a fun process. I mean, it's a process that I can't talk about, but it changed dramatically from what we were originally going to do to what was on script and to what you saw. But it was a great process as an artist to create that method.\nWe talked about Worf. Of course, how great he looks as an older Klingon. He really just never looked better. How did Michael Dorn like that whole transformation to turning him into the samurai Worf?\nJames MacKinnon: Oof. He had some PTSD from DS9 and Voyager and from the past. And it took a minute to get him ready to do this. And I think with the new products and the new silicone... I mean, we did his makeup in hair and 42 minutes. And usually, he was in the chair for two and some odd hours in the past. So we sped up the process [and] he was happier that he didn't have to sit in the chair that much longer. But again, Brent and Jonathan are in the trailer at the same time. So they're laughing and making jokes. So it's that legacy cast being there. And I've worked with them for [years]. I'm almost part of the makeup legacy cast with them as well, which is kind of fun, with so much past and present together.\nBut we used some techniques from the original shows to make him comfortable. Again, he has to leave that trailer, be happy with what he has on, be happy with his character. So our job is to make sure that he walks out feeling that character. So we manipulated some stuff underneath the prosthetics. Because silicone is not porous. So when he sweats, we made little routes for where the sweat was going to come down. But on the original show, he had a sweatband underneath his prosthetic, which on this prosthetic was so super thin, we couldn't. So I cut a sleeve off of a T-shirt and put it around his head. So underneath there, he's got a white T-shirt wrapped around his head. Prosthetic goes over [it]. I painted a little bit of darkness around here because some of it peeked out, but you can't see because the hair covers it. And then that soaked up all of his sweat during the day. It's those kinds of things that, as an artist, you're manipulating and learning as the process happens. And he's happy, and he walks out happy too.\nAnd Brent also looks so good as an older Data. Tell me about like how that was crafted to make Data human but still an android. Just a perfect fusion of both.\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, because on season 1, he was obviously what you call it. And I actually was able to assist Mike Westmore on First Contact. There's a scene where he flips open his hand and there's some wires and stuff. I did that while Mike was doing his face. So I did watch that process. And I talked to Mike before we started shooting and asked what the products were, and they don't exist anymore. It's not the same method and techniques. So I had to recreate those colors with the materials we have today, which sped things up much, much faster. And on this point with Brent, I put a shine. It's like a tattoo color that I swept over across his face. So it gave him a little plastic feeling, a little robotic type feeling, but still wasn't that Data color shimmer shine. And then Maxine Morris, our Department of Hairstyles, did this amazing front lace wig on him that blended with his real hair. So 99% of that is his hair with a lace piece on the front. So you have that realism of his hair, that beautiful white hair, but gives that sharp front edge.\nYeah, he really looked amazing. In your long career with Star Trek, going back to the 90s, where does Picard season 3 rank?\nJames MacKinnon: It's like a combination of all of them. Because like I say, that cast is now there, and to have all those friends for all these years and to be able to do their makeup again. And I'm doing little side gigs with Jonathan now on his little side project. So we still get to keep that relationship. And it's just yeah, it's just all a combination of having them back again. And hopefully, we'll see them again, if everything works out. And I don't know if I get to do it, but we'll see. They always complain that they're poor, so we never know. They never have any money.\nWhat are you proudest of in terms of Picard season 3, and the work you were able to do? This amazing work to bring all these prosthetics and makeup and everything to life.\nJames MacKinnon: I just think for me when I watch it, and we got to watch it on IMAX, if you can create a makeup that the audience and fans don't see the makeup, I have done my job. So with that massive screen, and I'm scared when I go to those because if I go, oof! I make some weird faces sometimes. But I didn't. I didn't. Everything looked fantastic. And it's almost like we're shooting a feature each week. Yeah, every week we're shooting a feature. So there, you have to step up your game as an artist to keep up with it. And the technology is only going to get better, and you're going to see more pores next year with the bigger TVs. Like, I have a 95-inch TV in front of me. It's almost the size of a theater, and you can see everything. So when I know that I can trick the eye of the viewer for it not to be a makeup and immerse yourself into that, I've done my job.\nThe third and final season of Star Trek: Picard features Jean-Luc Picard during the 25th century as he reunites with the former command crew of the USS Enterprise while facing a mysterious new enemy who is hunting Picard's son.\nCheck out our other Star Trek: Picard season 3 interviews here:\nStar Trek: Picard – The Final Season is available now on DVD, Blu-ray™, and a limited-edition Blu-ray SteelBook from Paramount Home Entertainment.

{"title": "10 Most Ridiculous Final Destination Deaths", "date": "2023-10-05 18:10:28", "text": "The Final Destination franchise features plenty of ridiculous kills, but there's a sense of palpable horror inherent to event the most absurd deaths.\nThe Final Destination series is known for its creative and gruesome deaths, with some of its most ridiculous still remembered as the best. The film series began in 2000 with the original Final Destination, wherein a teenager’s premonition saves several members of his high school class from an air disaster, only for death to come for the survivors in a series unexpected and violent accidents. Originally, Final Destination was written as an X-Files spec script before its author, Jeffrey Reddick, expanded the concept into a full movie.\nThe concept of death coming to the survivors through apparent accidents only materialized in a rewrite from filmmaking team Glen Morgan and James Wong, but it quickly became a core part of the franchise’s identity. While most teen-oriented horror films feature a malignant slasher killer, the notion of an omnipotent force of death motivating the accidents makes the kills all the more harrowing, even at their most absurd. As the franchise goes on, it embraces more and more absurd comedy in its gruesome death traps that have become a staple of the series.\nRELATED: Final Destination: Every Death Rule (& Exception) Explained\nRory Peters' death in Final Destination 2 displays the franchise’s knack for understanding the intrusive fear wrapped up in common objects, as well as a characteristic disrespect for the laws of physics. As an exploding van propels a length of barbed wire fencing through the air, poor Rory Peters is run clean through while still standing. The uneven cut, which also takes off one arm at the elbow, is unsettling in its specificity. Other details, like Rory’s still-moving expression of surprise and the wet, textured sound design, make the absurd death stick in the viewer’s memory.\nThe Final Destination franchise thrives off its wry balance of existential horror and pitch-black humor. One moment that successfully leverages its horror into laughs is the barbecue explosion that caps off Final Destination 2. As young Brian Gibbons goes to tend to the barbecue, his family reveals that Brian was also one of the survivors of the movie’s opening disaster, making him another target of death's design. The ensuing explosion which annihilates Brian and sends his dismembered arm flying onto the picnic table before his screeching mother is paced like a punchline, buttoning up the movie with a sick laugh.\nThe Final Destination breaks new ground for the series by featuring two mass-death premonitions rather than one. The second, a catastrophe set off by a shopping mall explosion, sees Nick’s girlfriend Lori sucked up into the exposed mechanism of an escalator. It’s quite contrived as Final Destination deaths go, since Lori had plenty of time to get away from it, and the mechanism reaching her foot somehow causes her to begin spitting up blood. Nevertheless, Lori being slowly crushed like a tube of toothpaste is just the kind of grisly image the series does well.\nOne of the most infamous deaths in the Final Destination series comes in the third installment with the egregious tanning beds scene. As Ashley and Ashlyn manage to trap themselves in malfunctioning tanning beds, the rapidly increasing heat proceeds to microwave the two alive. The absurd concept and gruesome execution finds the perfect balance between horror and comedy. The scene also gives way to one of the best match cuts in cinema history, as the two flaming tanning beds cut to Ashley and Ashlyn’s twin coffins.\nAs the Final Destination franchise progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult for the filmmakers to stay ahead of the audience’s expectations. One smart act of subversion comes in Final Destination 3, when the two main characters narrowly avoid death by escaping their car moments before it gets demolished by an out-of-control truck. However, death still gets its satisfaction, as the engine block of their car goes flying into the vehicle in front of them, which happened to be occupied by another death-cheating survivor, Frankie. Once again, the series makes the death disturbingly textured by having the engine’s fan blend the back of Frankie’s head into soup.\nIn Final Destination 2, the series ratchets up the suspense on doomed Evan by exposing him to a near-comic gauntlet of potential death traps, from fire, to a malfunctioning garbage disposal, to a sparking microwave. The punchline comes when Evan meets his end thanks to a forgotten pile of discarded spaghetti. As he slips and falls directly under the fire escape ladder, it gives way and punctures his skull. While a ladder malfunction is one of the more likely Final Destination deaths, the absurd gauntlet of death traps that precedes it makes the sequence farcical.\nFinal Destination proves itself one of the most consistent horror franchises thanks to its enduring capacity to conjure gruesome deaths out of the most banal situations. In The Final Destination, the swimming pool goes to show the series still has its edge, four movies in. As Hunt Wynorski takes a dip in the pool, a malfunctioning filter seizes him and sucks his innards out (presumably through his anus). Again, it’s a death that plays fast and loose with the laws of engineering and of physics in general, but the film’s exploitation of a fear of pool filters is affecting nonetheless.\nOne of the franchise’s best fakeouts gives way to one of its most memorable deaths in Final Destination 2. After a tense trip to the dentist, packed with ominous implements and a near miss with an airway-blocking plastic fish, Tim seems to be out of danger, but he isn’t exempt from the rules of Final Destination. His penchant for chasing pigeons causes the birds to send a pane of glass crashing on top of him. The franchise has shown characters being crushed before, but the utter pancaking that occurs with Tim's giant pane of glass is novel and macabre.\nFinal Destination 5 stepped away from the franchise’s increasingly comedic tone with a more serious fifth outing, defined by its tension powerhouse gymnastic scene. Since the films have trained their audience to understand the catastrophic chain reaction that can be set off by a single mishap, a falling air conditioner screw landing on a gymnastics beam fills the scene with creeping dread. When it finally pays off, the ensuing calamity launches gymnast Candice to her death from a parallel bar. However, the series still delivers the absurdity with the over-the-top gruesomeness of her death, as Candice’s spine explodes from her back on impact, folding her body like an ironing board.\nDespite the horror movie's unfairly low Rotten Tomatoes score, the original Final Destination is still the best in the franchise. The film delivers a series of unique and shocking deaths that each boast their own gruesome charms. Arguably the best death in the film is its most excessive, as a series of home mishaps at Mrs Lewton’s house all come to a head, inflicting an overkill death on the teacher. Shards of glass from an exploding computer slash her throat, a kitchen knife is pushed into her chest, and, to cap things off, her house explodes. It’s a display of absurd excess that the Final Destination franchise never tops.\n"}

From director Martin Scorsese, Killers of the Flower Moon tackles the story of a series of mysterious murders of members of the Osage tribe in the 1920s United States. In addition to De Niro and DiCaprio, Killers of the Flower Moon stars Lily Gladstone, Jesse Plemons, Tantoo Cardinal, and John Lithgow.\nAhead of the release of Killers of the Flower Moon, a new clip from Entertainment Weekly shows De Niro and DiCaprio’s characters in dire straits. In the clip, De Niro’s character chastises DiCaprio’s character for how he went about a planned murder, that was supposed to look like a suicide. DiCaprio’s character asserts that he told a presumably hired assassin to shoot the victim in the front of the head and leave the gun behind, while De Niro yells at him for being “foolish.”\nDiCaprio plays Ernest Burkhart opposite De Niro’s William K Hale, both of whom were real-life figures who played a part in the Osage murders. This new Killers of the Flower Moon clip hints at the relationship between the two characters, both of which have their own moral corruptions. Hale is a mastermind behind the murder plot, while Burkhart is willing to go to extreme lengths to please Hale.\nKillers of the Flower Moon is significant for the actors in that it unites the two of them in a Scorsese-directed feature for the first time. Despite this milestone, De Niro and DiCaprio’s working relationship goes 30 years back, when the two co-starred in 1993’s This Boy’s Life. According to an interview with Scorsese, it was De Niro who helped convince the director to cast DiCaprio in one of his films, after being so impressed with the emergent actor’s work on This Boy’s Life.\nSince first teaming up with Scorsese in Gangs of New York, DiCaprio has become a Scorsese regular. De Niro has maintained this relationship too, which originated in Scorsese’s Mean Streets and has continued through renowned films like Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and The Irishman. De Niro and DiCaprio did appear together in one other Scorsese-directed, co-starring in Scorsese’s 2015 short film The Audition. Killers of the Flower Moon is DiCaprio and De Niro’s shot for a feature-length unfolding of their working relationship, and if this newest clip is any indication, this effort will not disappoint.\nSource: EW\n"}
{"title": "10 Most Powerful New D&D Monsters In Planescape: Adventures In The Multiverse", "date": "2023-10-05 18:22:20", "text": "D&D’s new Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse adds a large new bestiary full of monsters that range from cute to deadly, and sometimes both.\nDungeons & Dragons' newest edition to its library is Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse, a set of three books that bring together many facets of the expanded worlds that the game encompasses and makes nearly anything possible in its mystical planes. Among these books is Morte's Planar Parade, a new companion book to the standard Monster Manual that adds many mighty monsters to the multiversal menagerie. Using similar presentations of stat blocks, Morte's Planar Parade has more than 60 enemies included for adventuring parties to vanquish, or at least attempt to.\nThe set of books in Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse includes lots of new content for DnD, including everything from new magic items to unique and incredible fantasy adventures for DMs to use to warp realities. For truly adventurous dungeon masters, the bestiary in Morte's Planar Parade could also be used to add fantastical creatures to other campaigns or homebrew games as well. Among the numerous additions in the set, here are a few of the most powerful and strongest monsters for players to watch out for.\nRelated: D&D Planescape Preview: A High-Level Adventure With A Catch\nAn Eater of Knowledge is a disgusting-looking mass of muscles and brain matter categorized in DnD as a large aberration that is typically neutral evil. Likely it doesn't smell very good either, while it uses its strength to hold its victims as tentacles crack open their brains for it to eat. The Eater of Knowledge becomes more powerful with every brain it eats, learning stronger spells for it to use in its attacks on its future meal. With an AC of 15 and only an average of 102 HP, it isn't impossible to defeat, but if it gets the chance to take its turn, adventurers will want to be prepared.\nThe Avoral Guardinal is one of several guardinals added in Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse and with good rolls could potentially be swayed to being an ally as they are typically neutral good. These eagle-like humanoids are avian Celestials, and are known to dive at enemies from high above and rip them apart with their talons. It does have darkvision of 120 ft and has a passive perception of 21, making it difficult to hide from, and has an AC of 16 and an average of 172 Hit Points.\nBaernaloths are bad enough on their own, but if a hapless adventurer comes across one in its lair, this fiend becomes even more powerful. These monsters enjoy the despair and suffering of others and will use their power to keep victims alive simply to prolong the misery. They are yugoloths who can sometimes summon another yugoloth to fight by their side and have resistance to magic, as well as many nonmagical attacks. When inside a baernaloth's lair, any creature that is not at full hit points must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw and take necrotic damage while they are in the area.\nDnD's Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse adds stat blocks for three demodands, which are Fiends from the Tarterian Depths of Carceri. They are wicked and bitter creatures who were thrown into prison long ago and know they are doomed to return. The Shator demodand is generally the commander of the others and is covered in fungal growths. It has a chance to summon another demodand and has a passive Perception of 23. Its many spells and attacks, combined with an AC of 19 and an average of 195 Hit Points, make it a truly powerful foe to run across.\nRelated: D&D's Planescape Character Options: The New Backgrounds & Feats Explained\nShemeshka is another yugoloth, who happens to be the notorious crime boss at her multiplanar casino Fortune's Wheel, which is a focus of the new DnD adventures in Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse. Even without her lackeys around her, she is strong and has many resistances, immunities, and powerful spells at her disposal - along with an AC of 17, an average of 162 Hit Points, and very high stats.\nOne of the five modrons added to DnD for the Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse books is the Hexton Modron. These huge constructs are the leaders of the modrons when outside of Mechanus. When damaged, they can retaliate with an arc of lightning, and during their turn, they can dispel magic at will. They have an AC of 17 and an average of 209 Hit Points.\nThe Aurumach Rilmani is a large Celestial and is one of the leaders of the rilmani people. They have gold skin and typically do not leave the Outlands, only doing so when they feel they need to destroy any who pose a threat to the stability of the multiverse. They are very skilled in magic and psychic powers and have an Armor Class of 18 in addition to 285 Hit Points.\nPlanar Incarnates are the literal manifestations of good and evil, either Celestial or Fiend, and are of gargantuan size. They look like roiling masses of energies, distinct for each type, and are broken off to protect their plane from threats and then will merge back to their original plane again once the danger is gone. They can take on majestic shapes or are even said to \"appear as unique manifestations of the philosophies they embody\" according to Morte's Planar Parade in the Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse. These powerful beings are immune to most conditions and damages, know all languages, and have very high stats to go with their average 333 Hit Points.\nKolyarut is a construct created by the leader of the modrons which is designed to forge binding contracts and agreements that should never be broken. They have four arms that are made through a combination of magic and machine and are classified as Inevitables. A kolyarut will forcefully destroy anything that stands in the way of what it considers to be the truth or who needs to be punished for breaking any contract.\nRelated: D&D: Planescape Reveals Cool New Styles From The Streets of Sigil [EXCLUSIVE TRAILER]\nDnD's time dragons are able to harness and manipulate any point in time: past, present, or future. There are time dragons of different ages, each with their own powers, but the Ancient Time Dragons are the deadliest of creatures. They have the power to create temporal gates connecting times and places throughout the overarching multiverse in Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse and can banish threats. They are beautiful, majestic-looking dragons, with an average of 536 Hit Points and an AC of 22.\nThey are rated as a challenge of 26 in DnD, for they have very high stats and skills plus the ability to manipulate time around it. If an Ancient Time Dragon dies, it will be reborn with all knowledge and memory of its previous life, including who killed it. This makes them a formidable new foe for Dungeons & Dragons.\nSource: D&DBeyond\n"}
{"title": "Big Brother Live Feed Viewers Want Cameron Hardin Evicted (He's A Threat)", "date": "2023-10-05 18:22:27", "text": "Big Brother 25 viewers enjoy Cameron Hardin on the weekly episodes, but those watching the live feeds are seeing a different side of the houseguest.\nBig Brother 25 viewers have been enjoying watching Cameron Hardin take on the competition, but those who are watching him on the BB live feeds have a different take on the competitor's sometimes inappropriate behavior. Cameron, who has been in the Big Brother house for over 60 days and spent the majority of his time on the nomination block, has faced challenges during his time on the series. A stay-at-home dad, Cameron has been away from his daughter for over 2 months and fought hard to stay in the BB house, even being brought back after a unanimous eviction. Cameron's gameplay has been impressive, but it isn't always clean.\nOn the weekly episodes, Cameron is being edited to seem like a game player who doesn't let things get too personal, but for viewers who are indulging in the Big Brother 24-hour live feeds, Cameron takes on an entirely different personality. Cameron, who presents as a care-free, fun guy that just wants to play Big Brother, has been saying some alarming things to his fellow houseguests, which have confounded live feed viewers. Though he appears as a master manipulator on Big Brother's TV aired episodes, Cameron has made it clear that he's more of a villain than most viewers imagined.\nWhile Big Brother is a game that requires manipulation the majority of the time, Cameron is taking his emotionally manipulative tactics to another level. During his second Head Of Household reign, Cameron's targets included Survivor legend Cirie Fields' closest allies, Izzy Gleicher and Felicia Cannon. He felt that he could take Cirie's power away from her in the game by getting rid of one of her closest allies, targeting Izzy over Felicia, though he didn't much care who went home. Cameron's targets were clear for him, but the emotionally manipulative tactics he used throughout his HOH reign to get Izzy out of the house were exhausting to watch.\nPrior to the nomination ceremony, Cameron decided to pull fellow BB 25 houseguests Blue Kim and Jag Bains up to the HOH room and lie, explaining he'd be nominating them. He was choosing to scare the houseguests in order to get as much information out of them as possible, knowing they were closer to the epicenter of the Cirie/Izzy/Felicia alliance than he was. After intimidating his potential nominees, he seemed almost gleeful in his reaction, loving the fact that he was able to twist them around emotionally as much as he had. This isn't the only instance of Cameron's troubling manipulation tactics, which leave his fellow houseguests feeling wronged.\nAfter BB 25 houseguest Luke Valentine was ejected early in the game for breaking the show's code of conduct, the houseguests have been tremendously careful about what they've said in the BB house. Cameron, who has spent the majority of the season on his own, has made some close-call remarks during the game that many feel could've been pushing the code of conduct. Though his alliance with BB 25 evicted houseguest Red Utley deteriorated after they were put on the nomination block together, both made some ugly remarks about the female houseguests during their time together in the game. After Red's eviction, some wondered if Cameron would calm down.\nDuring his time in the BB house, Cameron has been overtly sexual about several of his younger female houseguests, including BB 25's Reilly Smedley and America Lopez. Reilly was evicted during the second week of the summer and was friendly with Cameron during her time in the house. Though he's mentioned that he felt akin to her because she reminded him of her daughter, Cameron has made remarks about Reilly that are uncomfortable knowing he views her in that light. His comments about America have been explicit and overtly sexual, to the point that some houseguests choose not to leave the pair alone in a room together for America's safety.\nWhile the majority of the houseguests left in the Big Brother 25 house have tried to make themselves as comfortable with Cameron as possible, the houseguests who have been evicted from the game have spoken out about his behavior. Kirsten Elwin, the first evicted houseguest of the season, has been able to watch the entirety of the season and comment on the houseguests behavior as she's followed along. Having never been a fan of Cameron due to his abrasive personality, Kirsten hasn't been kind about his inappropriate comments and has even found herself calling him out on social media for the things he's said in the Big Brother house.\nKirsten has spoken out about the way Cameron speaks to America, unhappy with the fact that he continues to make explicitly sexual remarks to her even though she's both unresponsive and in a showmance with another houseguest. She's also called out the way that Cameron has acted towards the houseguests of color, as his behavior is riddled with microaggressions and his vernacular leaves much to be desired. In a recent post, Kirsten called Cameron out for calling her \"cotton\", appalled at the connotation of the word being used about a woman of color. Kirsten rightfully put Cameron on blast, calling for BB to do something about the racially insensitive behavior.\nCameron has been making remarks to America throughout Big Brother 25, despite the fact that she's been in a showmance with Cory Wurtenberger for weeks. Though it wasn't clear where America and Cory stood to some of the other houseguests early on in their relationship, it has become obvious. Cameron, who says he feels like Cory is his brother, was clearly put-off by the fact that America was interested in Cory rather than him, as Cameron and America had been playfully flirty early in the game. While America has engaged in the behavior, Cameron has taken it further than expected, making overtly sexual comments that America is openly uncomfortable with.\nCameron's jealousy has been obvious as he continually stared the pair down any time they were in communal areas or interrupted them when they were spending time one-on-one. He's told both Cory and America to distance from one another, angry when they refuse to do so, and has even targeted Cory in the game in jealousy. Though Cory has always supported Cameron in the house, he's chosen to take a path of destruction against Cory while talking poorly about America behind her back. The aggression in his gameplay is new towards the pair, and only happened after America stopped openly flirting with Cameron to make herself and Cory's relationship obvious.\nCameron was evicted unanimously during Big Brother 25 week 7, but his eviction was overturned by a twist in the game that allowed him to come back into the house and compete for his BB life. Cameron, who is a competitive threat in the game, won the competition against Jared Fields and got to come back into the house, but in the time between his eviction and re-entry to the game, it was clear that Cameron was angling for his spot. During his pitch to his fellow Big Brother houseguests to keep him around, Cameron used a bargaining tool that seemed off-putting to houseguests, and irked live feed viewers.\nCameron was hoping for just one more week of safety so he could make it to the jury house. The competitors who make it to the jury phase of the competition are paid handsomely for their time. Cameron, who left his daughter to come on Big Brother, explained to anyone who would listen that he didn't need to win the game, he simply wanted to make it to jury in order to make the most money he could. While it's understandable, Cameron rubbed his fellow houseguests the wrong way saying he didn't need to win the game, as the people left in the house are interested in playing to win.\nBig Brother 25 airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT, Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EDT, and Thursdays at 9 p.m. EDT on CBS.\n"}

Are the couple engaged now and is she in America?\n90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days couple Christian Allgood and Cleo surprisingly stayed together after the finale and revealed plans of getting engaged in the Tell All. Cleo, a 32-year-old trans woman living in England, is originally from Italy. Cleo and Christian, 28, met on social media and were good friends for a year before they started dating. Christian had no experience in dating a transgender partner before. While he seemed ready to meet Cleo in person, his family raised concerns about their relationship.\nChristian decided he would not show his affection for Cleo in public. He also acted quite friendly with other women while Cleo was right next to him, which made it look like Christian wasn’t serious about being with Cleo. He even refused to acknowledge to the cameras that they’d had sex. These ups and downs, however, didn’t affect the positive outcome of the relationship. Cleo and Christian revealed they were together at the Tell All. Cleo even came to America to stay with him for a month. But has she moved to the U.S. for good after Christian revealed he wanted to get engaged?\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nOut of all the shocking revelations during the Tell All, the most jaw-dropping one was Christian asking Cleo to marry him. The couple had seen each other just a few days before they filmed the reunion. Cleo had spent time with the women in Christian’s family, and they liked her. Christian said Cleo wanted to see him again in London. He wanted Cleo should come to the States. “And I don't mean to just visit,” he added. “Would you be willing to marry me?\" Christian asked Cleo out of the blue.\nCleo was not expecting a proposal from Christian at all. She couldn’t contain her shock when she mumbled, “Oh my God.” Christian assured Cleo that this wasn’t an official proposal as he wanted it to happen in person. He asked Cleo, after everything they’d been through, if this was something she could consider. Cleo was at a loss for words but proclaimed her love for Christian. “I think there should be a better place for that though,” she said. Christian promised host Shaun Robinson that there was an engagement on the horizon and a K-1 visa process was getting started.\n“It’s something that we’ve talked about,” Christian said about Cleo moving to the U.S. to marry him. Christian finally posted about Cleo on his Instagram page on September 25, 2023. He wrote he wanted to do it without “spoiling it” for the fans. “Here’s just a photo of us together in Minnesota enjoying some cocktails and dinner with good friends,” said Christian about the picture.

A look at all the spoilers revealed about the couple online.\n90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way couple Brandan DeNuccio and Mary Demasu-ay have reportedly been fired from the franchise. Brandan met Mary on a dating app after getting over a bad breakup. Mary had been cheated on multiple times by an ex-boyfriend herself when she decided to match with Brandan, who she thought looked like a mix of Justin Bieber and Harry Potter. However, Brandan and Mary became too possessive of each other.\nBrandan gave in to Mary’s demands when she insisted they be on video calls 24/7. Her demands made Brandan lose multiple jobs. He eventually flew to the Philippines to spend a lifetime with her. While the couple is yet to marry on the show, a cast member from a different 90 Day Fiancé spin-off, Statler Riley, has made an alarming claim about Mary and Brandan being fired. Statler revealed that Brandan and Mary overshared personal information online, spoiling their season. The pair has yet to address the rumors, but it’s likely that they might have broken some rules from their contract.\nBrandan and Mary’s wedding photos were posted online before their 90 Day Fiancé debut. Brandan spilled the secret on his social media. He then gave away a major spoiler about his relationship with Mary on Instagram. He had written, “Happily Married” in his Instagram bio. According to Starcasm, Mary also changed her last name to DeNuccio to match her husband’s on Facebook.\nBrandan’s mother Angela may have been against him moving to the Philippines during her appearances on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way, but it was she who revealed Brandan and Mary got married on her Facebook in April 2023.

{"title": "It's A Wonderful Knife Trailer: Justin Long Stars In Holiday Slasher Movie", "date": "2023-10-05 18:28:23", "text": "It's a Wonderful Knife trailer shows Justin Long in a horror twist of the classic James Stewart Christmas-centered film It's a Wonderful Life.\nA new trailer has been released for the upcoming holiday slasher film It’s a Wonderful Knife. Starring Justin Long, It’s a Wonderful Knife is a comedy-horror with a twist on the classic film It’s a Wonderful Life. It’s a Wonderful Knife will be released on November 10.\nDropped by RLJE Films, the It’s a Wonderful Knife trailer gives the first look at the holiday slasher.\nIn the trailer, It’s a Wonderful Life shows Winnie Carruthers, who wishes that she had never been born. Set to the tune of “Jingle Bells,” the It’s a Wonderful Knife trailer follows Winnie as she discovers a series of murders in her hometown and attempts to stop the killer in his tracks.\nAs mentioned in the trailer, It’s a Wonderful Knife has the same producers as the 2020 Vince Vaughn film Freaky. Taking on a similar twisted approach, Freaky retells the classic body-swap film Freaky Friday and turns it into a horror narrative wherein high school student Millie swaps bodies with a middle-aged serial killer. The film gained a decent following, and Freaky 2 has since been announced. Freaky and It’s a Wonderful Knife are two of several recent horror films that take a similar approach. Freaky director Christopher Landon previously made a Groundhog Day inspired horror movie in 2017 titled Happy Death Day.\nIt’s a Wonderful Knife sees director Tyler MacIntyre at the helm. It’s a Wonderful Knife seems to push and pull with the source material in similar ways as did Happy Death Day and Freaky. The wish-one-had-never-been-born framework remains, and elements such as the presence of angels are borrowed from It’s a Wonderful Life, while original horror elements are also introduced.\nWhile it can partially rely on the cult success of its predecessors, It’s a Wonderful Knife is also being released at a good moment for horror parody. 2023 brought the infamous Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey, which posited the likes of Pooh Bear and Piglet in more grotesque scenarios. While based on starkly different material, It’s a Wonderful Knife could do well riding the recent tidal wave of both horror parody and its predecessors.\nSource: RLJE Films\n"}
{"title": "11 Shows That Set The Gold Standard For Modern TV", "date": "2023-10-05 18:30:29", "text": "From The Sopranos to Breaking Bad, there are a ton of groundbreaking TV shows that set the gold standard for the modern television landscape.\nFrom The Sopranos to Breaking Bad, there are plenty of great shows that set the gold standard for modern television. While cinema has gone downhill in the 21st century, with the rise of CG-riddled I.P.-based blockbusters, TV has only gotten better. For decades, television rigidly stuck to established formulas with its stories and characters. But, when those formulaic TV shows inevitably grew stale, writers like David Chase and Vince Gilligan came along to shake up those formulas with morally gray antiheroes, long-running serialized storylines, and a truly cinematic sensibility.\nFor a long time, television was considered to be a lesser medium to the more grandiose forms of media like movies and the theater. But in the past couple of decades, trailblazing shows like Mad Men and Band of Brothers have turned TV into a respected art form. Those shows, combined with others like The Wire and True Detective, have contributed to the so-called “Golden Age of Television” that audiences are currently enjoying.\nRELATED: 10 Best TV Shows About Making TV Shows\nWith their HBO miniseries Band of Brothers, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg proved that a TV show about the Second World War can be just as big and grand and eventful as a movie about the Second World War, like their own Saving Private Ryan. Dramatizing the history of the “Easy” Company, Band of Brothers explores the conflict from a ground-level soldier’s perspective. Band of Brothers is as visceral and intense a portrayal of the horrors of warfare as any war movie ever made.\nVery few TV comedies have a joke-per-minute rate to rival that of Arrested Development. Most sitcoms get laughs purely from the situations and the dialogue, but Arrested Development proved that it’s possible to get laughs with cinematography, music, and editing, too. Arrested Development is filled with so many jokes and sight gags that every episode holds up to countless rewatches to spot them all. Every great single-camera comedy series from 30 Rock to Community was influenced by Arrested Development.\nJesse Armstrong pioneered a whole new kind of satire with Succession. His Shakespearean study of the spoilt brats fighting over their dying father’s media empire is both endlessly hilarious and deeply heartbreaking. The show gives the audience plenty of room to both laugh at the excesses of these absurdly wealthy characters and care intimately about their personal problems. The Roys are oddly endearing, and Succession strikes a unique balance between sympathy and mockery.\nAfter the game-changing arcs of Tony Soprano and Vic Mackey, Mad Men came along to prove that TV antiheroes don’t need to kill people to be compelling. Ad executive Don Draper is a captivating character whose highest-stakes conflict is whether or not he can land the Lucky Strike account. Matthew Weiner and his writers’ room used Don’s ad agency as a backdrop to explore all the social, political, and economic revolutions that American society underwent in the 1960s.\nFormer crime reporter David Simon captures the inner workings of the city of Baltimore with the depth and realism of a documentary in The Wire. Covering everything from the illegal drug trade to the underfunded public schools, The Wire is a razor-sharp study of crime and corruption in the American city. The series encapsulates the impact that institutions have on individuals, and the sociopolitical systems that prevent real change and perpetuate the cycles of violence and poverty. The Wire reinvented what a TV show could do.\nWhile the subsequent seasons have been kind of hit-and-miss, the first season of True Detective is top-tier television. A lot of modern TV shows style themselves as really long movies cut up into episodes, but True Detective season 1 really achieves that ambition with cinematic visuals, big-screen star power, and a single cohesive narrative that doesn’t get bogged down in unnecessary subplots. True Detective season 1 is a mesmerizing Southern Gothic detective noir told on two parallel timelines through the strained “buddy cop” pairing of a perfectly matched Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey.\nCraig Mazin brought the 1986 Chernobyl disaster to life in his HBO miniseries about the subject. Everything in Chernobyl is perfect: the atmospheric cinematography, the disturbing musical score, the grave seriousness of the actors’ performances. Chernobyl is a rare triumph of both the technical aspects of filmmaking and the specifics of historical accuracy. Some liberties were taken for dramatic purposes, but Chernobyl’s attention to detail is truly impressive.\nLarry David’s second sitcom deconstructed and revolutionized the entire genre. Curb Your Enthusiasm takes Seinfeld’s satirical exploration of the minutiae of everyday life and blurs the line between reality and fiction. Rather than shooting on a stage with a live audience and a laugh track, Curb Your Enthusiasm removes all the artifice of the sitcom with improvised dialogue, handheld documentary-like camerawork, and actors playing themselves. Curb Your Enthusiasm opened up the TV comedy to new possibilities, and continues to influence the genre to this day.\nDavid Chase singlehandedly kicked off the “Golden Age of Television” with his revolutionary work on The Sopranos. The Sopranos realized the cinematic potential of television with surreal dream sequences, pitch-black humor, and a wide variety of filming locations. It completely deconstructs the gangster genre with a typically stoic mob boss who starts opening up and feeling his feelings when he enters therapy. James Gandolfini and Chase’s team of writers combined forces to give audiences a more complex and rounded portrait of Tony Soprano than any previous TV show had done with its protagonist.\nVince Gilligan reimagined the purpose of a TV series with Breaking Bad. Most shows are designed to maintain the status quo, so the series can go on indefinitely. But Breaking Bad was defined by change as Gilligan famously envisioned turning Mr. Chips into Scarface. Breaking Bad is an intimate character study of a mild-mannered chemistry teacher who gradually embraces his dark side as he rises through the criminal underworld to become a meth kingpin. Breaking Bad also introduced the notion that TV directors can get creative with their cinematography and don’t have to feel confined by standard methods of coverage.\nWith his surprisingly harrowing series BoJack Horseman, Raphael Bob-Waksberg proved that dark character studies like Breaking Bad and wacky animated comedies like Family Guy aren’t mutually exclusive. BoJack Horseman started as a lighthearted Hollywood satire about a washed-up sitcom actor who happens to be a talking horse. But it quickly turned darker than most TV dramas as it dug into BoJack’s problems with addiction and mental health. It’s not an easy watch (particularly in its later seasons), but BoJack Horseman is a profound and groundbreaking series.\n"}
{"title": "Foe Director Garth Davis On The Narrative Complexities Of The Sci-Fi Thriller", "date": "2023-10-05 18:30:29", "text": "Garth Davis, the director and co-writer of Foe, discusses the intricacies and overarching environmental themes of the new sci-fi thriller.\nFoe is a sci-fi thriller that explores the idea of AI replacement and what it means to be human. Based on the book of the same name by Iain Reid - who previously wrote I'm Thinking of Ending Things - the story centers on a married couple whose life is thrown into turmoil after the arrival of a mysterious stranger. The film has an incredibly small cast, with just three main members: Little Women's Saoirse Ronan, Normal People's Paul Mescal, and Brother's Aaron Pierre.\nThe movie's Black Mirror-esque plot centers around Ronan and Mescal's characters Hen and Junior, a married couple who live on a generations-old farm in the year 2065. One night, Pierre's character Terrance arrives and informs them that Junior has been chosen to be a part of a special space program that will necessitate him leaving Earth for two years. As part of preparations for his departure, Terrance begins conducting a series of interviews and observations in order to design a sentient replacement to replace Junior in his absence, putting a huge existential strain on the couple's marriage.\nRelated: Foe: Release Date, Trailer & Everything We Know About The Prime Video Sci-Fi Thriller\nScreen Rant sat down with Foe's co-writer and director Garth Davis to discuss what it was like working with such a small cast, layered storytelling, and the biggest challenges in making the film.\nScreen Rant: First, I would just love to know what elements of the novel were the ones you wanted to be sure came through in the film the most.\nGarth Davis: I guess for me, what I really wanted to come through was Hen's story, how she is really fighting for this marriage and fighting for agency and her own destiny and her own life. I really wanted that to come through, that was the main - that's the heart and soul of the film for me.\nAnd what was it like working with Saoirse and Paul, were there any moments that stick out to you from set especially?\nGarth Davis: I guess all of them. I mean, every day going to set was a joy; they're wonderful human beings, and very collaborative and brilliant with their choices, and just so easy to work with, and so there's just such a great sense of play and craft and professionalism. So it was a joy going to set every day working with these actors, with this material, because it was so complex and exciting to explore. And also Aaron Pierre was also just wonderful to work with as well.\nAnd this movie has an incredibly small cast compared to projects that you've done in the past. I'm curious what that adjustment was like, was it weird at all to go down to so few people for the most part?\nGarth Davis: I was desperate for it. I mean, in a way I can do these big sweeping things, but ultimately the stuff that really puts a fire in the belly is when I'm just on the actor's face doing something beautiful. So I guess I was just trying to find some material that would have a lot of complexity and potential to give the actors a lot of stuff to explore. And there's so many layers and complexity to the story, and it was just like a delicious experiment which was all about acting, it was all about the human condition. So that was super exciting.\nWere there any things that stick out to you that were incredibly challenging to get just right?\nGarth Davis: I mean, they're all challenging, but probably the one that was the most challenging and we went through rehearsals quite a bit was the opening scene when Terrance comes into the house and they sit in the lounge room, because there's so many things going on at that moment. There's so many secret rivers - the story you think you're watching, the story that's really happening. So all of the actors are doing a multitude of things, and there's a lot of, \"How much do we reveal? How much do we conceal?\" So I think trying to find the reality of that conceit was the greatest challenge. It was very complex, so that was probably - for all of us - the greatest challenge was that scene.\nAnd there's a strong relationship in this film between Junior and Hen's relationship and the environmental climate around them. How would you compare those two things in the film?\nGarth Davis: Well, Saoirse I think said at one point,\"The way you behave, the way you treat someone, is the same way you treat the planet,\" like there's a direct parallel. But I love the idea that this decaying marriage kind of echoes and mirrors the decaying planet. And I guess the conversation in that connection is they're one and the same thing. So if the planet is dying, it's only saying that we're also dying inside of us as well, and I guess I found that a really fascinating metaphor and theme to bring through.\nAcademy Award nominees Saoirse Ronan and Paul Mescal star in Foe, a haunting exploration of marriage and identity set in an uncertain world. Hen and Junior farm a secluded piece of land that has been in Junior’s family for generations, but their quiet life is thrown into turmoil when an uninvited stranger (Aaron Pierre) shows up at their door with a startling proposal. Based on best-selling author Iain Reid’s novel, directed by Garth Davis, and co-written by Davis and Reid, Foe’s mesmerizing imagery and persistent questions about the nature of humanity (and artificial humanity) bring the not-too-distant future to luminous life.\nCheck back soon for our other Foe interviews here:\nFoe releases in theaters on October 6.\nSource: Screen Rant Plus\n"}
{"title": "&quot;Define An Era&quot;: How Dave Filoni's Star Wars Movie Will Change The Franchise", "date": "2023-10-05 18:36:01", "text": "Dave Filoni has shared about the importance of a film defining an era, hinting towards how his Mandalorian movie will change the Star Wars franchise.\nThe anticipation for Dave Filoni's Star Wars movie set in The Mandalorian-era has only grown since the conclusion of the Ahsoka series, and the director has already provided a hint as to how it will impact the franchise. Filoni's The Mandalorian movie is expected to be a culmination of the events that take place in Star Wars Disney+ TV shows such as The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, and soon-to-arrive Skeleton Crew. The story has already been compared to an Avengers-esque team-up of heroes like Din Djarin and Ahsoka Tano to face off against Grand Admiral Thrawn, and now, Filoni may be hinting towards another important detail.\nIn speaking with Empire, Filoni describes the importance of a movie having a moment that can \"define an era,\" likening it to Luke Skywalker blowing up the Death Star in A New Hope. He ties it into the idea of \"characters coming together\" as well, something that's inevitable for his upcoming Star Wars movie.\nTo me, a theatrical experience has to have a big idea – a monumental moment in the time period that changes what’s happening. What Tony [Gilroy] has done [in Andor] and what we did in Rebels, everything then changes when Luke blows up the Death Star. You’re looking for those moments that define an era, and that’s what the films really should be about – whether it’s characters coming together, or a defining moment.\nFiloni, then, is pointing towards what viewers can start to expect from his movie. If the idea of the characters coming together for a defining moment in a movie is so important to him, then there's some idea of what that defining moment might be.\nBy the time of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Coruscant is no longer the capital of the New Republic. At some point, it moves to Hosnian Prime, and Filoni's Star Wars movie could be the moment where this change is finally seen - and it may be because of the fall of Coruscant. The Mandalorian season 3 spent quite some time on Coruscant, with episode 3 having spent nearly its entire duration there, and now Ahsoka has also done the work of tying in the New Republic and Coruscant. All of this could be leading to the fall of the infamous capital, especially now that Thrawn has returned.\nRelated: New Star Wars Movies: Every Upcoming Movie & Release Date\nWhatever this moment may turn out to be in Filoni's Star Wars movie, one thing is for certain: the movie will define The Mandalorian-era. The inevitable team-up of the heroes already promised to start that effort, but Filoni's commitment to create a memorable moment only emphasizes it. The fall of Coruscant would be a perfect moment for Filoni to show in his movie, but no matter what he puts on the big screen, his film will change Star Wars and The Mandalorian-era - and likely for the better.\nSource: Empire\n"}

The iconic symbol of the Star Wars mythos, these \"elegant weapons from a more civilized age\" can stop almost every form of weapon the Empire can create. But in one Star Wars story, the franchise reveals lightsabers fail to work on one key race...and fail to stop a key villain from amassing an army.\nIntroduced in Episode IV: A New Hope in 1977, lightsabers were immediately iconic, with only Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader seen using them. The prequels only expanded what lightsabers could do, showing them deflect blaster bolts back at foes, cut through nearly any solid objects, and prove impossible to stop by anything but another lightsaber. But fans may not realize that one historically significant droid proved too powerful for even a lightsaber to stop.\nIn Star Wars: Revelations #1 the mysterious Eye of Webbish Bog reveals to Darth Vader a vision of a single droid: Ajax Sigma, a being who inspired a revolution among his people. Centuries ago, the Jedi of the High Republic cut down Ajax Sigma's rebellion and his followers in a pitched conflict... but his core processor was preserved, passed down from person to person, and eventually installed the core into a new, more powerful droid body.\nSo given all their power, why were the Jedi unable to kill a simple droid? Star Wars: Revelations #1 revealed this tale of droid survival thanks to Marc Guggenheim, Salvador Larroca, Paul Fry, Emma Kubert, and Justin Mason. But proving it wasn't a one-off bit of luck, a villainous droid's miraculous survival against a lightsaber-wielding foe has happened before.In Star Wars: Darth Vader #1, Darth Vader engages the droid ZED-6-7 in battle, but fails to permanently destroy it - and the same exact situation plays out in Star Wars: Darth Vader #13 against the famous IG-88.\nA lightsaber can take an organic opponent out of the fight with a single stroke to a non-vital organ, but the same cannot be said for droids. The destruction of a droid's limb simply does not matter when it can be repaired in minutes (or after years, or centuries). Unless the core processor sustains a direct hit, the individual droid will continue to function, possessed of all its character traits and motivations. Making them harder to kill, as demonstrated in Revenge of the Sith against General Grievous' Magnaguards, who continued to fight even when headless and limbless. But when rising to a height of individual threat and menace, it means an immortality that will survive even a flawless, elegant Jedi weapon.\nSimply put, a lightsaber is too precise a weapon to efficiently cut down droids for good. Even if a Jedi or a Sith slices off all their limbs and stabs them multiple times in the center mass, the droid's \"brain\" can still be recovered and placed in a new body; the same cannot be said for a human opponent. This is why Ajax Sigma is a genuine threat against lightsaber-wielders: a single stroke isn't enough to defeat him (or his many followers).\nSince a droid's core processor can theoretically be located anywhere (the head, the body, or even miles away in another ship), Jedi and Sith must either waste their time cutting each robotic opponent to ribbons, or lose the lightsaber in exchange for a conventional blaster - devices that these Star Wars organizations, steeped in tradition, would rarely use on principle.\nNext: Star Wars Addresses Fan Concerns About Ruining Yoda's Backstory\nJoshua Isaak is a Comics Staff Writer for Screenrant and attended New York University.

He Who Remains was revealed as the mastermind of the TVA in the first season's finale. He warned Loki and Sylvie that his death and the destruction of the TVA would lead to another multiverse war with his own variants as their enemies. However, Sylvie still decided to kill him, potentially plunging the multiverse into chaos, in order to give herself and everyone else the free will He Who Remains deprived them of.\nIn an exclusive interview with Screen Rant for Loki season 2, Wright discusses Miss Minutes and He Who Remains. He explains how many of the characters are searching for identities this season. He also teases how Miss Minutes dynamic with He Who Remains is unique in how he allowed her to evolve. Check out Wright's full quote below:\nKevin Wright: I think like all of our characters and their search for identity, but also that all of our characters being caught in a bit of a cyclical time loop, keep making the same mistakes. There's another interesting question about Miss Minutes that I think has been really fun to explore, which is the nature of ... She says this season something along the lines of He Who Remains gave her the ability to write her own programming, to create her own personality, to grow, to have wants, to have needs.\nI think that's exciting if that's true, knowing what we know about He Who Remains, he doesn't give a lot of people a lot of choices up until his death. And I'd be interested to see how much of her programming is her own, how much of this is just further path that He Who Remains maybe paved for all of our characters to walk down for some bigger reasoning.\nMiss Minutes has always been an intriguing character in Loki. She knows all and has a sweet southern drawl, but there seems to be a darker side as well. This could be exemplified by her connection to He Who Remains, who introduced himself to Loki and Sylvie as non-threatening but had done terrible things in the name of, according to him, protecting the \"sacred\" timeline. Stripping the universe of free will to keep the timeline on track and separate from the rest of the multiverse.\nRelated: He Who Remains Is Actually More Powerful Than Kang (In 1 Way)\nWith He Who Remains as her creator, it seems likely that Miss Minutes would be influenced by his mentality as well. However, if He Who Remains gave her the ability to alter and evolve her own programming, that is more free will than he seemed to have offered to anyone else. Miss Minutes foundation would still be the base programming that he gave her, which could be a way to keep his story alive in the second season of Loki even with He Who Remains dying in the first.\nThis could also set Miss Minutes up as a potential villain in the second season, especially if she wants to stay true to his mission. Miss Minutes likely wants to keep the \"sacred\" timeline as it is not allowing people to have free will, which could put her at odds with the people of the TVA, who were revealed to be variants plucked from timelines and brainwashed. Miss Minutes has always had a bit of a dark streak because of her connection to He Who Remains, but that could grow more insidious in the second season of Loki, especially after his death.\n"}

Nikki is a part of the several new faces making their way into the franchise with the milestone season. While Gino Palazzolo and Jasmine Pineda is the only returning couple for 90 Day Fiance season 10, 2023 has a total of six new couples in store for viewers. 90 Day Fiancé is the show where engaged couples have applied for or have received a K-1 visa, so they can bring their international partners to America and get married to them within a span of three months.\nEngaged couple Nikki and Justin have a shocking history together. According to a preview of the 90 Day Fiancé season 10 premiere, courtesy of ET, Nikki reveals she was engaged to Justin 17 years ago and what led to their first breakup.\nNikki tells a friend that Justin was being lazy, wasn’t helping her with the housework, and expected her to cook and clean for him. They got into a lot of heated arguments. During one such argument, Nikki told Justin, “I used to be a man.” It had been two years since Nikki and Justin started their relationship. “I traumatized him,” admitted Nikki.\nNikki was about 20 years old when she underwent her gender affirmation operation. She had tears in her eyes after the surgery and felt like she was reborn again. After the surgery, she started living in “stealth,” which meant that she didn’t tell people what sex she was assigned at birth. As a result, Nikki was in the closet. She never made any gay or trans friends; she only wanted to have female friends. This was all part of Nikki’s journey to find herself. Justin was “in shock” when Nikki blurted out that she's trans. Justin went back home and was “depressed for a very long time.”\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nThis was back in 2007. Nikki and Justin had met on a dating site in Moldova 17 years ago.

She thought it was a good idea for them to give their relationship a second chance. Three months after they first started speaking again, Nikki and Justin met in Mexico to connect “physically, mentally, emotionally.”\nJustin has proposed to Nikki again, and then she applied for the K-1 visa a second time. Justin wasn’t comfortable with Nikki’s gender identity the first time around. Nikki now knows what exactly she’s looking for in her future partner.

{"title": "Spider-Man's MCU Future Can Finally Revive Black Panther's Original Villain Plan", "date": "2023-10-05 18:50:28", "text": "Kraven the Hunter was originally set to appear in Black Panther, but with his solo movie coming up, it's not too late for him to jump into the MCU.\nSpider-Man 4 is one of the MCU's most anticipated movies, and it could potentially bring Kraven the Hunter into its story after his initial planned debut did not happen. Spider-Man has had a complex history with the MCU due to Sony Pictures holding his film rights, but Sony and Marvel Studios's eventual deal to share the Web-Slinger has blown the doors off the Spider-Verse like never before for both studios. In Sony's case, it also is helping to expand the possibilities of their universe of Spider-Man villains, including its next new series, Kraven the Hunter.\nDespite Kraven being a long-time Spidey villain, Spider-Man will likely not appear in Kraven the Hunter, but that does not mean they will not eventually meet. With the multiverse heavily in play in the MCU and Sony's Marvel films, there are already multiple avenues for Kraven to finally embark on his hunt for the Wall-Crawler after the release of Kraven the Hunter. Here is how Kraven the Hunter was almost introduced in the MCU and how Spider-Man 4 could bring him into the fold.\nJust prior to the release of Black Panther in 2018, director Ryan Coogler revealed in an interview that Kraven the Hunter was originally set to appear in the film. It's not fully clear exactly what Kraven's role in Black Panther would have been, in terms of whether he would have been the main protagonist, a secondary villain teaming up with Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger, or simply appearing in a minor cameo. However, Kraven's backstory and animal-like powers make it easy to see how he could have potentially fit into Black Panther's story.\nRELATED: Kraven the Hunter Cast & Marvel Character Guide\nIn theory, Kraven might have been featured in a scene or two showing him hunting African wildlife and encroaching on Wakanda's territory. Given Wakanda's secretive nature in the film, it would make sense for Kraven to be expelled from the nation in such a scenario, and this could have potentially set up his subsequent meeting with Spider-Man. On the other hand, Kraven's eventual debut in Sony's universe of Marvel villains seems likely to serve him better as a character.\nAs a Spider-Man villain and member of the Sinister Six, Kraven is in good company already in Sony's Spider-Man universe with Tom Hardy's Venom, Jared Leto's Morbius, and Dakota Johnson's forthcoming Madam Web. With the Rhino (Alessandro Nivola) also to appear in Kraven the Hunter, Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Kraven is in a setting much more directly geared towards an eventual Spider-Man showdown than his Black Panther role likely would have been. While Spidey has yet to arrive in Sony's universe of Marvel villains, that status quo will surely not last forever.\nRELATED: Everything We Know About Sony's Kraven The Hunter Movie\nThe fact of the matter is that, in a universe headlined by Spider-Man villains, it is a virtual certainty that Spidey himself will eventually appear. Venom: Let There Be Carnage and Spider-Man: No Way Home's end credits scenes laid the groundwork for exactly that with Eddie Brock being transported to the MCU and seeing Tom Holland's Spider-Man on television, so that expectation has clearly been primed by Sony. The infinite doorways of the multiverse make it possible for anyone from Andrew Garfield's Peter #3 to Miles Morales of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse to be that very Web-Slinger, while Kraven the Hunter is undoubtedly as prepped as Venom to battle Spidey.\nWhile Kraven the Hunter is set within Sony's universe of Spider-Man villains, there is also the potential that he could cross over into the MCU and meet Tom Holland's Web-Head. Venom's aforementioned journey to the MCU - brief though it may have been - already shows the door is open for Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Kraven to do the same. With Peter Parker in a difficult situation with the world's memory of him erased in No Way Home's ending, one particular Spider-Man comic story could even be perfect for where he picks up next. Namely, Kraven's Last Hunt, which is already serving as the partial basis for the Kraven the Hunter film.\nIn Kraven's Last Hunt, Kraven seemingly kills Spider-Man and assumes his identity in New York City, with the surviving Peter returning to stop him. With Peter forgotten by the entire world, someone else taking on Spider-Man's identity would be much easier to pull off if they were to get Peter out of the way, even temporarily. If Kraven is teleported into the MCU after his own movie, Spider-Man 4 could also easily adapt Kraven's Last Hunt as its story, with Tom Holland's Spidey battling his most vicious enemy yet in a battle where the stakes are higher than ever for him.\nBrad Curran is a Features Writer and Interviewer for Screen Rant.

As one of the most popular Nickelodeon shows during its six-season run from 2007 to 2012, iCarly received a Paramount+ revival in 2021. The revival allowed Kress to reprise his role as Freddie Benson, alongside co-stars Miranda Cosgrove (Carly Shay) and Jerry Trainor (Spencer Shay). However, it was announced that the iCarly revival would be cancelled after just three seasons.\nIn a tweet, Kress reacts to iCarly’s cancellation, taking the time to thank the show’s production team as well as the iCarly fans who made the show possible. The actor also mentioned that “no one wanted this to end on a cliffhanger.” Read his tweet below:\nKress elaborated that the iCarly team “had a lot of story left to tell.” While wishing that he and the team could have given audiences “the ending [they] deserved],” Kress ended his statement with some hope. He wrote: “Maybe somehow, someday, we'll find out how to story ends\" after iCarly season 3.\nKress expresses a similar sentiment that many iCarly fans are undoubtedly feeling in the wake of the show’s cancellation. As the Freddie actor alludes to, the show ends on a major cliffhanger when Carly and Spencer’s mom appears right before Carly and Freddie’s wedding despite being absent from the original series and revival up to that point. Additionally, audiences never saw a long-awaited wedding between Carly and Freddie.\nIn their cancellation announcement, Paramount+ attempted to paint a positive spin on the ending, mentioning that the show “delivered on what fans really wanted to see with Carly and Freddie finally getting together.” While the streaming platform did not state a reason for the show’s cancellation, it is possible that low ratings (though the numbers are unavailable on the streaming platform) played a factor. The WGA strikes may have also factored into the decision, as writers' room pauses halted shows across Hollywood.\nRelated: 10 Best Shows Like iCarly\niCarly’s cancellation is frustrating not only to viewers but to the cast as well. Although not every cast member returned to the show (the reboot was notably missing Jeanette McCurdy), those that did re-committed to the show after nearly a decade off the air. It is understandable that Kress would grieve for the loss of iCarly and still hope that he can finally finish Freddie’s story one day.\nSource: Nathan Kress/Twitter\n"}
{"title": "The Rick And Morty Movie: Confirmation Chances, Release Date Prediction & Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-05 19:00:32", "text": "A Rick and Morty movie has been discussed ever since the show first arrived in 2013, and over a decade later it may actually be happening.\nA Rick and Morty movie has been discussed almost since the shows debut back in 2013, both as a spinoff of the show and a live-action reimaging. While none of these ideas have reached the stage of development yet, there’s still be discussions about the possibility of a feature-length Rick and Morty adventure. With seven seasons behind it the show is entering a new era thanks to the departure of co-creator and voice actor Justin Roiland. Given that the future could see radical changes for Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith, there’s increased speculation that now could finally be the time for the Rick and Morty movie.\nThere have been several ideas for a Rick and Morty movie floated in the past by Dan Harmon, who created the show with Roiland but has been its main driving force for several years. The possibility of Rick and Morty getting a film adventure, be it on the big screen or as a double-length episode, hasn’t been ruled out by any of the Rick and Morty creative team, either. For the Rick and Morty movie it may be a case of not if it happens, but when, despite nothing official being confirmed yet.\nThe most recent news surrounding a possible Rick and Morty movie came on September 27, 2023. Dan Harmon gave an update on the Rick and Morty movie’s prospects. Surprisingly, Harmon revealed that conversations about a Rick and Morty movie were happening with studios prior to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes commenting earlier in the year. \nThe Rick and Morty co-creator revealed that a movie would be like a “super episode” akin to the likes of South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut. Now that the WGA strike has ended and SAG-AFTRA are expected to resolve their dispute with the AMPTP soon it’s possible that a Rick and Morty movie confirmation may actually arrive in the future after nearly a decade.\nThe Rick and Morty movie isn’t confirmed, although comments from Dan Harmon do indicate serious discussions have happened with studios behind the scenes. The prospects of a feature-length adventure for Rick, Morty, Beth, Summer, and Jerry has been discussed multiple times over the years, but seemingly not in any official capacity.\nThere’s no release date for the Rick and Morty movie yet, and until it’s picked up by a studio and enters development it’s impossible to predict one. However, it’s likely not a project that will arrive soon after being confirmed. Dan Harmon and the Rick and Morty team have famously never compromised the show’s quality by rushing to meet a release window. Given how important for the franchise a Rick and Morty movie would be, it’s a given they’d take their time ensuring it was the right story. A release date of 2027-2028 for the first Rick and Morty film isn’t at all unrealistic, and it could arrive even later.\nThe cast of the Rick and Morty movie would likely feature the same voice actors from the show. The Simpsons, Bob’s Burgers, South Park, and Futurama all kept the same cast for their feature length outings, and Rick and Morty is all but guaranteed to do the same. Comments from Harmon suggest that the movie would be like a “super episode” — what one would expect from Rick and Morty, but much more of it than the standard 20 minute-or-so-runtime allows.\nThis means the central cast of Sarah Chalke as Beth, Chris Parnell as Jerry, Spencer Grammer as Summer, and regular supporting voice actors like Kari Wahlgren, Phil Hendrie, and Cassie Steele would all be present. While they haven’t yet been revealed, the actors behind the re-casted Rick and Morty replacing Justin Roiland would also of course be part of the Rick and Morty movie cast.\nAnother option that has been floated is a live-action Rick and Morty movie. In this case the cast would be totally unknown, though there have been many suggestions for who could play Rick and Morty in live-action. Christopher Lloyd remains perhaps the most popular choice, and even appeared as Rick in a series of live-action shorts. \nThere are no hints as to what the story of the Rick and Morty movie would be. It’s likely Dan Harmon hasn’t fully concocted an idea yet, although he’s doubtless got several potential ones in mind. One possibility is that a feature-length Rick and Morty adventure could be a vehicle for resolving the meta-narrative of the show involving Rick Prime, Evil Morty, or maybe even Doofus Jerry from the Rick and Morty comic books. Until the movie is officially confirmed, however, it’s unclear what the plot could entail — and with a show like Rick and Morty the possibilities are limitless.\n"}
{"title": "'Thor-Knowledge': Thor's New Power Would Completely Change His Role in The MCU", "date": "2023-10-05 19:00:32", "text": "Thor has unlocked a new power in Marvel Comics, giving him abilities that would've drastically changed his movie journey through the MCU.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Immortal Thor #2 Thor wields a power few other characters in the Marvel Universe can even understand, let alone match, and his all-new abilities only reinforces that assertion, as Thor debuts powers that would have assuredly redefined his MCU journey.\nThor Odinson is currently the All-Father and the King of Asgard in Marvel Comics continuity, though he’s made it clear on many occasions that he considers Midgard - or, Earth - to be just as much a home to him as Asgard, with Thor's Avengers membership being a key reason as to why. The same is true for Thor in the MCU. Though with every effort to defend the Earth in the films, Thor always creates an impressive amount of damage. From the destruction caused during the Battle of New York in The Avengers to the decimation of Sokovia in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor has regularly been at the center of chaos in the MCU. However, with this new ability that was just introduced in Immortal Thor, Thor could have fixed all that damage in a flash (and eliminated any of his enemies even faster) by tapping into a power known as his ‘Thor-Knowledge’.\nIn Immortal Thor #2 by Al Ewing and Martín Cóccolo, Thor is in New York City facing-off against an elder god who exists outside the Ten Realms, one of immense power and fury: Toranos. It was clear since the battle began that Thor was no match for Toranos, even with the Odin-Power. However, after Thor recognized that he, not Odin, was in control of the abilities he now wields, the power and knowledge passed down by Odin were now wholly his own. Therefore, what was once the power of Odin became officially recognized as the power of Thor, and what was once the Odin-Knowledge was now Thor-Knowledge. With this reframing of his mind and realignment of his cosmic energies, Thor was able to use the Thor-Knowledge to its fullest extent. Thor tore a hole in the fabric of reality, and threw Toranus through it to the edge of known existence. Then, he used this power to repair the damage that was done to New York City in an instant, with his only shortcoming being his inability to reverse the deaths of those who perished.\nThis ability would have been perfect for dealing with the Chitauri in The Avengers, or Ultron in Age of Ultron, or even Thanos in Infinity War (indeed, Thor faced Thanos before any other Avenger in that film). Not only would Thor have been able to launch these villains to the other side of the universe instantaneously, but he’d also be able to clean up any and all damage caused by the villains immediately after they were gone. Toranos is one of the most powerful entities Thor has ever faced, as he was an elder god who claimed the title of God of Thunder when the first lightning bolt cracked across the sky, long before Thor was even born. Yet even still, Toranos wasn’t strong enough to withstand Thor when he utilized the Thor-Knowledge, meaning every villain Thor faced in the MCU would have easily crumbled before his newfound might.\nIf the God of Thunder had access to the Thor-Knowledge in the MCU, then his entire journey would have been altered, as every villain he faced would have been vanquished incredibly quickly. Or, if he wasn’t strong enough to consistently banish bad guys across the universe, then he’d at least be able to repair any damage that was done during any given battle, which alone might have been enough to prevent the Avengers splitting up in Captain America: Civil War. Any way one looks at it, it’s clear that the new powers Thor just debuted would have definitely come in handy in the MCU.\nImmortal Thor #2 by Marvel Comics is available now.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "10 Best Godlike Anime Healers", "date": "2023-10-05 19:00:32", "text": "Though they are often underappreciated, healers play the important role of allowing wounded anime heroes to recover from even the gravest injuries.\nAnime healers are rarely the center of attention, with all the glory usually going to heroes and warriors who boast impressive offensive capabilities, defeating their foes in a flashy manner and taking the spotlight for themselves. However, were it not for supporting characters who keep them afloat, these fighters may not even live to achieve the triumphs that make them popular.\nDepending on the setting and world, the power source and method of healers can vary greatly, from elite doctors who can treat even the rarest of conditions, to those who use magic to perform miraculous feats such as undoing the effects of death itself. But only the ones who can make a significant difference in their world can count themselves among the most remarkable, godlike healers.\nWhile Bleach's cast includes multiple accomplished healers, such as Retsu Unohana, no one is quite on the same level as Orihime Inoue. Thanks to her naturally high spiritual power, she is talented in detecting and controlling spiritual energy. Her spirit energy is harbored in the six-petal flower-shaped hairpins she received from her brother, where six different spirits lie. Using her spirits, Orihime can cast incredible techniques such as Sōten Kisshun, which doesn't technically \"heal\", but rather allows her to deny and undo certain events, even going as far as to restore missing limbs and resurrect people. Nothing says \"godlike\" like bringing back people from the dead.\nAs the Armed Detective Agency's personal physician, Akiko Yosano is a true expert in her field, possessing rich knowledge in terms of human anatomy and physiology. As Bungo Stray Dogs revolves around special abilities though, it's her rare ability that allows her to differentiate herself from other physicians. Using \"Thou Shalt Not Die\", Akiko can instantly heal any and all external wounds, both in and outside of combat, provided the target is nearly dead. The condition may seem limiting, but she has no qualms about injuring others to bring them closer to the necessary stage of being barely alive. Unfortunately, this ability has no effect on internal injuries and illnesses.\nAs Konohagakure's Fifth Hokage, Naruto's Tsunade is not only one of the world's strongest kunoichi, but also a legendary medical-nin, or ninja specialized in healing techniques. Her abilities as a medical-nin are truly unrivaled, as she has been noted to instantly identify any illness, and also easily treat conditions that most would consider impossible to recover from. She can heal anything from physical to psychological damage, and even solve cases of severe chakra depletion. Tsunade's strongest technique is her Creation Rebirth, which instantly heals any wounds, making her nearly immortal, but it comes at the cost of shortening her lifespan, which is why she only uses it as a last resort.\nRelated: A Forgotten Boruto Mystery Could Make A Comeback In Two Blue Vortex\nJoJo's Bizarre Adventure is all about iconic Stand abilities, which vary significantly in terms of both form and power. Diamond is Unbreakable's main protagonist, Josuke Higashikata, wields the Stand known as Crazy Diamond, which doesn't strictly heal, but rather restores objects and organisms to a previous state. This way, Josuke can not only repair anything but also heal virtually any injury, as long as it's not lethal. Thanks to his intelligence and mastery over his Stand, he always finds ways to use this ability creatively, adapting to any situation and making use of his environment. The only downside is that he cannot heal himself, which would require him to be more cautious, but that's not in Josuke's personality at all, so he will rush into any dangerous situation without regrets.\nWhile music is not uncommon in the anime world, thanks to the popularity of idol anime series, there is nothing quite like Healer Girl, wherein the musical moments are more akin to stage plays or Disney scenes. Its story takes place in a world wherein music is a valid, scientifically proven form of healing, and Ria Karasuma is at the top of the voice medicine world. Not only is she a renowned healer who runs her own clinic and teaches apprentice girls who hope to become like her, but she also conducts research on music healing, actively working towards advancing the field.\nHunter x Hunter's Alluka Zoldyck is not only a great example of trans representation, but also one of the anime world's most powerful characters. Truthfully though, despite being born into a family of infamous deadly assassins, Alluka has no exceptional strengths, either physical or Nen-related. Instead, the source of her power is Nanika, a mysterious creature from the Dark Continent who possessed her body. Nanika can grant any wishes, presumably to an infinite extent, after three of Alluka's requests are fulfilled. In terms of healing, a notable example would be when she healed Gon, whose body was in a critical state, almost dying as a result of a Nen contract.\nFairy Tail's Wendy Marvell uses Sky Dragon Slayer Magic, whose potential is multifaceted. Not only does it allow her to cast surprisingly powerful offensive and versatile support spells, but it also makes her a fantastic healer, able to cure even the gravest of injuries. Prior to her using this magic, it was believed to be long-lost, which indicates just how rare and significant it is. As one would expect, she can heal various wounds and negate the effects of potent poison, but that's not the full extent of her power, as she has even been noted to revive people who were in a near-death state.\nAs the Straw Hat Pirates' resident doctor, Tony Tony Chopper's medical skills aren't owed to one of One Piece's many Devil Fruits, but rather to his adoptive parental figures, Hiriluk and Kureha, two doctors who took care of him and taught him everything they knew about medicine. After learning the foundations of the field, he further increased his knowledge in the Torino Kingdom, where he studied books on drugs and herbs that the rest of the world was unfamiliar with. He has continued to learn and evolve as a doctor ever since, proving himself through extraordinary feats such as quickly developing new cures and treating brutal injuries.\nParallel World Pharmacy follows a world-class medical researcher who overworked himself to death and was reincarnated as Falma de Médicis, the heir of an esteemed family of pharmacologists, in an alternate, less developed world. Combining the knowledge from his previous life with the unique powers he obtained thanks to a deity's divine blessing, Falma can perform miraculous feats such as creating and destroying any substance whose molecular structure he's familiar with. Additionally, he also has divine sight, which lets him identify the medical issues of any person he's looking at. Lastly, unlike other people in his world, there seems to be no limit to his magic powers, making his potential unrivaled.\nWhile Elizabeth Liones may not be one of the titular sins, she is still one of The Seven Deadly Sins' most likable characters, as well as a surprisingly powerful one. As the current queen of the Kingdom of Liones and the current incarnation of the Goddess Elizabeth, she possesses immense light-based powers, being able to heal everyone in the kingdom at once in an instant. After learning to control her abilities, she proves herself to be incredibly talented, even more skillful than the best druids, easily healing multiple people who suffered lethal damage, as well as dispelling powerful curses placed by the Demon King's magic.\nWhile these characters may not be the most memorable of their series, as viewers tend to instead admire the ones defined by their seemingly endless strength, they may very well be the ones who played the most important role. Thanks to their healing powers, they allowed others to shine, often without expecting anything in turn. Some are even powerful enough to resurrect those who underestimated the threats they were facing, allowing fan-favorite characters to keep driving the action. Truly, anime healers deserve far more recognition than they usually receive.\nRemus Badescu is a writer for ScreenRant's anime section. He discovered his passion for the medium as a child, watching shows like Death Note on late-night TV, and has been enthralled with it ever since.

{"title": "Alternate Breaking Bad Endgame Revealed: Jesse Pinkman's Changed Fate, New Story Details & More", "date": "2023-10-05 19:00:51", "text": "Writer Thomas Schnauz reveals that there was originally a different plan for Jesse in Breaking Bad season 5 in which he inherited Walt’s empire.\nBreaking Bad writers Thomas Schnauz and George Mastras explains why a plan for Jesse to inherit Walt's drug empire was scrapped. Created by Vince Gilligan, the acclaimed crime drama first aired in 2008, chronicling the journey of Bryan Cranston's Walter White from mild-mannered chemistry teacher to the biggest drug kingpin in New Mexico. Aaron Paul costars in the show as Jesse, Walt's former student and eventual business partner, with the two have a major falling out in Breaking Bad season 5, the show's last.\nNow, in a recent interview with SlashFilm, Schnauz and Mastras reveal that there was originally a very different direction planned for Jesse's character arc in Breaking Bad season 5. What ultimately changed things, however, was the decision to have Jesse Plemons' Todd kill Drew Sharp in \"Dead Freight\" the show's train heist episode. Check out Schnauz and Mastras full comments about the change below:\nSchnauz: \"We had all these ideas of Walt's going to retire, and Jesse's going to be the big meth guy in Albuquerque. And once the kid got shot, that all got wiped off the table. \n“When we write, we flowchart a lot. And we say, 'What if this happened? What if that happens?' And one of the logical things is that Jesse is in the meth business and he's proud of what he does and he's good at it, and they're making the big bucks. And so the logical thing would be that Jesse would continue and Walt would get too sick to continue or pull away and let Jesse take over the operation.\n\"Walt, [unlike Jesse], can compartmentalize. They've done so many terrible things [...] So many things that he's pressed down that he tries to convince Jesse that yes, it was a horrible, terrible thing, but be strong and move on, and come with me on the successful journey that we're on because Mike's leaving so Walt doesn't want to be on his own.\"\nMastras: \"[Drew Sharp's death] really turned into the catalyst for the end really, spinning, turning Jesse against Walt. And that gave us that tool, I think unknowingly at the time, to really have that be the central conflict between the two characters that led to the overall ending.\"\nJesse, with Walt, is one of the most important characters in Breaking Bad, playing a central role in Walt's rise to power and subsequent fall. The two characters don't see eye to eye on most things, but they also need each other, with Walt memorably saying in season 1, \"You know the business, and I know the chemistry.\" While Walt's arc is what the show is essentially built around, Jesse's is just as crucial.\nWhere Walt is ambitious, driven, and ruthless to a fault, Jesse is, for parts of the show at least, basically the opposite. Jesse is, ostensibly, a loser, but he's also the heart of the series. Audiences care about Jesse because he's more empathetic, because he falls in love and cares about people, and because the horrible things he witnesses and participates in gnaw at his soul.\nThe decision to lean into this aspect of the character in Breaking Bad season 5 was for the best, as it speaks to Jesse's humanity. Jesse can't bear what happened to Drew, but Drew's death is really the last straw in a series of crushing deaths, betrayals, and hardships. While Breaking Bad's final season may still have worked if Jesse followed in Walt's footsteps and became a drug kingpin himself, exploring the softer and more human side of the character ultimately resulted in a powerful, cathartic, and more emotional ending.\nSource: SlashFilm\n"}

The 48-year-old Pennsylvania native recently completed his journey in Before the 90 Days season 6. On the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off, he dated Vietnamese single mom Violet Tuyet, hoping to marry her. Unfortunately, things didn’t work out between the two, leading to their split. Riley and Violet had no romantic chemistry at all. But at the Tell-All, Violet accused Riley of getting her pregnant. However, Riley surprised her by revealing he wasn’t fertile.\nWhile Riley’s connection with Violet didn’t go as intended, his new friendship with Kimberly may become fruitful. Recently, viewers spotted Riley getting flirty with Usman “Sojaboy” Umar’s ex. The duo interacted on a live video call on Instagram and planned to meet up. 90 Day Fiancé fan account 90 Day The Melanated Way posted the proof of Riley and Kimberly’s interaction and shared the gossip.\nThe fan account wrote, “Riley is heading down to visit Kimberly in SD later this month and let’s just say ‘date night’ is planned.” The admin of the fan account added fire to the rumors by stating that Riley’s dad already refers to Kimberly as his “daughter-in-law.”\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nAs expected, many 90 Day Fiance viewers took to the comments section to express their surprise and excitement about the news as they thought Riley and Kimberly made sense. Even co-stars such as Sumit Singh and Jenny Slatten were shocked about the sudden turn of events. Kimberly’s son Jamal Menzies also fueled the fire by stating he’ll “stop by” during the date. Unfortunately, the duo in question shut down the romance rumors by addressing their relationship. Kimberly commented, “No no no no. We are friends ONLY. D*** we can’t be friends?” Riley jumped into the conversation and told the 90 Day Fiancé fan account, “You never cease to amaze me lol.”\nFans aren’t wrong to get excited about Kimberly and Riley’s potential relationship. Both cast members were in bad relationships and would suit each other well. Kimberly dated Usman, who seemed to only care about making his name and didn’t respect her. Riley dated Violet, who called him “ugly” and didn’t care for his romantic gestures. Kimberly and Riley had similar heartbreaks, which would help them relate to each other. They are also both Americans and won’t have a cultural difference. Kimberly and Riley could be well-suited for 90 Day: The Single Life season 4.\nRiley seems like a much better fit for Kimberly as well. Usman cared for the San Diego woman but didn’t respect her enough. He made comments about her looks and didn’t love her sufficiently. In comparison, Riley cared for Violet and bought her many gifts. He wanted to make the relationship work and didn’t worry about her past for the longest time. Riley is a much better potential partner for Kimberly because the two don’t have a significant age gap or cultural differences. Unlike Kimberly’s last boyfriend, the new 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star also doesn’t want a child.\nSource: 90 Day The Melanated Way/Instagram\n"}

Tumi finally made it to the yacht Mustique in Italy after having visa issues in customs. She and Kyle were both stuck there and had to sit out the first charter. When Tumi met Natalya for the first time, it was clear there was some tension, and Natalya believed it had to do with Kyle.\nReddit user emergencyelk95, took a screengrab from Bravo's Below Deck Instagram account. In the screengrab, Natalya's going off in the comment section about Tumi and Kyle. Natalya's first comment was, \"My biggest pet peeve is when someone lets a certain person influence their opinion on someone before even meeting them.\" Natalya is clearly talking about Tumi and how Kyle likely said some not-so-nice things about her after their charter season together on Below Deck Med season 7.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nIn her next comment, she wrote, \"My other pet peeve would be ungrateful people who can’t even say thank you for holding do the fort for 4 days, while being crew down, while setting up a boat, while running on no sleep.\" ﻿During the most recent Below Deck Med season 8 episode, Tumi revealed in one of her confessionals that Kyle had warned her about Natalya. He told her how he and Natalya had their ups and downs last season, so Tumi was simply trying to make Natalya know that she was the boss. However, Natalya didn't appreciate how Tumi didn't give her the props for holding down the fort while she was gone.\nKyle clearly gave Tumi the rundown from last season and poisoned the relationship between Tumi and Natalya before it could even begin. It was clear when Natalya was showing Tumi the boat that Tumi had preconceived notions of Natalya. While Kyle and Natalya seemingly left the boat on good terms, it seems Kyle still had some issues with Natalya, some of which were shown in the Below Deck Med season 8 trailer.\nJudging by the trailer, the interior crew is going to have some issues going forward. Even though Kyle still had some underlying issues with Natalya, he should have let Tumi have an opinion of her on her own. Kyle giving Tumi the rundown on Natalya before the start of the season could potentially ruin their season.\nBelow Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.\nSources: emergencyelk95/Reddit, Below Deck/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "Who The “Reptile” Is In Netflix’s 2023 Movie – Title Explained", "date": "2023-10-05 19:10:27", "text": "Reptile is an intriguing name for the new thriller starring Benicio Del Toro. Here's who the \"reptile\" in Netflix's 2023 movie really is. \nWarning: This article contains spoilers for Reptile!\nWith so many mercurial characters and ambiguous situations in Netflix's 2023 film Reptile, the meaning behind the title points to the heart of the mystery Detective Nichols (Benicio Del Toro) is trying to solve. Nichols has transferred police departments and operates in the small community of Scarborough under the avuncular eye of Captain Allen, his wife's uncle. When a young real estate agent named Summer is killed, several suspects emerge from the darkness that enshrouds her idyllic life; Sam, an ex-husband, Will Grady (Justin Timberlake) a new boyfriend and fellow realtor born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and Eli Phillips, a neighbor with a personal vendetta.\nAs the investigation into Summer's death goes deeper, Nichols discovers that what he thinks he knows about all the characters in Reptile isn't what it appears to be. Shifting allegiances, ulterior motives, and all the hallmarks of a first-rate thriller and film-noir are on display, and at the heart of it stands a detective trying to make sense of it while keeping his integrity intact. By the end of Reptile, the explosive finale drives home why the dissonant title has so much bearing on the plot, and why the natural stages of a reptile's life cycle fits the way that the characters operate within it.\nReptile's title points to the titular entity's \"shedding of skin,\" which can be seen as a metaphor for the way the characters reveal themselves to be corrupt after previously presenting as benign. The director explained to Netflix; \"In the movie, characters are introduced as one thing and revealed to be something else,” Singer continues. “There’s a shedding of skin that occurs, and it felt like an appropriate metaphor for the film. Some of the most unethical people in the film can be very likable in moments.” Not only is this true of Nichols' boss Captain Allen, or Will Grady, Summer's grieving boyfriend with a sinister side, but of Nichols himself.\nAs Nichols' investigation peels away the layers of different characters' facades, and likable people in his life emerge as literal snakes in the grass, Nichols also goes through a shedding of skin, but for the languorous detective, the process works in reverse. He's trying to get rid of a reputation for taking bribes and keeping contraband that he acquired at his previous department, so while other characters become more corrupt, Nichols' true nature emerges as more altruistic. By the end of the film, he cannot in good conscience allow the illegal actions of those closest to him, and even his superiors, to continue.\nUnfortunately for Nichols, the final shedding of skin occurs in his own department, where even his closest friends are caught up in a scheme involving Grady's shell real estate company White Fish. When Nichols finds out that certain officers have been placing contraband in houses, seizing them, and then allowing White Fish to buy them for dirt cheap to flip at incredible profits, he has to confront the people he trusts the most, including the chief of police. It's only after Nichols has made it clear he won't be part of their plan that his transformation is complete, and he can honestly say to himself that he's a good cop.\nReptile explores themes of transformation, perspective, and survival in the natural world. Whereas some characters seem destined to remain the same and make the same mistakes, some can surmount fate and oppose what seems like an inevitable degradation of the human spirit. It's natural for snakes and reptiles to shed their skin as they outgrow it, and Reptile explores how that can be both the sign of a new beginning and a further indictment of character depending on perspective, and with Nichols providing the film's point of view, he presents a realistic arbiter the audience can relate to.\nSource: Netflix\n"}
{"title": "Terminator Already Confirmed Its Grossest Fan Theory Is 100% Correct", "date": "2023-10-05 19:11:19", "text": "Terminator's time travel has hard set rules, with a gross fan theory about how technology can be brought to the past already confirmed in comics!\nThe Terminator franchise has been around for decades, with fan interest keeping the series going despite its up-and-down quality in the movie space. But leave it up to comic books to give fans what they want because, in a Terminator issue from the early '90s, one of the grossest fan theories out there has already been confirmed to be true.\nThe Terminator: One Shot by James Robinson and Matt Wagner was released the same year as Terminator 2: Judgment Day and focuses on another “wrong Sarah Connor” that Skynet has targeted for destruction. Hunted down by a T-800 Terminatrix, Sarah is protected by a future Resistance member named Ellis Ruggles (who has been kicking around since 1955).\nEllis saves Sarah by using a large “Electro-Mech Fazer” against the Terminatrix, revealed later to have been built by hiding pieces of it in his body during his time travel trip.\nRelated: The First Terminator Had 1 Weapon That Could Destroy Arnie's T-800\nThe franchise's time travel is unable to send anything synthetic through time without a layer of organic material wrapped around it to help make the transition (the reason Terminators look like fleshy humans when sent on missions and arrive naked). Because of this, both the Terminators and the rebels sent back to stop them usually have to fend for themselves for clothing and weapons when they arrive at their temporal destination, leading fans to speculate that John Connors’ agents should be able to bring back advanced technology inside their bodies to help mitigate this disadvantage - something this comic issue directly addresses.\nObviously an uncomfortable choice, since rebels would have to either surgically implant pieces of weapons into their bodies or use more of a discomfiting approach to smuggling everything, this tactic nevertheless gives humans a major advantage in stopping the machines by giving them access to technology that won’t exist for decades. Furthermore, sending more than one person through time, each stocked up internally with contraband, would allow John Connor to essentially build whatever he wanted in the past to help his future self. It's a gross tactic, but one worth exploring if it can help save all of humanity.\nEssentially evening the odds between a human-sized flesh-covered weapon and an actual human with \"hidden\" weapons, this fan theory, though never technically seen in the films, is proven in this issue to work as something that the Resistance forces need to utilize more often.\nJohn Connor’s struggle to save humanity seems to be a never-ending one, so if he could find a way to send even more internally weaponized rebels to fight past Terminators, there at least will always be a fighting chance to take down these evil machines once and for all!\nBrian is first and foremost a nerd in every way shape and form.

{"title": "MCU Phase 5's Avengers Replacements Prove Marvel Fixed A Long-Standing Phase 2 Critique", "date": "2023-10-05 19:20:27", "text": "The MCU's origin story formula has become repetitive, but the Multiverse Saga's new characters prove that Marvel is working to subvert expectations.\nWith the Marvel Cinematic Universe moving into a new era with the Multiverse Saga, the franchise’s latest new characters prove that the studio has acknowledged early criticism. Every iconic character that has debuted in the MCU timeline comes with their own origin story, and the formula for these origin stories has been relatively straightforward since the MCU Phase 1. A character will be introduced as an underdog of sorts, with their first film usually showing them getting used to their unique powers while sometimes teasing another MCU character alongside them.\nWhile it is the classic superhero origin story, the repetitiveness of it started to wear on audiences as the MCU progressed. By the time of films like Ant-Man and Doctor Strange, the origin story formula had already been done with numerous heroes beforehand. Most of the origins followed the same story beats and even included the same kind of villain that mirrored the hero. The end of the Infinity Saga was the perfect time for the studio to act on the criticism, and the Multiverse Saga’s new characters have already proven that the Phase 5 and 6 movies will start branching out from the origin story formula.\nThe Multiverse Saga has most notably seen the introduction of several younger heroes to the MCU. These younger heroes have often debuted alongside more established MCU characters, and their ties to their mentors contribute to part of their origin story. Yelena Belova and America Chavez were only supporting characters in their respective films, but their origin stories were effectively fleshed out without needing a solo film. Even characters who debuted in a Disney+ series, like Kate Bishop, have shown off the MCU’s new take on origin stories in a more condensed setting.\nRelated: Marvel’s MCU Young Avengers Cast (As We Know It)\nKamala Khan’s origin story can be considered the most akin to the standard formula since she has a solo series that explores her powers. However, Ms. Marvel still manages to subvert from the Phase 1 origin story tradition by not having her save the world from some big bad or uprooting her whole life because of her newfound hero identity. Phase 5 and 6’s new take on character introductions suggest that the MCU has developed enough that they don’t need to stick to a traditional trend or formula and that the studio can take more liberties with origin stories with so much lore already developed.\nThe MCU’s Phase 1 origin story formula may have been the most effective way to translate a comic story to the big screen at the time, but the franchise has evolved past that. There is such a huge range of origin stories in the comics that the MCU subverting from tradition will be the best way to mirror its unique source material. With over 30 films in the MCU already, the superhero origin stories were starting to get too predictable. Marvel changing things up will help keep the franchise feeling fresh and creative going into a new era of the Phase 6 projects.\nPhases 1 and 2 of the MCU are undoubtedly iconic, but the standard storytelling format introduced in these phases could only work for so long. Going into the Multiverse Saga, Marvel had to do something to address the criticism of their redundant origin story formula. Whether it be alongside their mentor or in the grounded setting of teenage life, Phase 5 has already introduced new characters in ways that differ from before. With a shift in focus towards younger heroes and Disney+ being a whole new platform for the MCU to play with, Phase 6 should only continue to subvert expectations.\n"}
{"title": "Gen V Drops An Explosive Track By Christopher Lennertz & Matt Bowen [EXCLUSIVE]", "date": "2023-10-05 19:22:19", "text": "Exclusive: Screen Rant offers a first listen to “Flashpoint” from the upcoming Gen V soundtrack album by Christopher Lennertz & Matt Bowen.\nGen V proves that there is plenty of room for expansion in the world of The Boys. The spinoff series has managed to capture the violence, humor, and social commentary The Boys is known for, even as it introduces a slew of new Supes for whom powers may be as much of a curse as they are a blessing. Though Gen V boasts an exciting new cast led by Chilling Adventures of Sabrina alums Jaz Sinclair as Marie Moreau and Chance Perdomo as Andre Anderson, it was created by Eric Kripke, Craig Rosenberg, and Evan Goldberg, who all helped bring The Boys to life.\nAlso jumping from The Boys to Gen V are composers Christopher Lennertz and Matt Bowen. The pair have written music for The Boys since season 1, and Matt Bowen has spoken with Screen Rant about how they approached scoring that series. Now, Screen Rant is excited to share a piece of music Bowen and Lennertz have composed for Gen V. Check out “Flashpoint” below:\nAs can be heard above, “Flashpoint” is an exciting track full of dramatic twists and turns. It’s clear Bowen and Lennertz have taken plenty of inspiration from their work on The Boys, using many of the same techniques in Gen V. Still, with Gen V’s main characters bringing something new to the world, Lennertz and Bowen have incorporated new elements into their music as well. Both composers touched on their difference in approach to Gen V and their excitement in scoring the series:\nMatt Bowen: The writers and actors did such a great job setting this up as a spinoff. Chris and I just followed their lead when looking for our own inspiration. The music is still rooted in the world of The Boys, but it has fresh flavors and themes just like the show has fresh characters and storylines.\nChristopher Lennertz: From the beginning, the idea of expanding the sonic world of The Boys for a new group of Supes and a whole new setting and set of powers was an exciting opportunity. We had a chance to take all the violent dissonance and warped chaos of our Vought universe, but filter it through a new lens: the excitement of students at the very beginning of their journeys, as heroes in training. We hope that we created a sound that feels familiar, yet even more eclectic and powerful.\nWith so much crossover potential between The Boys and Gen V, it makes sense Lennertz and Bowen would keep the musical identity of each show relatively similar. With the story of Gen V so tied to the events of The Boys, a meeting of characters from both shows feels inevitable. If and when that does happen, the inclusion of new instruments to the spinoff’s musical palette, such as 808 drums and featured vocalists, will make for a fun blending of The Boys’ themes with those from Gen V.\nNew episodes of Gen V release on Fridays on Prime Video. The Gen V (Prime Original Series Soundtrack) will be released on digital platforms on October 6th.\n"}
{"title": "1 Evil Dead Rise Line Finally Explains Why Deadites Are So Unpredictable", "date": "2023-10-05 19:30:32", "text": "The vicious and lethal Deadites of the Evil Dead franchise could probably kill their victims immediately, but instead they torment and disturb.\nAfter several movies displayed just how unpredictable the vicious Deadites can be when torturing their victims, one Evil Dead Rise line finally revealed what their motivation is. With few exceptions, the living victims of Deadites eventually die in gruesome fashion, and it's fairly clear that they have the ability to kill their victims whenever they want. But the defining characteristic of a Deadite possession is not the eventual outcome, it's the insane behavior of the possessed individuals while under the influence of the Deadites.\nAs the Evil Dead franchise has evolved, the Deadite behavior has ranged from almost silly to extremely disturbing, but the common thread is their completely unpredictable nature. There is no textbook Deadite possession, and each instance reveals new and twisted ways that the Deadites can morph flesh, spread their infection and torment the people closest to the victim. The true intention of the Deadites' behavior was finally revealed in Evil Dead Rise, and it explains all the madness sown by the Deadites throughout history.\nThe recordings of the priest found with the Naturom Demonto in the vault at the outset of Evil Dead Rise revealed the true intention of the Deadites chaos. As the priest, voiced by Evil Dead franchise star Bruce Campbell, describes, a Deadite \"takes its pleasure in creating terror through total chaos.\" The aim of the parasitic demons is not to kill their victims - it is to enjoy the fear created by their unpredictable behavior.\nThis explains most of the actions of the Deadites, and why they even go so far as to possess already-dead individuals. Rotting their victims from the inside out, appearing uninfected to deceive others, and the group-merging seen at the climax of Evil Dead Rise are all tricks that Deadites use to sow fear and chaos in whatever environment they happen to invade. The deceptions they use and the confusion they create also make it far easier for them to infect others, as observed when the Ellie Deadite appears to return to her uninfected state to trick her youngest daughter into opening the apartment door.\nRelated: Evil Dead: How Deadite Possession Really Works\nThe Deadites' desire for chaos explains why their possessed victims are so different in their appearance and abilities. While they are sometimes played almost as jokes (as was the case with Cougie the half-human, half-mascot Deadite in season 3 of Ash vs. Evil Dead) the various versions of the Deadites are totally unpredictable in their actions, making them that much harder to defeat. The Deadites find new ways to terrify with every interaction, resulting in some truly bizarre creatures.\nOne of the best examples occurs in Evil Dead Rise itself. The Ellie, Danny, and Bridget Deadites literally melt their bodies together to create a monstrous entity known as The Marauder, which is unlike anything ever seen in the Evil Dead movies or TV show. That merging makes very little sense - as three separate people, the Deadites would likely have an easier time pursuing and infecting Beth and Kassie. However, as The Marauder, they create something far scarier and more disturbing, which elevates the fear and chaos they crave.\n"}
{"title": "All The Assassin's Creed Games, Ranked Worst To Best", "date": "2023-10-05 19:30:32", "text": "The Assassin’s Creed series currently has 20 games including spin-offs and handheld releases - here’s how they all stack up compared to one another.\nBased on a unique premise, Assassin's Creed successfully combines historical fiction and action-adventure to create a series of pulpy extravaganzas. Although the franchise has had its ups and downs, it's continued to push boundaries, taking players into increasingly enveloping and engaging scenarios.\nRecent entries have taken players further into the past than ever before, and while opinions differ on its recent direction, the series has never strayed too long from providing fun and engaging titles. Assassin's Creed has never shied away from exploring new ideas and epochs, constantly evolving along with the industry and always offering something new that keeps critics satisfied and audiences in anticipation. Although the upcoming live-service hub Assassin's Creed Infinity presents worries for some series fans regarding the future direction of the franchise, no matter where the franchise heads in the future, it will have a strong legacy behind it.\nRelated: How To Play Every Assassin's Creed Game In Chronological Order\nWith awkward controls on the Nintendo DS and more emphasis on stealth that makes it feel more akin to Prince Of Persia than Assassin's Creed, Altaïr's Chronicles was a poor first attempt at a handheld that landed a measly 58 on Metacritic. While it is impressive that Ubisoft was able to put an open world into a DS cartridge, it is clearly a rushed product.\nThe biggest issue it faced with players was its length; it can be beaten completely in four to five hours. Even for an early Assassin's Creed, that is way too short. Sadly, it also suffered from a flaw that the very first Assassin's Creed had: the overrated protagonist Altaïr is not that interesting of a character.\nThe spin-off series of Assassin's Creed was never beloved, but Chronicles did provide a unique 2.5D side-scrolling experience. However, fans were displeased with the copy-paste style of many Assassin's Creed subseries entries.\nThe highlight of Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia came in the form of its 1918 Russian setting, an era more technologically advanced than the franchise has ever explored. The World War I setting was refreshing and the main character was interesting, but with a 61 on Metacritic, it still amounted to little more than an average clone of the first Chronicles game.\nRelated: Every Assassin's Creed Setting So Far (Spin-offs Included)\nAltair made his return to the series with Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines on the PlayStation Portable, one of only a few AC games made for handheld consoles. The gameplay was a step backward for the series - particularly since Assassin's Creed 2 had recently released as a superior sequel to the original game and set a new standard for the franchise. While it was praised for giving Altaïr a proper return in a better story than Altaïr's Chronicles, it only achieved a 63 on Metacritic.\nDespite the impressively large map for a handheld title, the comparably unpolished and choppy gameplay made Bloodlines an unappealing alternative to the console games. A lot of this was due to the limitations of the PSP, a common problem with the system's games.\nContinuing from the first Chronicles, Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India continues to explore more exotic settings, this time showcasing the beauty of India. Many praised the visuals of India, but, like Chronicles: Russia, the sequel just does not do anything to innovate the spin-off series.\nDespite its lack of innovation, those who enjoyed the inaugural Chronicles game will likely enjoy its follow-up despite its mediocre 64 on Metacritic. Although it may not be an Assassin's Creed spinoff worth playing for everyone, fans interested in a more challenging experience can find one in Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed & Other Games That Are Wonderful History Lessons\nEzio Auditore da Firenze finally got his chance to shine in a handheld title with Assassin's Creed 2: Discovery. As such, the game received praise for continuing the legacy of one of the most beloved main characters of the whole franchise and managing to improve upon the formula.\nUnfortunately, Discovery doesn't quite manage to be anything beyond solid, showcased by the 69 it received on Metacritic. Like Altaïr's Chronicles, the game is far too short and largely comes across as a watered-down clone of Prince Of Persia, albeit with a decent story that takes place after the events of Assassin's Creed 2's DLC.\nThe first of the Chronicles spin-offs is definitely the best, taking players to one of the most perfect Assassin's Creed settings for the first time. The main protagonist, Shao Jun, has the credit of being one of the franchise's first playable female Assassins. The character was also praised due to her more grounded story and respectable portrayal of an Asian character.\nA more straightforward side-scrolling action/stealth game, Chronicles: China is a refreshing break from the open-world vastness of the main titles. The game's average score of a 69 on Metacritic showcases its limitations, but the title could have been a lot worse. There's no reason for hardcore Assassin's Creed fans to not give Chronicles: China a chance.\nRelated: How Assassin's Creed Jade Is Changing AC Combat & Gameplay\nDespite its title making it sound like DLC for Assassin's Creed 3, Liberation is actually a spin-off developed exclusively for the new - at the time - PlayStation Vita. When it comes to the Vita, Assassin's Creed 3: Liberation is often considered a must-have game for Sony's most recent handheld.\nIt keeps the typical open-world gameplay that Assassin's Creedis known for and, despite some slowdown, manages to hold up reasonably against its console counterparts. It is praised for replicating the Assassin's Creed 3 gameplay while introducing the first female Assassin and a unique new location. Liberation was so beloved - relative to the other side games, at least - that it even got an HD remake for two different generations of consoles.\n2014 was not a good year for Assassin's Creed. Both releases received the lowest scores of any console games in the entire franchise, with Assassin's Creed: Unity achieving a score of 71 on Metacritic. The plot is set during the French Revolution and centers on Arno Victor Dorian's efforts to expose the true powers behind the revolution. It's a setup AC fans had been hoping to see for some time, but it was marred with shortcomings.\nOften considered the worst Assassin's Creed, Unitydrew criticism centered on the game's small scope and numerous technical issues which included bugs and glitches, poor graphics, and performance and connectivity issues. Although patches improved the game and its parkour system was exciting, it never reached the heights of prior titles.\nRelated: Ubisoft Learned The Wrong Lessons From Assassin's Creed Unity\nThe first of two games released in 2014, Assassin's Creed: Rogue's final mission actually serves as the prologue for Unity. Set during the Seven Years' War, Rogue follows Shay Patrick Cormac, an Assassin turned Templar, in his efforts to hunt down and kill members of the Brotherhood who betrayed him.\nWith a weighted average of 72, Rogue holds a \"mixed or average reviews\" grade on Metacritic. Praise went to the primary twist of playing as an Assassin's Creed Templar instead of an Assassin, as well as the complexity of the titular character. The game, however, failed to innovate or deliver a sailing experience as strong as Black Flag and featured a generally predictable plot.\nThings improved somewhat in 2015, though the franchise remained at a low point with Assassin's Creed: Syndicate. With a Metacritic score of 76, firmly set on the \"mixed or average reviews\" camp, Syndicate follows twin Assassins Jacob and Evie Frye's attempts to take back their city from Templar control.\nSet in Victorian-era London, Syndicate offered an improvement on Unity and Rogue, with particular praise going to the plot, graphics, and missions. Many considered it a return to form for the franchise, although the repetitiveness of the gameplay acted as a strong downside.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed Syndicate: Evie Deserved To Be The Main Character\nThe game that started it all, the first Assassin's Creed showed the promise of the series from the beginning. It takes place during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land and introduces Desmond Miles, the franchise's modern-day lead - at least, during the first few games. The central conflict between Assassins and Templars is also introduced.\nPraised for its innovative premise, engaging storytelling and visuals, and overall originality, Assassin's Creed received a weighted average of 80 on Metacritic. Although its innovations are still interesting today, the characters and gameplay of later entries have improved in variety and entertainment.\nThe fourth game in the main series, Revelations continues the story of Desmond Miles, still voiced by Nolan North, as he tries to avert the 2012 apocalypse. It is mainly set during the 12th and 13th-century in Masyaf, Cappadocia, and Constantinople.\nFollowing up the acclaim offered to Assassin's Creed 2 and Brotherhood, Revelations took a slight downturn by adding only superficial additions and covering a less compelling part of Ezio's complete Assassin's Creed story. It still brought a solid experience to the table and also stands as the first and so far only game where all its versions received the same grade on Metacritic, with PC, Xbox 360, and PS3 all getting an 80 \"generally favorable\" review.\nRelated: Dawn Of Ragnarok's Trailer Has A Hidden Nod To AC Revelations\nPremiering in 2018, Assassin's Creed: Odyssey brought the franchise into full RPG mode. Odyssey took players further into the past than ever before, taking place between the years 431-422 BC. Set against the backdrop of the Peloponnesian War, the player controls a mercenary who fights for both sides as they attempt to find their family.\nOdyssey received critical acclaim for its characters (particularly when choosing the strong Assassin's Creed protagonist Kassandra), scope, setting, plot, gameplay, and story, gaining an 85 on Metacritic. However, the game's reach sometimes exceeded its grasp, and a focus on having an enormous amount of content led to some of the missions feeling repetitive or trite. With a focus on making players explore and grind for achievement, Odyssey's best features could only sometimes overcome its weaknesses.\nThe sequel to Revelations and the fifth game overall, Assassin's Creed 3 continues the apocalypse storyline and is set during the American Revolution. It received generally positive reviews, with an average weighted score of 83 on Metacritic.\nThe game courted some controversy when it was accused of anti-British sentiment while promoting American nationalism, particularly in its marketing. Once released, critics agreed that the depiction of both sides was balanced, with reviewers concurring with the developers claim that the game did not portray or endorse jingoism. Assassin's Creed 3's excellent opening gives way to uneven story pacing, which coincided with a buggy release to make Assassin's Creed 3 compare unfavorably against the high points of the Ezio games. Highlights like naval combat and tomahawk action, however, go a long way in counterbalancing flaws.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed 3 Gave Connor The Series' Coolest Weapon\nThe latest entry into the Assassin's Creed RPG venture, Valhalla serves as a successor to Odyssey. Set during the Viking Invasion of Britain circa 872 CE, the player assumes control of the Viking Eivor, who becomes involved in the ancient conflict between Templars and Assassins.\nHighly anticipated since its announcement, Valhalla received praise for its narrative and world design. Some side content can feel repetitive, but a less grindy approach to equipment marks an improvement from Odyssey. An average score of 83 on Metacritic shows that Valhalla's familiar approach doesn't hold it back from being a good overall experience.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage is a prequel to Valhalla, taking place 11 years before in ancient Baghdad, with its story centering on a street thief turned Hidden One, Basim Ibn Ishaq. Basim plays a key role in Valhalla, but Mirage is perfectly playable as a standalone experience, using its predecessor's foundation to deliver a game closer to the classic stealth action the series was known for originally. The overarching story of Mirage falters in some key places, but its gameplay is a delightful throwback, and the majority of its immediate narrative within Baghdad more than makes up for any low points.\nMirage feels like a return to the series' roots through-and-through, recentering the conflict between the Hidden Ones and the Order of the Ancients, organizations that would go on to become the Assassin Brotherhood and Templar Order respectively. This focus makes assassination Basim's main objective in numerous missions, peeling back the facade of Baghdad's high society to find the Order's rot within. This focus on investiagation makes it heavily reminiscent of the original Assassin's Creed, but Mirage doesn't suffer from the same repetitiveness.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nBlack Flag represented substantially different gameplay from prior Assassin's Creed games. Set in the 18th-century Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, the game features a great deal of ship-based action, with particular emphasis on strategy and exploration. Black Flag follows Welsh pirate Edward Kenway, voiced by Matt Ryan, who stumbles upon the Assassin/Templar conflict.\nCritically acclaimed upon release, Black Flag made an interesting and successful change-up to the traditional formula. Although Black Flag's open world tends to ping-pong players from mission to mission, its large scope marked an exciting change for the series, and its expansion of Assassin's Creed 3's naval gameplay resonated with fans. With an 85 Metacritic score, it received high notes in all its iterations, with its PS3 version as the highest-rated.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed: Edward Kenway Deserved His Own Ezio Trilogy\nEntering into the golden age of Assassin's Creed, Brotherhood marks the second installment of the Assassin's Creed trilogy headlined by protagonist Ezio Auditore da Firenze. His quest to restore the Assassin order continues, as well as his goal of bringing down his enemies, the powerful Borgia family.\nSet in 16th-century Italy, mainly Rome, Brotherhood earned critical acclaim. The PS3 version achieved a 90 on Metacritic, although its weighted average is 89 when counting the Xbox 360 and PC versions. Although the story doesn't always operate at the heights of Assassin's Creed 2, an excellent setting, improved gameplay, and interesting side content made it a more than worthy follow-up to a legendary predecessor.\nAssassin's Creed: Origins is set in Egypt at the end of the Ptolemaic Period circa 49 BCE. It explores the conflict between the Hidden Ones, ancestors of the Assassins, and The Order of the Ancients, who were forerunners of the Templars. It emphasizes role-playing elements but retains the open-world and stealth elements typical of the franchise.\nThe enormous Assassin's Creed Origins mapleads to a slower pace than prior games in the series, but the game excels in many other regards. The engaging protagonist Bayek has a compelling and personal story, and clearing enemy camps proves more engaging than prior games thanks to interesting combat and design. With an average of 83 on Metacritic, indicating \"generally positive reviews,\" Origins successfully took Assassin's Creed into new and exciting territory.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed Origins Bayek Cosplay Is Worthy Of The Gods\nAssassin's Creed 2 turned the franchise into a true force with which to be reckoned in the gaming world. Taking place at the height of the Italian Renaissance, the plot follows Ezio as he seeks vengeance against those who betrayed his family, discovering mysteries left behind by an ancient race known as the First Civilization.\nCritically acclaimed at the time of its release, Assassin's Creed 2's realistic open world, in which the player can explore Florence, Venice, Monteriggioni, and Forli, received universal praise. This perspective holds up today, as limited combat options and a smaller scope fail to drag down a tight, focused story and gameplay experience.Plenty of great Assassin's Creedgames have released since Ezio's first adventure, but the rooftops of Venice still stand tall above the rest.\nSource: Ubisoft/YouTube\nDavid is a twenty-nine-year-old Mexican writer and reader.

{"title": "Miranda’s Victim Review: Important Drama Is Elevated By Outstanding Performances", "date": "2023-10-05 19:35:26", "text": "Not a single performance was wasted in Miranda’s Victim, which is exactly the kind of production you need from such a heavy story.\n“You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used against you in a court of law…” Under the fifth amendment of the US Constitution, Miranda Rights protect people from self-incrimination. We hear them often in crime shows and films, but the story behind their creation is a shocking one. Director Michelle Danner brings to life this true story based on the 1966 Supreme Court decision that changed America forever. In Miranda’s Victim, Abigail Breslin stars as a victim of one of the most heinous crimes imaginable. George Kolber and Richard Lasser developed the story and J. Craig Stiles penned the screenplay of this well-acted, shocking story of events that would change crime reporting and our justice system forever.\nTrish Weir (Breslin) is a kindhearted and shy eighteen-year-old. After getting off at her bus stop from a long night at work and beginning her walk home, Trish is kidnapped and raped. Through countless recalls with the local police officers, Trish finally identifies her assailant, Ernesto Miranda (Sebastian Quinn). Miranda confesses without legal representation and serves a two-year sentence, which is later overturned. Trish wants to put her trauma behind her, but Lawrence Turoff (Luke Wilson), the prosecutor overseeing the case, is determined to hold Ernesto accountable for his crimes. But with Ernesto’s defense attorney, John Flynn (Ryan Phillippe), standing in his way, that proves to be more challenging.\nThroughout Danner’s film, there is one thing that is vastly clear: Rape reporting and convictions have been a trouble spot in our legal system for a very long time. Though Miranda Rights serve their purpose and belong in the constitution, their origin can very well leave a bad taste in your mouth. Through Weir, we see how little support there is when it comes to reporting such crimes, whether that be from your own mother, husband, or the courts. But something that Miranda’s Victim does well is show Trish’s bravery in dealing with her trauma while pushing through and using her voice to get her rapist convicted. We don’t often see this depicted on the big screen, so it’s a breath of fresh air to be reminded that women are multifaceted and able to take on the very same things that bring them trauma.\nThe script appropriately demonstrates just how difficult standing up to one’s rapist can be. Though the screenplay, written by J. Craig Styles, takes us through Trish’s trauma and fight for justice in equal doses, it is Danner’s direction that pushes the visuals a bit far in the storytelling. We're well aware of what a rape scene looks like, and the visual impact it brings. But we’ve also moved past the point of needing them to prove a point. And in Miranda’s Victim, the graphic visuals serve very little service to the story other than reminder flashbacks and ways to emphasize Trish’s ongoing nightmares. Subtlety would have been the best approach here and a redirection to the film’s style and personality would’ve been better suited.\nDespite these minor hiccups, it is clear Danner understands the sensitive content of the story. Visually, the other parts of the story work in and out of the courtroom when it comes to shaping Trish’s feelings throughout the years. Crucially, Danner gives her actors the space to excel in every moment, giving us a compelling final product that is worth the watch. Abigail Breslin certifies her talent with every tear shed while giving an equally amazing physical performance. Ryan Phillippe also returns to form with his cutthroat approach to his character John Flynn. Not a single performance is wasted in Miranda’s Victim, which is exactly the kind of production you need from such a heavy story.\nUltimately, this story, likely unfamiliar to the masses, conveys the hidden history behind Miranda Rights with conviction and great storytelling. Breslin leads this ensemble cast with confidence, reminding us that her Oscar nomination for Little Miss Sunshine was no fluke. Though Danner could have taken a more subtle approach in her visual cues, there’s no denying the lasting impact her feature will have given the origin of Miranda Rights. Even with the film’s simple style, this story is about one woman’s courage to tell her truth and get justice for herself, even if she had to face the Supreme Court to do so.\nMiranda's Victim will release in limited theaters and streaming on October 6. The film is 127 minutes and not rated.\nPatrice is a film/TV critic and editor based in southern California.

Netflix's critically acclaimed Bridgerton took the world by storm, bringing Julia Quinn's book series to life and serializing the loves, scandals, and adventures of the children of the late Viscount Bridgerton. The deep dive into the personal lives of Bridgerton's high society made the series a breakout hit. It quickly brought about the development of a second season, as well as the prequel limited series Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.\nAs of now, the Bridgerton universe's production company Shondaland has yet to confirm Queen Charlotte season 2. And although Bridgerton season 3 and 4 have been confirmed, solid release dates have yet to be established, leaving fans burning for more addictive narratives and historical romances of the 19th century. Fortunately, Bridgerton fans don't have to wait until those pesky, undisclosed release dates to enjoy another period piece. Apple TV+ will soon release its own historical drama, and it has the potential to win them over.\nApple recently released a trailer for its upcoming eight-episode drama The Buccaneers, and it promises to become one of several suitable replacements for Bridgerton to watch in the wait for season 3. The British series is set to premiere on the streaming platform on Wednesday, November 8. The Buccaneers will follow similar storylines and feature familiar themes from Shondaland's acclaimed Netflix series. The Buccaneers centers on a lively group of American girls who, despite rejecting the gender roles of high society in 1870s London, are shipped off to attend a debutante ball and secure suitors.\nLeading The Buccaneers' cast of characters is Sierra Burgess Is a Loser star Kristine Froseth as Nan St. George, 13 Reasons Why's Alisha Boe as Conchita Closson, and the Saved by the Bell reboot's Josie Totah as Mabel. The cast will also include Christina Hendricks (Mad Men), Imogen Waterhouse (The Irregulars), Josh Dylan (Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again), and Kate Winslet's daughter Mia Threapleton (I Am Ruth). Katherine Jakeways, writer of the British TV series Tracey Ullman's Show, serves as The Buccaneers' writer and creator, while Doctor Who alum Beth Willis serves as executive producer alongside Jakeways, George Faber, and Susanna White.\nHints from the trailer suggest fans of Bridgerton may find The Buccaneers a suitable replacement for several reasons. The Buccaneers will follow a group of young women as they balance their love/hate relationship to romance during the particularly confining period of the 1870s — so not long after Bridgerton's Regency era setting. The Buccaneers will tell its story quite similarly to Bridgerton, underlining the overall narrative with whirlwind romances, pushback against societal constructs, and exquisite fashions.\nThe Buccaneers' trailer might not reveal enough to convince fans to watch it in Bridgerton's stead, but period piece aficionados will be intrigued to know that Apple TV's new series is based on the unfinished, same-titled novel by Edith Wharton. Like Bridgerton and other successful period films and series — including Pride and Prejudice, Becoming Jane, and Outlander — The Buccaneers will be adapted from a source novel. The Buccaneers may not be the end-all, be-all for Shondaland fans. However, it holds promise and enough likeness to Bridgerton to pacify audiences until the highly anticipated season 3 releases.\n"}
{"title": "Breaking Bad Co-Creator Finally Reveals Details About New Show With Better Call Saul Star", "date": "2023-10-05 19:54:52", "text": "Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan is finally offering details on his highly-anticipated new series with Better Call Saul star Rhea Seehorn.\nBreaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan is finally shedding light on his new series with Better Call Saul star Rhea Seehorn. First announced in September of last year, the Apple TV+ Original reunites Gilligan with Seehorn, as the two worked together on Better Call Saul. The project has been described as a \"blended, grounded genre drama' and it has already nabbed a two-season straight-to-series order from the streamer. Gilligan will serve as executive producer and showrunner on Seehorn's first major television role since she ended her run as Kim Wexler, though plot details have been kept under wraps.\nIn a new interview with Variety, Gilligan pulls back the curtain on what to expect from his upcoming collaboration with Seehorn. The four-time Emmy winner was asked to shed some light on the Apple TV+ drama and mentioned that the story has a sci-fi component. Gilligan, who co-created Better Call Saul with Peter Gould, also stresses the new show is not connected to the Breaking Bad universe. He adds: \"The world changes very abruptly in the first episode, and then it is quite different.\" The full exchange is below:\nYeah! I wouldn’t call this heavy science fiction, I would call it mild science fiction. But it does have a sci-fi element to it, at its core. And there’s no crime, and no methamphetamine. It’s going to be fun and different. I have no prediction as to how folks to react to it — whether they’ll love it or hate it, or somewhere in the vast in-between. But I know it’s a story that interests me, and Rhea will be playing a very different character than she played on “Saul.” The weird thing is that it takes place in Albuquerque, except it’s a whole different world. There’s no overlap that I can see. She’s playing a character who is not Kim Wexler, but hopefully people will roll with that. I’m nervous. It’ll be interesting to see how folks react to it.\nThe world changes very abruptly in the first episode, and then it is quite different. It’s the modern world — the world we live in — but it changes very abruptly. And the consequences that that reaps hopefully provide drama for many, many episodes after that.\nPerhaps more than any other streaming service, Apple TV+ has gained the reputation of wanting to work with A-list talent on big and buzzy projects. But this is arguably the first time that the platform has put its resources behind a proven duo. Gilligan is one of the most popular writers in television, going back to his time on The X-Files. Seehorn, meanwhile, emerged as the beating heart of Better Call Saul and a phenomenal performer, with hopes that she will receive an overdue Emmy win for her performance as Kim Wexler.\nThe combination of the platform and the talent, both in front of and behind the camera, makes the upcoming show one to watch for. It'll be filmed in Albuquerque, the famous setting of the Breaking Bad world, and Gilligan mentions in the same interview that work on the project is set to ramp up again soon. It could be even more exciting when more details and castings are eventually shared.\nRelated: Better Call Saul Has 46 Nominations, But Hasn't Won A Single Emmy - That's Absurd\nSeehorn is Emmy-nominated for the second half of Better Call Saul. In comments before the actors' strike, the actor made no secret that she hopes to play Kim again someday. For now, her next endeavor with Breaking Bad creator has all the right components to capture attention once it finally debuts.\nSource: Variety\nAbdullah Al-Ghamdi joined Screen Rant in 2019.

Loki grapples with the warning He Who Remains gave him about his death, leading to a second multiverse war as he deals with the ever-expanding branches of the \"sacred timeline.\" With the help of new and familiar faces at the TVA, he will face questions about free will and the multiverse while also searching for Sylvie, Renslayer, and Miss Minutes.\nMichael Waldron created Loki, but Eric Martin stepped into the role of head writer for season 2. Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead join the series as the lead directing team for the second season, following Kate Herron's departure after the first. Loki features a star-studded cast led by Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson, Sophia Di Martino, Jonathan Majors, Wunmi Mosaku, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Tara Strong, and Eugene Cordero. Ke Huy Quan also joined the cast for the second season.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Breaks 2 MCU Trends That Have Defined The Last 10 Years\nScreen Rant spoke with Christine Wada, the costume designer for Loki season 2, about the new looks for the characters. She shared the inspiration for Victor Timely's look, OB's coveralls, and how both Loki and Sylvie have changed to reflect their journeys. Wada also revealed that the space suit worn by Mobius was a practical suit and a hilarious detail about Majors' Victor Timely costume.\nScreen Rant: You guys jump around from different genres and different eras. What was one of your favorite eras to explore in season 2?\nChristine Wada: 1970s. So fun. So fun and such a great way to transition us out of the TVA and then jump into that glamour world. Go from uniform to glamour was really fun. And I think it's a fun journey for characters like B-15 and to see her out of the armor and the uniform. It's great.\nWe do end up in a McDonald's there. How much research did you do with those old-school McDonald's outfits?\nChristine Wada: A lot. They're spot on. They are spot on. It comes from a catalog. Well, not a catalog. It actually comes from the handbook. So we really tried to stay as true and honest to that as possible. Yeah.\nYeah. One of the other ones that really jumped out to me was the World's Fair. Everything looks so incredibly detailed. Even the way it was shot was beautiful. Talk to me about designing the costumes for that sequence because there are a lot of folks wearing costumes from that era.\nChristine Wada: Yeah. That was, first of all, it was just interesting to try to make it feel like America in that era because of course we filmed in London, so a lot of the costumes are from Europe. And it's just American, adds some of that little Western vibe to it and a little less fitted because in Europe, everybody was really more, the collar was tight and everything was a little more trim. When you look at old American research, there's just a little more cowboy to it. So it's fun to do that and just designing it to sort of in a weird way, almost be a little bit like the TVA because it's still a uniform.\nWhen you go back to the 1890s, you realize that it's still kind of a uniform. There just wasn't as much choice, which I think is interesting when the season is somewhat about choice. We're going to this era where there really wasn't a lot of choice. So it's fun to play with that a little bit. So I really restricted the palette as much as I could and to try to think about how we see those past actual centuries. We see them sort of in black and white or as colorized photography. I thought it would be nice to sort of feed that into that episode.\nNow, Christine, Loki has evolved as a character from season 1 to season 2. I don't even think Thor would recognize this version of Loki at this point, but talk to me about what went into Loki's design this season evolving from last season.\nChristine Wada: He still, I think he needed to be tied to the TVA and all his relationships in the TVA. It's basically kind of assembling what would Loki do if he still wanted to have an attachment visually to the TVA, but Loki, the God, could create his own TVA uniform? So he still has the pants from season 1, but I think the jacket is definitely something that Loki would conjure up.\nHow much input does Tom Hiddleston have in the look of Loki?\nChristine Wada: Quite a bit. He's definitely... but input that is maybe not even verbal because I just think that there is a physicality to Tom that if you're paying attention, it dictates how you're going to design those costumes because his presence just brings a lot to the table. The way he performs brings a lot to the table. So, as a designer, like I said, I think if you're doing your homework, you can really take from a much more nuanced directive.\nI want to talk about Sylvie's look for a second because she's in a different point in season 2, but it's blending her Asgardian armor along with being more casual. What went into developing that for her?\nChristine Wada: There's so many different elements because you wanted her to feel like she picked up something from the 80s because she's really just trying to live a more real life, right? And I felt like her palette had to stay somewhat subdued because I just think she's just trying to blend in, but it also had to give her a swagger.\nAnd just from a really technical level of six episodes, it was also how do we keep Sylvie looking, how do we not make it campy or goofy for her to arrive in the 1890s in this 80s getup? Because I think the season is such an internal exploration of these characters that you want the costumes to be more vulnerable, and you don't want them to just stand out when they're going into these different environments in a way that's at all campy or jolting.\nIn Quantumania, we got introduced to Victor Timely, and we get his story expanded here in Loki season 2. Can you talk to me about designing Victor Timely's look and having that stand out from other variations of Kang the Conqueror?\nChristine Wada: Well, it was really inspired by Frederick Douglass. I think it's on the page. I think we're in the 1890s World Fair and I think if we stay true to what Loki is very successful at and really what makes it so fun to design is it always takes elements from real life. Even the TVA being grounded in the 60s and having some of the analog of the 60s. I just think it makes the show special and exciting and I think that with Victor Timely's character to have a real person be sort of our base role model just allowed us to design something that, he can only, he's just, yeah.\nThe subtleties of that character are phenomenal, even the small things he does.\nChristine Wada: Small things! Just the rise of the pant where the pant is and just the posture and even his handkerchief I embroidered with his initials. I actually made him real period underwear, so he could really feel like he was getting into the whole time period.\nKe Huy Quan might be my favorite new MCU character. OB is phenomenal. What went into designing his look and staying true to still with the TVA kind of aesthetic?\nChristine Wada: Well, it started, and I'd say production design has always been just so collaborative and something to cue off of. I remember Kasra [Farahani] talking about we were going to see these new areas of the TVA and having OB and his world feeling a little bit more like it's from the 40s or early 50s, right? And so that jumpsuit is, I pulled period jumpsuits from that era.\nThere's even that buckle, the high buckle in the back that is just very much a nod to those older periods and just doing all that work wear herringbone from that period. It was just trying to keep him a little more backdated and of course there were so many different iterations of that costume and so it really became this, well what are we trying to say that fits into this entire cohesive vision? So staying a little more period, a little more mechanical felt right.\nWhich character went through the most evolution from season 1 to season 2 and was the most challenging for you?\nChristine Wada: Wow, I would say that it really does have to be Sylvie even though Sylvie is oddly still wearing her armor from season 1. I just think it had to feel more vulnerable and more real and just taking the whole thing down a little bit. So, I think finding that sweet spot was hard, but then again working with the acting of Sophia is not hard so.\nOut of what we've seen in the first four episodes, can you tease anything that we would see visually that's coming up without giving a spoiler away? It's hard to tiptoe around that I feel like, right?\nChristine Wada: I don't think that I can. I don't know how to, and I would never want to spoil it because I think that it's so impactful what happens through this season that I would... I don't think I could say anything.\nI do have a question for you actually about the space suit. Is that a physical space suit or is that all a CG type of?\nChristine Wada: I love it. No, it's all practical and I have to say that's another thing that I think is really fun and special about Loki in particular is that we try very hard to do as much in camera as possible. Justin and Aaron were really great about that and so no, that's almost all practical. So we made a destructed version and we made so many different versions of it. So, it's all practical which wasn't easy, but it's modular, so it gave the actors some breathing room.\nOut of these costumes, which one is your favorite? I know it's like picking your favorite child.\nChristine Wada: I mean, right now I'm really, well I love the collar of Tom's. Come on. This is mean. This is mean. I love his collar. I love Sylvie's coat and I really love Renslayer so I'm sorry I can't keep it to one. I broke the rules.\nAlong with Mobius, Hunter B-15 and a team of new and returning characters, Loki navigates an ever-expanding and increasingly dangerous multiverse in search of Sylvie, Judge Renslayer, Miss Minutes and the truth of what it means to possess free will and glorious purpose.\nBe sure to also check out our interview with Loki season 2 executive producer Kevin Wright\nLoki season 2 debuts on Disney+ on October 5.\n"}
{"title": "What The Nightsisters Did To Morgan Elsbeth & Why She Didn't Look Like Them", "date": "2023-10-05 20:00:28", "text": "Morgan Elsbeth was transformed by the Great Mothers in Ahsoka’s season finale—but what exactly did they do to her, and did it lead to her death?\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nAhsoka’s season 1 finale was jam-packed with lore details and action sequences, but one of the more puzzling aspects of Ahsoka episode 8 was what happened to Nightsister Morgan Elsbeth. Elsbeth had proven to be a worthy foe for Ahsoka Tano and her apprentice Sabine Wren, and the more audiences saw of Lady Morgan, the more questions arose. The eventual appearance of the three Nightsister Great Mothers—Klothow, Aktropaw, and Lakesis—made Morgan’s story and background even more intriguing, as she answered their call across galaxies.\nThe Nightsisters of Dathomir were a race of witches who used magick to tap into the Force. However, their power resided in the dark side, though their magick remained unattainable for figures like Emperor Palpatine. The majority of the Nightsisters would be massacred in the final year of the Clone Wars, with General Grievous leading the attack on Dathomir that would decimate the Nightsister’s population. It’s known that Morgan Elsbeth was one of the survivors, and she aligned herself with Grand Admiral Thrawn and the Empire after the fall of the Republic in the pursuit of greater power.\nAhsoka episode 8 showed the Great Mothers reward Morgan Elsbeth with the “gift of shadows.” Morgan’s face was altered during the ceremony, with her eyes becoming all black. The Great Mothers essentially infused Morgan with ichor, which is also known as the power of the dark side. Morgan Elsbeth was already a formidable foe, but with this extra power and the Blade of Talzin, she was instantly more dangerous. Nightsister magick generally taps into the dark side of the Force, but this ritual to physically transform Morgan focuses that energy into a living being.\nIt's known from Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels that the Nightsisters of Dathomir, even after death, can affect the living world. Not only can the dead be resurrected—which was seen with the Night Troopers in Ahsoka episode 8—but the deceased Nightsisters can also possess living beings. This was seen in Rebels season 3 when Darth Maul lures Sabine Wren and Kanan Jarrus to Dathomir. Elsbeth’s transformation makes her not only look more like other Nightsisters audiences have seen in Star Wars canon, but also infuses her with a similar kind of communal magick she couldn’t access beforehand.\nRelated: When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline\nAfter Morgan Elsbeth was given the gift of the shadows, her power significantly increased. When Morgan first appeared in The Mandalorian season 2, it was a challenge for Ahsoka Tano to beat her, but the former Jedi would eventually come out victorious. However, when the two dueled again in the Ahsoka season 1 finale, the combatants were far more evenly matched. In fact, the duel was seemingly decided when the reincarnated Night Troopers appeared to help Elsbeth finish off Ahsoka. The only reason Morgan lost to Ahsoka was because Sabine Wren chose not to join Ezra Bridger aboard Grand Admiral Thrawn’s ship.\nThe Blade of Talzin also contributed to Morgan Elsbeth’s growth of power. With the sword being a relic of the Nightsisters, she was able to quickly master the weapon that appeared with green flames on the metal blade. While the Blade of Talzin is not a lightsaber, it could deflect the Jedi weapon like beskar and even cut through one of Ahsoka's hilts. If the sword is a kind of Force-infused weapon, then for the Nightsisters, the Blade of Talzin may be their own version of a lightsaber, though it is only bestowed on a certain few.\nOne of the most important parts of Morgan Elsbeth’s transformation at the beginning of Ahsoka episode 8 was the oath she swore before the Great Mothers gifted her. Audiences familiar with the Nightsisters from The Clone Wars may have noticed that the oath Morgan swore was the same that Mother Talzin had Asajj Ventress recite when she was welcomed back into the coven on Dathomir. This shows that Morgan was likely already familiar with the oath, and that it demanded a commitment to her sisters and to the Nightsister community as a whole.\nThere could be a good reason why Thrawn was quick to have Morgan be the one left behind, and that is because of the oath she took. Part of the oath was swearing to abandon her old life, and that likely included loyalty to Thrawn. If Morgan had pledged herself to the Nightsisters, Thrawn easily could’ve seen this as her no longer being fully on his side. For someone who inspires such loyalty from his troops—so much so that Night Troopers volunteered to die and become zombies—it’s not hard to see why Thrawn would be wary of an oath like this.\nRelated: Why Grand Admiral Thrawn Goes To Dathomir In Ahsoka Episode 8\nIt's likely that when Morgan Elsbeth took this oath, she knew she was entering into a deeper level of commitment to the communal magick of the Nightsisters. By taking the oath, Morgan was essentially getting baptized as a stronger member of the Nightsister clan. Not only did she swear her allegiance to the Nightsisters, but she vowed to put the needs of the whole community above all else. She was no longer seen as an individual survivor, but part of a sisterhood. For someone like Grand Admiral Thrawn, who had instilled such a sense of loyalty throughout his ranks, he could’ve viewed this oath and subsequent transformation as problematic for his goals.\nWhile the loss of a villain like Morgan Elsbeth is a blow for Thrawn's cause, the three Great Mothers will certainly reveal more about their larger plan and how their magick works in Ahsoka season 2. With Thrawn willing to sacrifice a loyal servant like Morgan, a potential change in dynamic with the Great Mothers could be in store with the antagonists all back in the main Star Wars galaxy. Ahsoka scratched the surface of what the Great Mothers are capable of, and future stories can allow them to demonstrate their power in ways Morgan Elsbeth never could.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "'All of Manhattan Became Mutants': TMNT's Original Plan for Mutant Town Was Much Darker", "date": "2023-10-05 20:00:28", "text": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles writer/artist Sophie Campbell reveals the Mutant Town was supposed to be so much darker ahead of her upcoming TMNT #150. \nMutant Town is a relatively new addition to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles lore, but one that has become integral to the wider story, as it makes the established universe feel so much fuller while also creating nearly limitless future story potential. While Mutant Town is unarguably a good thing within TMNT canon, it was originally supposed to be way darker, and the creative mind behind Mutant Town, Sophie Campbell, said so herself ahead of the conclusion to her run on TMNT.\nMutant Town was created after the events of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #98 when the TMNT's mutant extremist group called the Mighty Mutanimals led by the anthropomorphic cat-mutant and prominent TMNT villain Old Hob set off a mutagen bomb in the middle of a crowd in New York City, mutating every human in that general vicinity. While there were some outlying mutants who popped up in later stories who weren’t in the immediate area - given that the mutagen was airborne - it was only a relatively small number of mutants that were created that day, though more than enough to give the City of New York cause for alarm. In response, the newly-elected Mayor Baxter Stockman decided to wall-off a portion of the city where the mutants could live separate from humanity. This happened in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #101, which was Sophie Campbell’s debut issue. And now, Campbell reflects on the choices she made with the development of TMNT's Mutant Town, including the original scale of the walled-off portion of New York City.\nIn an interview with CBR, Sophie Campbell discussed the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #150, as that issue will mark the end of her run on IDW Publishing’s TMNT comic book series. While talking about what fans can expect, Campbell touched on how her storyline began, most notably Mutant Town. She spoke about what aspects of Mutant Town she was proud of, while also revealing what could have been.\nCampbell: Originally, I had wanted to expand the mutagen bomb effects and have the entirety of Manhattan become mutants and have the city walled off like Escape from New York, but we ended up scaling it back, which I think was the right way to go.\nSophie Campbell also explained how Mutant Town impacted the Ninja Turtles personally, not just in terms of the wider universe.\nCampbell: It was an opportunity to do a whole brave new world for the Turtles – a situation they’d never been in. They could finally mingle with other people without having to hide. They could finally have real lives in a real community.\nThese quotes outline two very different versions of Mutant Town. Given the reference to Escape from New York, it seems the original idea for it was something more akin to a controlled post-apocalyptic wasteland behind tall, unbreachable walls. That gives one an image of the Ninja Turtles filling the narrative role of Snake Plissken, carefully traversing the dangerous area, taking down mutant crime lords and kicking butt along the way. It’s a cool thought based on an ambitious idea, but definitely a dark flip for the Turtles that would have ultimately only served to separate them further from humanity, which is the opposite of what the canonical Mutant Town actually did. The Mutant Town TMNT fans got was the culmination of everything the Turtles had ever wanted up until that point. Sure, they hated that so many people were displaced and mutated, but in the end, everyone came together to form a tight-knit community where everyone belonged and no one was judged based on their physical appearance.\nNo longer did the Turtles have to hide in the shadows and live in the streets. In Mutant Town, they were respected community leaders, law enforcement officers, and even a reliable new source. Sophie Campbell created a home for the Turtles with Mutant Town, which - based on this interview - is a far cry from the ‘Escape from New York’-esque prison they almost got, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ Mutant Town was reportedly supposed to be way darker.\nSource: CBR\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

The idea of an adult movie about the iconic purple dinosaur is intriguing, especially to those who fondly look back on the character's role in their childhoods. Additionally, Barbie's remarkable performance demonstrates how Barney could make just as strong an impact. Still, the early word on this upcoming film gives some cause for concern.\nBarney is still in the very early stages of production, so Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz was reluctant to provide much information about the plot or angle of the film (via Screen Rant). He did confirm that this adaptation of the popular Barney & Friends franchise would be aimed at adults but wouldn't come with an R rating. This indicates it will be more like Barbie (rated PG-13) than a graphic reimagining like Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey. Overall, this is good news. However, Kreiz followed this up by stating that Barney \"will not be an odd movie,\" which, considering Barbie's oddness, is a somewhat concerning revelation.\nRELATED: Barney: Confirmation, Release Date Prediction & Everything We Know About Daniel Kaluuya's Adult-Focused Movie\nMattel's Barbie was undoubtedly full of wholesome, heartwarming, and societally impactful moments, but it was, at its core, an odd movie. The story was charming, but the film was absolutely absurd between Ryan Gosling's \"I'm Just Ken\" musical number and Kate McKinnon's Weird Barbie character. Considering Barbie was such a success, it seems Mattel would want to stick with a similar formula with Barney, and that means making things a little weird.\nAs a story about a purple dinosaur toy that comes to life and plays with school children all day, there is virtually no way to create an adult-aimed film that adequately pays homage to Barney while remaining serious. Of course, this also comes down to Kreiz's idea of what is or is not \"odd.\" It's possible the Mattel CEO was trying to say that audiences shouldn't expect a version of Barney that is dark or obscene. Regardless, the choice of words here, combined with the company's upcoming content plan, seems to imply that Mattel completely misunderstood what made Barbie so popular with audiences to begin with.\nBarbie was a massive box office success, with a worldwide gross of about $1.4 billion, making it the top movie of 2023. This has led Mattel to buckle down on the toy angle by announcing several similar movies in the works. Along with Barney, we can expect projects featuring American Girl Dolls, Hot Wheels, Thomas the Tank Engine, and much more. Though this is great for nostalgia, it reveals just how much Mattel has missed the point, and this is only furthered by the CEO's comments about Barney.\nRELATED: Barbie's Success Redeems Margot Robbie's 3-Movie Long Box Office Losing Streak\nThough Barbie certainly resonated with audiences who enjoyed playing with the various dolls back in the day, it was the impactful themes relating to society and the wacky comedy that made the film a success. There are countless ways that Greta Gerwig could have gone wrong with this movie, but by keeping things fun but layered with important concepts, Barbie was elevated to a new level. An adult-aimed, not \"odd\" Barney adaptation would prove that this went right over Mattel's head and would be a significant disappointment to audiences who genuinely want to see more projects like Barbie.\n"}
{"title": "Crunchyroll's Newest Hit Exposes Anime's Flawed Relationship to Videogames", "date": "2023-10-05 20:00:28", "text": "As fun as Shangri La Frontier is, its written game mechanics once more are used to inflate the protagonist's powers, rather than build a world.\nShangri La Frontier's first episode, released on Crunchyroll, is fun and visually dynamic, yet it also sets itself up for making the same blunders every video game-based anime setting does. Despite having a better sense of how a player interacts with a game, it's wasted on bolstering its protagonist's \"specialness\". In the low-stakes world of an MMO, it feels like an unnecessary and, therefore, tired piece of storytelling.\nRakuro \"Sunraku\" Hizutome speaks and acts like a gamer; that isn't in question. However, many of his banal stunts feel too self-congratulatory, making the anime give in to the all too onerous clichés of the overpowered fantasy hero. This is a shame since Shangri La Frontier otherwise has deserved moments of levity, and of course, beautifully drawn action scenes.\nRelated: 10 Best Anime Inspired By Video Games\nMany anime protagonists these days are now reliant on some quirk - optionally one leading to ostracization - becoming the core ability that lifts them up to godlike power by the end of the story. In Hizutome's case, his hobby of playing shovelware games is so mundane it's ludicrous writers want to convince fan this is a talent, yet Shangri La Frontier insists it is. Besides skills finely honed from playing glitchy entertainment, Sunraku's Shangri La avatar - a man wearing only underwear and a bird mask - is treated as an outside-the-box strategy that only he, the \"Trash Game King\", could have envisioned.\nUnfortunately, in 2023 this is all standard gamer tradition to the point of banality. A gamer subjecting themselves to \"trash games\" is likely to be livestreaming their antics. Meanwhile, wearing inappropriate outfits, or any at all, is just a way to raise hell or a self-appointed challenge to kill a boss while at the risk of dying in one hit. Even Sunraku's \"genius\" tactic of dumping his allotted skill points into Luck is nothing groundbreaking. Yet because Shangri La tries so earnestly to pretend its protagonist is some unparalleled genius, it only makes his skills come across as artificial.\nShangri La Frontier can be genuinely amusing when it actually talks about gaming itself. When someone complains about useless AI-controlled characters or skips a game's introductory cutscene, it's funny because it's true to life. While the hero's misadventures briefly mention them, ultimately the game exists just to glorify him, not video gaming itself.

{"title": "Severance Season 2: Release Date Prediction, Delays & Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-05 20:00:29", "text": "Here's what we know about Apple TV+'s Severance season 2, including returning cast, release info, and plot threads from the season 1 finale.\nSeverance season 2 is on the way to Apple TV+, although despite being confirmed for a while the future of the show is still uncertain. Created by Dan Erickson and produced by Ben Stiller, the first season of Severance ended on a dramatic cliffhanger, which more than set up season 2. Severance gradually revealed its dystopian science fiction world, in which the cult-like Lumon Corporation uses a technology called Severance to separate an employee's memories and personalities into two: an innie for the workplace, and an outie for the outside world, with both having no access to the other's experiences.\nSeverance was a breakout success for Apple TV+, thanks in no small part to the intriguing and mysterious premise spawning a number of Severance fan theories. Severance saw the four severed innies of the Macro-Data Refinement department grow more curious and resentful of the system they are a part of. However, the first chapter of the story was clearly just the beginning as nothing was close to being resolved where the show left off, meaning anticipation for the delayed Severance season 2 remains incredibly high.\nNews on Severance season 2 has been quiet throughout most of 2023. However, this is largely due to production shutting down in May due to the commencement of the WGA screenwriters going on strike (via Deadline). Since no work has been carried out on the show since — and with the cast themselves going on strike when the still-ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike began — it's unsurprising there have not been any updates from Apple or Severance producer Ben Stiller.\nThe WGA strikes were resolved on September 27, 2023. While SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP have yet to reach an agreement talks are ongoing, and the dispute is expected to be resolved by the end of 2023 (though this isn't a guarantee). It's possible that production on the show could resume once the strikes are completely resolved, which means the long-awaited Severance season 2 release date could be announced, or at least given a speculative window by Apple TV+, shortly after.\nSeverance season 2 is confirmed, with Apple announcing the renewal in August 2022 (via Variety).  Reports came in April 2023 of behind-the-scenes delays due to drama between Severance showrunners Dan Erickson and Mark Friedman were addressed by Ben Stiller who assured fans the second season was still going ahead.\nUnfortunately, Apple has yet to announce a release date for Severance season 2. Production began in October 2022 but was delayed indefinitely when production on the second season of Severance shut down due to the WGA and then SAG-AFTRA strikes in May 2023. While the WGA has since resolved its dispute with the AMPTP, and SAG-AFTRA is expected to within a few weeks, Apple has yet to offer an updated release date for Severance season 2. It's likely that, until the SAG-AFTRA strikes are officially resolved, production cannot continue. A 2024 or even 2025 release date seems like the most probable outcome for Severance as of October 2023.\nThe cast of Severance season 2 will mostly be made up of returning faces from the first chapter of the quirky Apple TV+ sci-fi. Adam Scott (Step Brothers) will once more lead the cast as Mark, with Patricia Arquette (Medium) returning as Harmony. Provided there are no unexpected exits between now and when the release date for Severance season 2 arrives, the cast will include:\nThere have also been eight new cast members added for Severance season 2 in undisclosed roles (via Variety). The new Severance cast members in the third season will include Gwendoline Christie (The Sandman), Alia Shawkat (Arrested Development), Bob Balaban (The French Dispatch), Merrit Wever (Godless), Robby Benson (Beauty and the Beast), Stefano Carannante (Mirabilia), John Noble (The Lord of the Rings), and Ólafur Darri Ólafsson (The Tourist). There's been no hints or teases when it comes to the characters these cast members are playing, however.\nThere haven't been any concrete reveals regarding the Severance season 2 story, but the first season left some teases to set it up. The final episode of Severance season 1 sees the innies gain control of themselves outside the office using the Overtime Contingency built into their Lumon Severance Chips. Their actions in the world will be hard to undo, including Mark telling his sister Devon about the abuse going on at Lumon, Helly — who's apparently an Eagan — publicly denouncing Severance at a Lumon gala, and Irving trying to meet up with Burt. Cobel promised Helly punishment for her actions, and Severance season 2 is likely to see Lumon trying to respond to MDR's rebellion without compromising their outies.\nThere are also a number of mysteries surrounding Lumon that Severance season 2 could shed more light on. These include what happened to Mark's wife Gemma, who reappeared in the Lumon workspace as Ms. Casey, why Lumon has a room of baby goats in Severance, and the company's larger ambitions with the Severance Chips, hinted at in Helly's conversation with her father.\nSeverance season 2 could also explore more of its outies' lives, including the bizarre clues regarding Irving's outside life. Moreover, in Severance creator Dan Erickson's Reddit AMA on April 2022, while fielding viewer questions, Erickson implied that Helena Eagan would be the villain of Severance season 2, and that there might be levels to the Severance procedure.\n\nRob Hutton is a feature writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "8 MCU Heroes We Think Will Get A Happy Ending", "date": "2023-10-05 20:10:31", "text": "The MCU has had its fair share of tragic deaths so far, but a lucky few characters seem like they may actually find some kind of happy ending.\nEvery MCU hero will eventually have to have their stories come to a close, and there are several who seem like prime candidates for a happy ending. By its very nature as an action movie franchise, the Marvel Cinematic Universe involves a great deal of death and destruction. Furthermore, as the stories being told focus on those able and willing to stand up and fight, many have already found their end in a tragic manner. Assuredly, many more will follow suit in the MCU Phases 5 and 6 films.\nHowever, though several heroes have died tragically, involvement as a hero in the MCU doesn't cement one's fate or guarantee one won't be able to find happiness. Already, several iconic characters have ended their stories without tragedy, retiring or dying a good death after a life well lived. Of all the characters currently living in the MCU, these seem most likely to find a similarly happy ending.\nClint Barton, aka Hawkeye, has undergone his fair share of pain and suffering, losing his family in The Blip and later having to witness the sacrifice of Natasha Romanoff, perhaps his closest friend, on Vormir for the Soul Stone. He also spent dark time as the violent vigilant Ronin, which is still, in ways, haunting him. However, things actually look fairly bright for Hawkeye's future MCU timeline. Things seem in perfect position for the Avenger's sharp-shooter to finally retire - his family is back and safe, and Kate Bishop is ready to carry on the Hawkeye mantle. Hopefully, Clint can retire and enjoy some much-earned peace.\nIn many ways, Steve Rogers already got the perfect MCU ending. After an incredibly tumultuous life split in half by his suspended animation in the Arctic, it seemed difficult to imagine how Steve could ever relax and step back from superheroics. Endgame's time travel presented such an opportunity, allowing him to live the life with Peggy Carter he always wanted. However, despite his absence from the MCU, Steve Rogers is still alive - somewhere. It's possible that he could be revisited despite being quite an old man, but it seems most likely that the MCU will let his Endgame closure ride.\nHulk may seem like the last MCU character destined for a happy ending, but his current station in the franchise at least presents the opportunity. While Bruce Banner and the Hulk originally had a combative relationship as they vied for control of one body, the two have somehow come to an agreement and have merged. Hulk also has several MCU replacements at the ready, including his niece, She-Hulk, and his son, Skaar. Something could easily go wrong, and Hulk could devolve back into something more savage, but it's equally likely that Bruce steps out of the spotlight and lets other Hulks do the smashing.\nA year ago, Ant-Man seemed high on the list of heroes most likely to die in the MCU Phase 5 or 6. Not only did Quantumania close his trilogy, but it also introduced the Multiverse Saga's big bad - Kang the Conqueror. It seemed to make sense that Scott might die to assert Kang as a threat, especially with Hope and his daughter, Cassie, able to carry on his role as a Pym-powered Avenger. However, that didn't come to pass, and if the MCU spared what was a perfectly set-up death, it may be possible that it's because they want him to survive the franchise.\nPeter Parker is famous for never finding lasting happiness in the pages of Marvel Comics, but the MCU can finally give him a happy life with loved ones. Tom Holland's upcoming Spider-Man trilogy is likely his last, and it's starting Peter Parker out on an incredibly low note. It seems unlikely the new trilogy will start low and drop even lower, but there's another reason Peter may live on after his time as Spider-Man. The wonderful Spider-Verse movies have famously covered the death of Peter Parker, and if Miles comes to live action, the MCU may not want to repeat a story people have seen so recently.\nWhile Tony Stark was still alive, Rhodey seemed more at risk, as it's a classic superhero trope to use the death of a friend to motivate another hero. How, though, there doesn't seem to be anyone close enough with Rhodey to warrant his death as a narrative device. After Secret Invasion's ending revealed that Rhodey had been a Skrull for an indeterminate amount of time, the Avenger may commit himself even more to politics, trying to instigate change through more traditional means. Especially if Thunderbolt Ross continues to butt heads with The Avengers, the team may want a powerful ally on the political inside.\nSince his apparent death in Captain America: The First Avenger, Bucky Barnes has had nothing but struggle in his life. Brainwashed by Hyrdra and used as a mindless assassin, the now-free Bucky has to deal with both his own guilt and the fallout of actions that weren't in any way his fault or choice. At this point, giving Bucky a tragic death would simply be one more piece of pain on an already tall stack. Letting him finally find true peace is by far the most exciting way to end his story, though he'll have to survive Thunderbolts first.\nGiven that Loki started out as a villain and would-be dictator of Earth, it's impressive that he's seemingly earned himself a happy ending. Time will tell what the MCU has in store for the God of Mischief in Loki season 2, but having him meet a tragic end would feel disappointingly repetitively. Loki's death at the hands of Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War was tragic and narratively effective, and the same thing can't happen again. Perhaps somehow Loki and Sylvie can find a way to be happy together, perhaps even in control of their own more heroic TVA moving forward in the MCU.\n"}
{"title": "15 Best Detective Series On Netflix", "date": "2023-10-05 20:20:28", "text": "Crime drama has never quite looked like this: the 15 best detective series' airing on Netflix filled with anticipation, suspense, and mystery. \nNetflix is home to a wide variety of crime dramas which keep audiences on their toes as they try to eagerly predict the story's conclusion. With the popularity of this genre soaring, Netflix has consistently delivered engaging and thought-provoking detective series. Whether it's in a big city or a small town, a crime or investigation can go anywhere, and more often than not, no character is safe.\nFor crime drama enthusiasts, it may feel that all available storylines have been exhausted. However, 2023 has seen a wave of new releases for Netflix, including new episodes of viewer favorites Luther and season 5 of Top Boy. Netflix also saw a huge audience response to the release of Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story in 2022, and the streaming giant is clearly keen to grow its impact within the genre by producing more riveting detective series.\nFeaturing eccentric American star James Spader, The Blacklist is a crime thriller series that follows a wanted fugitive as he assists the FBI in catching deadly criminals. This fast-paced mystery was praised for its overall entertainment, and Spader's incredible performance added an extra layer of tension to the screen. Despite some elements that require a suspension of disbelief and comedic moments that feel out of place, The Blacklist was generally positively received and well-worth watching.\nThe psychological drama Mindhunter follows two FBI agents in a unique take on the 1955 non-fiction book Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit. The show ran for three seasons, but Mindhunter was canceled in 2023. The one silver lining of Mindhunter's cancellation is it means that viewers can now binge every episode on Netflix. Unlike other shows that revolve around the FBI, Mindhunter follows a research project trying to understand the in-depth psyche of serial killers, rather than being out in the field, offering a unique perspective on real-world practices.\nIn The Sinner, Bill Pullman plays Detective Harry Ambrose, who focuses on crimes committed by surprising and typically unlikely culprits, trying to work out the motivation that led to their crimes. The show started as an eight-part miniseries, but due to an overwhelmingly positive response, the series was commissioned for a further three seasons. The Sinner also received multiple nominations for several awards while it was airing, including a Golden Globe nomination for Best Miniseries or Television Film.\nRelated: 10 Best Crime Movies On Netflix\nLupin is a retelling of the story of fictional French thief Arsène Lupin, created by author Maurice Leblanc. Lupin follows Assane Diop, a young thief who models himself after Arsène Lupin. The French language drama was watched by seventy-six million people in its first month, making it the most popular non-English language show on Netflix at that time (per The Hollywood Reporter). The show was then renewed for two further installments, the latest airing in October 2023, with no announcements for further episodes at this time.\nStarring David Tennant and Stanley Tucci, Inside Man tells the intense story of two very different people whose lives end up intercrossing: a prisoner in the United States, currently on death row, and a woman trapped in the cellar of an old, English vicarage. Tennant's performance is laced with anticipation and drama, and the dark themes throughout have the occasional comedic moment, although the ending of Inside Man proves somewhat confusing.\nStarring EGOT winner Viola Davis, How to Get Away with Murder made an incredible impact upon its initial release in 2014. The show ran for six years and finished in 2020. It follows Davis' character Annalise Keating, a defense attorney based in Philadelphia who, alongside five of her students, manages to get caught up in a murder plot. Davis' performance earned her a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, making her the first black woman to ever win the award (per NPR).\nRelated: How To Get Away With Murder: 15 Shows To Watch If You Love This Series\nWhen the stories of a suburban mother, a photographer, and a detective overlap, the mystery of missing father Stewart Green begins to rear its head once again, seventeen years after his disappearance in Stay Close. The Netflix detective series is based on the novel of the same name by author Harlan Coben. Coben has adapted more of his crime novels for Netflix, including Safe and The Stranger which also rank highly among the best detective series on Netflix.\nFour-part criminal thriller Collateral stars The Great Gatsby's Carey Mulligan as DI Kip Glaspie, who is thrown into the murder investigation of a delivery driver in South West London. Set across four days, the gripping British drama interweaves the lives of several seemingly unconnected characters. Collateral does a great job of making a comment on societal structures, while still focusing on the mystery at its core.\nAnother international detective series from Netflix, Deadwind is a Finnish crime drama that follows Detective Sofia Karppi who returns to work following the very sudden and accidental death of her husband. Upon her immediate return, Sofia is thrown into a murder investigation of a woman with suspicious connections to a construction company, while still having to raise her two children by herself. Deadwind has a gripping story that elevates it to one of Netflix's strongest outings.\nThe comedy-mystery Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency is based on the book of the same name, which was inspired by two episodes of Doctor Who written by the author Douglas Adams. It was then adapted for television in 2010, but only lasted for two years before it was adapted once again by BBC America and Netflix in 2016. However, the show was canceled again less than a year on the air. Despite this, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency is light and funny, laced with darker elements throughout, but it is generally more of a feel good watch compared to other detective series.\nSatirical crime mockumentary American Vandal ran for two seasons, with each one covering a ridiculous crime in full seriousness, as two high schoolers try and find the culprit. American Vandal was highly praised for its commitment to replicating the tension found in real crime documentaries but still layered in dry humor. Unfortunately, Netflix canceled American Vandal season 3, but the producers announced their hopes to move the show to elsewhere in the future.\nThe German miniseries Dear Child arrived on Netflix in September 2023 and was immediately praised for how it tackles the topic of child abduction. The show follows Lena, who manages to escape thirteen years of captivity, having birthed a son and a daughter in this time. At the same time as these events, other decades-old disappearances start to be dusted off by authorities who suspect a connection. Intense and distressing, Dear Child is a gripping and fast-paced thriller ideal for audiences who enjoyed Broadchurch.\nAnother French drama, The Forest follows the arrest of a teacher after her student disappears in the same forest that she has a suspicious history with. The series aired in France and Belgium in 2017, before being broadcast internationally on Netflix in 2018, running as a mini-series spanning six fifty-seven-minute episodes. The series was generally well-received, with criticisms leveled at some outlandish moments in the plot. While season 1 is solid overall, the show was not renewed for another season.\nRelated: 15 Famous TV Detectives, Ranked By Intelligence\nSet in a small, Midwestern town in the United States, Dare Me follows the story of competitive high school cheerleading, as the squad gets caught up in a mess of anxious secrets and panic when they meet their new coach, Colette French. Dare Me, based on the 2012 novel of the same name by Megan Abbott (who is also co-developer of the show), lasted only one season before being canceled by Netflix less than one month after it finished airing. Despite its cancelation, the show was generally well-received by critics, earning an 85% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\nBased on a real-life news article from 2015, Unbelievable follows the arrest of a young girl accused of lying about being assaulted and the two detectives who discovered the very complicated truth. The series received huge critical acclaim, and has an incredible 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and just thirty-four days after its release, Netflix announced the miniseries had been watched by over thirty-two million viewers (via X). Unbelievable was praised for its grittiness and realism, as well as the gripping performances from the cast.\nSources: The Hollywood Reporter, NPR, Rotten Tomatoes, @netflix/X\nRebecca is an experienced freelance writer from the UK, with two degrees focussing on narrative design and characterisation, as well as being a doctoral candidate on the discussion of the wider public's understanding of minority groups and the issues they live with, through mainstream television, film, and video games. \n\nIn her spare time, you'll find her with her cats, a cup of coffee, and gaming."}
{"title": "10 Tiny Decisions In Baldur's Gate 3 That Have Huge Story Implications", "date": "2023-10-05 20:31:26", "text": "Baldur's Gate 3 is filled with choices big and small, but some of the tiniest decisions can lead to story-changing outcomes, both good and bad.\nBaldur’s Gate 3 has impressed everyone with its complex and interweaving story, where even the tiniest of decisions can have an impact on the plot. In a world with so many places to explore and characters to meet, it’s little wonder that sometimes the smallest things can lead to unforeseen consequences. From unexpected quests to surprising allies for the final battle, Baldur’s Gate 3 really does deliver on the promise that choices matter.\n[Warning: This article contains spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3.]\nBaldur’s Gate 3 hurtles straight into the action, with the player character immediately fending off an apparent mind flayer plot. Throughout their journey, right the way through to the end of Baldur’s Gate 3, it is up to the party to navigate the complex world and save Faerûn. Whether it be speaking to a particular NPC, handing over an item to the wrong person or exploring secret areas in Baldur’s Gate 3, there is always something new to uncover.\nRelated: \"An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas\": Baldur's Gate 3 Review\nUsually, poking around someone’s home or private space isn’t a good idea, but there are some interesting things to be learned about Kagha for those to happen to be a little more inquisitive. Sneaking around the library just off the main area with Kagha and Rath will reveal that tucked behind a bookcase is Kagha’s secret personal chest. Unlocking it will reveal a note and a book that starts a new quest to investigate the Grove’s latest leader. This new question puts Kagha’s actions into context and opens up new dialogue not just when she is confronted but also when Halsin returns.\nA simple act of kindness can lead to something much more beneficial, especially where the tiefling children are concerned. Helping any of the kids while in the Druid Grove, such as saving Arabella from Kagha or Mirkon from the harpies, will get the party an invitation to meet Mol. Mol has taken the rest of the orphaned children under her wing and will offer her thanks for helping them as well as make herself available as a vendor. Even better though, helping the kids will mean that Mol likes you, which comes in handy at the start of Act 2, where she will speak up for the party to Jaheira when first arriving at the Last Light Inn.\nSpeak with animals is an amazing spell taken to brilliant new levels in Baldur’s Gate 3. Every animal has something to say and all wonderfully voice acted. While speaking with the various animals found along the Sword Coast will often provide extra insight into the world, the strange ox in the Druid Grove is something else entirely. This peculiar beast is clearly not what it seems, but speaking to it at first will yield no answers.\nRelated: How To Talk To Animals in Baldur's Gate 3\nIt is only after running into this particular ox again in Act Two that more knowledge is gained, with the ox giving the party terrible flashbacks to its crimes. However, the real twist comes in Act 3 when the ox requests passage into Baldur’s Gate in apple form. Doing this will gain the party not only Shapeshifter's Boon Ring, which pairs well with the Mask of the Shapeshifter to give +1d4 bonus to all ability checks, but the ox will also appear just before the final battle with the Netherbrain as an unexpected ally.\nWhen first entering the Druid Grove in Act 1, the party will come across three siblings having an argument about whether or not to stay. The sister, Lia, wants to stay and help fight, while Rolan wants to leave. Here, the party can intervene and take a side; however, if Lia is sided with, more quests will be available further into Baldur’s Gate 3.\nIn Act Two, Rolan can be met again, where it is revealed that he helped save the tiefling children from the cultists of the Absolute. His siblings have been taken, though, and if they are rescued, and Rolan survives the Shadow-Cursed Lands, he can be met again in Act Three. This time, Rolan will be working in Lorrokan’s shop and can be persuaded to turn on his new master if his siblings were saved in Act 2. Strangely, in the simple act of settling an argument between siblings, children are saved, and a new ally can be gained.\nVenturing into an owlbear cave might not seem like the best of ideas, but any party determined to explore every inch of the map in Act 1 will no doubt have stumbled across this area. Inside a mother owlbear will fiercely protect her young, and the sensible thing to do might be to leave before a fight starts. However, if the mother is killed, then her baby can be found again at the Goblin Camp, where he can be coaxed into joining the team and following the party to camp. Doing so not only gives the group one of the cutest characters that can join the camp but also a great boost in the final battle in Act 3.\nRomances play a significant part in Baldur's Gate 3, with there even being options for polyamory. However, two characters who are most definitely not willing to share with each other are Lae'zel and Shadowheart. One decision to be careful with for those planning to romance the cleric of Shar is that any 'evenings' with Lae'zel could complicate this. Lae'zel will be very forward with her intentions toward the player character, and it is possible to sleep with her before forming a deeper relationship. However, doing so will lock out Shadowheart from being romanced if the relationship is not ended before the camp celebration in Act 1.\nWhen arriving in the Last Light Inn at the very beginning of Act 2, the party will almost immediately be sent to speak with Isobel, a cleric of Selune, by Jaheira. This seems like a simple matter of getting her blessing before venturing out into the Shadow-Cursed Land. However, speaking to Isobel will trigger an attack by the Absolute’s forces, led by former Flaming Fist Marcus.\nAs the Inn itself will be the focus of the attack, there are many NPCs crammed in there who can die during the fight, such as Rolan, Art Cullagh, and even Halsin, and this can lead to some quests ending prematurely. There is also the issue of Isobel herself; if she is killed or knocked out during the battle, it will doom everyone in the area as the shield keeping the curse at bay will fall. So, while chatting with Isobel might seem like the obvious choice, it is best to avoid her room to keep everyone safe in the long run.\nWhen venturing into the Mountain Pass area, the party will meet Lady Esther, a member of the Society of Brilliance, who will ask the party to retrieve a githyanki egg for her. There are a few ways to complete this quest by either giving her what she wants or giving her an owlbear egg. However, if either egg is handed over, the Society of Brilliance in Baldur’s Gate is doomed as both the hatched githyanki or the owlbear will kill everyone in their lodge.\nThere is a chance to visit a Zhentarim hideout during Act 1 and meet a captured artist named Oskar. He will thank the party for their assistance if freed and promise a reward when they finally reach Baldur’s Gate. This seems to be the end of it; however, when Oskar is met again in Act 3, things have gone terribly wrong.\nRescuing Oskar can snowball into a much longer questline, which will lead the party to cross paths with the Mystic Carrion, a mummy lord living in Baldur’s Gate. This, in turn, will lead to its own quest as some of the Mystic’s servants have run away. There is some great loot and lore from both of these questlines that all start with one chat in Act 1.\nOne of the smallest decisions in Baldur’s Gate 3 that can lead to massive implications is Raphael’s deal in Act 3. While the choice to free Prince Orpheus or help the Emperor might seem like a big decision, on the grand cosmic scale, it isn’t that important. Both will aid the party in much the same way when facing the Netherbrain.\nHowever, it is what Raphael wants that makes this decision’s consequences matter. In exchange for the Orphic Hammer, Raphael wants the Crown of Karsus and he makes it very clear that he wishes to rule the Nine Hells. An after-credits cutscene with Raphael further drives home the true implications of this decision as it becomes obvious that Raphael has no intention of stopping with the Nine Hells, meaning that the hero of Baldur’s Gate 3 has doomed millions with the stroke of a pen.\n"}

One cackling villain ups the ante and creates even more copies of himself during his final showdown with his copycat.\nWarning! Spoilers ahead for The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #11!Fans who thought three Jokers were enough might want to prepare themselves. As two Clown Princes of Crime wage war, one goes all out by making an entire army of grinning doppelgangers with a devious purpose.\nIn The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #11 by Matthew Rosenberg, Carmine Di Giandomenico, and Romulo Fajardo Jr., Gotham is going to hell in a handbasket as the Gotham and LA Jokers continue their epic war against each other. Gotham's Joker and his crew roll up on a poor custodian and kidnap him, adding him to the collection of other victims that the Joker has snatched.\nAs chaos reigns throughout the city, Ravager and Manhunter run into each other, stumbling upon the van the Joker's gang was driving, now empty. They track the Joker down to his lair and attempt to take him out. Though Joker gets the better of Manhunter, Ravager shoots the villain in the shoulder. With no other option, Joker retreats and pulls out an unexpected surprise. He reveals his kidnapping victims have all been surgically altered to resemble the Joker. Even worse, they've also become living bombs that Joker detonates in his getaway.\nThe DC Universe has been haunted by dual Jokers for the past few months. One Joker moved out to Los Angeles, intent on expanding his criminal endeavors across the entire nation. But another remained in Gotham, trying to recover after being shot in the head and suffering gaps in his memory as a result. Both Harlequins of Hate were certain that they were the original, but Gotham's Joker finally regained his memory and remembered the impostor Joker was actually a former henchman that had been poisoned by Joker venom and surgically altered to resemble the Joker.\nEver since the publication of the Black Label miniseries Three Jokers, copies of the iconic villain have become an increasingly common sight. DC has even introduced a new villain known as Red Mask who can create Jokers on a whim. However, the latest batch of clowns doesn't seem to be intended as anything more than a trump card for Gotham's Joker. He used one doppelganger to attack LA's Joker and experienced a reluctance to use his victims on Ravager and Manhunter. Gotham's Joker likely wanted to take his copycat out in the most ironic way possible by killing him with other false Jokers.\nWhether he's the real one or not, Gotham's Joker has taken umbrage at another Joker existing in the DCU. Gotham's Joker swore he'd win in the end, and it looks like his final move was intended to put an end to the entire copycat Joker movement. It's a pretty creative manner of killing: It's violent, attention-grabbing, and essentially says LA's Joker was a fake like all the rest. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like Gotham's Joker will get the chance to use this creative method of execution. Seeing more than one Joker might be wearing thin for some, but this is a hell of a closing act for the multiple Joker shtick. The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #11 is on sale now.\n"}

With the series spanning four lengthy books, there's a lot of ground to cover in the world of Twilight, so it's not surprising that the writers and directors of the Twilight Saga had to change some things from the novels or completely leave plot points out.\nAlthough the Twilight movies were mostly loyal to the source material, which was key to their success with fans of the books, it also made some changes that weren’t well-received. The Twilight Saga either changed how some key scenes happened, left important information and context out, or completely skipped some scenes due to time constraints. Because of this, there are a couple of moments in the Twilight Saga that are better explained or developed in the Twilight books and which could have improved the movies, while others are exclusive to the movies and actually benefited them.\nRelated: Twilight Movies In Order: What Is The Second & Third Movie To Watch\nWhen it comes to book adaptations, many directors work closely with costume designers to create accessories that will distinguish one character from another or give the character personality. That was the case for the Cullen Crest, which even though is never mentioned in the books, features prominently throughout the films. Each Cullen family member wore their own version of it – for example, Edward's cuff, Rosalie's necklace, and Alice's thin choker all feature the family symbol.\nWhile this may seem like a small addition to the Twilight franchise, it's an important and symbolic one. With the Cullen family constantly being apart for different reasons, the Cullen Crest is the one thing that unifies them as a family, as they always have a piece of each other with them.\nOne of the most interesting things about the Cullens is that they're \"vegetarians\", which in the Twilight universe means that they don't drink human blood, and instead feed from the blood of animals – however, not every Cullen family member has led a vegetarian lifestyle. In his early years as a vampire, Edward rejected Carlisle's way of life by turning to human blood. In the books, Edward tells Bella about how he used to seek out criminals and kill them early on, but in the movies, this happens the night before their wedding.\nWhile viewers are consistently treated to the same tune by Carter Burwell throughout the Twilight movies, it's never blatantly stated that this is Bella's song, known as \"Bella's Lullaby\". It's only when Edward and Bella are seen sitting at the piano in Twilight that it's assumed Edward is playing \"Bella's Lullaby\" to her. In the books, Edward hums the song to Bella multiple times throughout the series, which doesn't happen in the movies.\nThroughout the Twilight Saga, viewers are treated to the backstories of Carlisle, Rosalie, and Jasper, but there's one crucial story that was left out completely: Alice's. In the books, readers find out the tragic backstory of Alice Cullen, from the early development of her powers to her time in a mental institution and her transformation into a vampire. Alice's backstory does have an impact on Twilight, as she was hunted by James years before.\nRelated: Twilight: How (And Why) All Of The Cullens Were Turned Into Vampires\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part Two is based around the Cullen Clan's impending fight with the Volturi in defense of Renesmee. In the books, the fight ends up being a peaceful encounter, but the movie did something different and controversial. Breaking Dawn 2 saw an all-out brawl between the Cullens and their allies against the Volturi that resulted in the deaths of some favorite characters like Carlisle, Leah, and Seth – but before viewers can process the massacre, it's revealed that all that was nothing more than Alice's premonition, so none of it actually happened.\nOne of the major plot points of New Moon is Bella engaging in reckless behavior in order to hear Edward's voice following their breakup. In the movie, Bella takes a joyride with a stranger on his motorcycle after a night at the movies with Jessica, but in the books, Bella spots the group of men who had ill intentions during her night in Port Angeles in Twilight, and as she approaches them, she hears Edward's voice for the first time.\nEclipse is widely regarded as the best book and movie in the Twilight series, in large part due to the introduction of the newborn army and the battle against these vampires led by Victoria. However, in the books, readers learn very little of the strategy of the newborn army, while in the movie, viewers get a behind-the-scenes look at Victoria's master plan.\nThose on Edward's side got a lot of joy out of Bella punching Jacob in the face after he kissed her in Eclipse, and while this scene stayed relatively true to the book, Bella and Jacob's second kiss didn't. Instead of Bella catching up to Jacob after he runs away, Edward is the one who brings Jacob back after he finds out that Edward and Bella are engaged. In addition to that, Edward and Bella are in the tent when they discuss their upcoming nuptials, and not outside.\nEdward's official proposal went great, but the first one wasn't exactly a romantic dream. In the movie, Edward proposes to Bella after he, Jacob, and Bella get into an argument in the woods, but in the book, Edward's proposal takes place in Edward's room, and Bella initially thinks he is joking.\nOne of the most iconic scenes in the whole Twilight series is when Bella tells Edward that she knows he's a vampire, but the movie version of this moment is completely different from the book one. Rather than taking to the ominous woodsy area of Forks, Bella finds out Edward is a vampire before her Port Angeles attack and reveals her knowledge in Edward's car.\nThe Twilight Saga depicted Bella as a loner, and though she had some human friends, like Jessica, Angela, Mike, and Eric, she didn’t spend much time with them. This is completely different in the books, where Bella’s friends have a bigger presence as she actually spends time with them rather than just being focused on Edward. This was a harmful change to the Twilight books, as the movies made it seem like Edward was isolating Bella from her friends, which is a huge red flag in their relationship.\nThroughout the Twilight Saga, Charlie and Bella are seen eating at a diner, but in the books, Bella actually cooked for Charlie. While this might seem like an unimportant detail, it’s actually key to Bella and Charlie’s dynamic, as well as to understanding Bella. When Bella learns Charlie can’t cook, she decides to cook for him, informing the reader that, as her mother often required care, she took on some of the responsibilities of an adult, such as cooking for others. It shows how protective Bella is of her loved ones, and adds some sweetness to her relationship with her father.\nBella and Edward’s first kiss in the Twilight movie was a lot steamier than in the book. In the source material, Edward and Bella kiss for the first time when they return to her truck after hiking to the meadow, with Bella reacting enthusiastically to it. The movie turned up the intensity and instead set Bella and Edward’s kiss in Bella’s room, with Bella only wearing a t-shirt and underwear. Bella escalates the kiss to make it more passionate, with Edward pulling back to control himself.\nTwilight ends on a cliffhanger as Victoria is revealed to be watching Bella and Edward at their prom, setting her up as a big villain in the sequels. This scene is exclusive to the movie, as in the book, Victoria never shows up at the prom – and had she done so, any of the Cullens in attendance would have immediately sensed her presence, which would have put everyone else in great danger.\nRelated: What Happened To The Original Victoria From Twilight?\nAs mentioned above, the Twilight Saga made it look as if Edward was isolating Bella, adding to complaints about the toxic relationship between Edward and Bella, but in the books, she actually focused on other areas of her life, too. In the books, Bella actually made plans to attend college, and Edward was very supportive of this. In Eclipse, Bella got accepted into the University of Alaska, and in Breaking Dawn, Bella decided to attend for a year after getting married and remain human – however, these plans changed when she got pregnant. Still, it shows that Bella wanted a lot more than to become a vampire, and Edward was supportive of her plans to have more human experiences.\nImprinting in the Twilight universe has caused a lot of controversy, mostly because Jacob imprinted on Bella’s child, Renesmee. While this is disturbing in both the books and the movie, in the source material it’s less creepy thanks to the explanation of what imprinting really is about. This, arguably, made the “Jacob imprinted on Renesmee” situation endearing, while in the movie, it became not just one of the most disturbing moments in the Twilight Saga but also one of the most mocked ones thanks to Bella’s over-the-top (but understandable) reaction.\n\n"}
{"title": "“Choose Nepotism”: Trainspotting Parody Video Retargets Opening Satire To Perfection", "date": "2023-10-05 20:34:39", "text": "UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak chooses nepotism in a Trainspotting parody that targets the iconic opening satire of the government's scandals.\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and other politicians appear in a Trainspotting parody that retargets the movie's iconic opening satire to perfection. Danny Boyle's 1996 adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel followed a group of misfits in Edinburgh played by Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremmer, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, Peter McKullan, and Robert Carlyle. Trainspotting is celebrated for its glimpse at substance addiction in the youth subculture, with the movie also launching McGregor and Boyle into widespread recognition.\nFollowing recent policy announcements made during the UK Conservative Party Conference that included the scrapping of the high-speed railway construction project HS2, PoliticsJOE has taken inspiration from the controversial decision and reimagined Trainspotting's recognizable opening sequences with Sunak and former Conservative Prime Ministers Liz Truss, Boris Johnson, Theresa May, and David Cameron in \"Trainstopping.\"\nIn Sunak's new monologue, the current Prime Minister looks back on his own tenure full of inconsistent policies and lobbying accusations, alongside other recent controversies, including Truss's short tenure, Johnson's neglectful mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic, May's handling of the Windrush Scandal, and Cameron's Black Mirror-Esque Pig scandal. Other key UK political figures, including RMT Union Leader Mick Lynch and former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, are also imposed into the opening, having to endure the group's antics.\nPoliticsJOE's history of biting political pop culture mashups extends far beyond their recent Trainspotting parody. The channel has approached major political events with many parodies of iconic songs and television shows. From imagining Johnson's chaotic resignation as Goodfellas' \"Meet the Crew\" monologue, placing Sunak's rise to Prime Minister into the opening of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and current Labour leader Keir Starmer's ever-changing stances as The Jungle Book's \"I Want To Be Like You,\" the YouTube channel has provided humorous videos that capture ongoing issues affecting both the UK and the world.\nHowever, what makes PoliticsJOE's newest parody stand out is how \"Trainstopping\" looks compared to the original Trainspotting monologue. The fast-paced nature perfectly encapsulates the chaotic changes brought through the current Conservative government since 2010. Sunak's reimagined dialogue lists what the UK political landscape has become, similar to how Renton's (McGregor) original monologue is about how he views ordinary life. Furthermore, it concludes with Renton (McGregor) stating he chooses to take heroin, as Sunak's dialogue states how the Prime Minister framed himself as cleaning up his party's many controversies but instead chose to let them persist.\nPoliticsJOE's Trainspotting parody is a darkly comedic encapsulation of the UK's current state. Not only is the title a fun play on the Conservative Party's derided HS2 choice, but Sunak's monologue features a wide range of biting jabs at the government's tenure dating back to Cameron's election. As such, \"Trainstopping\" is a quick, memorable remix of Boyle's iconic sequence that entertains and informs viewers.\nSource: PoliticsJOE\n"}

The Sister Wives star embraces his new monogamous life with Robyn Brown by taking a huge step.\nKody Brown from Sister Wives replaced his Claddagh ring with a new one, showing he’s confident about moving away from polygamy. The 54-year-old Brown family patriarch married four women in the last three decades, hoping to build one big family. However, he couldn’t sustain them forever and eventually fell into a monogamous relationship with his youngest wife, Robyn Brown. During Sister Wives season 18, Kody split up from Janelle Brown a year after losing Christine Brown. Kody also ended things with Meri Brown, for whom he felt no love over the last few years.\nET recently shared a preview clip from Sister Wives season 18, which shows Kody confidently flashing his new symbol of monogamy. The reality star is sitting across from his former wife Meri and his current (and only) wife Robyn. As Meri speaks to them about her plans to move away, she spots a new ring on her former husband’s hand and points it out.\nShe says, “Sorry, I am distracted by your ring. That’s a different ring.” While Kody laughs it off and says it was just a “ring,” Meri reminds the cameras that he used to wear another one. She notes, “I did notice that it was replacing the Claddagh ring we all used to wear together.”\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\n\nMeri is shocked to see the change but isn't bothered about it. She is confused about why Kody was smirking about the ring and making things awkward at the table. The 52-year-old Sister Wives star tells the cameras, “It’s weird that he is being so awkward about it. Like, if he doesn’t want me to see the ring, don’t wear it to my house.” Kody simply chuckles during the clip, like a kid who gets caught stealing cookies. However, Meri isn't impressed by his behavior. She adds, “I have no idea what this ring is or where it came from.” Meri claims she doesn't care where the ring came from.\nIt’s clear why Meri was surprised to see Kody’s new ring. The Sister Wives cast member was Kody’s first wife and had been with him for years. She assumed he would never change the Claddagh ring representing their polygamous relationship. However, Kody did the unthinkable by replacing the symbol of plural marriage. One possible reason for this change could be his newfound monogamous relationship with Robyn. Kody is no longer with Christine, Janelle, or Meri. Therefore, he has no reason to wear the Claddagh ring, as it doesn’t represent anything meaningful to him.\nWhile Meri claimed she wasn’t jealous or cared about Kody’s new piece of jewelry, she certainly seemed bothered by it. It’s clear that she was shocked by the change, but she shouldn’t have pointed it out. She should have known that her relationship with Kody wasn’t the same as it was years ago. Meri and Kody’s relationship went downhill after Meri fell for a catfish online. She stepped out of the marriage by committing emotional infidelity. If the Sister Wives star had been faithful to the rules of her marriage, Kody might still be with her as her husband.\nSister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT on TLC.\nSource: ET/YouTube\n"}
{"title": "Pet Sematary: Bloodlines Review - A Bland Prequel Despite An Intriguing Premise", "date": "2023-10-05 20:41:17", "text": "The film will resonate with the people eager to devour more Stephen King-inspired projects; sadly, there is nothing genuinely inspired to enjoy.\nIn 2019, the Pet Sematary remake was released. Directed by Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer and written by Jeff Buhler, the remake revisited the Creed family with a few minor tweaks that ultimately did not stray too far away from the original plot of the 1989 film. The consensus was that while the film had an updated look, the resurrected story offered very little. Pet Sematary: Bloodlines, a direct prequel to the novel and the 2019 film, follows young Jud Crandall as he discovers the cemetery where the dead don’t stay dead 50 years before meeting the Creeds.\nThe one aspect that seems to indicate the underlying intentions of Pet Sematary: Bloodlines' existence is the attempt to rectify the simplistic explanation of the burial ground that reanimates dead people and animals. There is an attempt to flesh out the history of the damned burial site, but the film doesn’t fully reckon with the reality that Stephen King and plenty of other horror writers rely on the audience's willful ignorance to explain away any spooky thing as being a byproduct of Indigenous peoples' history and culture.\nThere is a point where a case could be made for a Prey-esque prequel that solely revolves around the perspectives of the Mi’kmaq tribe, whose lands were invaded by the Europeans who would build Ludlow. There is a story to be told of how this burial ground came to be a source of terror for the town's residents. Instead, the film splits its attention, giving focus to the story of Jud Crandall, a character who didn't need to be explained or understood. At the same time, the general explanation of the “pet sematary” history is a protracted flashback.\nPrequels are a reality we cannot overcome. Still, there is a sad expectation that we are somehow incapable of inferring a character's past without being explicitly told in detail all that happened before the start of a story. Somehow, filmmakers (and audiences, as a result) can't accept that a story may have many other beginnings. It is one thing to have a prequel that expands our knowledge of the dynamics and world that made the story we enjoyed so intriguing, but it's an entirely different thing to focus on an inconsequential character. Jud Crandall was an interesting character with a history connected to the supernatural burial ground that predates Louis Creed and his family. But what exactly is there to learn or experience that makes Crandall’s story worth exploring in the first place? That question often goes unanswered with many unwarranted prequels, and Pet Sematary: Bloodlines fails to raise any compelling points.\nScreenwriters Jeff Buhler and Lindsey Anderson Beer, who also directed, do their best with what they have, but Buhler’s previous writing efforts on Pet Sematary didn’t manage to elevate the source material impressively, and there is nothing much to speak of for Bloodlines, either. The scares are palpable; Beer does a good job crafting an unsettling horror that has the right amount of gore and creepy ambiance. The cast is effective in their respective roles, but Forrest Goodluck and Isabella Star LaBlanc are underserved as they could easily have carried the entire film. Pam Grier is always a delight to see, but her talents are not utilized as well as they could have been. The story never manages to be as lively as it needs to be to justify its existence, but the cast attempts to make up for that with committed performances. Sadly, the film is rather dull, lacking in genuine suspense or intrigue.\nDespite some good instincts from Beer, the material is too constricting, denying the director the chance to expand her ideas or take turns that might alienate fans expecting a movie that answers questions no one was really asking. Mythology is certainly fascinating to explore when it comes to established horror that begins with an inexplicable idea, but there is hardly anything worth digging up here. In addition to the bland story, the film isn’t all too impressive to watch. There is a flatness to the cinematography, which is unfortunate considering Benjamin Kirk Nielsen has recently done great work. Tonally, the film is a tad bit gratifying for fans of King and his atmospheric horror. The darkness permeating over these characters and town is effectively realized, and the frights are effective.\nPet Sematary: Bloodlines is mercifully shorter than the 2019 film, but it still needed trimming. There have been worse straight-to-streaming horror films, and Pet Sematary: Bloodlines is hardly the worst among them. Memorable? Hardly. Entertaining? Somewhat. Ultimately, the film will resonate with the people eager to devour more Stephen King-inspired projects; sadly, there is nothing genuinely inspired to enjoy.\nPet Sematary: Bloodlines begins streaming on Paramount+ Friday, October 6. The film is 84 minutes long and rated R for horror violence, gore and language.\nFerdosa (she/her) is a lifelong student of cinema. She dreams of being a film festival programmer and is working her way towards that goal by consuming a concerning number of films every week."}
{"title": "Walking Dead Writer Admits One Sexist Moment Is Still 'Cringe-Worthy'", "date": "2023-10-05 20:45:12", "text": "Creator and writer of The Walking Dead Robert Kirkman acknowledges a sexist scene in the original series, and one he would change if written today.\nRobert Kirkman's The Walking Dead is a landmark series in the apocalypse genre, as a story not only about zombies, but human survival in the face of impossible odds. It's also a story that's been criticized for its depiction of women--and even Kirkman admits that there is one particular moment in the series he still finds \"cringe-worthy.\"\nThe Walking Dead Deluxe is a re-release of the original Walking Dead series, first published in 2004, with never before seen content and valuable creator commentary providing insight into a few of author Robert Kirkman's character decisions. This glimpse into Kirkman's creative process, specifically his decision-making when it comes to writing female characters, highlights one scene in need of revisiting.\nThe scene in question arrives in The Walked Dead #3, in which two of the three women excitedly discuss laundry detergent on their way to washing the survivors' clothes. Donna angrily points out the disparity in the men hunting and women cleaning, with Lori Grimes dismissing the sexism, and excusing it as \"being realistic.\" \nRelated: Walking Dead: Carl Losing His Eye Foreshadows His Tragic Future\nIn Walking Dead Deluxe #3, Kirkman notes this scene as \"cringe-worthy,\" explaining he would make different decisions today (intending to give the women the maximum amount of space to grow as the story progressed). These interpersonal interactions do indeed evolve some of these people into hardened and lethal survivors, eventually joining Michonne's level. Regardless of Kirkman's authorial intent the scene in both the comic series and the TV show caused backlash.\n\"Did I need a full page of the female characters talking about doing laundry while the men hunted? Probably not....I was going to take the female characters in some interesting directions as the series progressed. So starting them here would give me a lot of room to grow and evolve along the way. Anyway I was 23 when I started writing this comic so this is definitely not the last cringe-worthy thing (for me at least) that I wrote into this book. I'd have handled things a little differently had I written it today. I'd have maybe had Allen or Jim help with the laundry.\"\nBecause Walking Dead has so much exposure in the cultural zeitgeist, it means the more questionable scenes are open to critiques from the fans, a fact Kirkman acknowledges. To many fans the scene demonstrates that even in a zombie apocalypse the patriarchal structure endures. Kirkman has said in the past that he's not a political writer and doesn't want his work to be read as such, but he also understands that because of the platform he's been given with Walking Dead, people are going to read what they want into it. Understandably, some fans might find this scene hard to enjoy due to its parallels to the non-zombified reality, where, with a few exceptions, men are in charge of almost every group, faction, colony or community and women get few moments to shine in grisly combat.\nIt's clear that the scene in question was meant to be a commentary on the state of society, both in the world of The Walking Dead and our own. Whether or not it was in good taste has typically been up to the fans to decide. It wasn't until Robert Kirkman's creative commentary in the Walking Dead Deluxe #3 that there was a confirmation on his own gendered bias, calling the scene \"cringe-worthy.\" This isn't the only instance of Kirkman's personal feelings featured in the series, but it is one of the first times he's acknowledged the faults of an early creative decision.\nThe Walking Dead Deluxe is available now from Skybound wherever comic books are sold.\nNext: Walking Dead's 'Don't Dead Open Inside' Originally Had a Different Purpose\nEmily Stachelczyk is a Comics News writer for Screen Rant. Ever since she accidentally read Joss Wheddon's Astonishing X-Men in middle school she's loved dissecting comic books ever since. Although her career is in SEO project management, Emily loves to write about all things comics and Marvel.

{"title": "Does The Exorcist: Believer Have A Post-Credits Scene?", "date": "2023-10-05 21:00:27", "text": "The Exorcist: Believer is the start of a new trilogy of movies, so is there a post-credits scene teasing the sequels and future of the franchise?\nThe Exorcist franchise is at the start of a new potential trilogy, but does The Exorcist: Believer have a post-credits scene teasing future installments? The 2023 horror movie is a direct sequel to the original 1973 movie that does not connect to any of the previous sequels or prequels. The Exorcist: Believer continues the story nearly 50 years after Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) and her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) encountered a demon. The sequel sees Chris recruited by Victor Fielding (Leslie Odom Jr.) to help free two young girls from demonic possession.\nIn addition to being a sequel to The Exorcist, the new entry is planned to be the first installment of a new trilogy of movies. This means that by the time that The Exorcist: Believer's ending comes to a close, some clues about where the franchise is going next have been revealed. One of the most common tactics studios use to set up future movies that have already been announced is to include mid-credits or after-credits scenes. So with multiple other movies already planned, here's if audiences should expect to see a The Exorcist: Believer post-credits scene.\nRelated: How Much Exorcist: Believer Cost To Make & What Box Office It Needs\nIt is confirmed that The Exorcist: Believer does not have a post-credits scene. The movie does not include any additional scenes or teases at any point during the credits, meaning audiences will not see a mid-credits scene or end-credits scene in tehaters or when The Exorcist: Believer releases on streaming. Not including the tag is surprising considering The Exorcist: Deceiver has already been announced. While audiences do not need to wait for an after-credits scene now, sitting through the credits still is a great way to show respect for the writers, actors, and other people who made The Exorcist: Believer.\nBy not including an after-credits scene with The Exorcist: Believer, Universal and director David Gordon Green have taken the safer approach to building out the franchise. There have already been announcements for two more movies, but details on The Exorcist: Deceiver and the untitled third installment are still largely under wraps. The 2023 horror movie not having a post-credits scene means that the franchise can evolve naturally and make corrections based on The Exorcist: Believer's reception from critics and audiences. This also prevents the franchise from being written into a corner or potentially ignoring the tease altogether.\nJust because there is no post-credits scene after The Exorcist: Believer, that does not mean audiences will leave the movie without any indication on where the franchise is going. The final moments of the movie does help provide some insight into what could come next for the main characters. It is through this ending that a rough blueprint for how the trilogy will unfold comes to light. An end-credits scene after The Exorcist: Believer could have been redundant in this case, so it works better that the movie does not have one.\n"}
{"title": "Peanuts: 10 Best Peppermint Patty and Marcie Moments", "date": "2023-10-05 21:00:27", "text": "These best buds could not be more opposite, but Peppermint Patty and Marcie have some hilarious best-friend moments in these Peanuts strips.\nMarcie and Peppermint Patty became a dynamic duo in 1971, as Marcie made her Peanuts debut when the pair were seen at camp together. However, Marcie did not originally have a name, and she didn't receive one until some time later. The two didn't form the warmest bond right away, with Peppermint Patty calling Marcie a dork shortly after meeting. Regardless, they end up sharing a close friendship that configures Marcie as Peppermint Patty's sidekick and best friend.\nPeppermint Patty and Marcie offer very different personalties, making them an example of the tried and true comic trope of the big personality and the straight man, respectively. Positioning Peppermint Patty, who is outgoing, sporty, and extroverted, as a foil to the bookish and sweet Marcie provides endless funny situations for the girls to share — and for their fans to experience. They may be very different people, but one thing they have in common is their loyalty and devoted friendship. Here are 10 moments that celebrate their iconic friendship.\nRelated: 10 Funniest Peanuts Comics Starring Lucy\nMarcie is not the best at sports, as this strip clearly points out. She stands in stark contrast to the athletic, sports-loving Peppermint Patty. Marcie is very smart about a number of subjects, but sports is not one of them. Peppermint Patty, being the helpful pal that she is, tries to teach Marcie how to kick a ball. Things don't go as Patty planned and Marcie finds her own way of playing.\nFinding the humor in everything thanks to her good nature, Marcie finds her clumsy attempt at sports funny. Based on Patty's unsettled expression, the audience can guess that she does feel the same.\nMarcie loves school. On the other hand, Peppermint Patty does not. In fact, she hates school, and she is exceptionally lazy when it comes to her education. In Peanuts, it's been established that Patty frequently sleeps during class, which has been attributed to her dad coming home late from work and Patty waiting up for him. Regardless, Patty's attitude towards school is the polar opposite to Marcie's; Marcie is high achieving and loves to learn.\nWhen Marcie has to go to the principal's office, she claims innocence, only for Patty to reply that sleeping during class ensures not getting in trouble. It often annoys Marcie that Patty doesn't try very hard at school, so it seems unlikely that Marcie will take her friend's words seriously.\nA sports fanatic Marcie is not. Although, there is one sports superstar that Marcie is well aware of and is an active fan of: tennis player Billie Jean King. The former worldwide number-one tennis player, King is often referred to as one of the best tennis players of all time. She is also an advocate for women in sports and LGBTQ+ rights.\nA major tennis star in the '60s and '70s, King's popularity in the era's zeitgeist was immense, making her way into the Peanuts comics strip. Marcie and Peppermint Patty are huge fans of King, with Patty even threatening to never introduce her to the tennis star if she doesn't help Patty with women in sports. Too bad for Patty, Marcie pokes holes in her threats, leaving Patty desperate for a change of topic — even if from the teacher.\nAll best friends look out for each other, including by giving some much-needed style advice. As readers of the Peanuts strip know, Marcie's eyes are almost always obscured by her glasses. In this strip, Peppermint Patty thinks Marcie's eyes deserve to be seen and that putting her glasses on her head will make her look sophisticated.\nUnfortunately for Marcie, she needs those glasses on her eyes to see, sophisticated or not. What ensues is unsurprising; Marcie takes her glasses off and moments later walks directly into a tree. As helpful as Patty tries to be, she's better off sticking to sports tips than fashion advice.\nSports-challenged Marcie may not be a jock like Peppermint Patty, but there is one major exception: hockey. Marcie's grandfather plays in a hockey league, and, as noted in the strip, she and her father go to hockey games. While hockey is one of the very few sports Marcie is somewhat familiar with, she is still pretty clueless about some basic parts of the game. For instance, she thinks a hockey rink is called a hockey court.\nCorrecting her friend, Patty tells her it's a rink only for Marcie to get mixed up even further and call a basketball court a basketball rink. Marcie may excel at many subjects and even different languages, but she cannot seem to get a grasp on sports — something that is endlessly frustrating to Patty.\nMarcie and Peppermint Patty have one of the best friendships in the entirety of the Peanuts strip. They are endlessly loyal to each other and are always each other's first pick for everything. As tight-knit as the pair are, they are complete inverses to each other when it comes to sports. There is the all around athletic, competitive Patty who differs greatly from Marcy, whose vast knowledge does not extend to sports.\nWhen asked by Patty to fetch her a driver and ball, Marcy gives her a driver with no hesitation or issue. However, when it comes to which ball to give her friend, Marcie stumbles hard and hands her a soccer ball instead of a golf ball.\nA bookworm of the highest order, Marcie loves to read and learn, which could not be in more opposition to Peppermint Patty. Marcie can speak French fluently and is well-read on many subjects... except for sports. Apparently, the little intellectual is also knowledgeable about the Book of Proverbs, reciting one to a perplexed Patty.\nThe ancient writing of the Book of Proverbs would be hard for most adults to grasp, let alone a child. As a result, it's not hard to blame Peppermint Patty for having no clue what she's repeating. Patty is lucky to have a best bud like Marcie who can always help her out when she's in some academic jam.\nMarcie may be sweet and unassuming, but that doesn't mean that she isn't immune to fighting with her best friend. With two pals who spend as much time together as these, it's only natural for them to clash from time to time, as evident in this strip. When Marcie questions if Patty didn't do her homework yet again, Peppermint Patty gets defensive and complains about being called \"sir.\"\nNot one to back down, Marcie intentionally calls her \"sir\" over and over until Peppermint Patty can take no more and hits her friend on the head with a book. Some hair pulling ensues and the two girls are sent to the principal's office. Marcie, instead of acting like any normal kid would in the situation, feels elated after the fight and shows no trepidation about seeing the principal, much to Peppermint Patty's annoyance and confusion.\nPeppermint Patty is ready for a sports game or a scrimmage at any time. Patty is also one to stand up for herself and others. When a peer makes fun of Patty by making a cruel joke about graduating from dog obedience school, which she was told to attend by Snoopy, Patty does not take kindly to it.\nShe delivers a line that would be just as fitting in an Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie and bops the kid right on the nose. Marcie is very impressed and voices her admiration. Although, she should be careful to not call Patty \"sir\" at the moment in case she gets a bonk on the head, too.\nPeppermint Patty is very particular about her appearance and what she likes to wear. In one show of activism, Patty fights against the school board and hires Snoopy as her attorney after her school requires her to wear a dress for the new dress code. Therefore, Patty will stick to her guns about what is right and fair, including when it regards clothing.\nPatty is not immune to mixing things up, though. When she is competing in a skating competition, she is prepared to dress the part, hairstyle included. For the competition, she wants a new hairdo and asks Marcie for help. She should've kept looking, because Marcie comes up with a style that is not the most flattering, requiring the iconic Peanuts duo to go back to the drawing board.\n"}
{"title": "Bridgerton Season 3: Release Date Prediction, Cast Changes & Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-05 21:00:28", "text": "Bridgerton season 3 is coming to Netflix. Here are the latest updates, its story details, who it'll focus on and how Queen Charlotte sets it up.\nBridgerton season 3 was confirmed several years ago, but the release date could finally be on the horizon for the Bridgerton sibling's return to Netflix. Season 1 adapted Julia Quinn's novel The Duke and I, telling the tale of Daphne Bridgerton and Simon Basset's romance. Despite being such a success with audiences, that was put on the back burner in season 2 — which doesn't feature Simon at all, although he is name-dropped occasionally — and adapts the second Bridgerton novel The Viscount Who Loved Me, focusing on Anthony Bridgerton and Kate Sharma's enemies-to-lovers storyline.\nInstead of adapting Benedict Bridgerton's story, An Offer From A Gentleman, for Bridgerton season 3, the Netflix show is making a huge switch-up and changing the order. Bridgerton season 3 will cover the fourth Bridgerton novel, Romancing Mister Bridgerton, and even then is making several alterations (as it did for seasons 1 and 2). Production on Bridgerton season 3 is already underway, and a release date announcement feels closer every day, with the added bonus of Bridgerton spin-off Queen Charlotte setting up the third mainline series in a surprising way.\nThere has been surprisingly little news on Bridgerton season 3 outside the occasional tease from cast members since filming wrapped in March 2023. However, this is likely due to both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. While production is reportedly more-or-less complete on the next season, the strike conditions also prohibit the cast from promoting their work in all but a very limited capacity.\nHowever, Bridgerton was expected to arrive in 2023 by many, so the lack of promotion for the show from Netflix by September is worrying. There's increasing concern that, due to the strikes and Netflix wanting to be able to promote it properly, the next season of Bridgerton could be delayed until 2024. However, a leaked report in August suggested the Bridgerton season 3 release date could be as soon as December 14, 2023 (via CBR). \nIt should be noted though that this date was only rumored, and since it's only a few months away the lack of promotion from Netflix doesn't seem to correlate — especially given both the popularity of the show and how long it's been since the next season of Bridgerton was confirmed in 2021.\nBridgerton season 3 is officially happening on Netflix, with the show's renewal confirmed in 2021 (via Deadline). What's more, the streamer confirmed a fourth season would also follow. Author Julia Quinn wrote eight Bridgerton books in total, one focusing on each sibling, and the hope is that each book will be adapted into a different season for TV. It's likely that Netflix will continue with the show long into the future should interest remain high.\nAt the time of writing, Bridgerton season 3's release date has not been confirmed. Bridgerton season 1 was released in December 2020, and season 2 was released in March 2022 following multiple delays due to COVID-19. The WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes assured that any production and development remaining which required an actor or writer couldn't continue throughout most of 2023, too — although filming was wrapped in March. The Bridgerton season 3 release date will likely arrive in 2024, although until Netflix confirms anything it's impossible to say with certainty.\nBridgerton season 3's cast will include most of the Bridgerton family: Jonathan Bailey as Anthony; Ruth Gemmell as Violet; Claudia Jessie as Eloise; Luke Thompson as Benedict; Luke Newton as Colin; Will Tilston as Gregory; and Florence Hunt as Hyacinth. Nicola Coughlan will, of course, be back as Penelope Featherington as the focal character of the season. The Bridgerton season 3 cast is likely to feature many other returning faces, including:\nPhoebe Dynevor's Daphne Bridgerton will not return. Dynevor did keep the door open to return in later seasons, but she will not be around in Bridgerton season 3. Some of Bridgerton's second-season cast additions, including Rupert Young as Jack Featherington and Calam Young as Theo Sharpe, are perhaps less likely to return since their stories are seemingly wrapped up.\nThere is one major casting change for Bridgerton season 3. Ruby Stokes is no longer playing younger sister Francesca Bridgerton. Stokes landed a starring role on Netflix’s Lockwood & Company, which conflicted with her recurring status in Bridgerton. Replacing her as Francesca is Hannah Dodd who recently appeared in Enola Holmes 2, also for Netflix, as Sarah Chapman. Black Sails actress Hannah New joins the series as Lady Tilley Arnold, a young widow. Daniel Francis, James Phoon, and Sam Phillips have also all joined the show for season 3.\nRelated: Bridgerton: 14 Movies & TV Shows That Feature The Cast\nMany expected the Bridgerton Netflix series to follow the order of the books, as the Bridgerton novels also begin with Daphne and Anthony’s stories. There’s been a change to the lineup, however. Instead of focusing on Benedict for Bridgerton season 3, the Netflix show will focus on Colin and Penelope. Colin and Penelope’s story makes up the fourth book in the series, Romancing Mister Bridgerton — albeit with some differences in the plot for Bridgerton season 3.\nFollowing the surprising events of Bridgerton season 2, Penelope decides that she needs to look for a husband that will allow her to get out of her mother’s house and still live her double life as Penelope and Lady Whistledown, but she doesn’t have the same level of confidence that other debutantes do. Colin, who misses Penelope’s company when she starts to ignore him at social events, offers to help her land a husband. According to Netflix’s official summary, Colin’s plan to help Penelope gain confidence might “work a little too well.”\nIn addition to Colin and Penelope’s love story unfolding, Eloise will also share some of the spotlight in the Bridgerton season 3 story. After discovering that Penelope is Lady Whistledown, Eloise wants nothing to do with her former best friend. That leaves her forging new relationships while still being present for the parties of the season.\nNicola Coughlan, who plays Penelope Featherington, teased that season 3 will be \"extremely spicy.\" (via Collider). Coughlan explained \"I mean Lady Whistledown is right at the center having to deal with all her little secrets and it gets harder and harder for those to come out and then scandalous love affairs popping up all over the place. [It's] the most scandalous one yet, I would say.\"\nBeyond the established Bridgerton sibling storylines from Bridgerton season 2, spin-off Queen Charlotte throws in the seed of a substantial storyline for Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell). She plays an important role in Queen Charlotte, playing part of the triptych of \"widows\" (including Charlotte herself who awaits King George's death), each representing different types of grief. She loved her husband dearly, and still mourns him, but begins to realize in Queen Charlotte that she may be ready to enjoy herself once more — to \"allow her garden to bloom\" again, as the show delightfully puts it.\nWhile it feels unlikely that Violet will remarry in Bridgerton season 3, there is the possibility of courtship and perhaps some liberated sexual activity to throw further scandal under the belly of the ton. And the unexpected source of that scandal, Violet, would make for a wonderfully entertaining new dynamic.\n\n"}
{"title": "Dark Side Ahsoka: Will Thrawn's Big Threat Come To Pass?", "date": "2023-10-05 21:01:38", "text": "In Ahsoka's finale, Grand Admiral Thrawn tries to use Ahsoka's relationship with Anakin against her – but he doesn't know just how much she's grown.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nGrand Admiral Thrawn implied Ahsoka could one day turn to the dark side in the Ahsoka finale, but could that ever really come to pass? Though Ahsoka never dealt with Grand Admiral Thrawn in Star Wars Rebels, she’s been chasing after him since The Mandalorian season 2, hoping to prevent him returning to Star Wars’ prime galaxy and leading the Imperial Remnant’s resurgence. She knows why Thrawn is such a fearsome adversary, just as he understands how far she’s willing to go to stop him and how powerful she truly is. He knows all this because he used to know Ahsoka’s Jedi Master, Anakin Skywalker.\nThough Thrawn confirmed he knew Anakin in Ahsoka episode 8, “Part Eight: The Jedi, the Witch, and the Warlord,” the circumstances of their meeting happened off-screen in Timothy Zahn’s canon Star Wars novel Thrawn: Alliances. Near the tail end of the Clone Wars, Thrawn and Anakin met on the planet Batuu while both were on unsanctioned missions. Thrawn was seeking information about potential allies and new technologies as a Captain of the Chiss Ascendancy, and Anakin was there to rescue his wife, Padmé Amidala. They agreed to help one another, and during their time together, Thrawn witnessed Anakin’s power and unconventional methods first-hand. Later, he was also one of the few to know of Darth Vader’s real identity, a fact which he has now weaponized to taunt Ahsoka.\nAs Ahsoka and Sabine race to catch up to Thrawn’s Star Destroyer in the Ahsoka finale, Thrawn decides to revel in his victory and opens a channel with their ship just before making the jump to hyperspace. It is during this conversation that Thrawn reveals he knew Anakin Skywalker and was aware of Darth Vader’s true identity. He says: “I know you because I knew your master. I concluded your strategies would be similar. One wonders… just how similar you might become.” The underlying threat of Thrawn’s implication is clear – he believes Ahsoka could still follow in her master’s footsteps and fall to the dark side, and that had always been one of Ahsoka’s greatest fears.\nRelated: When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline\nShe believed she abandoned Anakin when she left the Jedi Order at the end of Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 5, forcing him on a path to darkness. Ever since, she’s lamented her time with the Order, reflecting on how, instead of being taught to become a peacekeeper, she’d only ever fought in a war, being made responsible for battles and bloodshed when she was just a teenager. How could she not fear becoming someone as terrifying as Vader, when Anakin Skywalker, one of the bravest and most powerful Jedi the Order had ever known, fell victim to the temptations of the dark side as well? How could she not be afraid to fall to the dark side herself, when all she’d ever experienced as a child was violence during the Clone Wars, betrayal by those she trusted the most, and grief for her friends?\nDespite the Ahsoka show’s focus on Thrawn’s return to Star Wars’ main galaxy, it also explores Ahsoka’s growth as a character. Ahsoka episode 5, “Shadow Warrior,” sees Ahsoka confronted with her past, her relationship with Anakin, and her greatest fears whilst in the World Between Worlds. Ahsoka has long been held back by her past and her legacy – since learning of Vader’s true identity in Star Wars Rebels season 2, she’s been running from her past, abandoning meaningful connections like the one with her own Padawan Sabine Wren in favor of hunting the galaxy for threats in a misguided attempt to atone for her imagined sins.\nIn the World Between Worlds, however, Ahsoka is given the opportunity to examine how her past has affected her. She sees the battles she was forced to fight as a child, the way she grew and learned under Anakin’s tutelage, and learns that she is capable of being more than what she was trained for. Anakin, and the Order by extension, trained her to be a warrior, yes – but Ahsoka discovered her capacity for empathy and kindness on her own. Her final lesson with Anakin taught her that while her past is an important part of who she is, she has the power to change her future.\nAhsoka now knows that she is more than just Anakin’s Padawan. Instead of choosing to kill him in the World Between Worlds, she chose to live and honor his teachings instead. Her experiences in Ahsoka episode 5 changed her forever. Now, she’s “Ahsoka the White,” no longer burdened by her past but rather accepting of it. She understands that Anakin’s fall to the dark side was a consequence of his own choices, just as much as it was Palpatine’s will. She is not her master, and as such, can make her own choices as she embraces becoming a beacon of light in the galaxy rather than being self-destructive.\nOne of the reasons Thrawn is such a threatening adversary is because he is willing to take the time to get under his enemies’ skin. He learns about their history and their relationships, using that knowledge to knock them down and shake their confidence. He’s done this time and time again – for instance, in Star Wars Rebels, he meticulously studied Twi’lek culture to rip apart their rebellion on the planet Ryloth. Thrawn is an Imperial Officer who uses more than just the Empire’s brute force to overcome his enemies; he messes with their minds as well, playing games and using their biggest fears against them.\nRelated: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nThis is exactly what he hopes to achieve by taunting Ahsoka with Anakin’s tragic fate. He wants to shake her confidence because he knows that, should she make it back to Star Wars’ primary galaxy alive, she’ll be one of his most difficult opponents. Thrawn doesn’t like to take chances; any advantage he can find, he’ll utilize, and knowing about Anakin’s fate is certainly an important piece of information to have in his arsenal. Despite Anakin having been redeemed by Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi, Thrawn could still do a lot of damage with the knowledge of Vader’s true identity as the Imperial Remnant tries to expand its foothold in the galaxy. After the Ahsoka finale, Thrawn has proven himself to be as cunning and terrifying as ever.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "7 Times Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny Changes History", "date": "2023-10-05 21:11:25", "text": "Indiana Jones has always played with real history, but the changes that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny makes could have huge ramifications.\nThe Indiana Jones franchise has always grappled with history, but Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’s changes to real events take this to a new level. Set in 1969, the most recent and final addition to the Indiana Jones series sees the aging archaeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) going up against the Nazis once more, this time in pursuit of Archimedes’ antikythera. Dr. Jones and his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) go on a globe-trotting adventure to save the antikythera from the clutches of the Nazis — though they travel a little further than they intended.\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny's ending takes the characters to Syracuse in 212 BC, where Indy and Helena not only end up encountering the history they study face-to-face, but manage to change it as well. While some of Dial of Destiny’s historical changes are relatively benign, other alterations would have major ramifications on the course of history. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changes history seven times during its runtime, and each of these instances would affect real-world events in one way or another.\nEven before the time travel begins in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the titular archaeologist alters the course of history during a celebration of the 1969 moon landing. After a scuffle with the Nazis and Indy’s morally gray goddaughter Helena Shaw, Indy ends up getting framed for the murder of two of his colleagues at Hunter College. This forces him to flee the university to escape his adversaries and the police. Unfortunately for Indy, New York City’s moon landing parade is in full swing, so the chase sequence between him and the Nazis interrupts the event.\nWhile this chase resembles the usual Indiana Jones antics, this is a real event that Indiana Jones and the Nazis change through their presence. The parade that Indy upends is an actual parade that took place in August 1969, which honored the astronauts of the Apollo 11 moon landing. In real life, however, the Apollo 11 moon day parade was decidedly devoid of an aging archaeologist bursting through on horseback or a car full of Nazis chasing him. This makes the Moon Day parade an early example of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changing history.\nAfter Indy and the Nazis’ unintended involvement in the Moon Day parade, their changes to history get even more drastic. Toward the end of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Dr. Voller reveals that his plan for the antikythera is to go back in time to 1939 and kill Adolf Hitler to prevent him from losing World War II. However, his miscalculation results in the time fissure delivering their plane to the Siege of Syracuse, and the plane is soon shot down. Since the airplane wouldn’t be invented until 1903, a Nazi plane certainly wouldn’t have appeared in 212 BC, making this a big change to history.\nOne of the biggest ways that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changes history is by introducing Ancient Greek inventor Archimedes to the movie’s main characters, who hail from the modern era. After the Nazi plane crashes — with Indy and Helena escaping via parachute — the two archeologists encounter Archimedes. Getting the chance to meet a major historical figure like Archimedes is a huge moment for Indy personally, but it also alters history quite a bit.\nRELATED: Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny: 31 Easter Eggs & Hidden References\nArchimedes getting to meet the time-traveling Indy and Helena changes history in several ways during the Indiana Jones movie. Obviously, it’s highly unlikely that the real-life Archimedes ever encountered time travelers, which is a big alteration. Through meeting these time travelers, Archimedes is also introduced to several modern items and inventions he never would have encountered otherwise. Additionally, Indy and Helena both speak to Archimedes with a level of reverence that hints at his modern reputation, something Archimedes wouldn’t have known about. By meeting Indy and Helena, Archimedes would have gained an awareness of modern times he never would have in real life.\nOne interesting way that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changes history is in its depiction of the antikythera. In the fifth and final Indiana Jones movie, the antikythera is able to detect fissures in time. This allows the users to travel in time, although the Indiana Jones characters later discover that the antikythera only takes them to 212 BC. While this is an interesting function for the artifact to have, the real-life antikythera had a different function.\nRelated: How The Dial Of Destiny Works In Indiana Jones 5 (Explained With Real Science & Math)\nWhen the real-life antikythera was created, its intended use was not time travel. Rather, it was capable of performing complex astronomical calculations, making the antikythera the earliest known example of an analogue computer. This is an impressive feat in its own right, but it is a far cry from the time fissure-detection that the antikythera can do in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\nMeeting time travelers isn’t the only way that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changes the life of Archimedes. In real life, Archimedes died during the Siege of Syracuse in 212 BC, where he was killed by a Roman soldier. However, the end of The Dial of Destiny shows that Archimedes is still in the process of creating the antikythera, and since Indy has a completed version of the invention, that means Archimedes has to live long enough to finish his version. Therefore, whether it was intentional or an unintended plot hole, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny extended Archimedes’ natural lifetime, thus changing history considerably.\nOne of the biggest historical changes that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny makes occurs when Indy and the Nazis interrupt the 212 BC Siege of Syracuse. When the modern characters arrive in Syracuse, the two opposing armies assume that their plane is a dragon, leading them to shift focus and shoot it down. Although it’s impossible to know everything that really happened at the Siege of Syracuse, it’s unlikely that this took place, so it’s a pretty significant divergence from the real battle. It’s also possible that Indy and the Nazis’ interruption is what prevented the Romans from killing Archimedes, which is another alteration.\nRELATED: How To Watch The Indiana Jones Movies In Order (Chronologically & By Release)\nThe appearance of time travelers during the Siege of Syracuse begets several historical changes in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, particularly when it comes to Archimedes encountering examples of modernity. When Archimedes finds the completed antikythera from the future, he also discovers a wristwatch that Dr. Voller was wearing when he died in the plane crash. Though Archimedes gives Indiana and Helena the completed antikythera back, he keeps the wristwatch.\nHaving modern technology in different time periods is always significant in time travel movies, as it marks a major deviation that could change real-life events. After all, Archimedes wouldn't have access to such technology without the time travel ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. The character getting a modern wristwatch could have huge ramifications for the course of history, especially since he's an inventor. It could mean other pieces of modern technology being created earlier, and it could also give certain nations advantages that weren't present in the prior timeline.\n"}
{"title": "10 Best Thriller Movies On Amazon Prime Video", "date": "2023-10-05 21:20:17", "text": "For Amazon Prime Video subscribers, there are a number of excellent thriller movies to watch for a night of suspenseful and nail-biting viewing.\nFor Amazon Prime Video subscribers looking for a thriller movie, there are plenty of options on the platform. Thriller films can spread across different genres, from superhero films to horror to intense action movies. The primary purpose of the genre is to evoke heightened feelings of tension, anxiety, and anticipation while the film quickly builds toward its conclusion. Thriller movies are often filled with shocking plot twists that help the fast-paced narrative escalate toward a dramatic climax.\nPrime Video has a section for thriller films on the site, though there are a number of low-budget and mediocre offerings to weed through. The best thrillers to watch tend to include all-star casts and directors. However, a thriller film's script is often what makes or breaks it, as such stories tend to explore darker ideas about humanity that are meant to linger with the audience after the film's conclusion.\nBurning is a psychological thriller from South Korean writer and director Lee Chang-dong. The film follows a young man, Jong-su, who runs into his childhood friend, Hae-mi. Hae-mi introduces Jong-su to a mysterious man she's met named Ben, who Jong-su is suspicious of. This leads him to believe that his friend is in danger. Burning is engrossing and suspenseful, and it's filled with thematic depth for viewers to explore.\nDirected by Denis Villeneuve and written by Taylor Sheridan, Sicario is an excellent action/thriller film. The movie follows Emily Blunt as Kate Mercy, an FBI agent who's recruited to a team tasked with taking out a powerful cartel boss. The film is beautifully shot and well-written, as one would expect from the writer/director duo that made it happen. Sicario is a nerve-racking, action packed, and gritty thriller that builds its tension perfectly.\nSouth Korean cinema gained a ton of popularity from the 2019 film Parasite. There are a number of other great psychological thrillers to explore from South Korean directors, including Bong Joon-ho's other movies. Bong Joon-ho's Mother is the best example currently available to stream on Prime Video. The film tells the story of a widow who must clear her intellectually disabled adult son of a murder he's been accused of following a messy police investigation. Mother offers a tense murder mystery that fans of Parasite or Memories of Murder will surely enjoy.\nThe 2018 film Suspiria is a supernatural horror thriller inspired by the 1977 Italian film of the same name, directed by Luca Guadagnino (Call Me by Your Name). The film follows a young dancer from America who arrives in Berlin in the 1970s to audition for a renowned dance studio. As the narrative progresses, the young woman unearths sinister witchcraft activity. The film isn't as strong as the original, but it's still one of the best original horror movies on Prime Video. Suspiria is filled with suspense, and it also contains body horror that will freak its audience out.\nJoker is a comic book movie that's received acclaim for its dark, gritty character study. Inspired by Martin Scorsese films like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, Joker chronicles the deterioration of Arthur Fleck, an isolated man who feels rejected by society. As the film builds toward its climax, Fleck transitions further and further into becoming the Joker. Most of the praise for the film comes from the performance from Joaquin Phoenix, who captures the comic book character in a way that feels more realistic than previous variations.\nMost modern moviegoers know of Christopher Nolan and that he's capable of turning any genre or story into a sensory overloading, fast-paced, thrilling experience. His 2000 film Memento is perhaps the best bare-bones example of his style, crafting a simple story that is made complex by its scenes being displaced in time. The main character has short term memory loss, requiring him to utilize a system of notes and photographs to keep track of information as he seeks out revenge toward the men who murdered his wife. The film is complicated due to its narrative style, adding to the anticipation and its plot twists.\nRELATED: Memento Timeline & Ending Explained\nDirected by the great Sidney Lumet, Serpico is one of the earliest and best movies starring Al Pacino. While Pacino is known for playing mobsters, Serpico sees him on the other side of the law, playing a good cop in a New York City precinct full of bribery and corruption. The film depicts the true story of Frank Serpico, who was a whistleblower on police corruption in the '60s and '70s. The film is tense and gripping as obstacles build up in front of Serpico, who goes against the status quo and tries to oust the dirty cops.\nAnother comic book adaptation, The Batman is the first version of the character on the big screen to primarily focus on detective work, allowing the film to lean heavily into thriller elements. Directed by Matt Reeves, the movie sees Batman pursuing the Riddler, who's portrayed as a serial killer leaving behind clues. The film takes heavy inspiration from the mystery thrillers of David Fincher, such as Zodiac and Se7en, laying out clues and misdirection as Batman tracks down the Riddler and the motivations of the film's villains.\nChinatown is one of the greatest mystery movies ever made, and one of the best examples of the neo-noir genre. While the film isn't as fast-paced as many modern thrillers, its slower, contemplative burn allows for its script to fully take effect, maximizing the film's foreshadowing and plot twists. The conflict of Chinatown is relentless, constantly evolving as it transitions from a murder mystery to a grander story about politics and corruption. This is a film that will fill its audience with a sense of tension and dread, both as it develops and long after it ends.\nRELATED: Chinatown: 10 Reasons It's The Best Film Noir Movie Ever Made\nJordan Peele's latest film, Nope, was one of the best new releases of 2022, celebrated for Peele's usual mix of genres. Nope contains elements of sci-fi, comedy, and horror. The film follows a pair of siblings, played exceptionally by Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer, who discover what they believe to be a UFO above their horse ranch. Peele commonly subverts horror tropes, allowing his films to play out and build anticipation in ways that are unexpected, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats throughout. Nope is a must-watch thriller on Amazon Prime Video, especially for fans of thrilling narratives.\n"}

Prior to the Blumhouse slasher comedy, Khan had scored acclaim for her work as creator and showrunner of ABC's Fresh off the Boat and American Dad!, followed by her feature directorial debut with the Randall Park and Ali Wong-led Always Be My Maybe.\nKhan has assembled a star-studded roster for Totally Killer, including The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina alum Kiernan Shipka, Olivia Holt, Julie Bowen, Liana Liberato, Charlie Gillespie, and Randall Park. Khan's debut in the horror genre brings all of the sharp humor that has defined her work in the past while also delivering the shocking thrills expected of an entertaining slasher.\nRelated: New On Amazon Prime Video: All 138 Movies & TV Shows Arriving In October\nAhead of the movie's release, Screen Rant spoke exclusively with director Nahnatchka Khan to discuss making the jump from comedy to horror, her biggest goals for her on-set environment, and thoughts on a potential sequel.\nScreen Rant: I'm so excited to talk about Totally Killer. I've been a fan of your work since Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, and I loved what you did on Always Be My Maybe, which makes your transition towards horror with this film really intriguing. What about the script really sparked your interest to want to do that, even if it still has some comedy elements?\nNahnatchka Khan: Yeah, I'm a horror fan, just as a viewer and audience, I love the genre. So, after I did Always Be My Maybe, I kind of just sat down generally with Jason Blum and the team at Blumhouse, and I just was fanning out to them. I was like, \"I love what you guys do, and I'm a fan,\" and they were like, \"Let's figure something out. Let's do some sort of mash-up.\" So, we've been talking about it, and then they sent me Totally Killer, and usually when you get a script, it has the synopsis or whatever. But this had nothing, it was just a script, so I truly didn't know. I was like, \"It's coming from Blumhouse, so I know there's got to be some sort of horror thing,\" and so then, when I got locked into the premise, I was like, \"Oh my god, this is so much fun, I could have a ton of fun with this.\" It just made a lot of sense, and it was an exciting challenge.\nBlumhouse always has a horror edge to their stuff with Freaky with Happy Death Day, and this feels like it fits nicely in there. I said it before, but this is also a very funny movie, which is obviously in your wheelhouse. What was it like finding the right balance between the humor and some of the genuine slasher thrills?\nNahnatchka Khan: I think it was wanting to kind of lull you into this world, and not starting from too dark of a place, and then surprising you when it sort of takes a hard turn with that first kill sequence and being like, \"Oh, okay, we're going for it, we're not checking our swing here, there's a slasher on the loose, there's gonna be some gory kills and some gruesome moments.\" It's really just understanding that those two things can live together and can coexist, so always leading with comedy, I think, allows for the horror to shine. Like, those are not the comedy set pieces, right? It's around that, and then of course, the time travel element has to come into play as well, and get that in there.\nKiernan obviously has a history in horror, and you and Randall have a history together, but the rest of this ensemble around them is just incredible to watch. What was it like building this cast to really embody these characters?\nNahnatchka Khan: It was so fun. I mean, it was a challenge, because we obviously had people playing one role 35 years apart. So, starting with like Olivia Holt, who plays Kiernan's peer/young mother, she's amazing. The two of them together are just so much fun, and then getting Julie Bowen to play the older Olivia, they look like [each other], it feels like, \"Okay, that tracks.\" Then, building out the rest of the world and having these kids who were young adults now living and embodying these 1980s tropes, going back to the John Hughes era that they didn't live through, and kind of talking them through [it].\nThey have all the reference points, that was the thing that was really cool, too, about working with the cast is I came in armed with all these movies that I was going to have them watch to be prepared. Not only had they seen them, but they threw it back at me, and they were like, \"Have you seen this, this, that?\" I was like, \"No.\" So I left being like, \"Alright, let me go watch some of this stuff,\" because they are so aware, and so ready for the challenge, it was really fun.\nThat's awesome. Did you have a favorite of the movies that they gave you?\nNahnatchka Khan: There was some obscure '90s [movie], I gotta find the name of it, but it was something I'd never heard of before. It was like some, like, Brazilian movie — I'll find it, and I'll make sure it gets sent to you, because it was really amazing.\nDid you have the time to allow the actors to form a rapport with one another, especially with the adult and younger counterparts, to get the chance to join together and find the characters together?\nNahnatchka Khan: Definitely, as much as possible. When we were all on set together, we would have just actor meetings with the actors that were playing the same role, just so they can kind of get to know each other. So, Charlie Gillespie and Lochlyn Munro were together, Julie and Olivia. It was just a fun way to hang out, and kind of not mirror each other, but sort of see what the other one is doing. We had table reads, so everybody could get on the same page. Just wanted to keep it loose, so they can feel comfortable to bring their talent to it, and elevate it, and they really all stepped up. It was just such a fun challenge, and so great to watch them work.\nThis is a movie that, much like Happy Death Day, ends on a mostly conclusive note with maybe a hint or two that it could continue. Do you have any ideas about a possible sequel, or would you want to come back and continue this story?\nNahnatchka Khan: You know, it's funny, I think from like, day two of shooting, our DP, Judd Overton, kept saying every day, at the end of this movie, there's still a time travel device left in 1987, and we were like, \"That's true. That's true.\" So he's banging the drum that there could be a sequel where somebody from the '80s now comes to the present day, if they find that time machine, so you know, anything is possible.\n35 years after the shocking murder of three teens, the infamous “Sweet Sixteen Killer“ returns on Halloween night to claim a fourth victim. 17-year-old Jamie (Kiernan Shipka) ignores her overprotective mom’s (Julie Bowen) warning and comes face to face with the masked maniac and on the run for her life, accidentally time travels back to 1987, the year of the original killings.

{"title": "Godzilla's Name for King Kong Explains Why Their Battle Was Inevitable", "date": "2023-10-05 21:30:25", "text": "Godzilla vs Kong is an epic film with one of the best monster battles in history, & the reason why they fought was due to Godzilla's name for Kong. \nIt’s no secret that Godzilla and King Kong are rivals, as these Titans have faced off in not one, but two separate continuities, including and especially the most recent MonsterVerse film Godzilla vs Kong. While the visual spectacle of having these two behemoths battle it out on the big screen is reason enough to pit them against each other, there’s a far less meta purpose for their fight as well, and Godzilla’s name for King Kong explains exactly why their MonsterVerse battle was inevitable.\nIn the original 1962 film King Kong vs Godzilla, Kong was taken from his home and brought to Godzilla’s territory in order to fight the kaiju on behalf of humanity, despite the fact that the two monsters had never heard of each other before and had no reason to fight beyond proving which one was the strongest. There wasn’t much background or motivation for either Kong or Godzilla, but then again, there didn’t really need to be. Two iconic monsters (one more recognizable in Japan, the other an American classic) in a movie together, fighting to see who would win, is fun enough as it is. In the newly-established MonsterVerse films, however, Godzilla and Kong have a deep-seated rivalry that stretches back generations for both their species. That’s why Godzilla and Kong fought in 2021’s Godzilla vs Kong, and that’s why Godzilla had his own special name for Kong before the events of that movie even took place: the Rival.\nIn Godzilla: Dominion by Greg Keyes and Drew Johnson, readers are shown what Godzilla was doing before the events of Godzilla vs Kong following his narrow victory over King Ghidorah in Godzilla: King of the Monsters. The book gave fans a bit more insight into Godzilla’s thought process, as well as revealing another interesting ability movie fans didn’t know he had. Godzilla has the power to tap into the entire world, and feel things happening on the planet the same way one can feel something on their skin. This is how Godzilla knows when there is conflict, or when someone or something is overstepping their boundaries and needs to be put in place. More than that, though, Godzilla can constantly feel Kong’s challenging presence on his world, with every moment Kong continues to exist without recognizing his supremacy being like an itch Godzilla just can’t scratch.\nGodzilla’s species and Kong’s species used to live together in the Hollow Earth, where remnants of a great battle between them were discovered in Godzilla vs Kong (and where Kong got that sweet Godzilla-killing ax). It’s for this reason that Godzilla immediately recognizes Kong’s presence on Earth as that of his ultimate, instinctual rival, and why it was inevitable that the two would fight. Again, the issue here isn’t that Kong didn’t bow before Godzilla like the other Titans did in King of the Monsters, it’s that Kong is inherently a threat to Godzilla’s kingship. Add that to the fact that Godzilla can feel Kong’s every move with his planet-scoping power, and the ultimate battle between the two was completely unavoidable.\nThankfully, by the end of Godzilla vs Kong, the two were able to work out some sort of unspoken agreement that would allow both of them to exist on the same planet at the same time without further conflict. However, that initial conflict was necessary either way, regardless of the outcome, and Godzilla’s names for King Kong explains why.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "Hulk Vs She-Hulk: Who Is The Stronger Gamma-Powered Superhero?", "date": "2023-10-05 21:40:25", "text": "Hulk and She-Hulk's MCU power level is extremely high, but there's one key difference that makes one Gamma monster stronger than the other.\nAlthough the MCU's Hulk and She-Hulk draw their power from the same source, one of them has a clear advantage over the other. Gamma monsters are especially powerful MCU characters due to their sheer strength and durability. Even when they give up power in exchange for intelligence, they're still stronger than most Marvel superheroes. And to top it off, they can also become exponentially stronger according to their rage level.\nHulk's MCU origin story is inherently tied to Captain America, as the experiment that resulted in Bruce Banner's first transformation aimed to replicate the original Super Soldier serum. With the addition of Gamma radiation and Bruce Banner's pent-up rage, the experiment resulted in the birth of a monster with seemingly endless energy and strength: Hulk. Hulk then inspired the creation of other Gamma monsters, either voluntarily or accidentally — namely, the Abomination, the Leader, and She-Hulk, all of which have more natural control over their consciousness but less power and endurance.\nHulk's MCU power level has varied a lot throughout the years. First, The Incredible Hulk showed that Hulk is capable of mowing down whole military squads with ease, though he might struggle against certain weapons like Stark Industries' sonar cannons and against a similar Gamma monster, like the original no-holds-barred Abomination. Hulk's return in The Avengers increased his power to the point of being able to stop a Chitauri Leviathan on its tracks with a single punch, as well as brush off a hit from Thor's Mjolnir and survive a swarm attack from the Chitauri army. This same Hulk accomplishes a similar feat with Ultron's army in Avengers: Age of Ultron, but gets knocked out by Iron Man's Hulkbuster machine after an intense battle between the two Avengers.\nHulk's pinnacle of power in the MCU came in Thor: Ragnarok, where a smarter Hulk had already become a champion gladiator after defeating a variety of intergalactic warriors on the Grandmaster's arena. Thor: Ragnarok's Hulk is strong enough to defeat Fenrir single-handedly and land some blows on a giant-sized Surtur, though the only reason he can defeat Thor in gladiatorial combat is that the Grandmaster intervenes. After Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War showed that Hulk's strength is no match for Thanos' fighting skills, and Smart Hulk's introduction in Avengers: Endgame put an end to the Hulk's immense feats of power — but not before he proved that his body is still durable enough to withstand the power of all six Infinity Stones.\nJennifer Walters' first transformation into She-Hulk came with the reveal that she doesn't need to lose her calm in order to tap into her Gamma power. She-Hulk can take advantage of all of her abilities at any time, including super strength, super speed, a fast healing factor, and the Hulk's emblematic thunderclap. During her training with Smart Hulk, She-Hulk demonstrates her immense base-level strength by throwing Smart Hulk around and putting up a decent fight, yet it's obvious that Smart Hulk is holding back. However, this fight scene is only She-Hulk's first time getting to know her powers.\nRelated: She-Hulk Ending Explained (In Detail)\nShe-Hulk's following fights in She-Hulk: Attorney At Law don't require her to use her full strength. In fact, she walks right through most of them unharmed and mostly unbothered, with opponents like the Wrecking Crew, Leap-Frog's henchmen, and Marvel Studios' employees failing to land a single blow on her. As She-Hulk still lacks experience, she struggles to match Daredevil's agility, which leads her to resort to a thunderclap to stop him. However, more training and more demanding fights against stronger opponents could force She-Hulk to reach her full potential in a future Marvel Cinematic Universe movie or show.\nHulk, more specifically Bruce Banner's Savage Hulk persona, is undeniably the most powerful Hulk in the MCU, at least up until Phase 5. Not only is the original Hulk bigger, stronger, and more brutal, but he also has the advantage of being fueled by pure rage. Hulk feeds from Bruce Banner's repressed anger to power himself and recover from any injury, growing stronger in the process. Although clever opponents like Iron Man and Thanos have found ways to neutralize Hulk, Hulk still stands out as a highly adaptable character. Hulk's main weakness, if anything, is his will to fight, as his losses in Avengers: Age of Ultron and Avengers: Infinity War are influenced by his state of mind.\nRelated: Every Way The Original Hulk Can Return To The MCU\nShe-Hulk is also powerful, but apart from her lack of experience, she isn't interested in fighting. If she were, it's possible that all of her abilities would increase proportionally to her rage and energy. Given that Bruce Banner found a way to merge his human self with Hulk's persona, there could also be a way to unleash She-Hulk's full potential, possibly turning her into a monster as big and unstoppable as the original Savage Hulk. But while there's a precedent of such a transformation in Marvel Comics, the MCU's She-Hulk is highly unlikely to risk her human consciousness in order to pursue Hulk's full power.\n"}
{"title": "Welcome To Plathville: Ethan Plath's Cheating Rumors Explained", "date": "2023-10-05 21:50:17", "text": "Welcome to Plathville's Ethan and Olivia Plath are dealing with cheating rumors. The gossip about Ethan's date with another woman's troubling. \nIf the recent cheating rumors are true, Welcome to Plathville's Ethan and Olivia Plath are possibly on the rocks, and it's time to talk about that gossip. In season 5, the pair are dealing with so much stress, thanks to Olivia's feuds with Kim, Barry and Moriah Plath. Ethan thinks he's caught in the middle, and that kind of drama generally doesn't help a person to keep their marriage afloat. Over the years, the Plath family's made Olivia's life a living hell. Now, many Plaths, including Kim, are giving her the silent treatment. Some of the Plath kids have unloaded about their sister-in-law online.\nOlivia's had the hardest journey on the show, except perhaps for Moriah, who's talked about being in a dark place during Welcome to Plathville season 5. Kim didn't approve of Olivia, and Barry followed suit. They had no faith in their daughter-in-law, who made efforts to smooth things over. She worked hard to build bonds with some Plath family members, including Moriah. Olivia succeeded in many ways. However, during this installment, everything's falling apart onscreen. Olivia's being shunned, and she may be bailing out on her marriage. While Ethan was caught with another woman, that doesn't mean that he ended things with Olivia. She might have walked away.\nRight now, there's no proof that Ethan and Olivia are done, but there are clues that don't look good. Ethan definitely seemed to be on a date when a fan caught him dancing with another woman in a Minnesota bar, as per Without A Crystal Ball at Instagram. They were reportedly holding hands while they danced. The woman was described as a brunette who definitely wasn't redhead Olivia. Ethan doesn't really seem like the type to step out on his marriage, so possibly the divorce rumors, which have been running rampant, are one hundred percent accurate. If they are, reality TV show star Ethan's branching out following a separation, rather than actually cheating.\nIf Ethan and Olivia are still together, he might have been caught red-handed with a woman who isn't his wife. In that case, it would be very shocking. Based on what's unfolded onscreen over the years, Ethan's a loyal guy. He's stuck with Olivia, who may be the new Kim, through some very hard times, and was totally crushed when she wanted a break. He appeared to be very depressed.\nPeople change, so maybe he's not in the same state of mind now. He may feel differently about his wife, and be ready to live his life without her. It wouldn't be a surprise if Ethan and Olivia imploded, because the type of pressure they've been under through five Welcome to Plathville seasons has been significant. Most couples would have folded long ago, throwing in the towel just to avoid the mother-in-law drama and other feuds. Instead of calling it quits, Ethan and Olivia made an effort to heal their relationship. They went to Europe, traveling around to escape from the realities of being members of the Plath family.\nWhen they returned, they learned that Moriah had fled the Tampa home she shared with them without telling them first. Ethan and Olivia have been married since 2018, and they've weathered some extreme ups and downs. However, the rift with Moriah, with whom Olivia was once so close, seemed like quite a hurdle to overcome. Did it break the couple?\nOlivia's sister Sophia Meggs said that Ethan and Olivia are currently divorcing, but Olivia denied it. Nonetheless, something seems to be wrong. The pair just don't appear to be on the same page. They're not posting about each other lately, and they're sort of avoiding the elephant in the room at Instagram. Of course, their reluctance to address the rumors at IG, where they both have sizable followings, seems very relevant. It's possible that fans will see one of those polite but sad divorce announcements soon. If so, what does that mean for the future of the show? Will it end after Welcome to Plathville season 5?\nSource: Without A Crystal Ball/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "Was Halloween Ends Really That Bad? Re-Examining The $105M Disappointment, 1 Year Later", "date": "2023-10-05 21:50:25", "text": "Halloween Ends is one of the most controversial entries in the beloved horror franchise, but looking back on the film, is it really that bad?\nHalloween Ends is one of the most controversial films in the iconic horror franchise, and while the $105 million box office disappointment was initially met with poor reception, was it really that bad? Halloween Ends came out one year ago in October 2022, with the film wrapping up David Gordon Green's Halloween reboot trilogy. The third entry in the trilogy was definitely a risky move, with it putting a new spin on the Halloween franchise that hadn't been seen before. However, this spin didn't resonate with many Halloween fans, leading to Halloween Ends becoming a critical and commercial failure - but did it deserve this reception?\nHalloween Ends is the final entry in the Halloween reboot trilogy, which itself retconned all of the Halloween sequels and directly followed up on John Carpenter's 1978 original. Halloween Ends is set four years after the events of Halloween Kills, with Michael Myers having been missing for the previous few Halloweens. In his absence, the town of Haddonfield has grown increasingly paranoid and violent, almost as if Myers had put a curse on the town. Unbeknownst to Haddonfield's residents, Michael Myers has been living in the sewers, healing himself as he prepares to reign terror once again. However, this time the masked killer has some help.\nThe Halloween reboot trilogy had a pretty poor time in the critical marketplace, with none of the films being met with overwhelming positive reviews. Reviews for Halloween 2018 were ok, but the same can't be said for Halloween Kills or the subject of this analysis, 2022's Halloween Ends. As of the writing of this article, Halloween Ends sits at a 40% critical rating and a 57% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes, showing that the film didn't really gel with either fans or critics. Upon its release, Halloween Ends was torn to shreds, with a movement to reassess the movie only starting up recently.\nFans and critics had many problems with Halloween Ends, but they mostly are due to Michael Myers' connection to Corey Cunningham. In the film, Corey begins making a name for himself as a masked killer in Haddonfield, with him even acting as Michael Myers' sidekick at some points. Corey was arguably the main character in the film, which was a point of contention with fans. According to these fans, the scary part of Michael Myers is his mystery, something that doesn't work with Corey due to his prominence in the film. Some have even called Halloween Ends the worst entry in the franchise, showing how disappointing it was to some.\nHalloween Ends' critical reception wasn't the only thing that was disappointing, as the box office was pretty underwhelming as well. Halloween Ends made only $105.4 million on a $33 million budget, which is a huge step-down from Halloween 2018 making $259.9 million on a $10 million budget. While Halloween Ends was probably profitable, it most likely didn't meet the expectations of the studio. This financial failure is mostly due to Halloween Ends having a simultaneous release in theaters and on Peacock, with this streaming strategy undoubtedly kneecapping the film's box office returns. Thus, Halloween Ends failed on both critical and commercial fronts.\nRelated: Halloween Ends Cast & Character Guide\nAlthough Halloween Ends was received poorly, it is not nearly as bad as initially thought. The themes that are pulled in due to Corey Cunningham's story are truly unique to Halloween Ends, with them not having been seen in the franchise before. Halloween Ends also features some moments that are truly surprising, such as the opening scene. Halloween Ends' never lets the audience in on where it's going, so while every idea may not work out, it is at least trying something new. Corey Cunningham is the breath of fresh air that Halloween needed, which is why it's so odd that the film has been looked down upon.\nHalloween Ends may not live up to the original, but it is definitely more interesting than its two predecessors. Halloween 2018 and Halloween Kills are just lazy rehashes of the original film, with them not taking any risks. Because of this, both movies just feel like watered down versions of John Carpenter's original. Halloween Ends, on the other hand, isn't afraid to take risks, which is why it's so good. The only flaw with the film is its ending, with Michael's fight with Laurie Strode feeling completely detached from the rest of the story. Notably, this is the film's most similar scene to previous Halloween movies.\nThe Halloween franchise will continue into the future, causing many to wonder how this will affect the reception and canon status of Halloween Ends. Halloween Ends makes some wild choices near its end, including killing off Michael Myers. Due to the nature of Michael's death in Halloween Ends, it is impossible to say that he somehow lived (unless he is a supernatural entity). Because of this, future Halloween projects either have to be a prequel or they have to retcon Halloween Ends. With the rights to Halloween currently being sold, it seems as some studios have a plan for the franchise's future.\nInterestingly, Halloween Ends not truly being the end could be the best thing for the film's reception in the long-run. Many of the criticisms of Halloween Ends have to do with the film concluding the franchise by focusing on an original character rather than Laurie or Michael Myers. If more Halloween movies and TV shows are made, then Halloween Ends won't have ended the franchise on this note, fixing this problem. Halloween Ends may start seeing more positive reception as future Halloween projects get made, with this critical turnaround already being seen online.\nHalloween III: Season of the Witch was initially received poorly due to it not featuring Michael Myers, but it has become a cult classic in recent years. This same trend may repeat itself with Halloween Ends, with the film eventually being held in high regard for being so different. No other Halloween movie is like Halloween III: Season of the Witch, and the same can be said for Halloween Ends. Thus, it can be expected that fans and critics alike will have a more positive outlook on Halloween Ends in the future, redeeming the film that was already great from the start.\nRobert Pitman is a Movies/TV features writer for ScreenRant and loves all things nerdy.

Contains spoilers for Catwoman #57!There's one hero in Gotham that Red Hood respects more than others. While facing off against his former mentor, Jason Todd informs Batman of a hero that the vigilante is starting to hold in high regard.\nIn Catwoman #57 by Tini Howard and Nico Leon, Batman is still in shock from losing his Batcave to Vandal Savage. As Bruce makes his next plans to stop Catwoman's newest criminal enterprise, Selina is one step ahead. She comes up with a plan to train her underlings to become car thieves and puts Red Hood in charge of the operation.\nAs Red Hood and a group of thieves pose as valets, Batman comes to stop him. Jason leads Bruce on a chase to distract him while Selina and several of her trainees rob a gala blind. Batman doesn't hold back from his former sidekick and yanks Red Hood off of his motorcycle with a grapple gun. As Bruce begs Jason to stop his alliance with Catwoman, Jason makes the point that he has a lot more in common with Selina than Bruce. Red Hood makes it blunt that he believes in Selina and her plan to make Gotham better.\nThe \"Gotham War\" crossover has made some major cracks in the Bat-Family. While Batman was recovering from Knight Terrors, Catwoman began training low-level criminals to break out on their own and target Gotham's wealthiest. As a result, Gotham's supervillains are floundering from a lack of henchmen and street crime has gone considerably down. All Selina asked was for the Bat-Family to not interrupt her operation, but Batman starkly refused. With no one but Damian on his side, Batman has begun pushing himself to end Catwoman's plans by any means necessary.\nBatman has lost nearly all his allies due to them seeing the validity of Catwoman's plans but it's surprising to see Jason on board with her. After all, just a few years before this, he spent his days terrorizing those who broke the law, killing an untold number of criminals. Now he's wholeheartedly endorsing Selina's plan. Admittedly, his line of logic makes sense. Both Jason and Selina didn't have the privileged upbringing that Bruce had and understand how desperation drives people to crime. For better or worse, Catwoman is actively changing Gotham for the better, and her work is doing what Batman never could: Inspire Red Hood.\nIt's not a stretch to say that Batman and Red Hood have a combative relationship. Jason has tried over and over again to get Bruce's approval but has had a tough time earning it. Selina, on the other hand, acknowledges the skills Jason has and has rewarded his efforts by making him a huge part of her plans. Red Hood is getting something from Catwoman that he hasn't gotten from Batman in a while: Respect and appreciation. In turn, Jason is confirming that he respects what Selina is doing and admits that he truly thinks she can make the city better.

From Casper to The Pope’s Exorcist, Netflix’s selection of supernatural and horror-related movies are perfect for revisiting old favorites or experiencing a story’s thrills and scares for the first time.\nRelated: 10 Best Horror Movies On Netflix In October\nAmong the greatest Halloween movies available on Netflix is Casper, the 1995 supernatural coming-of-age dramedy starring The Addams Family’s Christina Ricci. Based on the Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoons, the 1995 movie follows teenager Kat (Ricci) as she joins her father James (Bill Pullman) to communicate with Casper and his fellow ghosts, who peacefully haunt a mansion in Maine. Casper quickly falls for Kat, but his deceased nature and mischievous ghostly uncles cause trouble for the young pair. The box office hit is still as charming today as it was 28 years ago, making Casper one of the best nostalgia watches this Halloween on Netflix.\nSteven Spielberg ushered in a wave of blockbuster filmmaking with Jaws in 1975, which remains one of the scariest and most thrilling movies nearly 50 years later. Jaws, which is based on the same-titled 1974 novel, surrounds the summer resort town of Amity as a man-eating great white shark continues to attack beachgoers, leading the police chief Brody, marine biologist Hooper, and professional shark hunter Quint to team up and hunt down the sea creature. The three-time Oscar winner has been frightening people out of the water for several decades since its debut, with Jaws’ streaming availability on Netflix being apt to scare new generations of prospective beachgoers.\nA prequel to the 2014 box off hit Ouija, Mike Flanagan’s horror movie follow-up premiered in 2016 to significantly greater critical acclaim than its predecessor. Ouija: Origin of Evil takes the story back to 1967, beginning when a widow working as a spiritual medium introduces a Ouija board into her family’s phony séance business. When the board actually conjures a spirit that possesses her daughter, Ouija: Origin of Evil takes twisted turns that prove to be even scarier and dramatic than the original movie. Mike Flanagan proves to be the king of horror on Netflix, with his Universal-backed Ouija: Origin of Evil being available alongside his Netflix originals this Halloween.\nThe cult classic 2008 horror movie The Strangers stands out among Netflix’s Halloween movie catalog. While it received mixed reviews upon release and became a sleeper hit at the box office, The Strangers’ cult status turned it into a multi-film franchise with three follow-ups already confirmed. The true story-inspired psychological horror film offers plenty of scares and homages to classic slashers from the 1970s, with The Strangers itself having often been reassessed as a modern horror classic.\nRob Zombie’s movie adaptation of the classic 1960s sitcom The Munsters arrived on Netflix in 2022, serving as the origin story of the romance between Herman and Lily Munster. While Rob Zombie’s The Munsters movie wasn’t received very well by critics, the cult approach of the adaptation makes it ripe for better reception upon additional viewing. Zombie may be better known for his gorier horror outings, but Netflix original movie The Munsters provides a charming PG-rated macabre story that the entire family can enjoy.\nThe second installment in Netflix 2021 Fear Street movie trilogy, Fear Street Part Two: 1978 takes the story back to a fateful night in the Shadyside and Sunnyvale lore. The two towns are brought together for summer camp only for a killer to gruesomely attack Camp Nightwing’s kids and teens, with plenty of Easter eggs and homages to classic flasher movies like Friday the 13th. Starring Stranger Things’ Sadie Sink and One Piece’s Emily Rudd, Fear Street Part Two: 1978’s ending features some unexpected twists and that brilliantly lead into the trilogy’s third and final installment.\nFrom Coraline and The Nightmare Before Christmas director Henry Selick, Wendell & Wild revives the classic stop-motion animated horror movie trend with a spooky story about two demon brothers who receive help from an orphaned teenage girl. The 2022 Netflix original movie surprisingly boasts a PG-13 rating, making the stop-motion film’s macabre themes more suitable for older audiences. However, the critically-acclaimed movie still provides plenty of spooky humor and striking visuals that make it a perfect Halloween watch.\nAlso streaming on Netflix this Halloween is Hotel Transylvania 2, the second installment in Todd Durham’s monster franchise. The 2015 animated box office hit brings back voice actors such as Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James, and Keegan-Michael Key as Dracula, his classic monster friends and family, and human son-in-law. Coming in at under 90 minutes, the spooky family-friendly monster movie provides a brief and entertaining story to stream on Netflix this Halloween season.\nAdam Sandler’s 2020 supernatural mystery movie Hubie Halloween may not have landed with critics, but the comedy still boasts a talented ensemble cast and entertaining story to get into the Halloween spirit. The Netflix original follows the titular character (played by Sandler) on Halloween as he monitors the town of Salem, Massachusetts in an attempt to save his fellow residents from a kidnapper. Adam Sandler has produced numerous comedy movies for Netflix over the years, with Hubie Halloween providing annual holiday fun that appeals to kids and adults alike.\nThe 2008 animated horror-comedy Igor is also available to watch on Netflix this Halloween. While originally receiving mixed reviews from critics, Igor has gained a cult following over the 15 years since its release, with its availability on Netflix’s Halloween hub inevitably introducing it to a new generation of viewers. Igor is inspired by the titular character who has appeared in various forms in supernatural monster movies, typically as an assistant to an evil scientist or villainous monster. However, this animated movie flips the evil scientist assistant trope, as Igor accidentally creates a kind female monster in his attempt to move from assistant to an evil scientist himself.\nIn addition to his Ouija prequel, Mike Flanagan’s 2017 psychological horror movie Gerald’s Game is streaming on Netflix in October 2023. The Netflix original movie is based on Stephen King’s 1992 novel of the same name, which had largely been considered unfilmable before Flanagan’s critically acclaimed outing. Starring frequent Mike Flanagan collaborators Carla Gugino, Bruce Greenwood, Kate Siegel, and Henry Thomas, Gerald’s Game is centered around Jessie Burlingame, who is left stranded and handcuffed to her bed without a key after her husband dies of a heart attack. While trying to survive in the isolated cabin, Jessie is confronted with her personal demons in one of Mike Flanagan’s most chilling movies.\nJohn Carpenter’s 1998 neo-Western horror movie Vampires is streaming on Netflix just in time for Halloween viewing. The Halloween director’s film follows a team of vampire hunters who try to prevent a centuries-old cross from falling into the hands of a powerful vampire, which leads to non-stop gory showdowns. While not as critically adored his Carpenter’s classics like Halloween and The Thing, 1998’s Vampires takes him into another horror subgenre that still embodies the filmmaker’s iconic style.\nGuillermo del Toro has proven himself to be a master in the supernatural horror genre, with Crimson Peak’s gothic romance story being a brilliant execution of his visual style and themes. The 2015 movie stars Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, and Tom Hiddleston in Edwardian-era England as a newly-married young aspiring author moves into an isolated Gothic mansion with new husband and sister-in-law. However, she soon must solve a twisted mystery as ghosts haunt her new abode. With primarily positive reviews from critics and several award wins in the horror genre, Crimson Peak is a brilliantly spooky movie to watch on Netflix this Halloween.\nThe third installment in Netflix’s Fear Street movie trilogy, Fear Street Part Three: 1666 brings the tale back to the titular year while revealing the truth behind Sarah Fier and the “cursed” nature of Shadyside. The twists in the flashbacks lead to a thrilling reckoning in the “present” timeline of 1994, which continues the gory nature of the first two installments. Fear Street Part Three: 1666 received the highest critical acclaim of the three movies, marking a satisfying conclusion to the scary R.L. Stine-inspired Netflix trilogy.\nThe 2022 horror film The Invitation, inspired by the classic story Dracula, depicts the horrifying tale of a young woman who meets her long-lost family members after her mother’s death, leading to her discovery of their dangerous and dark secrets. While a modest success at the box office, The Invitation provides a chilling vampire story with a mesmerizing performance by former Game of Thrones actor Nathalie Emmanuele. Of the modern horror hits available to watch on Netflix this October, The Invitation will satisfy vampire subgenre Halloween viewing.\nThe 2019 supernatural horror movie The Wretched is another relatively recent outing available to steam on Netflix’s Halloween catalog. The creepy horror film follows a teenage boy who vies against an evil witch posing as his next-door neighbor, which satisfies many of the expected supernatural witch-in-the-woods movie tropes. The Wretched also boasts critical acclaim and a significant box office return, as the movie earned back over $4 million against a small budget under $100 thousand. With a teenage ensemble taking it upon themselves to battle a witch, The Wretched also drew frequent comparisons to Netflix’s own Stranger Things.\nCreep stands out as one of the most critically acclaimed horror movies within Netflix’s available Halloween content, as the 2014 found footage film received substantial praise from critics upon release. With plenty of thrills and captivating performances by its cast, Creep’s creepy tale follows a videographer who is tasked with filming an eccentric client at a remote cabin. The success of the Blumhouse-produced horror movie even spawned a critically acclaimed sequel in 2018, which is expected to be followed by the sequel Creep 3.\nNetflix has several Stephen King-inspired movies in its library, with 2019’s In the Tall Grass being based on the same-titled novella by King and his son Joe Hill. The Netflix original horror movie follows a brother and sister who are unable to escape a dangerous field of tall grass after entering in the hopes of saving a boy, providing plenty of scares expected of a Stephen King movie adaptation. In the Tall Grass also stars horror veteran Patrick Wilson, who is best known for his roles in The Conjuring and Insidious franchises.\nAnother Netflix original horror movie to stream this Halloween is The Babysitter, the streaming service’s 2017 black comedy horror film directed by McG. The Babysitter stars Scream Queen Samara Weaving, Judah Lewis, and Bella Thorne, with the film centering on a 12-year-old who learns that his babysitter is involved in a satanic cult that plans to kill him. The positively-reviewed Netflix original even launched a sequel in 2020, which stars Scream and Wednesday actress Jenna Ortega.\nAmong the most recent horror movies that is available to stream on Netflix for Halloween is The Pope’s Exorcist, which debuted in theaters in April 2023 to mixed reviews from critics, but proved successful at the box office. Starring Russell Crowe as the real demon-fighting exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth, The Pope’s Exorcist is inspired by the priest’s real claims, adding another creepy layer to the movie’s scares. Crowe’s performance allows Father Amorth’s demon-battling adventures to be a crowd-pleasing horror outing, providing a thrilling possession movie to watch this Halloween on Netflix.\n"}
{"title": "Star Wars Is Setting Up A Villain Bigger Than The  Force Itself", "date": "2023-10-05 22:30:23", "text": "Ahsoka's finale episode sets up a massively powerful villain for Star Wars' future and will likely require the entirety of the Force to defeat.\nWarning! This post contains SPOILERS for Ahsoka episode 8\nAhsoka has set up the canonical return of one of Star Wars' most powerful villains who's bigger than the Force itself. With a powerful presence calling to the Dark Jedi Baylan Skoll (Ray Stevenson), Ahsoka's finale episode gave a major tease as to who Baylan is searching for on the extragalactic world of Peridea. As such, it's quite possible that a huge new threat is coming in Star Wars' future that would be far worse than Grand Admiral Thrawn's return to the known galaxy.\nIn search of power referenced only in myth and fairytales, Baylan Skoll is driven by his desire to break the galaxy's never-ending cycle of light and dark. Rather than wanting to restore the Empire via Thrawn's return, Baylan has his own agenda as soon as he makes it to Peridea, the fabled homeworld of the Nightsisters located in another galaxy. To that end, a major hint in Ahsoka's finale suggests Baylan is being called by Abeloth, a major cosmic entity from Legends connected to the Ones of Mortis, the trio of Force gods first seen in The Clone Wars who have now returned in this new Star Wars show.\nKnown as the Queen of Stars and Bringer of Chaos, Abeloth was first introduced in Legends' Fate of the Jedi novels by Aaron Allston, Christie Golden, and Troy Denning. Set during the New Republic era, Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order faced Abeloth, a threat far more powerful than the Sith and the dark side. However, the books and Abeloth were removed from the official canon following Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm and the Star Wars IP back in 2012. Nevertheless, the provided backstory and origins for Abeloth are directly tied to the Ones who remained part of the canon given their appearances in The Clone Wars season 3.\nAbeloth was once a mortal woman who began serving the Ones as the Father strove to keep his children in balance, the Son embodying the dark side of the Force while the Daughter represented the light. Eventually, she became part of their family as the Mother, helping the Father keep the children in balance. However, the woman continued to age unlike her family of immortals, motivating her decision to drink and swim in the forbidden Font of Power and Pool of Knowledge.\nThe Mother transformed into the Force being known as Abeloth, gaining extreme power while also being corrupted and twisted to madness. As such, the Father and his children abandoned Abeloth for Mortis as the world quickly became corrupted and darkened. The Ones also created a prison to contain Abeloth, though she would break out anytime there was a major disruption in the balance of the Force, requiring the Son and Daughter to work together to imprison her once more. Once the Mortis gods died as seen in The Clone Wars season 3, Abeloth was unleashed for good during the New Republic era.\nRelated: Thrawn's Zombie Stormtroopers Explained: Magick, Power & Star Wars Future\nKeeping Abeloth and her Legends' history in mind, it does look as though Ahsoka is setting up her return to the official Star Wars canon very soon. Believing that even the Nightsisters' Great Mothers feared the hidden power calling to him, Baylan may be searching for Abeloth herself. Considering the power and magicks at the disposal of the Great Mothers, this mysterious being has to be something incredibly dangerous to get them so scared, and Abeloth definitely fits the bill. It would certainly explain why the Mothers are so subservient to Grand Admiral Thrawn seeing as how he's their only way to escape Peridea.\nAdditionally, Abeloth's imprisonment could also be why the witch kingdom fell in the first place and why the planet is largely a wasteland. Perhaps it was corrupted over time by Abeloth's influence and containment. Abeloth on Peridea could also explain why the purrgil star whales changed their migration routes in the ancient past, seeing as how they now only come to Peridea to die, hence the planet's rings being comprised solely of the whales' bones.\nIt's not hard to see how Abeloth and Baylan's goals could align. Wanting to create a new era for the galaxy that's no longer burdened by the constant conflict of light and dark, Abeloth could certainly manipulate Baylan into releasing her (if she hasn't broken free already). Following her corruption and descent into madness, Abeloth sought to bring about a galactic apocalypse, allowing her to create a brand-new galaxy in its place where she would be loved and adored (despite being an entity of pure chaos and entropy). As such, Abeloth calling out to Baylan is more than plausible.\nRelated: 15 Star Wars Easter Eggs In Episode 8\nAbeloth was already being theorized as the one calling Baylan Skoll before Ahsoka's finale. Now, Baylan finding massive statues of the Mortis gods hugely supports those ideas for Star Wars' future. Clearly, the Ones had an influence on Peridea which could very well be Abeloth's prison and/or her original world before the Force gods abandoned her for Mortis. To that end, this unnamed world was indeed described in the novels as a \"mountainous forest world\" just like the valley Baylan discovers at the end of Ahsoka. Perhaps it's one of the last regions that hasn't been turned into a wasteland from Abeloth's own influence on Peridea.\nAs seen in the final shots of Ahsoka's finale episode, the statue of the Father points across the valley to the mountains on the other side. Likewise, one of the peaks features some sort of shining beacon or glint, clearly representing the endpoint for Baylan's quest before he discovers who or what has been calling to him ever since he came to Peridea, having fully abandoned not only Morgan Elsbeth's efforts to bring back Thrawn but also Baylan's own apprentice Shin Hati. As such, the odds are very strong that Baylan will discover far more than he bargained for, especially if it's Abeloth.\nThere's some solid evidence that Abeloth will soon make her Star Wars comeback either in a possible Ahsoka season 2 or some other Star Wars project in the works. To that end, it will likely require both the light and dark sides of the Force joining together to even have a hope of containing Abeloth (let alone destroying her for good). Thanks to Baylan Skoll's discovery in Ahsoka's finale, the future of Star Wars just got incredibly exciting and even more dangerous all at the same time.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Masters Of The Air Is Already Beating Band Of Brothers' First Follow-Up In One Major Way", "date": "2023-10-05 22:30:23", "text": "The Pacific never reached the same heights as Band of Brothers, and Masters of Air has already gotten closer to the original series in one big way.\nThe team behind HBO's beloved series Band of Brothers is dipping back into WWII with Masters of the Air, and the latest follow-up already has a leg up on its predecessor, The Pacific. Debuting nine years after Band of Brothers originally aired, The Pacific acted as a companion to the widely acclaimed miniseries. Although it didn't quite measure up to the bar set by Band of Brothers, The Pacific was renowned for its visual and technical execution and overlapping individual stories as opposed to the broader focus of Band of Brothers.\nHowever, The Pacific never achieved the same level of popularity as Band of Brothers for a litany of reasons. Part of it was certainly its coverage of the Pacific War, widely considered a much more brutal and horrifying conflict than its European counterpart in WWII, which was viscerally depicted on screen. Another key element that The Pacific was missing was the massive, star-studded cast of Band of Brothers. In that regard, Masters of the Air is already improving upon the first companion series.\nThe cast of Band of Brothers was largely made up of small-time or unknown actors, some of whom went on to become major film stars. However, it also included a long list of already-established stars like David Schwimmer, Scott Grimes, Donnie Wahlberg and Ron Livingston. The Pacific was missing the excitement of those existing stars for people to look out for. While some of the members of the cast did go on to become major stars (including Rami Malek, Jon Bernthal and James Badge Dale), they were all relative unknowns at the time the show aired.\nRelated: Masters of the Air Has Broken a Major Band of Brothers Tradition (& It's Worrying)\nMasters of the Air will not have the same issue, as its cast will be led by two of cinema's more recognizable faces--Austin Butler and Barry Keoghan. Academy Award nominee Austin Butler is fresh off playing Elvis Presley in the acclaimed biopic Elvis, and has featured roles in the highly-anticipated upcoming movies The Bikeriders and Dune: Part II. One of his primary co-stars in Masters of the Air is the also-Academy Award-nominated Barry Keoghan, who has had significant roles in cinematic juggernauts like Marvels The Eternals and Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk. Both actors are supremely talented, which is an exciting prospect for how emotionally impactful Masters of the Air will be.\nThe first images from Masters of the Air provided a glimpse of the aesthetic that will dominate the companion series, as well as the first look at Butler and Keoghan's characters. Butler is set to portray Major Gale Cleven, and Keoghan will play Lt. Curtis Biddick, both of whom were real-life members of the 100th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces. Nicknamed \"The Bloody Hundredth\" due to how few of their pilots returned from their raids in 1943, the 100th Bombardment Group attacked German forces and industrial targets across Western Europe.\nButler and Keoghan's real-life counterparts were both B-17 Flying Fortress bomber pilots, which will certainly be reflected in the show given that it is accurately based upon the book Masters of the Air from historian Donald L. Miller. Early images from Masters of the Air seem to indicate that while Butler and Keoghan may be the primary leads for the show, emphasis and screen time will be dispersed among the entire ensemble cast, much as it was for Band of Brothers. The return to that format is exciting in itself, but the fact that it will be led by two legitimate stars gives Masters of the Air and early leg up on its predecessor The Pacific.\n"}
{"title": "Totally Killer Producers Talk Blumhouse's Time Travel Slasher Thriller & Challenge Of Modest Budgets", "date": "2023-10-05 22:30:23", "text": "Totally Killer producers Greg Gilreath and Adam Hendricks talk Blumhouse's time-traveling slasher and the challenge of trimming modest budget scripts.\nFrom the studio behind hit horror-comedy mashups Freaky and Happy Death Day comes another fresh take on the slasher genre with Totally Killer. The Blumhouse-produced title centers on a teenager whose mother is killed by a serial killer who terrorized her small town almost 30 years before and finds a way to time travel back to the original killing spree, leading her to team up with the younger version of her mom and her friends to stop the killer and get back to the present before it's too late.\nThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina alum Kiernan Shipka leads the star-studded Totally Killer cast alongside Olivia Holt, Julie Bowen, Randall Park, Lochlyn Munro, Charlie Gillespie, Liana Liberato, Kelcey Mawema, Stephi Cin-Salvo and Anna Diaz. Bringing the same self-aware humor as Blumhouse's prior genre mashups for another hilarious and thrilling combo, the movie arrives just in time for the Halloween season.\nRelated: New On Amazon Prime Video: All 138 Movies & TV Shows Arriving In October\nIn anticipation of the movie's release, Screen Rant spoke exclusively with producers Greg Gilreath and Adam Hendricks to discuss Totally Killer, the search for the perfect director for the script's vision, and the challenge of trimming down scenes to accommodate larger set pieces.\nScreen Rant: Greg, I'm very excited to talk about Totally Killer. How did the script first come to you, and what about it really spoke to your interest to want to help produce it?\nGreg Gilreath: Great questions, it was a script that was floating around at Amazon, and they were kind of up on it. We had partnered with Blumhouse and Amazon on this sort of small slate of films, and it was one that was in the mix. Just reading it, it was so apparent right away that this was something that could be really memorable, really fun, and really stand out and allow you to have a great viewing experience. A lot of these comedy-horror films are really reliant on self-referential [humor], sort of really understanding the depths of the slasher genre, or things like that.\nI really love that this was kind of an entry point into the into this thing, it was like, \"You don't need the deep knowledge of slasher films,\" it could kind of be a first step in, and it really was so comedy forward, we knew that we had the right director and the right cast on this. It could be sort of a door into the horror genre for a lot of people who might tell themselves, \"I don't like horror films,\" and I think it really has succeeded in that, because it's so funny, and here's so much heart. All the comedy comes from character, and emotion, and nostalgia, and sort of subverting nostalgia, as opposed to being like, \"Hey, you remember that scene in Prom Night when this thing happened? And if you don't, you won't get the joke.\"\nAdam Hendricks: I think that there are a few things. One is that the scope is really fun, it's a challenge, there's big action set pieces, lots of extras in '80s costumes, hair even, like, hair's a big deal. I think that was really exciting. I think that for us, humor wise, the opportunity of doing a film where someone with a contemporary viewpoint goes back to the '80s where people are unfiltered, and all of a sudden, just realizing that that time that I was born in — it's so long ago from now, it's as far away as the '80s were from the '40s like, how insane is that conceptually?\nFinally, [we just] love Natch, what a cool filmmaker, what a great person to get behind. This is her only horror thing, we loved all her non-horror stuff, and Greg and I think our tastes go way beyond, even though we're like we're such horror babies, we also just love all types of film. To have someone who's succeeded in television shows, but also rom-coms, and basically saying, \"I really want to murder people on screen,\" it's like, how do you not get behind that?\nYou talked about looking for the right director and the right cast, which did you find was the most important step first? Did you feel that the script needed to be touched up, or did you feel that Blumhouse and Amazon already had it set up, and you just wanted to help get the director?\nGreg Gilreath: I think it's always director first. It was a great script, but the thing that we always look for in a director that didn't write the script is a director who is like, \"This is a great foundation, but here's how I'm going to do this and make this my own.\" We knew that the script was excellent, but that finding that director who had a vision for it and had like a real keen understanding of, \"This is how I will hone this, and shape this, and maybe change it up just a little bit from what it was originally conceived,\" that was by far the most important piece of this puzzle.\nHow challenging would you say that journey was to find the perfect person who had that vision?\nGreg Gilreath: It was both incredibly difficult and incredibly easy. It's like when it's blue skies, and in your mind, you could have anything that you could possibly ever imagine or go out to any director, you have lists with hundreds of people, and you're watching films, and you're talking about it. Then, once we kind of hit on Nahnatchka, and talked about it some more, and then once we met with her, it became clear that she is the person to direct this film, so it was really easy. Once we spent those months, dreaming big and talking about everything, and everybody you could possibly imagine, and then it really collapsed in an amazing way as soon as we talked to her.\nOne of the things that also really surprised me about this movie is that despite having Blumhouse's name attached, it feels like a very big movie, production-wise. The sets and action feel pretty high-scale. What is that like from your position as a producer, trying to help bring the script to life, bring some of those big sets to life, while maintaining a modest budget for a streaming release?\nGreg Gilreath: Yeah, so, it's true of every single movie that's ever been made, there's never enough time or money to do everything you want, unless you're doing an Adam Sandler Netflix movie, where they're just like, \"Whatever you want,\" but outside of that, there's never enough time or enough money. So, Adam [Hendricks] and I have done over 30 movies at this point, and the process is really getting in there with the writer and the director, and the department heads on the movie, and sort of being like, \"What is the essence of the story that we have to keep?\"\nThere's always scenes that go, and fat that's trimmed, and there's always calls of like, \"Okay, these seven scenes, we really need to spend all of our money, and then maybe on these ones, we could just find a location that's already got all this stuff in it, and just maybe shift it a little bit, or maybe instead of shooting a big wide for this scene, we can kind of contain it a little bit to the small part of the room, because we know there will be those two people talking. It would be great to have that big wide, but having just two people talking close up like that will really give us the scope to go do the Gravitron, or do this chase sequence, or something like that.\" So, honing in on what those pieces are — and to Nahnatchka's credit too, we were way over budget at one point, and she was so adamant — and she was correct — that the Gravitron sequence tt the end had to stay, and if that went away, there would be no movie that was worth making.\nEverybody at a certain point, everybody — not fought her on it, but questioned whether that was the best choice. Because it was like, \"What if we made everything else 15% better?\", but she was like, \"Absolutely not. We're doing this.\" So we had to reverse engineer the movie and really dig into the script with her about like, \"Okay, this scene's four pages, can it be one? We have these three scenes, can they be two, we have these five characters, can we get that information in one?\" It was a real process of breaking down the movie scene-by-scene and element-by-element, and figuring out what can go and what has to stay?\nI'm actually really glad she fought for that Gravitron scene, it's radical. In talking about going back to the script and trimming things here and there, what would you say was the hardest scene that you really reworked to fit this budget?\nGreg Gilreath: That's a great question. I think there's a lot of different ways to slice that, so like the Dollhouse of Horrors, the haunted house sequence where they sort of finally get the killer, and the pre-Gravitron sequence. That was a thing that existed at the amusement park in Vancouver, we were going to at first build this whole giant thing that we were going to do, and we couldn't figure out how to afford it, and our production designer, Liz, was pitching all these ideas about, \"Well, what if we just did like an elaborate entrance, and then everything else was kind of minimalist? Or what if it was outside?\" We had 100 different conceptions of what that area was called, it was called the Enchanted Forest at a time, just so many conceptions of what that could be, and none of them felt great.\nThen, there was this moment where I was like, \"Wait, what's that weird, spooky building over there that's kind of boarded up? Can we go in there?\" And the locations rep was like, \"Oh, sure, I guess you can.\" Once we put our heads in there, it kind of all clicked for that scene, and that's the great thing about making a movie, where you're just sort of a little bit of kismet, we just happened to be walking over there, and somebody happened to be curious about what this creepy looking building was. Then, once we went in, it became clear that we were spinning our wheels and wasting our time on trying to build a whole new thing for that sequence that was never going to work, it was just never going to work because we didn't have the resources or the time to do it properly.\nAlso, I think knowing when to cut bait and pivot is such an exceptionally rare tool right now. I think that was probably the biggest change that we made from what the script was, everything else was just little [things], like the party kill sequence. There was an extra beat on the stairs, there was another thing in the garage, so it's like very surgical, for the most part, just carving out little things.\n35 years after the shocking murder of three teens, the infamous “Sweet Sixteen Killer“ returns on Halloween night to claim a fourth victim. 17-year-old Jamie (Kiernan Shipka) ignores her overprotective mom’s (Julie Bowen) warning and comes face to face with the masked maniac and on the run for her life, accidentally time travels back to 1987, the year of the original killings. Forced to navigate the unfamiliar and outrageous culture of the 1980s, Jamie teams up with her teen mom (Olivia Holt) to take down the killer once and for all before she’s stuck in the past forever.\nCheck out our other interviews with:\nTotally Killer begins streaming on Prime Video on October 6.\nSource: Screen Rant Plus\n"}

Here are the Top 10 The Boys characters fans wish could have died twice!\nThe Boys has no shortage of gruesome deaths splattered throughout its fictional world, and while that may be hard for some fans to stomach, those who are killed usually more than deserve what they get, making their deaths oh so satisfying. In fact, these select characters are so despicable, one death just doesn’t seem like enough of a punishment for them.\nWithin The Boys universe (created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson), practically everyone of note with superpowers is a vile, repugnant excuse for a human being. Sexual assault is rampant, drug use is a given, and even murder is commonplace among the separate superhero teams - including and especially the Seven. That isn’t to say there aren’t regular humans who are deserving of death in this world, as there are more than a few who are even worse than those with superpowers - which is something this very list will reflect. Between those who abuse their superpowers and those who are somehow just as bad without them, here are the Top 10 worst characters in The Boys who fans wish could have died twice.\nIt doesn’t take long for The Boys to establish exactly why A-Train deserves to die. In the very first issue, A-Train callously runs through a living person - specifically, Hughie’s girlfriend, Robin - while chasing a super-villain, killing her instantly. Then, in The Boys #3, A-Train is one of the three supes who sexual assault Starlight right after she’s been brought on to the Seven. In the end, Hughie kicks A-Train’s head right off his body after getting a jolt from some Compound V Butcher gives him, and that quick death is far more than he deserved.\nThe first example of a non-powered villain on this list, Little Nina is the head of a Russian crime syndicate who plotted to overthrow the Kremlin and appoint herself as the new head of state. Her plan was to use a group of supes to pull off this coup, and if it weren’t for the Boys, she would have likely succeeded. In The Boys #14, Little Nina suffers a relatively quick - albeit incredibly bizarre - death after a bomb goes off right next to her (or possibly inside her body), killing her in the explosion. Little Nina dedicated her life to gaining power at the expense of others, as she was no stranger to manipulation, torture, and - of course - murder, making her death all the more satisfying.\nA supe who picks on those weaker than him just for a laugh, and who manipulates those around him by making them fear for their lives. That is Malchemical, and fans assuredly wanted to see him dead from the moment he first appeared in The Boys #40. Malchemical has the power to alter his body’s molecular structure in a variety of ways. He can do anything from classic shapeshifting to turning himself into a cloud of poison gas. In fact, it was the latter form that killed him, as Butcher lit a match when Malchemical was in a gaseous state, lighting him on fire and burning him to death. His anticipated demise came after Malchemical tormented a relatively innocent group of supes, who weren’t very good superheroes, but tried their best to be. Those who prey on the most vulnerable deserve the most horrific of fates, and in Malchemical’s case, he deserves it twice.\nFirst and foremost, Stormfront is a Nazi, so that in and of itself earned him a place on this list. But even if he wasn’t, Stormfront still proved to be a despicable superhero and human being all the way up until his death in The Boys #37. According to his canon history within The Boys lore, Stormfront was used by Vought-American in conjunction with the United States government to commit local atrocities like killing off the entirety of a Native American tribe for the sake of building a dam on their land. Stormfront actively enjoyed killing people, as it made him feel more powerful, and that’s why watching him get stomped to death by The Boys was so satisfying.\nEvery horrible act of sexual violence, drug abuse, or flat-out murder committed by pretty much any supe in The Boys - including and especially those of the Seven - are made possible by this man, James Stillwell. Stillwell makes sure the proverbial curtains remain closed to the public when it comes to the horrific things done by Vought-American’s supes, and he’s paid a lot of money for doing this. In fact, James Stillwell is so bad that his fate is actually far worse than anyone else on this list: he’s still alive. As revealed in The Boys: Dear Becky, James lost his mind following the events of The Boys’ series finale, as he’s spotted roaming a pineapple plantation, raving about ‘good product vs bad product’. His fate is one that he has to wake up to day after agonizing day. That moment when he finally snapped was just as finalizing as any death on this list, and it’s something fans can only hope he still remembers deep within his now-fractured psyche.\nHaving recently made his live-action debut in the new Prime series Gen V, The Boys fans should now be at least semi familiar with John Godolkin, though they may still not know the full extent of his heinous crimes in the comics. Debuting in The Boys #24, Godolkin is the leader of the G-Men, as well as the person who runs a school for young supes. On paper, Godolkin is an upstanding citizen and leader of a high-profile superhero team. Behind closed doors, however, John Godolkin is a pedophile who victimizes the young supes in his care. Godolkin is gunned down by a small army deployed by Vought-American, along with practically every supe in his school, and the world became a safer place immediately following his grisly death.\nAnything bad done by Homelander is immediately made worse by the fact that he’s supposed to be this world’s ‘Superman’, and is meant to be the shining light of inspiration and hope in a world filled with violence and terror. But, as it turns out, Homelander is a genuine piece of human garbage who deserved every bit of the gruesome death he got. In The Boys #65, Black Noir reveals himself to be an enhanced (and mentally unstable) clone of Homelander who was created to kill him if he ever got out of hand - which he does in spectacular fashion. Within the Oval Office of the White House, Black Noir rips Homelander to shreds with his bare hands, leaving nothing left of the repugnant Superman knock-off except one of his arms and a bit of his torso.\nWhile Black Noir did the world a favor by killing Homelander, he wasn’t exactly a saint himself. In fact, the only reason Homelander was worth killing at all was because of Black Noir. Since Black Noir’s entire purpose was to kill Homelander if he got out of line, Black Noir took it upon himself to push Homelander over that line. He looked just like Homelander, so Black Noir put on Homelander’s suit, committed unspeakable acts of violence, and took pictures of himself doing it. This was all done in an effort to make Homelander think he did these things, pushing him to become the villain he already thought he was, and making it acceptable for Black Noir finally fulfill his dark purpose. After that was done - and after Homelander put up a hell of a fight - Billy Butcher finished off Black Noir himself, and the supe clone deserved every moment of agony the leader of the Boys put him through.\nSamuel Butcher, husband of Connie Butcher, father to Billy and Lenny Butcher, was a baker in London’s East End, though it’s heavily implied that he moonlit as a career criminal for cash on the side. Why he’s on this list isn’t because he supposedly had a penchant for breaking the law, however, but because he was a heavily abusive husband and father. Sam would mercilessly beat his wife in front of their kids, going so far as to blind her in one eye during a particularly violent rage-filled outburst. He was a cruel, sick man with a family who feared and hated him to their core. He died an unspectacular death in The Boys storyline “Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker”, with one of his own sons urinating on his corpse.\nWhile many might think of Butcher as one of the main protagonists of The Boys, they’d be very wrong. Butcher’s entire life revolved around intimidating, threatening, and blackmailing people into doing whatever he wanted. While he used this skill for good with the Boys by keeping supe’s in-line, he also did it with Vogelbaum, the man who created Compound V, and forced him to create a new compound that would kill every single supe in the world - effectively creating a means for genocide on a global scale. Not only that, but Butcher killed every single member of the Boys himself (except Hughie), turning on the people who trusted him the most. Butcher is seductively charming, to be sure, but he’s a bona fide super-villain, and his death in The Boys #71 couldn’t have come soon enough.\nThe heinous atrocities committed by everyone on this list makes them more than deserving of their violent fates. In fact, it’s safe to say that they should have to live their deaths at least one more time all over again, as these Top 10 The Boys characters are the ones fans wish could have died twice.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "Shonen Jump Publisher Bets Big On Spider-Man Manga For Next Big Hit", "date": "2023-10-05 22:35:25", "text": "Shueisha and Marvel Comics continue to deepen their collaboration with a new series that’s sure to draw the attention of the manga and comics crowd.\nLast year the world got its first glimpse of the Japanese Spider-Man manga, and Spidey made such a good impression, he's coming back to star in his own continuing manga series from Shonen Jump publisher Shueisha. The series marks the latest in a long and ongoing collaboration between Japanese manga publishing powerhouse Shueisha and American comic book publishing legend Marvel Comics.\nAs reported in Anime News Network, this month's issue of Shueisha's Saikyo Jump will feature the debut of Spider-Man: Kizuna - a brand-new ongoing manga following the adventures of a Japanese elementary student who becomes Spider-Man. While further details of the storyline were not announced before its publication, judging from the prior work of its creators, the story will likely include a fair share of high adventure mixed with humorous hijinks. The news title dropped in the October 4, 2023, issue of Saikyo Jump, which will continue to be its publishing platform thereafter.\nSpider-Man: Kizuna is based on Setta Kobayashi and Hachi Mizuno's one-shot of the same name. That story, which was published in September 2022, also appeared In Saikyo Jump. At the time Kobayashi posted a note to his X (formerly Twitter) account stating how excited he was to have the opportunity to work on a manga starring Spider-Man and how he hoped its readers would convince Shueisha or Marvel to serialize the title. While it took a few years, fan support for the Spider-Man: Kizuna one shot must have convinced Shueisha that the story deserved its own dedicated title and continuing series. More recently, Kobayashi went on to state that his aim in creating Spider-Man: Kizuna is to establish a new Japanese version of Spider-Man.\nThis is not the first time Shueisha and Marvel have collaborated. Last summer the two companies announced a manga spinoff to the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse called Spider-Man: Octopus Girl. That story follows the misadventures of Doctor Octopus who, after falling into a coma during another fight with Spider-Man, wakes up to find that he inhabits the mind and body of a Japanese middle school student. Even earlier, in 2019, the two comic publishing giants inked a deal in which a series of one-shot manga stories involving Marvel characters were produced and published on Shueisha's premier manga website Shonen Jump+. That collaboration resulted in the generation of some notable titles including Sanshiro Kasama and Hikaru Uesugi's Deadpool Samurai, and Secret Reverse by Yu-Gi-Oh! author Kazuki Takahashi.\nInterestingly, the 2019 Shueisha - Marvel collaboration also included a work by Mizuno entitled Avengers: Gag Reel which uses a traditional gag/prank manga style to poke fun at the usually super serious Avengers. Kobayashi is also not new to the parody scene. In 2018, he created Asta's Journey to Wizard King, a \"gag manga spinoff\" to Yuki Tabata's Black Clover. While Spider-Man is one of the most wisecracking heroes in Marvel, it certainly would be interesting to see him in an environment where everything could be a joke. If that's what Kobayashi and Mizuno are setting up Spider-Man: Kizuna as, it will definitely be a fresh new take on Marvel's classic hero from Shonen Jump publisher Shueisha.\nSource: Anime News Network, @settaboyashi (1), (2)\nMarcel Green is a writer for Screen Rant's Comics and Anime Sections."}
{"title": "8 Biggest Takeaways From The Exorcist: Believer's Scathing Reviews", "date": "2023-10-05 22:41:25", "text": "Most critics agree that The Exorcist: Believer is yet another unnecessary and dispirited attempt to extend the 1973 horror classic into a franchise.\nConsidering the abysmal reviews for The Exorcist: Believer, the main takeaways of the mass criticisms center around one common theme: it isn't good. The Exorcist: Believer is hardly the first attempt at implementing an entertaining and reliable horror franchise out of the celebrated 1973 original film, often heralded as the 'scariest movie of all time'. Believer was created with the intention to compete with modern independent efforts in the horror genre such as M3GAN and Talk to Me but mainly fell flat because of its lack of originality and purpose. Even with successful franchise revitalizer David Gordon Green at the helm (Halloween), most critics have lost their faith in The Exorcist franchise.\nThe original 1973 Exorcist still holds up as a terrifying movie that has unsettled audiences for some 50 years. The direct sequel The Exorcist II: The Heretic was released in 1977 under the new direction of John Boorman but failed to capture the prominence of the first film. 1990's The Exorcist III is arguably the best installment of The Exorcist franchise but still couldn't hold a match to the classic. Hollywood already got the hint that TheExorcist sequels were doomed, resorting to two even worse prequel films in 2004 and 2005 that seemed to have buried the franchise for good. Unfortunately, The Exorcist: Believer continued the trend of the woefully uninspired horror sequels.\nRELATED: The New Movie That's Perfect For Fans Of The Exorcist (Not Exorcist: Believer)\nMost critics agreed that The Exorcist: Believer was simply an unnecessary venture because it doesn't push the envelope on the already progressive state of the modern horror genre. In a time where many great horror films are finding innovative ways to terrify the masses, particularly due to standout auteur directors like Jordan Peele, Ari Aster, and Robert Eggers, The Exorcist: Believer goes in the opposite direction. The film is full of familiar horror tropes and similar situations to those found in the original movie, resulting in what feels like largely a paint-by-numbers movie which would hold up better if it weren't cast in such a monumental shadow.\nDirector David Gordan Green surely knew what he was up against when taking on The Exorcist: Believer, considering the original film's reputation as a landmark of horror. With this in mind, the one major requirement for any sequel of The Exorcist should undoubtedly be its overall fear factor, an aspect that feels like it was overlooked with 2023's Believer. Similar to The Exorcist III, which notably did not feature a single exorcism on screen, Believer's story feels like it was forced to fit under The Exorcist umbrella more than it was inspired by its actual legacy. The Exorcist III was based on a novel titled \"Legion\" and rebranded as an Exorcist movie, which feels like the case in parts of Believer.\nEllen Burstyn was wise to not reprise her role as Chris MacNeil, mother of the infamous Regan character from the original, until five decades had passed. Her big return to the franchise was effectively underwhelming, as Green and Blumhouse didn't utilize her as much as they should have in their attempts at revival. The 90-year-old Burstyn only agreed to return to The Exorcist franchise if Blumhouse agreed to increase her salary and donate it entirely to the charity of her choice. Burstyn's casting was evidently transactional and passionless, used by Blumhouse for the sake of continuity credibility and hardly any other reason besides that.\nRELATED:The Exorcist: Believer Review - Odom Jr. & Burstyn Elevate Gripping, Tame Horror Revival\nOne of the most challenging considerations with The Exorcist franchise is how impactful the original film was and how difficult as a result it is to produce something greater than one of the best horrors ever made. Several other successful and decades-spanning horror franchises didn't start out with such a high standard to live up to, such as Friday the 13th, Saw, and Child's Play. At times, the original Exorcist appears somewhat like an art film with profound, intentional cinematography, religious symbolism, and sophisticated themes of psychiatry in the face of supernatural phenomena. For anything to actually compare to the original, it would essentially have to be a modern masterpiece.\nMuch like Green's modern Halloween trilogy, The Exorcist: Believer was designed to be the first of a 21st-century Exorcist trilogy, which still might be the case. It's too early to tell whether Green would still be involved in that if Blumhouse decided to stick to that original plan. However, he is a talented enough filmmaker to possibly turn the franchise around with a redemptive Exorcist sequel. The Exorcist brand name will still always turn heads and catch the eyes of fans of the original movie, so not all hope is lost for the franchise that, by most critic's assessments, should have never started.\nLinda Blair was handed a script by Green and was prompted to become a part of The Exorcist: Believer cast. Blair declined despite studio excitement and willingness for her to reprise her role as Regan alongside Burstyn's Chris, which might have produced a more appealing film. This fault can't really be attributed to the film itself, as they at least tried to get Blair on board but were unable to convince her. Blair was a consultant on the film, primarily with the intention of creating a safe space for the child actors on set. Believer could have done more to explain Regan's absence but elected to chalk it up to her becoming estranged from her mother over time.\nRELATED: How Scary The Exorcist: Believer Is\nAt the end of the day, most critics see The Exorcist: Believer exactly for what it is: a flat and predictable horror movie hiding under the guise of a cinematic landmark. This is made even more clear by the sheer lack of imagination in the movie, almost identically hitting every beat of the original without properly building the suspense or believability to at least give it a chance of holding up to the original. Believer ultimately plays it too by the book to the point where it nearly feels like Green wants the audience to see the direct links to the original film but in formulaic structure, not in craftsmanship or effect.\nThe Exorcist: Believer only substantiates the argument that was already made clear with 1977's direct sequel which was equally disastrous. None of the three sequels or two prequels in The Exorcist franchise are any good. Believer should hit the nail on the coffin on a franchise that just wasn't meant to be. William Friedkin himself walked away from talks of The Exorcist 2 for the simple fact that he had no other story to tell with the material. Unfortunately, Blumhouse and Green did not have much of a story to tell with The Exorcist: Believer despite its potential, resulting in yet another disappointing installment of The Exorcist franchise.\n"}
{"title": "10 Worst Movies On Netflix", "date": "2023-10-05 22:50:26", "text": "Netflix is known for its incredible library of content, but the streaming service’s worst offerings include some truly terrible movies.\nNetflix has made a name for itself in the realm of streaming thanks to its incredible selection of movies and TV shows, but there are some truly terrible movies available to watch on the platform. Netflix has been operating for more than 25 years and has gone through several changes to get to where it is today. Starting life as a simple movie delivery service, it grew to the point that businesses like Blockbuster disappeared. Now Netflix creates its own content to rival what other studios put out.\nNetflix's catalog and the quality of its films have improved drastically over the years, but that doesn't mean that its releases are all hits. Many of the worst Netflix original movies feel rushed, poorly executed, or like a half-baked concept that just had money and star power thrown at it. Alongside its independent content, Netflix also features some really terrible movies from other studios, many of which will leave viewers confused, irritated, or downright bored.\nIn an age where superhero movies are making massive waves, Netflix tried its hand at making one of its own. Thunder Force follows the adventure of two childhood best friends who get powers from a science experiment, then team up to fight super villains. The whole film feels incredibly empty and predictable, with jokes that mostly fail to land. Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer helm the cast of Thunder Force, but everything from the chemistry to the plot is exceptionally poor, especially compared to what is being produced by larger studios.\nMarlon Wayans plays Rob Anderson, a man trapped in a time loop on the morning of his wedding, in 2017's Naked. He's cursed to reset the day over and over, during which he wakes up naked in a lift after being the victim of a crime. Naked leaves behind everything that makes a time loop film good, removing any concrete moral of the story and replacing it with cheap jokes and a silly premise. This film fails on every single front to deliver something coherent, engaging, or entertaining. For an absolutely mindless comedy, Naked delivers a sub-par experience all around.\nThe Ridiculous 6 brings together an impressive cast for a modern Happy Madison production, but despite the team in front of and behind the camera — and the funding from Netflix — it falls flat. In the movie, Adam Sandler discovers he has five half-brothers, and they set off on a Western misadventure to find their father. Everything about this film is wacky, zany, and quirky, but it's not in a good way. Everything feels over-the-top silly, and it lives up to its title as a truly ridiculous film. Sadly, it's too ridiculous to be watchable.\n2017's Death Note takes an absolutely outstanding anime series with depth and meaningful themes of morality and justice and turns it into something ugly. Death Note is subpar both visually and in concept. The film whitewashed the cast, even going so far as to change the names and locations from the anime. Death Note also does away with the motivations and background of its main character, watering down Light's most important qualities. The film destroys any semblance of meaning, and its CGI is weird and ridiculous. The anime is leagues better, so the live-action Death Note is not worth the watch.\nRELATED: 10 Live-Action Anime Adaptations That Ruined Their Source Material\nIn The Last Thing He Wanted, Anne Hathaway and Ben Affleck come together to create a film that largely loses track of itself. The narrative follows a journalist who gets mixed up in the middle of a series of crimes she's attempting to break the news on. Despite featuring talented actors, The Last Thing He Wanted meanders and wastes time, creating more loose ends than the movie knows what to do with.\nThe Last Days of American Crime is set in the alternative near future, where crime is running rampant, and the U.S. government is making a last-ditch attempt to stop it in its tracks. The intention is to somehow halt all crime through a broadcast. However, in the more than two hours this film takes to open up and explain its story, it manages to do nothing but run around in circles. The Last Days of American Crime delivers a series of clichés and action scenes in the process, none of which help the story overall. The film is excessively long and void of any meaningful resolution or concrete storyline.\nRelated: 10 Best Crime Movies On Netflix\nAdam Sandler has had an extensive career starring in comedy films, but his partnership with Netflix has seen a decline in the quality of his projects overall. He stars side-by-side with David Spade in The Do-Over, which sees the duo planning to fake their deaths to get a fresh start on life. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned. The identities they take on are in worse trouble than they were. The biggest issue with The Do-Over is that the level of the humor is well-suited for an audience of preteens — but it's rated TV-MA, so adults are the intended audience.\nThe Bubble proves that putting together a cast of incredibly talented actors does not guarantee a film with any level of actual quality. Karen Gillan, Pedro Pascal, Guz Khan, Keegan-Michael Key, and Leslie Mann are part of the cast that make up this flop. When a group of actors is trapped in a bubble due to the COVID-19 outbreak, they decide to continue making the film. Ultimately, the film gets lost, going deeper and deeper into the concept of a film within a film. The Bubble misses the irony it desperately tries to analyze, suggesting legendary director Judd Apatow may have been asleep at the wheel for this one.\nTall Girl already received a great deal of backlash from audiences who were not happy with the premise of setting up a girl with above-average height as something extremely unnatural and worth exploiting for a film. Ultimately, at the conclusion of the first film, characters wind up happy and more mature. However, Tall Girl 2 walks back any of that growth to make its lead character into a popular character struggling to connect with her old friends. Lack of plot, unfortunately bad acting, and manufactured drama converge to create a cash grab sequel for a film that didn't perform that well in the first place.\nJared Leto hasn't had the best track record with movies, and The Outsider unfortunately continues that trend. The 2018 film follows a former prisoner who ends up in the yakuza and begins a rampage of violent crime for his new employers. The main issue with this film is how it has no real character development. The story goes nowhere, and everything feels incredibly pointless. The opening scene is exciting, but after that first 10 or 15 minutes, the development stops. After that, it's essentially just a gore fest, making it one of the least worthwhile movies to watch on Netflix.\n"}

From interdimensional evils like Darkseid to more street-level foes like the Key, the League has gone up against just about every big bad in the DCU.\nNow, one of their subtlest foes is working behind the scenes to hit the Justice League harder than ever before — with the surprising help of the WildStorm legacy. Batman: The Brave and the Bold #5 features the latest entry of “Stormwatch: Down With The Kings” by Ed Brisson, Jeff Spokes, and Saida Temofonte, in which the black-ops team learns that one surprising anti-Justice League figure has been controlling their every move: Amanda Waller.\nStormwatch has been collecting weapons that could take down the Justice League itself. When Ravager learns the truth, she makes it clear to Director Bones that she’s no longer taking part in their quest, especially after learning Bones is only a figurehead. Before Bones can finish spouting another lie, Stormwatch’s true commander, Amanda Waller herself, finally makes an appearance and reveals that she’s been running the team from the start.\nRelated: Marvel Finally Has Its Own Version of Justice League's Most Powerful Hero (According to Batman)\nWhile Stormwatch has been collecting weaponry with the express purpose of taking down the Justice League, they’ve been doing so under the impression that these weapons would be used only in self-defense should the more public-facing heroes of the DCU ever try taking them down. Unfortunately, as Ravager learns, that reasoning couldn’t be farther from the truth — but that lie plays exactly into Waller’s private mission throughout the current Dawn of DC era. After all, since the finale of Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Wall has been working with the Council of Light to weaken and the world’s greatest heroes, which is a mission that would benefit from an arsenal of anti-Justice League weaponry.\nThis is far from the first connection Waller has made with the grittier WildStorm corner of the DC Universe, as the Waller vs. WildStorm Black Label miniseries by Spencer Ackerman, Evan Narcisse, Jesús Merino, and Vicente Cifuentes makes clear. Waller has always been one of the publisher’s most morally flexible spymasters, so the notion that she would employ one of WildStorm’s most famous organizations, even one consisting largely of DC Comics Earth-0 characters, is totally in-line with her personal history. All in all, her moral flexibilty and willingnes to manipulate ever the darkest anti-heroes does not bode well for the future of the Justice League.\nWhen Amanda Waller sets her sight on a goal, she moves heaven and earth to make it a reality. Unfortunately, the Wall’s current goal seems to be the destruction of the DCU's greatest heroes. If the Justice League hopes to survive an onslaught at the hands of Amanda Waller and Stormwatch, they should start preparing for the worst.\nBatman: The Brave and the Bold #5 is available now from DC Comics.\n"}
{"title": "Occlumency Theory Explained: Why Harry Potter Failed (& Draco Succeeded)", "date": "2023-10-05 23:00:26", "text": "Harry Potter was never any good at Occlumency, and the reason for this may explain why Draco Malfoy found the skill so easy to perfect. \nThe Boy Who Lived never got the hang of Occlumency in Harry Potter, but this might not have had anything to do with a lack of talent. Severus Snape began teaching Harry this obscure branch of magic in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix since Dumbledore hoped it would ensure that Voldemort couldn't use his connection with Harry to gain information or possess him. Of course, these lessons went catastrophically. By the time Snape refused to continue teaching Harry, the boy hadn't come anywhere close to gaining control over his mind's security.\nThough Harry struggled with Occlumency, Draco Malfoy excelled at it. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, it was revealed that Draco had been taking Occlumency lessons from his aunt, Bellatrix Lestrange so that no one at Hogwarts would be able to determine what he was planning with the Death Eaters and Voldemort. He was ultimately very successful at this since even Snape was unable to dive into Draco's mind and figure out what he was planning. Harry was always as equally talented a wizard as Draco, if not a little more. So, why could the Slytherin boy master this skill but not the hero of Harry Potter?\nRELATED: Harry Potter And The Order of the Phoenix Ending Explained\nThe Harry Potter series demonstrated on several occasions that Harry had stronger-than-average willpower. In the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire book, Mad-Eye Moody (really Barty Crouch Jr) began teaching students about the Unforgivable Curses and tried to teach them how to protect themselves from such attacks. When he cast the Imperius Curse on his students, Harry alone could fight off the control. He did this with his will alone and fought off the Imperius Curse both this time and later when Lord Voldemort attempted to Imperius him as well.\nThis proves that Harry's lack of skill had nothing to do with his mental capacity, as Snape had suggested. Many have blamed Harry's failure at Occlumency on the professor, who never really took teaching him seriously and ultimately lost his temper and put an end to their lessons. However, the Wizarding World website suggests that Harry would have struggled with Occlumency even if he had a more patient teacher. This is because Harry was far too emotional—unable to hold back his anger at injustice and always ready to spring into action. This is part of what made him a great hero, but it takes a calmer, more cunning wizard to shut down his mind and master Occlumency.\nThis is precisely why Draco Malfoy was far more capable at Occlumency, and Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling has supported this. She stated that \"it was perfectly consistent with Draco’s character that he would find it easy to shut down emotion, to compartmentalize, and to deny essential parts of himself.\" She went on to state that Draco's upbringing, though lavish, was a fearful one. Lucius Malfoy expected the very best from his son, so weakness and excessive displays of emotion would not have been tolerated. To cope with this, Draco learned from a young age how to shut those feelings down and present a cold, strong, and proud exterior.\nIn addition, Draco was under immense pressure when he began learning Occlumency in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. He had just become a Death Eater and was eager to prove himself on the mission that, unbeknownst to him, he was always meant to fail. Therefore, when Bellatrix—who was surely a harsh teacher—began turning her nephew into an Occlumens, he would have put his all into succeeding since the alternative would have been death. On the other hand, Harry was relatively fearless when it came to Voldemort (even to a fault). Though Dumbledore told him it was necessary, Harry never feared Voldemort seeing into his mind.\nThe reason that Severus Snape was such a good double agent was because he was an expert Occlumens. Lord Voldemort was known to be an accomplished Legilimens and could confidently see into the minds of all his Death Eaters. To deceive him, Snape had to conceal his feelings for Lily and his determination to protect her son while also feeding the Dark Lord false information and memories. This took meticulous control that most wizards couldn't have managed—especially someone like Harry, who wore his feelings on his sleeves. Still, Snape wasn't always the epitome of self-control.\nIf Harry couldn't master Occlumency because of his emotional nature, then it's a surprise that Snape could. Though he always wore a calm mask in the Harry Potter movies, the books contained several instances of the Potions Master losing his cool. These weren't simple instances of a lost temper but full-on, destructive outbursts. One example is at the end of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, when Snape threw a fit because Sirius Black escaped, and no one would believe it was Harry's fault. If a man like this could master Occlumency, then Harry simply being emotional may not be a good enough reason.\nRELATED: Harry Potter - Every Clue That Snape Wasn't A Villain\nHarry's failure to learn Occlumency had major consequences in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Voldemort managed to plant false images in Harry's head of Sirius being tortured at the Department of Mysteries, and it was this that led Harry—and then the rest of the Order of the Phoenix—to the Ministry. Unfortunately, in an effort to save his godson, Sirius lost his life. Harry immediately regretted not taking Occlumency more seriously, but if it's true that it was his own emotional tendencies that kept him from being successful, he was better off not letting this go.\nYear after year, Harry became increasingly angry at the injustices of the wizarding world. When his teachers (especially Dolores Umbridge) treated the students unfairly, Harry would stand up and fight back. When the entire magical community believed he was lying about Voldemort's return, he all but yelled at the rooftops what he had seen. It was this quality that made Harry the perfect hero to stand against Lord Voldemort. Though Snape and Draco were skilled at blending in and hiding their true feelings, Harry Potter wore his own on his sleeves, and this made him impossible for the Dark Lord to control.\n"}
{"title": "Long-Awaited Stephen King Adaptation From Black Phone Director Gets Grim Update", "date": "2023-10-05 23:02:48", "text": "The Black Phone director Scott Derrickson shares a negative update on his long-gestating horror movie adapted from a Stephen King novella.\nThe Stephen King adaptation The Breathing Method has gotten a grim development update. The movie, which was previously with director Scott Derrickson attached, is an adaptation of the King novella of the same name, originally published as part of the 1982 collection Different Seasons. The story follows a woman in the 1930s who is desperately protective of her unborn child, who was conceived out of wedlock, so much so that her \"breathing method\" for helping birth the child keeps her lungs moving even after she is decapitated in a car accident.\nCinemaBlend recently had the chance to speak with Derrickson, whose most recent work in the horror genre is the segment \"Dreamkill\" from the new anthology movie V/H/S/85. During their conversation, he shared an update on The Breathing Method. Although he \"really loved that script,\" he is \"not involved with it anymore,\" so he was not able to offer a more substantive update. Read his full quote below:\nI don't know where the rights are on that. I don't even know if it's in development now. I had a script developed with Scott Teems, who worked on the Halloween films and I think one of the Insidious films. And he did a great job, and I really loved that script, and it was very imaginative, and a really strong adaptation. It didn't end up going anywhere. I'm not involved with it anymore, so I have no idea where it's at.\nThe Breathing Method was originally announced to be in development in 2012. At the time, it was already announced that Derrickson would be attached. The director was then fresh off his Blumhouse horror hit Sinister, which earned $87.7 million off its $3 million budget and was followed by a sequel in 2015. He had also previously directed the horror titles Hellraiser: Inferno and The Exorcism of Emily Rose.\nRelated: Every Scott Derrickson Horror Movie Ranked Worst To Best (Including Black Phone)\nBack in 2012, Teems' involvement as screenwriter was also announced. However, there was no word on the project for quite some time until 2019, when a new announcement was made, confirming Teems and Derrickson's continued involvement. However, after that the project went dormant once again until Derrickson's most recent comment.\nIn the years since The Breathing Method was announced, both creators have put out other works in the horror genre, with Derrickson even directing 2022's The Black Phone, an adaptation of a story by King's son Joe Hill. However, if Derrickson is no longer involved, it may be the case that Teems (who wrote Halloween Kills, Firestarter, and Insidious: The Red Door in the meantime) is also not attached. Even if the script is still in play, with no director the movie is likely very far from going into production, if the possibility is still even being considered.\nSource: CinemaBlend\n"}

Set sixteen years after the first film, the sequel finds Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri's (Zoe Saldaña) Na'vi family under the threat of a recombinant Quaritch (Stephen Lang) as they seek refuge with the aquatic Metkayina clan. During the final battle, Jake and Neytiri's oldest son Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) is fatally shot by one of Quaritch's men and dies in front of his family.\nIn a recent episode of Cinema Therapy, licensed therapist Jonathan Decker watched Neteyam's death in Avatar: The Way of Water and broke it down in detail, including Jake and Neytiri's response to the tragedy. While Neytiri becomes \"feral with grief,\" as Decker says, the therapist notes how Jake's response is different, as he blames his younger son Lo'ak for Neteyam's death. Read a portion of his commentary or watch the full video below:\nThey're both grieving. It's a petty, mean, hurtful thing to say, and it's super relatable. He blames his son for his other son's death. Which is, again, if you're in the headspace to evaluate what's really going on, you're not going to say something like that. Cut Jake some slack here, but he's still doing what he does, which is he's compassionate with his wife and he's tough on his sons.\nHe was getting to a better place. I do think it's true. We learn and we evolve and we grow, and we often do things better, as long as things are fine. We backslide into our past behaviors. Eeven though it was, as an audience member, it was frustrating and hurtful to see Jake do this late in the film. It's true to the character and it's true to how people are. It's true to human psychology. But we do need that catharsis. For there to be an arc, it has to go to a healthy place.\nAs the oldest son of Jake and Neytiri, Neteyam was expected to safeguard and care for his younger siblings. However, it is his more impulsive younger brother, Lo'ak, who convinces him to save their symbolic sibling Spider, the biological son of Miles Quaritch. Therefore, Lo'ak feels responsible for Neteyam's death and Jake, whose headspace is also clouded by grief, blames his youngest son for his oldest son's death. Neteyam's tragic death, and the resulting family dynamics, do set up a strong foundation for future character arcs in Avatar 3 and future sequels.\nAs already seen during the Avatar: The Way of Water ending, Jake and Neytiri should continue seeking retribution against Quaritch for their son's death as they attempt to put an end to his destructive rampage once and for all. Neteyam's death should also have a profound influence on Lo'ak, potentially making him more cautious about protecting his siblings or sending him down a dark path of pain and regret. The heartbreaking tragedy could also have an effect on Jake and Neytiri's other children, Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) and Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss), who will pursue their own paths of revenge or healing.\nSource: Cinema Therapy\n"}

Spoilers for X-Men #27 ahead!One of the most dangerous villains the X-Men have ever faced has plans to steal the Juggernaut’s powers and turn himself into the unstoppable Dr. Juggernaut. The events of Fall of X have put the X-Men on the back foot, with most mutants having either been killed or imprisoned. Now, one of the architects of the mutants’ catastrophic new status is prepared to make things even worse.\nX-Men #27 by Gerry Duggan, Phil Noto, VC’s Clayton Cowles, Tom Muller and Jay Bowen opens with Kate Pryde breaking into an Orchis prison and discovering Juggernaut. She provides the means for him to break out the following day, but at the end of the mission it’s revealed that his breakout attempt fails. Doctor Stasis, a version of Mister Sinister and one of the leaders of Orchis, says that Juggernaut is too dangerous to be left alive.\n“Rather than execute him, I’ve realized that magic gem of his is inside his body. I’m going to extract it surgically and then ingest it,” Stasis tells Firestar. “I hope the world is ready for Dr. Juggernaut. I’ve scheduled him for an autopsy in the morning.”\nMister Sinister and Doctor Stasis are two of the four clones that 19th century scientist Nathaniel Essex made of himself. His purpose in creating these clones was to try different methods for humanity to fight back against artificial intelligence in the future. While Sinister is a version of Essex with an X-Gene, Stasis is an ordinary human, albeit one with an abnormally long life. Believing that mutants are a greater danger than artificial life, Stasis becomes one of the leaders of the anti-mutant organization Orchis and helps orchestrate the attack on the Hellfire Gala that kicks off Fall of X.\nBoth Juggernaut and Mister Sinister have been staples of the X-Men’s rogues’ gallery for decades as formidable physical and mental threats, respectively. Cain Marko is known more for his brawn than his brain, as the powers granted to him by the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak make it so that he is literally unstoppable. With the added intellectual might of Doctor Stasis, he would be able to wield his physical strengths in genius new ways. While Stasis is a relatively new character, he has the same intelligence as Sinister, who is known for his cunning and always thinking ten steps ahead of his opponents.\nSinister recently enacted a plan to incorporate his genes into the DNA of every mutant resurrected on Krakoa, resulting in the creation of the Sins of Sinister timeline. Here, everyone on Earth became a version of Mister Sinister, and he was able to exert his power to not only take over the world, but extend his reign into the far reaches of space. He was even able to come up with a brilliant way to use Juggernaut’s abilities by turning him into a bullet that was then used to assassinate both Thanos and Galactus.\nThe one hope that Juggernaut and the rest of the X-Men have is that Stasis tells his plans to Firestar, who is working as a spy within Orchis. Firestar will need to alert her fellow mutants in order to stop him. If she is unsuccessful, then Doctor Stasis will be able to supplement his own abilities with the mystically-infused powers of the Juggernaut, a deadly combination that the X-Men would have no hope of defeating.\nX-Men #27 is on sale now from Marvel Comics.\n"}
{"title": "Future Pixar Movies Have A Major Problem, Despite Elemental's $490 Million Box Office Recovery", "date": "2023-10-05 23:40:25", "text": "Elemental managed an impressive comeback at the box office, but Pixar can't count on this happening again for its future theatrical projects. \nElemental made a spectacular comeback after its disappointing opening weekend, but Pixar still has a lot of work to do going forward. The Disney studio hasn't had a lot of luck with its films recently, and it was hoped that their element-themed romance would turn this all around. Unfortunately, Elemental's opening weekend made it look as if the film would be a box office bomb, which would be especially bad news for Pixar after other such failures. Thankfully, the studio's most recent movie made a surprising $400 million comeback. Still, Pixar can't count on this for all of its future projects.\nIn its opening weekend, Elemental only managed to bring in just under $40 million at the box office. Compared to studio successes like Toy Story 3, this is a significant flop. Still, things managed to trend upward for the film. Word of mouth really seemed to do Elemental some favors, and a surprising number of audiences turned up at theaters in the weeks that followed. Pixar's chief creative officer, Pete Docter, was thrilled (via Screen Rant) that audiences had wound up resonating with Ember and Wade as he thought they would, but it isn't lost on him that Elemental's disappointing weekend is still a problem.\nRELATED: Elemental 2 - Confirmation Chances, Release Date Prediction, Possible Sequel Story & Everything We Know\nElemental may have pulled itself together at the box office, but Pixar can't count on this happening for its upcoming new releases. This is something that Docter seems to recognize. He noted that even with Elemental's $400 million recovery, he plans to take \"another look at the projects we’re working on now\" to ensure that they meet the standard of their past successes. \"I really think I want to double down on what allowed us to speak to audiences to begin with,\" he said, still standing by his love for Elemental but noting that Pixar needs to return to its roots to avoid another close call.\nOverall, the fact that Elemental failed to bring audiences in on its opening weekend means that leading up to the film's release, people simply weren't interested. It took word-of-mouth for people to decide to hit the theaters. Though this says a lot about Pixar's marketing plan (something the studio also needs to take a closer look at), it could also come down to a loss of faith in the studio's films. After all, several of their recent movies have failed to meet audiences' expectations.\nThe pressure on Pixar might be different if Elemental was the studio's first project with a disappointing opening weekend. Lightyear (2022) only brought in $50 million when it hit theaters, but unlike Elemental, it never managed to turn these numbers around. The film has a worldwide gross of only $226 million—considerably lower than Elemental's—and is considered a critical failure as well as a box office bomb.\nOther Pixar failures were relatively well received by audiences once they started streaming on Disney+, but audiences didn't seem to think it was worth it to turn up at the theaters. Onward (2020), which holds an impressive 95-percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, only managed $141 million gross. Overall, these numbers reveal that Pixar is consistently missing the mark when it comes to predicting what stories will get audiences to buy tickets—something they used to get right consistently.\nPart of the reason for many of Pixar's failures is the decision on Disney's part to give the studio's films a simultaneous streaming release or to skip over the theatrical release altogether and jump straight to Disney+. This was the case for Turning Red, Soul, and Luca—all movies with decent critic reviews but a relatively poor return on investment. It's difficult to say why Disney deems this a good idea, but if Pixar wants to earn more theatrical releases, then it needs to take full advantage of the opportunities given.\nTo justify future theatrical releases, Pixar must prove it can make magic happen at the box office, and Elemental didn't manage this. Sure, the romance wasn't a complete failure, and its surprise recovery may allow Pixar to tread water for a time. However, if the studio's next movies continue the disappointing opening weekend trend, we will likely see a lot more Disney+ releases rather than theatrical ones. Hopefully, Docter meant it when he said that Elemental's performance has him taking a closer look at their upcoming projects because audiences are ready to see the old Pixar back in theaters.\n"}
{"title": "Reptile Ending Explained: Who The Killer Is", "date": "2023-10-05 23:48:51", "text": "Reptile is a thrilling mystery starring Benicio del Toro as a veteran detective trying to catch a killer. But who actually killed Summer?\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for Reptile.\nGrant Singer's thriller Reptile weaves a web of deception as Benicio Del Toro's Detective Nichols tracks down the killer of a young real estate agent named Summer (Matilda Lutz), and in the process uncovers department-wide corruption within the ranks of the Scarborough police force. After going through several suspects, including Summer's lover and fellow real estate agent Will Grady (Justin Timberlake), ex-husband Sam (Karl Glusman), and disgruntled neighbor Eli Phillips (Michael Pitt), he finally discovers the identity of the killer among the characters in Reptile along with their motivation for Summer's demise. Unfortunately, his revelations put him in the crosshairs of powerful players in a convoluted game of cat-and-mouse.\nWhen he brings evidence against the killer and corrupt members of his department to the chief of police, the pair pay a visit to Captain Allen (Eric Bogosian) whose been concealing the identity of the murderer the entire time. Unbeknownst to Nichols, the deception goes all the way to his superiors, and Nichols is forced to get into a shootout with his former colleagues before he can expose the entire conspiracy. Full of red herrings, plot twists, the film delivers on the hallmarks of a gripping procedural but nevertheless leaves a few lingering questions as Nichols uncovers who Reptile's \"reptile\" really is.\nIn a rather confusing flashback, it's revealed that Will Grady killed Summer. When Detective Nichols is chasing down yet another lead and trying to figure out who Rudy Rackozy called so many times on the day that Summer was killed. It isn't stated out loud but it's implied that Rudy called Will, who is seen in yet another flashback standing over Summer's barely-breathing body. Will intended to pin the crime on Summer's ex-husband, but unfortunately for him, Detective Nichols was too good at his job and traced the burner phone to Will.\nUnfortunately, this isn't the most innovative part of the plot, as the killer is often the boyfriend in thrillers like Reptile. While it's enjoyable to see Justin Timberlake play against type, his part in the film makes it feel formulaic. Fortunately, Will isn't given a villainous monologue, but at the same time, getting more scenes involving him being a little more sinister, rather than so much time wasted on Eli and other red herring suspects would have made the reveal feel more deserved.\nDetective Nichols initially thought it was suspicious that Summer sold houses for a real estate agency yet often didn't receive any commission for the sales. These sales were part of a drug laundering scheme concocted by Wally and the majority of the police in Detective Nichols' department, and Summer had started calling the FBI in preparation to tell them the truth about White Fish being a shell company. Will finds out about what she was planning to do and kills her before she can reveal how far up the corruption goes.\nThe corruption linking the police department and the shell real estate company is somewhat convoluted, but Detective Nichols starts to piece it together once he notices that contraband has been suspiciously disappearing from the department evidence room. Wally plants drugs in certain houses and then they get seized, and White Fish buys them for a fraction of their cost and makes considerable profits. Summer was the broker for these transactions and didn't know anything about it at first, but eventually, the guilt became too overwhelming.\nRELATED: Reptile: Why Judy Puts Tom's Hand In WaxProcedurals like Reptile need to get tighter as they progress, but it's at this point that the narrative gets more convoluted. A lot of loose ends are left dangling, such as why Captain Allen agreed to keep the Chrysler Imperial, seen at the scene of Summer's murder, in his garage. The \"why\" in Reptile is not as important as the \"how,\" and understanding character motivations only gets in the way of appreciating what they end up producing as far as tension and tone.\nEli Phillips is a Nostradamus-looking suspect who appears early on with a motive to kill Summer; Will Grady swindled his family out of their property, which forced Eli's father to take his own life. Eli threatens Will and he returns the favor by showing up one night in his apartment, telling him to stop sniffing around his business. He's joined by another figure who Eli seems to recognize, but they're never revealed to the audience. This person is most likely the chief of police, whose role in the entire tawdry tableau is revealed later when Detective Nichols tries to bring evidence of the corrupt officers to his attention.\nAfter the confrontation between Eli, Will, and the mysterious third intruder, Eli is never seen again in Reptile. When Detective Nichols returns to question Eli again, he finds his entire home scrubbed clean and a bottle of bleach on the counter. While the audience never sees Eli's death, it's implied that he was killed, dismembered, and his body was disposed of at a different location with no evidence left to implicate either Will or his accomplice in the crime.\nEli's fate is left open-ended and ambiguous in keeping with the shifting nature of the case. Singer purposefully makes all the characters suspicious in the beginning, particularly Eli, and including Detective Nichols himself. Eli represents one of the most obviously nefarious characters, but he's not only harmless - he cracked the case, and his death is meant to remain unknown so that fans can make up their own minds as the case progresses, constantly guessing just like Nichols, working to solve it along with him.\nReptile's intense finale is punctuated by an innocuous moment involving a frisbee hitting the large picture window where Nichols and Wally's incredibly intense confrontation is in full view. Nichols looks over to see children's noses pressed up against the glass, taking in the horrifying tableau of Wally on the ground, his own blood pooling around him, and Nichols holding his firearm. Singer has explained Reptile's frisbee scene in terms of his own position as a novice filmmaker; \"The idea is that I'm the kids playing. This is my first movie, I'm just enjoying myself, I'm just playing and this is my thing.\"\nLooked at within the context of the narrative, the frisbee is an ironic act of God that pulls Nichols, Wally, and the audience out of the moment and redirects their focus, and the horrors of what they're participating in are juxtaposed with the everyday act of children playing outside, creating a surreal space for introspection and reflection. The corruption of Wally's world, having already infiltrated friends and family, cannot be divorced from the children's incorruptible innocence operating as a deux ex machina, highlighting that everything has consequences.\nBenicio Del Toro gives an incredibly nuanced and intense performance in Reptile, using body language and long stares to communicate trauma and a wounded psyche. He's been accused of being on the take at his old department, which makes him a perfect candidate for Captain Allen's, or so Allen thinks, but Detective Nichols wants to actually have a fresh start and peace that will never come. He's asked at one point if he needs to be redeemed, a notion he becomes defensive about, but it's clear that he needs to solve Summer's murder for more reasons than simply being a thorough investigator.\nBefore her death, Summer finds a dried snakeskin, indicating all is not what it seems inside her house. The movie is called Reptile because as each character is introduced their nature changes, and after appearing to be one thing, they soon \"shed their skin\" and are revealed to be something else. Will Grady is a skittish wasp who becomes capable of stabbing his girlfriend, Wally is an avuncular poker buddy who turns out to be the kingpin in a drug scheme and tries to kill the \"rats\" bringing him down, and Detective Nichols is a perceivably corrupt cop shedding the skin of his old reputation to be an altruistic hero.\nCinematographer Mike Gioulakis crafts Reptile stylishly and makes salient use of reflective surfaces, particularly mirrors. Characters reveal key plot points, perform exposition, and question each other from within these glossy parameters, representing the way that things aren't always what they seem even when they're right in front of character's faces. It's an interesting technique that helps give Singer's thriller a distinct aesthetic and oeuvre.\n"}
{"title": "Django Unchained Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-05 23:51:23", "text": "Django Unchained has an ending that begs to be explained. Here is a deep dive into Tarantino's complex tale of love, freedom,  and redemption. \nThe complex Django Unchained ending begs for further explanation, as the story is much deeper than what it initially appears to be. Considered by many to be one of the greatest films in the Tarantino vault, Django Unchained starts as a gunslinging Western and quickly transforms into a tragic story of undying love. It's also a story of how that undying love can drive a man to darker depths than he thought possible.\nAfter their plan to fool the evil slaver Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) goes awry, Django has to shoot his way past his oppressors to set his wife free. The end of the film finds Django and Hildi riding off into the dark of night after a triumphant win from Django. Although this may seem like a happy ending, given the times and the nature of the events that just occurred, Django and Hildi may have trouble coming their way.\nThe ride off into the darkness is an ominous symbol of the dark road ahead for the couple. Not only would they have to somehow make their way out of the Deep South during a time when slavery had not yet been abolished, but Hildi and Django would also be surrounded by enemies actively hunting them for the crimes they just committed. From neighboring plantations to slave catchers and sheriffs, they'd have to keep the lowest of profiles to somehow sneak out of Mississippi unscathed and make their way up to the North to safety. Although Django could use his power of deceit to make a few allies, it's hard to imagine the couple living out their life in freedom without any consequences.\nIn the film, Candyland is a plantation in Mississippi known throughout the South for its cruelty and torture of Black people. Just the very mention of its name was enough to make Django uneasy. At the end of the third act, after Django is done shooting down every slave owner in Candyland, he takes it a step further by blowing it up with a stick of dynamite. This explosion doesn't just deliver a satisfying moment of redemption for Django's character, it's also symbolic of the concept of freedom.\nCandyland represents not just slave ownership, but oppression as a whole. Throughout the grounds, there are slaves in every room performing all sorts of unspeakable acts and being treated in the cruelest, most inhumane ways. Its destruction symbolizes the dismantling of oppressors and the idea of putting an end to enslavement once and for all, as evidenced by the film being set right before the Civil War.\nBy destroying Candyland, Django doesn't just set Hildi free, but he also frees other slaves, including Cora, Sheba, and the men who are being transported to the mines. All of their futures are tied in Candyland, and by burning it down and killing all the masters, Django sets them all free. The destruction of Candyland sends a message to onlookers and oppressors: a new future is coming, a future where the enslavement and inhumane treatment of Black people is not only unjust but will be met with consequences.\nCalvin Candie and Dr. Schultz are the polar opposites of one another. Dr. Schultz was the only White character who treated enslaved people with respect, addressing them by name and treating them like equals. He's even able to set a few free, like Django. Calvin Candie, on the other hand, is infamous for being mean, cruel, and ignorant. Not only does he prefer methods of torture, but he doesn't even see slaves as human beings. Candie genuinely views slaves as property, even watching a man get beaten to death in front of him without blinking an eye, unlike Schultz, who is visibly uncomfortable and shaken.\nIt's clear that Schultz and Candie don't like each other. They make each other uncomfortable and can not exist in the same space. One of them has to go, and when Candie calls Schultz back to shake his hand, he clearly makes the choice that it will be Schultz. At that moment, the tension between Dr. Schultz and Calvin Candie throughout Django Unchained comes to a head, and the climax is an all-out bloodbath. Although Candie insists that the handshake is just a traditional business move, the timing and context behind the request scream set up, which is why Dr. Schultz draws first blood. In the small act of a handshake, there is a greater symbolism of a shifting power dynamic, not just between the two men, but between the cruelty of oppressors and those who will rise up to defeat them in the end.\nThe moment when Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) realizes Django and Hildi know each other is the exact point in the film where things go downhill. Although this may seem like a sharp left, a reexamining of the scene gives away why it is so easy for Stephen to put two and two together. Stephen is one of Candie's most loyal servants, a traditional \"house Negro\" who enjoys privileges the other slaves don't get due to his loyalty. He is suspicious of Django and Dr. Schultz from the start, fearing they'll upset the balance of Candyland where he enjoys a relatively easy life, unlike his fellow slaves.\nKnowing the delicate nature of the situation, it is imperative that the crew be as careful as possible, for any misstep could cost them their life. But the attraction between Hildi and Django is too great, and after a tearful reunion, the two can't help but exchange a few longing glances at one another. The glances, however subtle, are evidence enough of Django and Hildi being familiar with one another, and that's the very moment that set everything in motion. If Hildi could've been assigned another task in the house, she could've avoided her public shaming and bloodbath that occurred at the plantation.\nWhen Django first tells Dr. Schultz his idea of rescuing his wife, Dr. Schultz practically takes it as a joke. The idea seems so unrealistic that he initially encourages Django to move on with his life. Then, against his better judgment, Dr. Schultz ends up accompanying Django on his impossible rescue mission. Although he claims it is because he felt responsible for Django after setting him free, a few moments in the second act show it's deeper than that.\nDr. Schultz has faith in Django's mission and truly believes that he can do it. To him, it is a matter of fate, a story written in the fairytales of German lore. Schultz knows that the bond that Hildi and Django share is too powerful and that Django will stop at nothing to achieve it; naturally, he wants to be the one to help his partner along. Schultz's compassionate heart helps him devise a clever scheme that gets him as far as the plantation–once he gets there, however, he starts to have regrets.\nWhen the reality of the situation sets in, Schultz begins to reflect on all the people who were tortured and killed to achieve Django's dream, and grows uncomfortable with the whole idea. When their cover is blown, Schultz is almost relieved that he's finally able to come clean with how much he regrets meeting Calvin Candie. It's lucky for Django that Schultz is an idealist at heart; maybe if given the chance to redo his decision, Schultz would've gone about things differently.\nTarantino is a director known for his clever use of color. Whether it's a filter or a costume, his bold use of color makes a statement about character roles and tone. Django Unchained is no exception to this rule and uses color and costumes to give the audience clues about the film's order of power.\nThroughout the movie, monochromatic costumes are often used as a symbol of importance. The powerful men in the South, like the U.S. Marshall, can be seen wearing all white or all black. The underlings tend to wear a combination of both, establishing a hierarchy through the use of color. Schultz, a man who treats everyone equally, usually wears neutral colors like gray. When characters are making a statement of status, they wear bold, bright colors, like Candie's luxurious burgundy suit and Django's royal blue ensemble.\nSince its 2012 release, there have been talks of a Django Unchained sequel, with Tarantino's plan to allegedly team Django up with the legendary sword-wielding hero Zorro. Instead, Tarantino opted to continue the story in a comic book series. However, if a sequel were to materialize on the silver screen, there are a couple of plot points it could run with.\nRight before his explosive death, Stephen yells that Django will be the one on wanted posters and that he'll be hunted down for what he did to Candyland. Django Unchained 2 could see Django go from the hunter to the hunted. As the new \"fastest gun in the south\", he could fight off those who come after him for the crimes he committed in Django Unchained. By then, he and Hildi could have started a family with gunslinging talents of their own. It would be extremely satisfying and fitting to see Hildi wield a pistol and help her beau shoot down bounty hunters.\nIG: @kysheeta_c\n\nKaillaby is a writer from NYC with a passion for anime, movies, and all things pop culture.

{"title": "14 Best Scary Movies To Stream", "date": "2023-10-05 23:57:17", "text": "With Halloween right around the corner, it's time to find the best scary movies to watch at home on streaming to get into the spooky mood.\nHorror movies have been becoming increasingly popular in recent years with some incredible remakes, sequels, and several new original stories that have made big waves. For years, horror movies were primarily enjoyed at the cinema with a group of friends as everyone gripped tightly onto their popcorn. Now, with the ease and availability of so many streaming platforms and their large libraries of content, more people are choosing to dim the lights in their own homes and snuggle up in a warm blanket to watch horror from the comfort of the couch.\nDedicated horror streaming platforms like Shudder are a good option for die-hard horror fans, but for more casual viewers getting into the spooky season, it's worth knowing what movies are available on other popular platforms. HBO Max, Peacock, and DirecTV appear to have the best selection of all-time great horror films for anyone interested in watching the classics like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, John Carpenter's The Thing, or Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street. And for even more of the best movies available right now on streaming, see the list below.\nThe Exorcist is widely regarded as one of the all-time greatest horror films ever made. Originally released in 1973 and then plagued by critical outrage from the Catholic Church seeking the film to be banned, The Exorcist drummed up a great deal of controversy while also being praised for its incredible screenplay and sound which helped to create a truly horrifying film. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and nominations in nine other categories. In The Exorcist, 12-year-old Regan becomes possessed by a demon and the film deals with the traumatic experience of trying desperately to exorcise her with the help of two priests. For keen horror fans, The Exorcist is a must-watch film available currently on HBO Max.\nPsycho has been adapted many times from the original novel by Robert Bloch, but perhaps none more famous or successful than the original 1960 film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. When a young woman's car breaks down on a quiet road, she is saved by the well-mannered young hotel owner, Norman Bates who provides her shelter and food in her dire need. The film becomes increasingly unsettling as the plot unfolds and it also contains one of the best twists in any horror to this day. Psycho is currently available to watch on Peacock.\nRelated: Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho: 10 Things That Still Hold Up Today\nStanley Kubrick's The Shining is adapted from the novel by famous horror writer Stephen King. Released in 1980, just three years after the book debuted and starred a young Jack Nicholson as a writer who takes his family along with him to care for a hotel in its off-season. Nicholson delivers an outstanding performance as a man slowly descending into madness and the story grows increasingly bizarre, tragic, and horrifying as events unfold. The Shining is now streaming on HBO Max and DirecTV.\nAlien, directed by Ridley Scott and starring a young Sigourney Weaver in the early days of her career, is another classic horror film that set the tone for what classic horror should be. Released in 1979, Alien expanded into a large franchise with many sequels and prequels, and still, more are being made now, the story of terrifying alien creatures that can infect and grow in the human body continues to be one of the most enduring and popular images in all of horror history. The first film in the franchise is currently available to watch on Hulu.\nHalloween was directed by the legendary John Carpenter who will appear on this list again. A deranged man in a mask sets out to commit violent murders around his hometown of Haddonfield and through this film and several sequels, the rampage only continues to get increasingly brutal and terrifying. The series also features Jamie Lee Curtis as possibly the most famous final girl of any horror franchise, Laurie Strode. Halloween is the classic slasher movie and perfect for getting into the Halloween spirit, available to watch with a subscription on Shudder, AMC+, or FuboTV, and free with ads on Crackle, Redbox, and Plex.\nChanging gears to a much more modern film for a moment, Get Out earned its place on this list of all-time great horrors thanks to incredible direction and vision from Jordan Peele and an outstanding performance by Daniel Kaluuya as a young black man who uncovers shocking secrets about his white girlfriend's family. The film plays on the uneasiness of this visit and the subtle challenges that may be experienced by an interracial couple with family who may not be accepting but takes this concept much further with unsettling twists and dark secrets. Get Out can be viewed on Peacock, FuboTV and FX Now with a subscription.\nRelated: Get Out's Inspirations Explained\n1982's The Thing is also directed by John Carpenter and tells the story of a group of researchers exploring Antarctica. During the course of their work, some thing begins to wreak havoc when their research is interrupted by disturbing occurrences. This creature has the ability to inhabit and imitate other beings and things get really weird, really fast. Starring Kurt Russell at the height of his career, The Thing is not to be missed and can be found on Peacock with a subscription.\nThis film from 1974 was originally marketed as being based on a true story in order to attract audiences, and it largely did that. However, the story is largely fictional with some details about the killer being inspired by the mass murderer Ed Gein. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has been remade and inspired sequels about the story which follows an isolated killer who wields a chainsaw and wears people's faces as a mask. This first installment steps up the intensity of classic slashers with a more high-powered weapon and a small group of victims to hunt down and can be seen over on Peacock with a subscription now.\nThe Silence of the Lambs starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins seeks to bring audiences deep into the mind of a twisted killer. Foster plays a young FBI agent who calls upon Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter for help on a case. The issue is, that Hannibal is himself a cannibalistic murderer. Despite his murderous tendencies, Hannibal is also brilliant, as a trained psychiatrist and capable of attuning his mind to that of other killers. Creepy and unsettling throughout, The Silence of the Lambs can be seen on HBO Max and DirecTV with a subscription now.\nEd and Lorraine Warren are experienced demonologists who assist others struggling with supernatural occurrences. During 2012's The Conjuring, they come face to face with exceedingly powerful demons and possessions that create an incredibly unsettling and disturbing film. Starring Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, The Conjuring is a dark and twisted tale that will make anyone look twice at unassuming dolls just in case something more sinister could be lurking within. Available to stream on both HBO Max and DirecTV with a subscription.\nRelated: The Conjuring Universe Complete Timeline\nThe haunting series of films that started with 2004's Saw follows the twisted games of a madman hiding behind a puppet played out by unsuspected and unwilling contestants. Jigsaw carefully selects his victims by watching people he deems to be unworthy, or perhaps not living up to their potential, and then he traps them in a fatal game, usually against other players in order to win their life and learn how to live a better, more grateful and attuned life. Some of the most gruesome and anxiety-inducing deaths in horror are played out in this series, but they are exceptionally well thought out and there's a twisted sense of morals to sink into with this series. Available to watch with a subscription on Peacock, Prime Video, Starz and FuboTV, or with ads on Tubi.\nWes Craven's literal nightmare fuel, A Nightmare on Elm Street was released in 1984. Following the terrifying Freddy Krueger who literally walks through children's dreams and kills them in their sleep, this movie is full of jump scares, and horrifying moments of the disfigured Krueger chasing children through lengthy dream corridors. This was also the film that launched Robert Englund as a horror icon and inspired dozens of parodies in pop culture. A Nightmare on Elm Street was also the first project that Johnny Depp performed in and can be seen on HBO Max with a subscription.\nScream is one of the most legendary franchises in horror with incredible stars like Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Matthew Lillard and even a brief appearance by Drew Barrymore. The series follows a series of murders in Woodsboro and eventually further afield. Scream does an incredible job of interacting with Horror as a medium with Scream first releasing in 1996 and playing with popular tropes from slashers that came before. Every installment seeks to subvert expectations and lead the viewers on a mystery manhunt to uncover the killer or killers under the Ghostface mask. Scream can be streamed on HBO Max for anyone with a paid subscription.\nX starring Mia Goth is a deeply harrowing film that follows a group of young people recording a porn film in rural Texas. The group has rented a property from an elderly couple who live on the land nearby and appear to become suspicious of what these holidaymakers are doing. The whole film creates an incredibly tense and challenging atmosphere as it deals with confronting and challenging imagery and once things start to go wrong, they go very, very wrong. The film also creatively uses Mia Goth to play both the role of the young starring actress and the older, more restricted woman to create interesting parallels and unsettling moments throughout. X can be seen on Showtime, FuboTV and DirecTV for those with a subscription.\n"}
{"title": "John Wick's Perfect Replacement Hero Debuted 2 Years Ago In This Action Movie Hidden Gem", "date": "2023-10-06 00:00:26", "text": "The future of the John Wick franchise feels increasingly unclear, but the perfect action movie replacement already hit theaters two years ago. \nJohn Wick is one of the most iconic action franchises out there, but even if John Wick: Part 5 happens, the future of the Lionsgate movies is uncertain — and there's one existing action hero who could replace Keanu Reeves' if it comes to it. Reeves made his debut as the assassin John Wick in 2014, winning the hearts of critics and general audiences alike. The success of the first John Wick movie spawned multiple sequels, as well as the less-loved TV series The Continental. John Wick: Part 4 could have served as a definitive ending for the film series, but it seems like Lionsgate isn't ready to let go yet.\nDespite John Wick 4's ending, John Wick 5 is starting to seem increasingly more likely. Additionally, the John Wick universe is expanding with spinoffs like The Continental. It's very possible the series will continue, even if it changes drastically. However, given recent developments, it's just as likely to conclude sometime in the near future. Either way, the perfect replacement for the John Wick franchise already exists; the hidden gem actually released in movie theaters two years ago.\nJohn Wick may have a hold on the action genre, but one 2021 movie has the potential to become its replacement: Nobody. Starring Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul alum Bob Odenkirk, Nobody debuted to stellar reviews, receiving an 84% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes and a whopping 94% from audiences. Nobody also fared well at the box office considering the circumstances — it released as the industry was still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic — and it's easy to see why audiences enjoyed Odenkirk's first outing as an action hero.\nNobody follows Odenkirk's Hutch Mansell, a former assassin whose deadly skills are reawakened when his home in the suburbs is broken into. The incident leads to a number of revelations, with Hutch's family eventually finding themselves in the midst of all the danger. Odenkirk gives a compelling performance as the movie's lead, and he could easily hold his own if Nobody were to become a full-fledged action franchise. Although the first movie didn't add anything particularly groundbreaking to the genre, it served as a promising and action-packed beginning to a story that could take over when the John Wick craze fades.\nAlthough John Wick doesn't need a replacement just yet, the franchise's future is feeling less certain. There are a few reasons for that, but the most obvious goes back to John Wick 4's ending. The most recent installment of the series concluded with Reeves' titular hero supposedly perishing during a face-off with Donnie Yen's Caine. It's possible the Baba Yaga faked his own death. However, if Reeves' character truly is gone, it'll be difficult for John Wick: Part 5 to keep the franchise going. The lead character — and the actor who plays him — is the main draw, so it's hard to see the series faring nearly as well without him.\nAnd while John Wick's franchise future could lean into spinoffs, prequels, and sequels, that approach may not be as promising as it once seemed. After all, The Continental attempted to explore the world of John Wick from a different perspective, but the 2023 series didn't capture the heart of the films. The Continental reviews are so much worse than the John Wick movies, suggesting that a future without the title character isn't so bright. With that in mind, the world may soon be in need of a new action hero.\nIf Nobody hopes to compete with — or even replace — John Wick, it will need to return with an equally compelling sequel. Fortunately, Nobody 2 is already in the works. Nobody 2 producer Kelly McCormick told Collider that, if everything goes as planned, production on the sequel should begin sometime in 2024. Writer David Leitch has been working on the script, and Odenkirk seems confident and eager to return.\nThe ending and post-credits scene of Nobody certainly leaves the door open for another go-round. Hutch hasn't addressed his inner conflict fully by the time Nobody comes to a close, and the character will need more screen time to make the decision the story is building to: should he forego his life as an assassin for his family or try to embrace both personas? This is an internal struggle that sets Nobody apart from John Wick, and it could become the action genre's next big focus.\nSource: Rotten Tomatoes, Collider\nAmanda Mullen is an entertainment writer with a passion for all things books, films, and television.

{"title": "New Stephen King Horror Movie Continues 36-Year Failure, Confirming Harsh Reality For Spinoffs", "date": "2023-10-06 00:00:26", "text": "Not even Stephen King's new horror movie can break free from a decades-long failure. Here's why not even the King of Horror can save it. \nStephen King's new horror movie Pet Sematary: Bloodline is continuing a decades-long failure that not even the King of Horror can avoid, and its performance at the box office is confirming a harsh reality for spinoffs of his original works. There have been plenty of Stephen King movie and TV remakes that have been done well, but when it comes to derivative projects, they don't seem to succeed as well. Not even following the intriguing character of Jud Crandall, and finding out the origins of the mystical burial ground introduced in the first Pet Sematary can make the film shine.\nEven working with a foundation rooted in King's works, sequels to his stories don't seem to draw nearly the sort of audience that material from his own imagination does. Beginning with A Return To Salem's Lot in 1987 and continuing with Pet Sematary 2 in 1992, movies that continue the world created in classic King novels never seem to find their footing with even his most ardent fans. In the shadow of their predecessors, a lot of pressure rides on their successfully recreating what made the originals so good, and based on everything we know about Pet Sematary: Bloodline, it's trying to tell its own story.\nDespite having an intriguing premise and promising to answer a plot hole that's plagued fans of Pet Sematary for 40 years, even Pet Sematary: Bloodline continues a negative trend of movies that are derivative of King's original books and stories. It follows Jud and his first encounter with the burial ground, something he explains many decades later to Louis Creed as he mourns the death of his family's cat and wonders how to return the smile to his young daughter's face. Jud encourages using the burial ground's power despite it being a \"curdled place\" because he wants to teach the girl that \"sometimes dead is better.\"\n Besides the odd choice to violate the natural order of things in order to enforce morals on someone else's child, fans have always wondered why Jud told Louis about the burial ground if he knew the consequences of burying anything there, and the film doesn't really answer that question, though it has many of the same thrills and chills of the original film. Lindsey Anderson Beer’s film only makes Jud's actions later seem more erratic than ever, and the low success of Pet Sematary: Bloodlines indicates that spinoffs and prequels only work when King himself is behind the story.\nDisregarding It: Chapter Two, which is simply the second part of one (albeit giant) Stephen King book, Doctor Sleep seems to be the only Stephen King movie sequel that has worked. Starring Ewan McGregor as an adult Danny Torrance, it centers on him healing from his traumatic experiences at the Overlook Hotel, exploring the supernatural power known as \"the shining\" introduced in King's novel by the same name, and Danny's relationship with a young teen who shines the same way that he does, and whose light has attracted more malevolent entities.\nOne of the main reasons why the movie works so well, aside from McGregor's magnetic performance and its truly immersive horror experience, is the fact that King had written the sequel it was based on. This helped create a solid foundation for its story, and it's no wonder why the movie clocks in at nearly three hours - the screenplay left none of King's world-building out the way Stanley Kubrick's The Shining did. Pet Sematary: Bloodline largely tries to do its own thing and flounders the most when it tries to sync up with King's book, ultimately failing because it doesn't answer any of the questions a prequel origin story should.\n"}
{"title": "DC Admits Jason Momoa Would Nail a Major Upcoming MCU Role", "date": "2023-10-06 00:00:26", "text": "DC pokes playful fun at the casting rumors surrounding Jason Momoa — including the possibility that he could play one major upcoming MCU role.\nWarning! Contains spoilers for DC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1!\nWith DC currently gearing up for a new cinematic universe, plenty of casting rumors are spinning — including the fate of the DCEU's Aquaman, Jason Momoa, who is often fancast as DC's Main Man, Lobo. In a new short story for Halloween, Lobo's daughter Crush points out his perfect MCU counterpart as well: Wolverine.\nThis surprising comparison takes place in the story \"Happy Hal(Lobo)ween!\" by Hans Rodionoff, Adam F. Goldberg, Danny Earls, Patricio Delpeche, and Dave Sharpe from DC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1. Lobo crashes his daughter's apartment to force her to help him come up with the perfect Halloween costume. This involves Crush trying to point Lobo towards Hugh Jackman's famous portrayal of Wolverine, but, due to legal issues, she can't outright say this.\nThis leads Lobo to dress up as a litany of Hugh Jackman characters, but never the iconic X-Men character. Finally, exhausted by her father, Crush suggests she dress up as the other superhero that Lobo bears a striking resemblance to: Aquaman.\nRelated: DC's Answer to Wolverine Gets Even More Savage With New Zombie Form\nLobo is one of the more extreme characters from the '80s and '90s, and a lot of fans believe that Lobo was DC's answer to Marvel's Wolverine. Lobo is an absolutely absurd satire of both over-the-top masculinity and action heroes in general. He's a wise-cracking bounty hunter who perpetually has a lit cigar in his mouth, and he travels around space on a skull-adorned motorcycle. It's obvious why Lobo is such a beloved character considering how ridiculous he is. Despite how beloved and popular Lobo is with fans, he's never been adapted into any live-action movies, and the idea of who would play him is a heated debate. It seems DC has not only confirmed who could play Lobo on the big screen — but also who could possibly play the MCU's Wolverine.\nOne of the most popular fan casts for Lobo is none other than Jason Momoa, who also plays Aquaman in the ill-fated DCEU. This fan cast is so popular that the actor has even responded to it, and it seems DC is completely aware of the demand. In this year's Halloween story, after Crush gets exhausted trying to get Lobo to dress up as Wolverine, she instead points him to dress up as Aquaman, which is a cute reference to both the actor's and fans' desire to see Momoa play Lobo. While Lobo doesn't believe he has any resemblance to Aquaman at all, he's only thinking of the Arthur Curry of the DC Universe. The version of Aquaman played by Momoa looks a lot closer to the Main Man.\nDC is well aware that fans want Momoa to play Lobo, and the actor himself is even up to the task. But, in admitting that Lobo shares a striking resemblance to both Aquaman and Wolverine, the publisher has revealed that, if Momoa can't ever play Lobo, then maybe he will find himself on the big screen playing the iconic Wolverine for the ever-expanding MCU instead.\nDC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1 is on sale now from DC Comics!\n"}

Known by millions for his sensational skills on the soccer field, David Beckham, along with his equally famous wife Victoria, has been in the spotlight for decades both on and off the pitch. Beckham rose to prominence as a loyal member of Manchester United, one of the greatest professional soccer clubs in the history of the Premier League. He started dating Victoria Adams in 1997 following her success as a singer in the popular Spice Girls group.\nBeckham aims to shine a light on David and Victoria's lesser-known qualities while revealing several new details on their careers and relationship history in the process. While everybody now recognizes the name Beckham, the documentary provides previously inaccessible coverage of the intricacies of what it's actually like to be David Beckham. The Netflix doc also chronicles David's humble beginnings and the internal battles that the superstar faced through the most intense and demanding parts of his celebrated career. David retired from soccer in 2013, fourteen years after marrying Victoria. Here are the ten biggest reveals from the four-partNetflix miniseries Beckham.\nRELATED: Untold Johnny Football – 10 Biggest Reveals About Manziel's Rise & Fall In Netflix's Documentary\nBeckham's first episode opens up with scenes of David Beckham tending to his bee farm fulling clothed in beekeeper's attire. He collects honey very naturally and hands some over to director Fisher Stevens, who is just as impressed as the viewing audience likely is. Outside of soccer, which Beckham has not played professionally in over ten years, beekeeping is just one of David's many hobbies that he enjoys regularly. Another favorite pastime of David's is to collect and assemble Legos. He unsurprisingly also loves to shop and invest in luxury items such as designer watches.\nBefore one of the most infamous games in David Beckham's career, Victoria revealed in Beckham that she told David that she was pregnant with their firstborn and eldest son Brooklyn. Victoria called David to tell him the news while he was in France awaiting a hotly contested matchup with the powerful Argentinian National team while she was in Brooklyn, New York, which inspired the name choice. Victoria reveals that while she and David were both incredibly happy about the news, she did not think much about how it would affect David going into one of the biggest games of his life.\nBefore David ever met Victoria in real life, he pointed her Spice Girls persona out on TV one day and announced that he was going to marry her. Beckham recalls being with former teammate Gary Neville and stating that he would marry \"the posh one\" in the future. Gary, of course, thought he was joking and started to laugh at David's earnestness. David soon proved to be incredibly serious about Victoria, who he knew nothing about at the time. By some magic, David turned out to be spot-on with his fortune-telling and he and Victoria have been together ever since.\nRELATED: 10 Biggest Reveals About Jason & Travis In Amazon's Kelce Documentary\nDavid and Victoria's marriage fell into very hot water when allegations surfaced about David's alleged infidelity with a former assistant of his by the name of Rebecca Loos. Loos came forward to the press that she and David had an affair that lasted four months when he first traveled to play in Spain for Real Madrid. David has always denied the allegations and Victoria has supported him, although both admit that it was the hardest part of their marriage by far. David recalls in the Beckham documentary that he is grateful that he and Victoria were able to come out of the difficult situation with their marriage intact.\nAfter the notorious incident in which David Beckham was ejected from the 1988 World Cup game against Argentina, he revealed that he was depressed after all of the public and media hate he received as a result. David recalls feeling hated by the entire country of England and not knowing how to handle all of the relentless public ridicule. Every time David would go anywhere in public, people would spit and cuss him out with fierce and intense hatred which left David feeling incredibly broken. David claims in Beckham that he was never quite the same after experiencing such public backlash on a national scale.\nDavid reveals in Beckham that he had a terrible spending habit when he first came into wealth. David is currently worth roughly $450 million so his early spending days did not do much to set him back financially. Beckham reveals that David's first paychecks that he revived on a Friday were typically gone by the following Saturday. He loved to spend his money on luxurious items, clothes, and even a brand-new BMW M3 from an Adidas endorsement deal. Considering Beckham's humble beginnings, it's hard to blame Beckham for indulging in the finer things.\nRELATED: Untold Hall Of Shame: The BALCO Drug Scandal & What Happened To Major Athletes After Investigation\nDavid's former soccer coach Sir Alex Ferguson expressed disapproval that David was starting to date Victoria Adams when he was still just a young player on Manchester United. Ferguson believed that dating a celebrity might steer David off the right path of becoming the world-class soccer player he could be. He instructed David not to take any photos together with Victoria in order to maintain their privacy. David obeyed and initially dated Victoria in secret, meeting in places like parks and avoiding the lurking eye of the paparazzi.\nDavid reveals that he charged his former Manchester United coach Alex Ferguson after the manager kicked a cleat at David, hitting him just above the eye. What was later revealed to be a freak accident and completely unintentional, an angry Ferguson kicked the soccer cleat at David which resulted in him apparently getting stitches. The following season, David was traded to Real Madrid, which was when his life began to spiral out of his control. He reveals in Beckham he never got to properly say goodbye to Ferguson.\nOne of the most unsettling revelations in Beckham is the horrific truth that David and Victoria received random threats that their newborn son Brooklyn would be kidnapped. These threats arose due to the lingering public hatred towards David after he was sent off in the 1998 World Cup. David recalls being afraid to leave the hospital in Beckham, sleeping up against the hospital room door where Victoria was staying. The couple recalls how they were somewhat robbed of the joy of their first newborn because of the intense paranoia circling around Daviid and the angry public.\nA lighthearted moment in Beckham arrives when Victoria recalls the instance in which David nearly missed the birth of his third son Cruz because he was tied up at a photo shoot with Jennifer Lopez.

{"title": "The Exorcist: Believer Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-06 00:51:10", "text": "The Exorcist: Believer builds to a final exorcism to deliver an ending with twists and sequel setup. Here's everything that happens and what it means.\nWarning: Contains SPOILERS for The Exorcist: Believer!\nThe Exorcist: Believer's ending revolves around a final exorcism to save Katherine and Angela's lives, and the event includes major revelations, death, and set up for a new trilogy of movies. Picking up almost 50 years after the original The Exorcist's story, the sequel shifts the franchise's focus to new families whose lives are changed when their daughters become possessed by demons. This brings Victor (Leslie Odom Jr.) to find Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) in the hope that she'll help the two families save the young girls. Ultimately, the fate of the girls is put in the hands of their parents and various spiritual leaders.\nIt is no surprise that The Exorcist: Believer builds to a final exorcism that puts the fates of Katherine (Olivia O'Neill) and Angela (Lidya Jewett) in the balance. This comes after Angela is confined to a mental institution while Katherine's parents attempt to help her at home. Chris is absent from the final exorcism after being stabbed in the eyes by Katherine, but she encourages Victor to recruit different people from all types of backgrounds and religious beliefs to help perform the final exorcism. The entire story wraps up rather neatly as there is no The Exorcist: Believer post-credits scene, but the final revelations still leave room for sequels.\nThe final exorcism in The Exorcist: Believer takes place at Victor's house. Katherine and Angela are both brought to the location after it is fitted for an exorcism. Victor is joined by Katherine's parents, the pastor at Katherine's church, Victor's nurse neighbor who previously wanted to be a nun, a local root doctor, and another one of Victor's neighbors who believes in God. The plan immediately goes awry when the Catholic priest tells them he cannot lead the exorcism as promised, but he passes leadership to the nurse, Ann (Ann Dowd).\nThe initial attempts to get the demon out of the girls are unsuccessful, as they mock Ann for her past, but the root doctor helps turn the night around. This leads to the demon revealing an impossible choice has to be made among the people in attendance; they must choose which girl lives and which one dies. The demon states that only one of them will survive, which connects to a deadly decision from Victor's past. While Victor and Katherine's mom Miranda (Jennifer Nettles) agree that they cannot and will not make that choice, Katherine's dad Tony (Norbert Leo Butz) panics and tells the demon he chooses Katherine to live.\nRelated: When Will The Exorcist: Believer Release On Streaming?\nIt initially appears as if Tony's decision is accepted by the demon, as Angela begins to float in the air before collapsing on the ground with no heartbeat and Katherine begins talking and looking like normal. However, this is where the demon's deceitful nature comes into play, as Angela begins to breathe again but Katherine dies. While attempts are made to save Katherine's life, she is taken away from the world of living. The death choice made by Tony in The Exorcist: Believer mirrors the one Victor made in his past, where who is chosen to live actually dies.\nOne of the big revelations in how The Exorcist: Believer ends goes back to the movie's opening sequence which results in the death of Victor's wife. An earthquake in Haiti leaves his pregnant wife with severe injuries, and Victor is told that he must make a difficult decision to choose between keeping his wife or unborn baby girl alive. His wife's wish was for him to protect the child at all costs, and the fact that Angela is alive after the 13-year time jump indicates that he followed through.\nIt is only during the exorcism that the demon reveals to everyone that Victor actually chose to save his wife instead of Angela, but the baby survived the operation instead. The revelation that Victor chose his wife over Angela recontextualizes much of their relationship. This is not something that Angela knew on her own, but it does explain why Victor is so protective and watchful over her now. The Exorcist: Believer's scary focus means there is no time for Victor and Angela to talk about the revelation after she gets better, but it would not be surprising if this puts a strain on their relationship going forward if she remembers.\nAngela surviving the exorcism leaves her with a clear fate as she returns to school, but where Katherine ends up in The Exorcist: Believer is more tragic. The movie indicates that she is pulled to Hell after her death. Katherine is shown in the woods again before she begins to be pulled underwater by many hands. This appears to be a visual representation of Katherine being taken to Hell by demons after she is tricked into being the sacrifice. It is unclear if The Exorcist: Believer is the last the franchise will show of Katherine or if her experience in Hell will factor into the sequel somehow.\nThe biggest surprise of the movie's ending is Linda Blair's return as Regan in The Exorcist: Believer. The movie makes multiple references to what happened to Regan after The Exorcist, but she is not an active part of the story. Her fate is instead left as a lingering mystery for most of the runtime. Thankfully, The Exorcist: Believer confirms Regan is alive and well by bringing Linda Blair back for a quick cameo. Regan is shown reuniting with Chris in the hospital during one of the final scenes. The appearance is an indication that viewers could see much more of Regan in The Exorcist: Deceiver.\nOne story point in The Exorcist: Believer that could create some confusion is the identity of the main demon that possesses Katherine and Angela. It is never named, but there are references made that the demon knows Chris and that she's encountered this spiritual being before. Despite the implication that The Exorcist: Believer's demon is Pazuzu, it has been confirmed that this is not the case. Director David Gordon Green revealed as much during interviews pre-release (via IGN), noting that the sequel has a new demon. However, he refuses to confirm the identity of the new demon, and The Exorcist: Believer does not confirm it either.\nThe fact that Angela's life is saved in The Exorcist: Believer might also have more to it than meets the eye. During the final moments, flashes of the blessing of protection Angela's mom gets while she is still pregnant are shown. This could mean that the blessing is actually what saved Angela's life, making the parallels to Victor's death choice before a coincidence. This would mean that the blessing is strong enough to prevent the demon from killing Angela but still allows her to be possessed. Ultimately, it is up to each viewer to decide which reading they want to believe.\nConsidering Universal announced The Exorcist: Believer as the start of a new trilogy, it is no surprise that the ending leaves the door open for its sequel. The follow-up is confirmed to be called The Exorcist: Deceiver, which indicates that there is more to what audiences witness here. The pastor specifically calls the demon a deceiver after the initial proposal of the death choice, so that could be a sign that Katherine and Angela's fates are not quite as sealed as believed. In any case, there is no doubt that the demon will return in some form, possibly pulling on the grief Katherine's parents struggle with.\nThe Exorcist: Deceiver's story is also sure to build on Chris and Regan's reunion too. The decision to bring Linda Blair back for a quick scene is certainly meant to get audiences excited to have her and Ellen Burstyn play bigger roles in the sequel. Both actresses had plenty of input on The Exorcist: Believer, and while their roles in the sequel are not yet officially confirmed, the intention is rather clear. The question then becomes if The Exorcist: Deceiver will fully shift the franchise's focus back to the MacNeil family or if Victor, Angela, and others will remain prominently featured.\nThe meaning of The Exorcist: Believer's ending is one of hope and belief. Despite it being a horror movie about the demonic possession of two young girls that features brutal deaths, The Exorcist: Believer leaves audiences with a message that believing in the good, and even God, is what everyone needs. It is seemingly only after Victor believes that the exorcism can work and reconnects with his daughter through his wife's scarf that his attitude and her fate begin to change. If there is any doubt about The Exorcist: Believer's true meaning of hope and belief, the final voice-over monologue provided by Ann Dowd makes it clear.\nSource: IGN\n"}

Will their relationship last?\nWARNING! This article contains spoilers for The Golden Bachelor!\nThe Golden Bachelor contestant Theresa Nist has made a deep connection with leading man Gerry Turner, but will they fall in love? Premiere night was Theresa's 70th birthday, and she emerged from the limousine teasing him that she was going to show him her birthday suit. When she opened her wrap, she revealed flesh-colored undergarments, and they both laughed. Later, Theresa Gerry gave Theresa a cupcake for her 70th birthday. He asked her if he took a bite of cupcake and had icing all over his mouth, would she help clean it up. She said yes, and asked him to do it. They then shared their first kiss.\nOn the second episode of The Golden Bachelor, Gerry gave Theresa his first one-on-one date. It was Gerry's first time driving on the California freeway, and the headlights on the car weren't working. However, when Theresa put her hand on Gerry's shoulder, he was immediately calmed. They went to Cadillac Jacks Drive-In & Diner, where they bonded about losing their spouses and feeling lonely. They talked about how they felt hope, while Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing\" played. They kissed and then participated in a flash mob, dancing in and outside of the diner. Gerry then gave Theresa the date rose.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nTheresa is a 70-year-old financial services professional from Shrewsbury, New Jersey. She's a mom and grandmother to six grandsons. Her ABC bio reveals that she's very close with her family, and \"loves nothing more than seeing them all thrive.\" She loves playing with her grandsons, and was shown playing ball in her premiere night package. Theresa said that she feels that she's at the best part of her life.\nIn her Golden Bachelor premiere night package, Theresa said that she feels like she has so much more life to live.

In the second episode, before her date with Gerry, Theresa admitted that she was thrilled beyond belief to receive it, but also \"a little scared.\" She shared that Billy was the love of her life, and she wondered if she could find that again.

He was drafted during the Vietnam War, and came home to be in his brother's wedding. They got married with two days' notice. They were high school sweethearts, and began dating when Theresa was 14 and Billy was 16. They were married for 42 years. Tragically, Billy passed away because, as Theresa told Gerry, his kidneys were \"not good.\" He'd always had hope of having a kidney transplant.\nHowever, tragically, one day when Theresa was at work, Billy suddenly took a turn for the worse. She ran home, and watched him take his last breath. Theresa shared in her confessional that, before Billy died, he told her that he hoped she would find someone and get married again.

{"title": "Who Is Ouroboros? Ke Huy Quan's Loki Season 2 Character Explained", "date": "2023-10-06 01:00:27", "text": "Academy Award winner Ke Huy Quan will be joining the cast of Loki season 2 as a new MCU character, with an interesting origin in Norse Mythology.\nPhase 5's Loki season 2 sees the addition of an exciting new character known as Ouroboros to the MCU. The second season of Tom Hiddleston's solo Disney+ series was announced on July 14, 2021, during Loki's season 1 finale, and is set to follow on from the events of the first season, which saw the eponymous God of Mischief exploring the Time Variance Authority (TVA), dealing with multiversal variants of himself, and coming face-to-face with Jonathan Majors' He Who Remains, a variant of Kang the Conqueror. The post-credits scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania teased the storyline for the next season of the MCU show, especially by teasing one of the new characters in the Loki season 2 cast.\nLoki's season 1 finale ended with Sylvie, played brilliantly be Sophia Di Martino, killing He Who Remains, which created thousands of branching timelines, and trapping Loki in a very different version of the TVA, ruled over by Kang the Conqueror himself rather than the fictitious Time Keepers. While Loki season 2 is set to introduce Victor Timely, another Kang variant, to the franchise, the MCU will also be blessed with the debut of Ke Huy Quan, fresh off a win for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards for his role in Everything Everywhere All At Once.\nRelated: Loki Season 1 Ending & Future Set-Up Explained\nKe Huy Quan assumes the role of Ouroboros in Loki season 2, confirming the rumors before the show's release that this would be his character. Quan is a brilliant addition to the MCU, having been featured as Short Round in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom when he was only twelve, and appearing as inventor Richard \"Data\" Wang a year later in The Goonies. After taking a lengthy break from acting, Quan returned as Waymond Wang in Everything Everywhere All At Once opposite Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, and Jamie Lee Curtis.\nKe Huy Quan's Ouroboros is revealed to be the chief engineer of the TVA - and, in fact, their only engineer. As such, he's responsible for the upkeep and repair of all of the faction's tools, including their time travel devices, which gives him some complicated tech to take care of. Luckily, OB is both shown to be an outright genius, and committed to his work, as the first episode of Loki season 2 sees him spend 400 years toiling away without a single visitor - until Loki himself appears.\nThere are a few different representations of Ouroboros in the pages of Marvel Comics. The Oculus Oroboros is introduced as a conduit of elemental magic, that depicts a variation on the classic ouroboros shape of a snake eating its tail by featuring a second snake. Doctor Doom once attempted to harness the power of the Oculus Oroboros, though was stopped by Doctor Strange. There is also an Admiral Ouroboros, who appeared in 2015's Silver Surfer Vol. 7 #11, depicted as an antagonistic character who comes face-to-face with the Silver Surfer after the latter becomes trapped in a time loop, reminiscent of Groundhog Day or Palm Springs.\nIt's unclear whether these idea will translate into Loki season 2, though the TVA's time-twisting technology has already been shown to trap individuals in time loops, as Loki was berated by Lady Sif over and over again as punishment. Interestingly, the time loop that the Silver Surfer finds himself in is referred to as a Möbius strip - Owen Wilson's Loki character is named Mobius M. Mobius, and Tony Stark utilized an inverted Möbius strip to crack time travel in Avengers: Endgame. It's possible that this time loop theme could play a major role in Loki season 2, but the name Ouroboros could also suggest a deeper connection to Loki himself.\nThe shape of an ouroboros is depicted as a snake forming a circle, with the end of its tail in its mouth. This image has roots in Ancient Egyptian and Ancient Greek iconography, but also has a deep connection to Norse Mythology, on which most of Thor and Loki's MCU storylines are based. In Norse Mythology, the ouroboros is formed by Jörmungandr, otherwise known as the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent, an unfathomably large snake-like creature that resides in the world sea, and is large enough to encircle the entire Earth and bite its own tail. Legend notes that when Jörmungandr releases its tail, the catastrophic Ragnarök event will occur.\nWhat deepens the mystery, however, is the fact that the Midgard Serpent is actually one of Loki's own children in Norse Mythology, along with Hel, the Goddess of Death, and the wolf Fenrir, both of whom were adapted for Thor: Ragnarok, though Cate Blanchett's Hela was Loki's sister in the MCU. In Norse Mythology, Thor often has run-ins with Jörmungandr, engaging in epic battles with the serpent, even fighting to the death during Ragnarök. It's unclear how much of this will be adapted by Ke Huy Quan in Loki season 2, but it could even point to a deeper link between Quan's character and the God of Mischief himself.\n"}

A new series of sequel films was announced in August, the result of a months-long fan campaign to revive the Netflix show. Recently, it was revealed that another update surrounding the film series would be revealed.\nNow, Warrior Nun Saved has revealed a contest for an original redesign of the Halo ahead of the upcoming Warrior Nun continuation. The contest will run until 11:59 p.m. ET on October 31, 2023 for participants in the US and Canada, and will be overseen by the creator of the Warrior Nun Areala comic Ben Dunn. The winner of the contest will receive an original, signed illustration from Dunn.\nThe upcoming Warrior Nun film trilogy was announced following an international campaign to revive the TV series after it was cancelled by Netflix in December 2022.

{"title": "2000's Dune Miniseries Director Hopes Denis Villeneuve's Movies Bring New Viewers To His Adaptation", "date": "2023-10-06 01:19:18", "text": "Dune miniseries director John Harrison praises Denis Villeneuve's Dune movies and hopes they will introduce new viewers to his previous adaptation.\nThe Dune miniseries director John Harrison hopes Denis Villeneuve's movies will bring new viewers to his adaptation. Frank Herbert's seminal 1965 sci-fi novel has been adapted to the screen several times starting with David Lynch's Dune from 1984, which was a critical and commercial failure and was disowned by the director due to studio interference. In 2000, a three-part miniseries officially titled Frank Herbert's Dune aired on the Sci-Fi Channel. Villeneuve's Dune, with the first film released in 2021, has become the definitive Dune adaptation due to its critical and commercial success.\nAhead of the Dune: Part Two release date in March 2024, the Dune miniseries director spoke to ComicBook and shared his praise for Villeneuve's movies. Harrison, who wrote and directed the Dune miniseries, says he is \"very excited\" about what Villeneuve is doing with the story and hopes it will introduce newcomers to his previous adaptation. Read what he shared below:\nI'm very excited about it. Richard Rubenstein and I were still involved in the development of several attempts to try and get it off the ground after my miniseries. And maybe fortunately, some of those never came to pass because I think what Denis Villeneuve has done is just fantastic. And I love him as a director. I wasn't involved at all in the latest movies except to have my name put up there. But I think it's just fantastic and I'm really looking forward to the new ones.\nAnd I hope it does introduce a whole new audience to the Dune world. If they are able to get back and see my miniseries, I'm very proud of them. We were able to ... I think the success of them, they won a couple of Emmys and they were hugely successful here and abroad. I think they gave people faith that Dune actually could be adapted again.\nThe Dune miniseries was generally well-received by critics and audiences. At the time, it was considered a vast improvement over Lynch's Dune which tried to cram the entire story, including all its intricate mythology and sprawling scope, into a single 2-hour 17-minute movie. However, it's worth mentioning that Lynch's preferred cut was three hours. Nevertheless, the Dune miniseries functioned better as an adaptation with a total runtime of 265 minutes. Today, the Dune miniseries still stands among the highest-rated programs ever broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel. As Harrison mentions, it also won two Emmys for Outstanding Cinematography and Visual Effects.\nRelated: Dune: What Sandworms Look Like In Every Adaptation\nBy breaking the book up into two parts, Villeneuve's movies adopted a similar approach as the miniseries, which is probably why Harrison appreciates them so much. Similarly, Villeneuve's Dune won several Oscars for its technical accomplishments, including cinematography, visual effects, production design, and sound. Villeneuve and Harrison's Dune adaptations actually have much in common, so it's possible the movies could bring new viewers to the miniseries, as the director hopes. However, one should temper their expectations considering the miniseries is now over 20 years old and was made on a fraction of the budget for $20 million.\nSource: ComicBook\n"}
{"title": "Suits Officially Breaks Another Streaming Record After Previously Tying With A Netflix Original", "date": "2023-10-06 01:32:17", "text": "Suits' relentless streaming dominance continues after breaking another streaming record it once tied for alongside a hit Netflix Original.\nContinuing its record-breaking streaming trend, the 2011 legal drama Suits has officially smashed another record in Nielsen’s viewership rankings, overtaking yet another massive Netflix original. First climbing back into widespread public consciousness when the hit drama began dominating streaming charts four years after it ended, Suits would eventually overtake Netflix’s hit show Wednesday for weekly viewership minutes. More recently, it also tied with Netflix’s Ozark for spending the longest time atop Nielsen’s Top 10 Overall Charts.\nPer The Hollywood Reporter, Suits can now officially add this new record to its ever-growing list of accolades, as finally overtook Ozark’s 11-week record thanks to the legal drama’s 12 consecutive weeks in the top slot. Making the feat even more impressive, Suits achieved its record in a single continuous streak, while Ozark had previously held its title spread across multiple season releases.\nWhile Suits’ original 2011 release was a success for USA Network, earning favorable reviews and strong viewership numbers, the show’s popularity gradually waned following the departure of key cast members such as Meghan Markle and Patrick J. Adams. Nonetheless, the show’s recent resurgence on streaming reveals the enduring appeal of its quick wit and largely formula-driven narratives. However, the timing of Suits' continued record-breaking streak on streaming television coincides perfectly with many important conversations currently taking place about streaming services and the equity of continuing residuals paid to actors and creatives.\nEarlier this year, Suits writer Ethan Drogin admitted that while he was elated to see the show’s resurgence on Netflix and Peacock, he had earned less than $300 in streaming residuals despite its overwhelming success. While the Writers Guild of America has recently come to an agreement with streaming services, which includes a dramatic new performance-based pay bonus structure for writers, members of SAG-AFTRA are still currently waiting to see the outcome of their own ongoing strike action.\nWhile Suits’ recent resurgence in popularity may have no direct connection to the wave of industrial action sweeping through Hollywood, its timing perfectly demonstrated many of the growing inequities that industry guilds were attempting to challenge. Perhaps once the recent public interest in Suits begins to die down, the show’s enduring legacy will come to mean much more than its growing collection of streaming records. Instead, its unlikely resurgence may have also potentially done much to help shine a light on important industry concerns and bring them out into the open.\nSource: THR\n"}
{"title": "Loki Season 2 Episode 1's Post-Credits Scene Is Way Deeper Than You Realize", "date": "2023-10-06 01:45:25", "text": "Loki season 2's first post-credits scene is big on nostalgia, but the real meaning is probably deeper than you realize at first.\nWARNING: This Article Contains MAJOR SPOILERS For Loki Season 2, Episode 1\nIn the grand tradition of most Marvel Cinematic Universe releases, Loki season 2 episode 1 has a post-credits scene. Following directly on from the daring mission to pull Tom Hiddleston's Loki out of the timeline and stop his time-slipping, the first Loki season 2 stinger is also an important one.\nLoki season 2 has already started off strongly, with a complicated storyline injected with a lot of scientific jargon (not least from Ke Huy Quan’s Ouroboros). It’s also very obvious that the show is less interested in tying to wider MCU timeline events, and focusing instead on the continued battle for the Sacred Timeline set up by Loki season 1’s ending. But that doesn’t mean all MCU traits are out the window, with the post-credits scene offering that element of familiarity.\n Watch Loki On Disney+\nAfter the credits role on Loki season 2 episode 1’s ending and Loki has avoided being spaghettified or lost in time, the post-credits scene flips back to Sophia Di Martino’s Sylvie in the immediate aftermath of He Who Remain's death. Sylvie transports herself to 1982, enters a McDonalds (perfectly rebuilt from the early 1980s designs, including the freakish cartoon tree), speaks to the young manager and orders one of everything on the menu. Quite how she pays for all of those burgers, fries and nuggets is anyone's guess, but since the marketing has spoiled that Sylvie ends up working at the same McDonalds, maybe she's forced initially to do so to pay off the fast food debt. Or she uses magic.\nRelated: How Powerful Each Loki Variant Really Is (& Who Is The Strongest)\nAs confirmed by the Loki season 2 episode 1 post-credits scene, Sylvie didn't stay in the Citadel at the End of Time after killing Jonathan Majors' He Who Remains in season 1's finale. Having completed her mission, she did exactly as Thanos did, seeking her own personal peace, by leaving and jumping somewhere else in the timeline. Sylvie's outfit all but confirms that the McDonalds scene happens immediately after He Who Remains' death.\nThe question most will have watching the Loki season 2 episode 1 post-credits scene is why McDonalds and why 1982. For the first answer, you have to consider Sylvie's tragic origin story. As she reveals in Loki's Lamentis episode, the TVA attempted to prune her when she was roughly ten years old in human terms (but a lot older as a Frost Giant). She flees and spends the rest of her life on the run, which, judging by the life-span of Frost Giants (at least around 5000 years), would mean she'd probably been on the run for thousands of years. She never got her chance of her truly formative years, which would have included simple pleasures like the Asgardian equivalent of McDonalds.\nSylvie seems drawn to McDonalds because of the same wonder that made the fast food giants so popular with children. It's a simple, almost naive pleasure, completely in contrast with Sylvie's life of fight and flight. Sylvie has also never been able to enjoy anything, constantly looking over her shoulder and having to move everywhere to keep ahead of the TVA. Being able to go somewhere as innocuous as McDonalds and not be worried about how conspicuous she is in her Asgardian outfit, which she noticeably doesn't disguise, is a huge indication that she believes she's beaten the TVA.\nRelated: How Old Is Sylvie Compared To Loki?\nLoki season 2 episode 1 suggests that Loki time slips because Sylvie kicks him back into the past from the Citadel at the End of Time before she kills He Who Remains. Because he was previously pruned - i.e. removed from the timeline - his presence back on the timeline causes a glitch, sending him randomly slipping through time without warning. In contrast, Sylvie was never pruned - or at least wasn't \"deleted\" using one of the TVA time sticks - so is able to go back to the timeline in 1982 without the same danger of time slipping.Related: Why Loki Is Glitching In Season 2: Time-Slipping Explained\nSylvie's choice of the small town of Broxton, Oklahoma for her new home may not seem to have any significance in Loki's TV show lore, but it is an important site in Marvel Comics, which suggests it may be some sort of nexus location in wider Marvel lore. In the comics, Thor purchases land just outside of Broxton (paying with a truck load of gold), to rebuild Asgard in the wake of Ragnarok.\nObviously, in the MCU, Thor and Valkyrie rebuilt Asgard in Norway, but the new Asgard was in America on the page, setting up the events of Siege, which took place around Broxton. In that event, Norman Osborn seeks to invade Asgard, under the pretense of a threat to the United States, but really as a means to strengthen his own power. Loki actually plays a key role in that Siege, convincing Osborn to orchestrate a tragedy at Soldier Field football stadium, where thousands of civilians are killed during a battle between Volstagg and villains working for Osborn, as he and Loki watch on.\nOther notable events in Broxton include it being the site of the death of Cul Borson (AKA Serpent), as well as a war between the Asgardians and Galactus, and finally, its destruction by the God Of Hammers, which killed its residents, as a means to draw Thor's anger. Sylvie heading there in Loki's season 2 episode 1 post-credits scene doesn't tie to those events - though it could similarly endanger the town and its people - but it fits a rich Marvel history.\nLoki season 2 continues next Thursday, Oct. 12 at 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "The MCU Just Broke A Time Travel Rule The Avengers Called Unbreakable Only 4 Years Ago", "date": "2023-10-06 01:50:26", "text": "The MCU just broke one of its biggest time travel rules, only four years after it was established as unbreakable by Marvel movie canon.\nWARNING: This Article Contains SPOILERS For Loki Season 2, Episode 1\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe introduced time travel in Avengers: Endgame, but four years later, Loki season 2 has broken one of the major rules established by Marvel Studios' 2019 movie. After Thanos snapped away half the universe in Avengers: Infinity War, Earth's Mightiest Heroes set out to figure out how to travel through time in order to undo the devastation wreaked by the Mad Titan. With the help of Tony Stark's genius and Scott Lang's knowledge of the Quantum Realm, they managed it, and used time travel to gather the Infinity Stones and defeat Thanos.\nEndgame also established a certain number of time travel rules, the biggest of which was that if someone traveled back in time and changed the past, it wouldn't affect the present. As Smart Hulk explains, \"If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future, and your former present becomes the past, which can't now be changed by your new future.\" The scene further established that time travel in movies like Back to the Future and The Terminator are incorrect because their premises are based on the theory that changing the past does, in fact, change the future. However, the Loki season 2 premiere completely breaks this rule in a big way.\nRelated: Loki’s Powers Explained In Full: How Each Ability Is Different\nIn Loki season 2, episode 1, Loki is having trouble time-slipping, which essentially means he's being pulled between the past, present and future at random. This actually comes in handy when he and Mobius visit the TVA's chief engineer Ouroboros, aka OB, for help putting an end to the time-slipping. Loki meets OB in the present, then time-slips to the past, where he has a conversation with the engineer about how to fix his time-slipping problem, leading the past OB to create a Temporal Aura Extractor that will help solve the problem in the present. Since OB is shown remembering the conversation with Loki as it's happening in the past, the audience can deduce that Loki's actions in the past are changing the future.\nThis goes against everything Smart Hulk, and by extension Avengers: Endgame, established in terms of how time travel works in the MCU. If changing the past affected the future, then everything from the Avengers' time heist would've had ripple effects and when they returned to their present, it would've been completely different. Thanos may never have been able to achieve the snap in the first place, and it would've been an anticlimactic ending to the Infinity Saga. However, establishing one set of rules in Endgame and then proceeding to retcon them over and over and over again in Marvel movies and shows since has only led to more confusion. Still, there's an easy way for Marvel to explain Loki breaking Endgame's time travel rules.\nThere's one repeating line in Loki that helps to explain why the God of Mischief was able to change the future by changing the past: Time works differently in the TVA. It's a constant refrain in Loki season 1, and that theme has continued into season 2. If time as a whole works differently, it stands to reason that time travel works differently as well. This would be an easy explanation for Loki being able to break Endgame's rules, because Loki time-slipping breaks even the rules known by the TVA. However, the episode also establishes that the way time works in the TVA is changing, which may be explained by the creation of the multiverse.\nEndgame took place before Sylvie killed He Who Remains, so the MCU was existing within the Sacred Timeline, and any changes to it would've been pruned by the TVA. Hulk's time travel rules may have been true for the Sacred Timeline, due to factors outside his and the audience's knowledge, but now that the multiverse exists, time travel doesn't work in the same way. This explanation would set up the MCU to not have to adhere to the rules established in Endgame, while not actively retconning the movie. \nOf course, it still means that Marvel needs to re-establish what the MCU's time travel rules are and ensure all movies and shows stick to them. Considering the massive multiversal war teased by Loki, and the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania post-credits scene, it's important audiences are clear on how time travel and travel between multiverses works—not just in a single movie or show, but across the entire franchise. Endgame's time travel rules were already confusing and have been made worse because they've been retconned so many times that it's become a running joke, and even Loki season 2 joined in on poking fun.\nWhen Loki, OB and Mobius are having their conversation across time, Mobius realizes that Loki is changing the present by changing the past, and OB says \"there's no flaw in that logic.\" Although the dialogue doesn't call out the Avengers or Endgame by name, it feels like a major diss to the 2019 MCU movie due to how many times Endgame's logic has been called into question. The pithy comment is played as a joke, and considering Endgame established rules directly contrary to the scene, it makes the Avengers movie the butt of the joke.\nThat said, the Loki season 2 premiere likely isn't trying to be maliciously mean to Endgame, especially since the movie is beloved by many and was by far the MCU's most successful film to date. But Endgame's time travel rules have been widely discussed and dissected ever since it released, and even within the movie itself, they don't make much sense. Having Loki rewrite the time travel rules of the MCU, while poking a bit of fun at Endgame, is a good way to show audiences that Marvel knows what they're doing and are trying to fix their mistakes.\nIt also shows that Endgame's time travel issues are incredibly far-reaching and, even four years later, Loki is still working to fix them so the MCU can move forward into its Multiverse Saga. With Loki potentially changing Marvel's time travel rules (again), hopefully future MCU movies and shows will make more sense, especially Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars. While that remains to be seen, we do know Loki was able to break a major time travel rule established in Avengers: Endgame—while poking fun of the Marvel movie in the process.\nLoki season 2 continues next Thursday, Oct. 12 at 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Is Jonathan Majors' Kang In Loki Season 2?", "date": "2023-10-06 01:56:26", "text": "Audiences might wonder if Jonathan Majors' Kang is in Loki season 2 after He Who Remains and Kang the Conqueror were introduced in the MCU.\nWARNING: This article contains SPOILERS for Loki season 2, episode 1\nAfter he was introduced in season 1 and set up to become the next main villain of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, audiences may be wondering if Jonathan Majors' Kang is in Loki season 2. Majors joined the MCU in the Loki season 1 finale as the Kang variant He Who Remains, a version of Nathaniel Richards who had defeated all others and kept them at bay by creating the sacred timeline. Although Sylvie ended up killing He Who Remains and setting the multiverse loose, Marvel had made it clear that it wouldn't be the last viewers saw of Kang.\nSince then, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania introduced another variant, Kang the Conqueror, who was the main villain to Scott Lang and his family. Though that particular iteration of Kang was defeated by Ant-Man, the Quantumania post-credits scenes established there were innumerable other Kangs from across the multiverse. The second of the scenes also revealed a new version of Majors' Kang would be in Loki season 2, but now that the first episode has aired and he was nowhere to be seen, there might be some confusion over whether the villain will appear.\nAs seen in the Loki season 2 trailer, Majors will reprise his role as Kang variant Victor Timely in the show after appearing in the Quantumania credits scene. Little is known about the MCU's version of Victor Timely, since all that's been revealed is that he's an inventor/scientist of some kind working with time theory. In the Marvel Comics, Victor Timely is a persona adopted by Nathaniel Richards after he time travels from the future to the past.\nA month following the release of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Majors was arrested March 25 in New York City on charges of strangulation, assault and harassment. Although a trial date has not been set as of publication, the allegations against the actor have sparked speculation about his future in the MCU. Marvel Studios hasn't commented on the situation, but Loki executive producer Kevin Wright told Variety that Majors' arrest didn't affect season 2 because filming had wrapped in 2022.\nWright went on to explain there weren't any discussions about changing Majors' role in Loki season 2, saying, \"No. And that mainly came from — I know as much as you do at the moment. It felt hasty to do anything without knowing how all of this plays out.\" Given Wright's comments, it seems Marvel is waiting to see the final verdict of Majors' trial before deciding on his MCU future. Since the season was done before Majors' arrest, the show wasn't affected and Majors is still expected to appear in Loki season 2.\nIt's not known exactly which episode or episodes Majors will appear in during Loki season 2, but now that the premiere has aired, it's confirmed he wasn't in it. It's unlikely Majors' Victor Timely will be saved for the season 2 finale since he appeared in the trailer. After all, He Who Remains was hidden from all the Loki season 1 marketing, and he didn't appear until the finale. Since Victor Timely is shown in the trailers, he'll presumably appear earlier in the season, but exactly which episode of Loki season 2 remains to be seen.\nLoki season 2 continues next Thursday, Oct. 12 at 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Loki Season 2 Episode 1 Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-06 02:16:08", "text": "Loki season 2 hits the ground running in episode 1 which culminates in a twist-filled ending to set the tone for the God of Mischief’s second outing.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Loki season 2, episode 1.\nLoki season 2 begins almost exactly where the first season left off, with episode 1's ending providing plenty of twists and turns for the beginning of the God of Mischief's second solo MCU outing. In Loki season 2, episode 1, the titular Asgardian is attempting to deal with his new reality: a TVA under the control of Kang the Conqueror. What's more, Loki's former ally - Owen Wilson's Mobius - does not remember him as the lovable rouge begins slipping through time be it the past, present, or future.\nAs such, much of Loki season 2, episode 1 centers on Loki's predicament. Loki discovers that the Mobius who does not remember him is a result of him time-slipping into the past which provides plenty of Loki season 2, episode 1 Easter eggs. The episode is chaotic, to say the least, as the present timeline features Loki, Mobius, and Ke Huy Quan's O.B. finding a way to stop Loki's time-slipping before it is too late as the rest of the TVA deals with the aftermath of He Who Remains' death. With such a confusing, time-travel-oriented plot, here is everything explained about Loki season 2, episode 1's ending.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Episode 1's Post-Credits Scene Is Way Deeper Than You Realize\nThe episode opens exactly where Loki season 1 left off with Loki having time-slipped into the past of the TVA. After escaping the pursuing TVA soldiers, Loki crashes through a building and encounters the past version of Casey who does not remember him. Loki then slips for the first time back into the present as he tries to reunite with Mobius to explain his issue. After slipping between the past and present a few more times in his pursuit of Mobius, Loki finds himself in the War Room of the TVA in the past.\nHere he finds recordings of He Who Remains and Ravonna Renslayer from the Multiversal War and sees the original designs of the former's face adorning the War Room walls. Loki subsequently slips back into the present to finally encounter the versions of Mobius and B-15 that remember him, finally reuniting the cast of characters for Loki season 2. Loki begins explaining the complex situation to everyone present before Mobius opts to take Loki to Ouroborus - or O.B. for short - in an attempt to fix the time-slipping.\nLoki's time-slipping becomes more frequent from this point, often used for humor with his destination not shown until O.B.'s first scene. During this scene, Loki talks to the O.B. of the past while Mobius converses with the O.B. of the present. Eventually, Loki returns to the present until the third act of Loki season 2, episode 1 adds another twist to the tale.\nThe final time slip of the episode sees Loki travel into the TVA's future. Here, everything is in chaos. Loki frantically searches for a Timestick to conduct his part of O.B.'s plan to stop the time-skipping but not before he encounters Sylvie in the future. Sylvie makes it seem as though she has been searching for Loki before an unknown assailant prunes the latter, returning him to the present with Mobius and O.B. before the episode ends.\nConcerning how Loki managed to stop time-slipping, the answer is somewhat convoluted. O.B.'s plan to stop Loki's time-slipping was to have Loki prune himself as a means of stripping all traces of himself from every timeline. To make the plan succeed though, Loki had to prune himself at the same moment as Mobius activated a device called a Temporal Aura Extractor. According to O.B.'s theorizing, these two events happening at the same time would allow Loki to be pulled back into the present to stop him slipping through time.\nBy the time of Loki season 2, episode 1's ending, this plan is thrown into action. Loki slips into the future of the TVA as he frantically searches for a Timestick to prune himself when the time comes. Mobius puts the Temporal Aura Extractor in place, connected to the Temporal Loom - the aspect of the TVA that converts raw time into physical timelines. Eventually, Loki is pruned in the future by an unknown person meaning the Temporal Aura Extractor can pull him into the present, stopping the time-slipping seemingly for good.\nOne of the burning mysteries of Loki season 2, episode 1 was who pruned Loki in the future. As Loki is captivated by Sylvie's sudden appearance, someone prunes him from behind before anything else can be explained leaving both the audience and Loki without answers. Similarly, Loki returns to the present meaning it was not revealed who pruned him. The likely answer is that it was Loki who pruned himself. Loki is now aware that, at some point, a version of himself will appear at that exact point in time needing to be pruned to stop the time-slipping meaning he takes it upon himself to provide this.\nAlongside the question of who pruned Loki in the future, this scene provides many other questions. One of those is what Sylvie is doing in the TVA. As of the ending of Loki season 2, episode 1, the answer to this is unclear. It is likely that these events will be shown from the perspective of Loki and Sylvie as the season goes on given they take place in the future, potentially even in the final episode as the season delves even deeper than its predecessor into complicated time-travel storytelling.\nAnother unanswered question as of Loki season 2, episode 1's ending is who is calling the TVA phone in the future. As Loki sees Sylvie just before being pruned, a phone can be heard ringing in the TVA. The phone receives a lot of attention from both Loki and the camera meaning whoever is on the other end will likely be vital to the series' overarching story yet the identity of this mysterious caller is left frustratingly unclear as of the ending of Loki season 2, episode 1.\nAn interesting element of Loki season 2, episode 1 is that it changes the established time-travel rules of the MCU. In Avengers: Endgame, Hulk stated that it was impossible for someone who had traveled back to the past to change the future. Hulk explained that anything that happens in the past simply causes a brand-new timeline. However, Loki season 2, episode 1 proved different. Loki was directly impacting the events of the present when he time-slipped into the past as evident in his conversation with O.B. This could be because of the different time rules of the TVA yet regardless, it proves the MCU's time-travel rules are changing with Loki season 2.\nOne of the new elements of the MCU multiverse in Loki season 2, episode 1 is the Temporal Loom. O.B. describes the Temporal Loom as the section of the TVA in which raw time is refined to create physical timelines. O.B. also states that the endless branching of the timeline caused by He Who Remains' death is causing the Temporal Loom to overload which is causing Loki's time-slipping and the power surges at the TVA.\nConcerning what this means for the MCU multiverse, the ramifications could be huge. O.B. mentions that he will attempt to retrofit the Temporal Loom to handle the endless expansion of branching timelines. This could mean that the events of Loki season 2 essentially create the multiverse as O.B. figures this out which allows countless timelines to exist together. Regarding how else the Temporal Loom will affect the MCU multiverse, Loki season 2's next five episodes will hopefully reveal more.\nFinally, regarding what General Dox has planned for Sylvie in Loki season 2, episode 1, she simply wants answers. The TVA is in chaos after the death of He Who Remains which causes higher-ups like General Dox to somewhat panic. As a result, Dox states that she needs to know exactly what happened at the End of Time. To do so, Dox begins sending every single available TVA agent after Sylvie to extract an explanation from her, something that will undoubtedly cause trouble going into Loki season 2's future episodes.\nNew episodes of Loki release every Tuesday on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Every Loki Season 2 Episode 1 MCU Easter Egg & Reference", "date": "2023-10-06 02:43:21", "text": "Loki season 2 continues the God of Mischief’s MCU time-travel journey with episode 1, an installment filled with wider MCU Easter eggs and references.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Loki season 2, episode 1.\nLoki season 2, episode 1 continues the titular God of Mischief's MCU journey, bringing plenty of references and connections to the wider franchise with it. More so than many other Marvel Disney+ shows, Loki is tied intrinsically to the status of the MCU. The events of Loki season 1 were instrumental in the foundation of the MCU multiverse that led to stories like Spider-Man: No Way Home and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness becoming possible.\nJust as Loki season 1 kickstarted the events of the Multiverse Saga, Loki season 2 will be integral to its progression. This means that Loki season 2 will be filled with wider references to other MCU properties as well as other fun Easter eggs pertaining to different elements of the character. As such, here is every Easter egg, reference, and fun nod found in Loki season 2, episode 1, \"Ouroborus.\"\nMidway through Loki season 2, episode 1, Loki is introduced to Ke Huy Quan's character named Ouroboros, seemingly explaining the Loki season 2, episode 1 title. However, it has a deeper meaning than simply referencing the lovable new TVA agent. In the real world, an Ouroboros is a circular symbol often depicting a snake or a dragon devouring its own tail to signify the endless cycle of destruction and rebirth. Given the events of Loki season 2, episode 1, this seems fitting while also propping up Quan's O.B. to have a major role in the upcoming season.\nA common Easter egg that has come to be expected by every new Marvel Studios project is the updated logo for the company. With Loki season 2, episode 1, the Marvel Studios logo is gold and green. This reflects the two primary colors of Loki's design throughout the MCU as both an Easter egg to the character's past and the prominent color scheme of the first season.\nIn the opening chase sequence of Loki season 2, episode 1, Kang's statue is shown towering above the TVA. While this could be seen as simply a reference to the overall villain of the Multiverse Saga, it holds a deeper meaning. The camera pans backward from the statue and back into the TVA building in which Loki is being chased almost as if the statue is watching the events unfold. This is an Easter egg to both He Who Remains and Kang's presence in Loki season 2, with both versions of the character having presided over timelines as they watched events take place.\nJust as Marvel Studios properties have delved into the multiverse, so too have Sony's Spider-Verse movies. In the latter franchise, characters are shown to \"glitch\" when they are in a universe different from their own. The visual representation of glitching is incredibly similar to Loki's time-slipping. While a slightly different phenomenon in context, the visual design of Loki's time-slipping was likely an intentional Easter egg to another prominent Marvel multiversal story.\nAs is known from Loki season 1 and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Jonathan Majors will be responsible for bringing Kang the Conqueror's many variants to life. In Loki season 2, episode 1, a neat Easter egg features Majors' first appearance in the season. When slipping into the past, Loki finds a recording of He Who Remains and Ravonna Renslayer from the time of the Multiversal War which provides context to the TVA's history while also providing a fun Easter egg to Majors' overarching MCU role.\nThe character of Loki in Marvel is based on Norse mythology as is the rest of Asgard. In Norse myth, it is said that a world tree known as Yggdrasil holds together the Nine Realms on its branches. In Loki season 2, the Temporal Loom provides a similar function. The Temporal Loom takes branches of the timeline and forms them into physical matter, essentially acting as the Yggdrasil of the MCU and providing an Easter egg to Loki's Norse origins.\nOne of the more memed aspects of Loki's character in the MCU is his endless amount of hair flips. In Loki season 2, episode 1, this continues in abundance. After every time slip, Loki dramatically flips his hair over his shoulder. Given the countless time-slips shown in Loki season 2, episode 1, Loki's extra, over-the-top dramatic tendencies continue.\nThe new end-credit sequence of Loki season 2 provides an Easter egg to the state of the overall story. In Loki season 1, it was revealed that He Who Remains essentially constructed the Sacred Timeline to lead Loki and Sylvie to the Citadel at the End of Time. In Loki season 2, episode 1's end credit sequence, someone is shown reconstructing the events of the episode with miniatures and models. This references the central themes of Loki's story which center on the idea of free will against predetermination that will undoubtedly continue in season 2.\nThe end-credit scene of Loki season 2, episode 1 sees Sylvie exiting the Citadel at the End of Time in Broxton, Oklahoma. At first, this may seem like an innocuous location, yet it has deeper comic-book connections. In Marvel Comics, Broxton is where Thor rebuilds Asgard after the events of Ragnarok. While the MCU depicted this differently with New Asgard being situated in Norway, Loki season 2, episode 1's end-credit sequence including Broxton is a neat Easter egg to Marvel Comics.\nNew episodes of Loki release every Tuesday on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "&quot;Looking Like Tarzan&quot;: Prey Cut A Wild Scene Where The Predator & Naru Meet Much Earlier", "date": "2023-10-06 02:59:20", "text": "Prey director Dan Trachtenberg cut an early scene where the Predator and Naru met earlier in the treetops due to budget and execution concerns.\nPrey director Dan Trachtenberg explains why a scene introducing Naru to the new Predator sooner was cut. The Predator franchise's return to feature movies saw Amber Midthunder's determined young hunter set out to prove herself when another hunter from across the stars began its own bloody game across the Great Plains in 1719. While Prey passed over a theatrical release and instead went straight to Hulu, it earned widespread acclaim from critics and has been seen as a return to form for the franchise.\nWith Prey now receiving a home release, Trachtenberg sat down with /Film and opened up about the movie's production, shedding some light on moments that didn't make it into the final cut. The director revealed that initially, Naru would encounter the Predator in the trees early on. For various reasons, which he explained, this was cut. Check out Trachtenberg's complete explanation below:\nI don't. This was a little bit of a filmmaking director trick of the trade. On the one hand, it was a sequence as we were devising it — Naru was in the tree in the beginning, so in my mind, it was to set up the sequence at the end, that the physical capabilities were there and the visual language was sort of already in the movie. I love the idea of seeing her running through the tree, and the Predator up there, because he's up in the tree so often in these films. Putting her up there, too, it could have been really fun. But I was also incredibly nervous that it ended up looking like Tarzan. The execution had to be perfect for it to be great. Then, it was also becoming very costly to do, and [it was] time-consuming, which, sometimes, is the same thing.\nIt was in the parking lot next to our stage, starting to map out where the trees were going to go, and having a talk with my producers about the cost and the implications and what's our schedule and other things that we needed also. So rather than fight to make it work, when other things were getting squeezed, I sort of waited until the things that were also critical were getting impacted. I said, \"You know what? What if we lost the thing? What if I took out that whole sequence? Then we could do this other ... Surely, you can't tell me that we can't.\"\nBut in the back of my mind, it was like, Okay, Dan. You're nervous about it already. Listen to your gut. It might not be great. The thing that I was the saddest to lose was, I thought, a clever use of the cut clamp, one of the Predator's weapons that Naru has in the sequence. So now, I'm glad that people can kind of see what it was. Previz is a tool that we use all the time in movies and TV sometimes, and movie fans and potential future filmmakers never get to see that stuff, so it's cool that they have it now.\nWhile Trachtenberg's initial idea for Naru and the Predator's first meeting was scrapped, the idea of it leaves the question of how Prey's narrative would be impacted by the sequence. It could be argued that seeing Naru's keen hunting skills could've impacted her journey, as her growth from a young hunter to the slayer of an advanced alien rival helped endear her to the audience, solidifying her as a captivating protagonist. While it likely wouldn't dampen her growth too much, it would make her actions in during the ending of Prey less of a surprise, as her skills would've already been shown.\nRelated: What Would Happen If Naru Met Other Predator Heroes?\nFurthermore, Naru's first true encounter with the Predator in Prey's final cut would surely be diminished if the pair met earlier. Naru's first glimpse at the Predator is both a surprise for her and the audience, as the alien makes his presence known when he slays a grizzly bear that she has been battling alone. Not only is the Predator's bloody intervention a shock, but it being able to annihilate large threats like bears with ease instantly makes Naru see how dangerous her foe truly is, raising the stakes further than before.\nWhile Prey's alternate first encounter established Naru's skill set and parallels with her Predator rival, the final execution proves that a longer wait may have been worth it. Alongside making her growth more captivating to watch and allowing further surprises, the greater build-up allowed for more anticipation around the Predator's on-screen debut. However, Trachtenberg still ensured a pre-visualized concept of this scene exists to give viewers a glimpse at an alternate take on the movie.\nSource: /Film\n"}
