{"title": "Six tips for getting a job if you're over 50", "date": "2023-03-16 11:05:55", "text": "Britain needs you. \nThat was the message from Chancellor Jeremy Hunt on Wednesday's Budget when he unveiled plans to lure over 50s who have retired early to return to the workforce to help revive the economy.\nSo called \"returnerships\" and skills boot camps were mentioned alongside abolishing the lifetime tax-free limit for pensions savings.\nMr Hunt promised that for anyone looking to get back to work, the government would make it worth their while. \nWe await details of the measures, but in the meantime the BBC asked recruiters and charities for tips for anyone seeking to return to work. \nUnfortunately ageism is still a problem, says James Reed, chief executive of recruitment firm Reed. \n\"Despite legislation to prevent age discrimination, older jobseekers can still face bias,\" he admits. \nHe suggests shifting the focus away from your age and onto your ability wherever you can. \nWhile you shouldn't lie about your age, there's no need to highlight it either,\" he says. \n\"Consider streamlining your CV and taking out older experience that dates back more than 10 years, or omit dates in the section listing your education.\" \nEmployers are allowed to ask for your date of birth, to see whether they are attracting a wide range of candidates, for example. But they should keep this separate from the application, says the charity Age UK. \nIf health is the reason you left your last job, it can be tricky. But you don't have to mention it at interview, unless it could affect your work in the future. \nPetra Tagg, director at Manpower, says it's up to you to decide how much information you share.\n\"There's no need to disclose a history of illness if it won't affect your ability to perform your duties,\" she says.\nHowever, she says be truthful about health concerns that may affect your ability to perform a job or if you may need time off.  \nLaura Reilly, director at Taurus HR, advises keeping the reasons for leaving previous employment relatively light and positive. \n\"Once an offer has been received, any disclosures can be made - including if reasonable adjustments need to be made for you,\" she says. \nYvonne Smyth from recruitment firm Hays says that if you are asked to complete a workplace adjustment assessment or form, that is the time to disclose any health information you feel may have an impact on your work. But that is usually a little further along in the interview process. \nOlder workers can often face prejudicial questions around digital literacy and skills, James Reed says. \nFor that reason he says it's worthwhile polishing skills in areas valued by employers.   \nHe says things like using news alerts to keep up with developments in any given field can help you stand out from the crowd during the interview process.  \nTaking voluntary opportunities can also boost your skills as you effectively get on-the-job training in whatever technology is used, says Stuart Lewis, chief executive of Rest Less, a website that provides resources for jobs and volunteering for the over-50s.\nHe also advises making it clear in your application that you're interested in new challenges and learning new skills. \nSome older people find they don't have the energy for full-time work, or have caring responsibilities or simply prefer to work part-time.  \nBut you shouldn't be afraid to ask for flexible work. In fact, employers may expect it. \nBusinesses are increasingly realising that offering flexible working helps retain older workers, according to Tracy Riddell, of the Centre for Ageing Better. \nThe Acas website has further guidance on flexible working requests here. \nJames Reed says older jobseekers shouldn't rule out gaining new professional qualifications. It can demonstrate to prospective employers your ability to adapt and learn new skills, or even be the start of a whole new career. \nApprenticeships, for instance, are not just for the young. Older workers and career-switchers can do them too. \nAnd think about your \"transferable skills\", says Clare McCartney from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.   \nIf you are a good communicator or have lots of leadership experience, for example, you could consider applying for jobs in different industries, she says. \nThe UK government has further advice on support for older workers here. \nPetra Tagg from Manpower says older workers should try to avoid falling into the trap of undervaluing themselves.   \nShe says that often the advantage for older workers is the breadth of experience they bring. \n\"In circumstances where other, younger candidates may seem to have more to offer, reminding yourself of what makes you stand out from the crowd is a quick and effective way to build awareness and confidence in yourself and your own worth,\" she says.  \nShe says people can use a job description \"to pull out all the things you can do, and give real examples, rather than focusing on those you don't have experience in\".\nI made my business digital so I can work beyond 60\nOver-50s: We are not seen as useful at work\nWho are the millions of Britons not working?\nFive tips when asking for a pay rise\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Renting: Three ways to win the race to securing a property", "date": "2023-03-28 23:14:18", "text": "Trying to find a place to rent in today's market and beating your competitors to the front door can feel like a relentless race that you'll never win. \nProperty website Zoopla says the number of available properties to rent is down by a third since before the pandemic.\nSo with such ferocious demand, what can you do to secure your new home? \nMost people know the importance of having a decent credit rating and their deposit secured. \nBut how do you avoid the bidding wars and massive queues on \"open home\" day and get a landlord to pick you and not someone else? \nIf you're new to the rental race, we've asked agents and landlords to tell us impressed them most and made those hunting for a rental stand out from the crowd.  \nRightmove said at the beginning of 2023, 70% of rental listings received an email enquiry from a potential tenant looking to view a property within the first day of it being listed on the website. \nIts property expert Tim Bannister said: \"Tenants need to do their homework and decide what they really want from a home so they can be targeted - online, with agents, friends and family. \n\"Then when instant alerts come through they can move quickly and get to the front of the queue. Be focussed and be prepared. Being first won't necessarily guarantee you the property but it will help.\"\nCampaign group Generation Rent agreed. Spokesman Dan Wilson Craw said it was essential to know what the property needs to have, such as storage for a bike or a washing machine already installed. \n\"That way if you view a property that ticks all the right boxes you can apply for a tenancy on the spot,\" he said.  \nBeing loaded with information really helps landlords and agents when looking to choose a tenant. \nRightmove's Tim Bannister said: \"That means making sure you've got as much information as possible, for example multiple references with contacts available. \n\"Be clear about your circumstances and how flexible you can be with your timelines. Be upfront and provide clarity. The more you can do to work with a landlord, the better.\"\nGeneration Rent said aside from having the holding deposit worth one week's rent in your account, prospective tenants needed to provide evidence of their income.\nThat includes letting your employer and current landlord know they'll need to provide a reference. \nIf you have exhausted your time trying to find a rental in your perfect area try thinking outside the box. Zoopla said a travel time search can bring more properties into your orbit which you might not have considered. \nGeographically, a home may look too far away but its travel time might be quicker than you thought. This can can open up your search to cheaper areas or slower rental markets. \nMr Bannister said rental searches on Rightmove had expanded since the pandemic with many approaching reaching 50 sq km (19.3 sq miles).\nVictoria Tolmie-Loverseed helps students find accommodation with Unipol, a charity based in Bradford, Leeds and Nottingham. \nA rising student population not matched by an increased supply of housing has resulted in a crisis for young people often living away from home for the first time.\n\"Be flexible about where you're willing to live, cast your net wider into non-student areas and be willing to travel a little bit further,\" Ms Tolmie-Loverseed said. \n\"Know your budget, have your deposit sorted, know who your guarantor will be,\" she added.  \nRenters struggle as homes to let plunge by a third\nWhat are your rights when you're renting?\nThe care leavers struggling to find somewhere to live\nWhat you can do about a rent increase\nBBC Sounds - Rental Health - Available Episodes\nFinding a home to rent - Citizens Advice\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "First time home buyers: How much can I borrow?", "date": "2023-05-12 09:47:46", "text": "With rents rising, lots of people are crunching the numbers to see if they can afford to buy their own home.\nBut it is a big financial commitment, with risks if house prices fall or if you need to relocate. \nSo what do you need to know to help you decide?\nMost people spend less each month on their mortgage payments than they would on rent for a similar property, according to the Halifax. \nHalifax's most recent Owning vs Renting review found on average the monthly mortgage costs for a three-bed home were £42 lower than renting the equivalent.\nBut the difference varies widely across the UK.\nHomeowners in Scotland make big savings compared to renters. While in the east of England it is cheaper to rent than to own.\nFirst-time buyers can apply for the same mortgage deals as any other borrower. But banks and building societies will look very closely at a first-time buyer's financial situation and credit record. \nAfter a year of steadily rising interest rates, mortgage rates have also gone up, to between 4% and 7%.\nMortgage brokers like Riz Malik at R3Mortgages say that it can be hard for first-time buyers to borrow large amounts, as lenders are getting tougher over affordability criteria. \nTypically, a bank might lend you four or five times your salary.\nIt also depends on what outgoings you have. If you already owe money, such as a car loan, or have student debt, that will be taken into account.\nA lot of money advice websites have calculators to help you work out what you can afford and mortgage brokers can help you identify deals to suit your situation.\nThe average house price for a first-time buyer is just over £300,000.\nSaving a large enough deposit is the biggest hurdle for many would-be homeowners, one of the reasons the average age of a first-time buyer has risen to 32.\nUsually you need a deposit worth at least 10% of the property's value. But the bigger your deposit, the better deal you will get from the lender.\nThe average deposit for first-time buyers is £62,470 according to Halifax, almost double the UK's average annual salary, with people typically putting down around 20% of the purchase price of their property.\nSome lenders will accept a deposit of 5% of the property's value. Skipton Building Society is even offering a no-deposit mortgage. It is the first mortgage to cover 100% of the value of the property since the financial crisis and uses your history as a rent-payer to establish credit-worthiness.\nIf you are saving for a deposit and you are between 18 and 40, the government will match 25% of any money you save in a Lifetime ISA.\nMore than 60% of first-time buyers are opting for joint-ownership and that's not just couples. Increasingly friends are choosing to buy together too, says Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons Estate Agency.\nAny joint arrangement should be drawn up with a proper legal contract, as all parties will be liable for the full mortgage, says Ms Beveridge.\nA first-time buyer is someone who has never owned or part-owned a property before. That offers a tax advantage as long as you are buying a property to live in.\nIn England and Northern Ireland first-time buyers don't pay stamp duty - a tax based on the value of the property you're buying - on properties worth less than £425,000.\nScotland's equivalent, the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax, is waived for first-time buyers of properties worth less than £175,000.\nThere is no first-time buyer relief for the Wales' Land Transaction Tax.\nThe biggest government scheme to support home-buyers, Help to Buy, has ended (except in Wales), although recently there have been reports the government is considering a reboot.\nThere are others including the First Homes scheme, aimed at helping first-time buyers and keyworkers with a household income under £80,000 (or £90,000 in London) to buy new-build properties.\nShared ownership schemes allow you to buy a share of the property and pay rent for the rest, with the option of increasing your stake when you can afford to.\nNeither of these schemes are on the scale of Help to Buy, says David Hollingworth at L&C Mortgages. Help to Buy helped ramp up house prices, he adds, making them less affordable for first-time buyers today.\nDeposit-free mortgage aimed at renters launched\nWhat are the new stamp duty rates?\nWhat no change in rates means for your money\nWhat is happening to house prices?\nWhat are your rights when you're renting?\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Fuel cost: How to save petrol and diesel", "date": "2023-07-03 13:01:34", "text": "Making fewer journeys is the most obvious way to save money, but how else can you use less fuel?\nHere are five popular tips from drivers - and whether or not they really work.\nMany motorists consider driving at exactly 56mph to be optimum for fuel efficiency.\nHowever, there is no ideal fixed driving speed, according to the RAC motoring group.\nThe 56mph myth, it says, came out of old fuel consumption tests - comparing driving in a built-up area to driving at 56mph and at 75mph.\nThe most efficient of the three was 56mph, which led people to think this was always the best speed. \nHowever, depending on the type of car and its size, the RAC says 45-50mph is most efficient.\nIf you've ever resisted the urge to reach for the air conditioning on a hot summer's day to save fuel, you were right to do so.\nExtra energy is needed to power a car's air conditioning system and turning it on can increase your fuel consumption by up to 10% according to the AA.\nThe impact might be more noticeable on shorter trips - that's because the air conditioner has to use more power initially to bring down the inside temperature of your car.\nOpening your windows might be better, but this creates a separate problem called \"drag\". This is where your engine has to work harder to compensate for the air resistance created by the open windows.\nIf you're forced to choose between two, the best option will depend on your speed. The air conditioner is probably the better above 50mph because the faster you drive the greater the drag caused by open windows. \nCoasting is when you drive with the car in neutral, or with the clutch pedal held down.\nThe AA recommends against coasting. Not only could it be unsafe (because you can't accelerate out of a tricky situation), the group also says it's unlikely to save you any petrol. \nIt says most cars have electric controls which cut the supply of fuel each time you take your foot off the accelerator - so there's nothing to be gained by coasting.\nCruise control - a device which keeps your car at a constant speed without having to use the accelerator pedal - is often seen as a sure-fire way to save fuel, as it avoids unnecessary acceleration and harsh braking. \nHowever, this may only be true when it comes to motorway driving - due to the constant flat surface. \nOn other road types you are more likely to come across hills and your cruise control will take time to adjust to the change in gradient, using up more fuel in the process.\nNormally you take your foot off the accelerator as you begin to descend down a hill, but as your cruise control can't see what's in front it spends extra time using power - leading to worse fuel consumption.\nUnderinflated tyres will use up extra petrol. The advice is to check your pressures regularly, especially before heading off on a long journey. \nThe correct pressure will be listed in your car's manual, but you may need to increase it to the recommended maximum if you're carrying several passengers and heavy luggage.\nHowever, any extra weight will still use up additional fuel - so leave out anything you don't need.\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

Watch the BBC's Lora Jones tell you, in a minute.\nIn England a holding deposit is paid to a landlord to reserve a property.\nIt can't be more than one week's rent.\nYou should get the money back within seven days of signing your tenancy agreement - or it can go towards your rent.\nBut if you decide not to move in, you could lose it. \nIf the landlord doesn't give it back, and you think they should, write to them.\nIf you still don't get a refund, contact one of the letting agent redress schemes.\nYou can also complain in England to Trading Standards through the Citizen's Advice consumer helpline.\nSuch deposits are not legal in Scotland, and rules are different in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nLandlords need to follow strict rules if they want a tenant to leave - if not, the eviction could be illegal, or the landlord could be guilty of harassment.\nIn England the landlord has to give written notice to the tenant, which could be: \nOther tenancy contracts have different rules.\nOnce the notice period ends, the landlord can start eviction proceedings through court.\nLandlords can apply for a so-called \"possession order\". If that is granted and you don't leave, landlords can apply for a \"warrant for possession\".\nEviction rules differ in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nTenants in England have the right to \"live in a property that's safe and in a good state of repair\". Similar rules are in place in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\nLandlords are not expected to do small jobs like changing light bulbs.\nHowever, a rented home could be unfit if, for example, the electrics are unsafe, it's damp, or there's a problem with rats or mice.\nIf so, you can complain to your landlord, or - if that doesn't work - your local council.\nYour landlord may try to evict you rather than make repairs, but you might have more protection if you've already complained to the council. \nTenants need to pay rent on time, cover the bills they are responsible for, and look after the property. This includes disposing of rubbish, and keeping the property reasonably clean.\nThere are no laws explicitly stopping this, but MPs are considering more protections for renters in England.\nUnder a new law tabled in Parliament, tenants will be given a legal right to request to keep a \"well-behaved\" pet, which the landlord can only refuse on reasonable grounds - such as the size of the property.\nHowever, landlords will be able to charge a higher rent to cover the risk of pet damage.\nThe law is also set to make it illegal for a landlord to refuse tenancies to families with children, or those on benefits.\nAt present it could be discrimination under equality law in England if a landlord refuses to rent a property to a woman because she has children.\nHowever, BBC News foundalmost a quarter of some 8,000 adverts examined on the property website OpenRent indicated that families were not eligible.\nMore than 300 listings on another property portal, Zoopla, explicitly said children were not wanted, although this was less than 1% of those we looked at.\nSome 73% of sampled OpenRent listings said tenants with pets were not welcome, compared with 6% on Zoopla. \nShelter warned the problem would be even more widespread as sometimes prospective tenants were only told they were not welcome when they applied. \nLandlords can choose to include bills such as council tax, but don't have to.\nIf a landlord includes utility bills, they cannot charge a tenant more than the amount they pay. \nExhausting, costly, miserable: My search to rent a one-bed flat\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Food prices: How can I save money on my grocery shop?", "date": "2023-07-31 10:57:17", "text": "As price rises bite into budgets, many people are cutting back on the weekly food shop.\nAs well as buying less, people are looking for ways to make their money go further and to make the most of what they have. The BBC spoke to money bloggers for their tried and tested tips.\nRosie suggests taking a good look at your cupboards before each shopping trip. \"We all know the value of making a list, but if you're adding to what you've already got in your cupboards, then you're going to spend money on things you don't need,\" she says. \n\"There's no point in buying more jars of pasta sauce if you've already got five of them in the cupboard.\" \nShe keeps a list of what's in her cupboards in a notebook, so she always knows what she already has when she goes shopping. She says it has helped bring her weekly food shop for her, her husband and one-year-old son down to around £40.\nLynn recommends changing how you shop when you walk into a store and to head straight for the reduced section. \"If you spot something there that's on your list, you can tick that off and you've already saved some money,\" she says.\nShe suggests then going straight to the frozen-foods section, and then the canned-produce aisle.\n\"Frozen meat, fish and vegetables will almost always be cheaper than the fresh option,\" she says. \"If you get what you need from there before going on to the fresh produce aisles, you're likely to make significant savings.\"\nAccording to sustainability charity Wrap, the average household wastes around £700 every year by throwing food away. Lynn says making better use of her freezer has helped her cut down dramatically on waste.\n\"If things are getting close to their use-by date you should always try to freeze them,\" she says. \"Things like milk and cheese, even fruit and vegetables, can all be frozen and kept for when you need them.\"\nMore on the basics of freezing can be found on the Food Standards Agency website.\nKate Hall, who runs The Full Freezer website, uses her freezer as a pause button rather than a long-term storage solution. She says that while almost all foods can be frozen, you do have to change the way you use them.\n\"You can't defrost a banana or salad and expect it to be the same as when it went into the freezer,\" she explains. \"But if you think about how you could use it in puddings or in soups or in casseroles, then you're going to save a lot of money.\"\nRosie says that a lot of what we buy in the supermarket is packaged for their convenience and not ours. \"How often have you bought a tray of mushrooms covered in cling film only to have them go off in their packaging? They're wrapped up like that to make them easier to transport,\" she explains. \nShe puts hers in a paper bag when she gets them home but says just taking off the plastic wrapping will help them last longer.\nHelen White, from Wrap, which runs the Love Food Hate Waste campaign, says there are small things we can do to make food last longer, especially fresh vegetables and salads - the UK's most wasted food group. \n\"Just putting a piece of kitchen roll into an open bag of salad to absorb moisture is going to help it last longer,\" she says. \nKeeping fruit in the fridge will help it last longer, but she suggests checking that the temperature is set to below 5°C. \"We think millions of UK fridges are at least two degrees too warm,\" she says. \"This is bad news for milk and other food items kept in the fridge, which can go off [more quickly] when not stored at the right temperature.\"\nRosie tries to use local, smaller retailers a lot to tap into their years of experience. \n\"Butchers are a great resource and someone we shouldn't be afraid to talk to about saving money,\" she says. \"If you go into your local butcher and tell them you've only got £8 for your meat for the week, they'll be able to tell you how to stretch your money by buying the cheapest cuts.\n\"They're the best people to advise on how to cook them and how to make them go further.\"\nWe asked you for your tips, here are some you sent in: \nMy wife and I sit with our iPads on both Asda and Tesco and put in the exact same things for our weekly delivery.

We feel that writing a list of things you need then getting them online saves going to the shop where we would invariably end up throwing things in that we don't need. Russell, Portstewart, Northern Ireland\nI highly recommend having a weekly menu, so you know what you are going to cook/prepare for your meals each week. I post this on our fridge and our family of five always knows what to expect. This not only saves money but eliminates the stress of \"what's for dinner\"? I know exactly what I need to get, and I stick to my budget because I go to the supermarket with a plan, plus I check the fridge/pantry before I go shopping. Michelle Lutchman, Surrey\nTip is not about food but about cleaning products. There is much money to be saved on laundry and cleaning products. These are full of gimmicks to make us buy additional stuff. For instance, you don't need separate washing powder for coloureds. Fading is largely due to exposure to daylight rather than brighteners in washing powder. Helen Borodzicz, Lytham, St Annes\n I go to the supermarket at about 2.30 pm when they are reducing sandwiches - that's my tea sorted!

{"title": "What is happening to house prices, and could there be a crash?", "date": "2023-08-01 12:47:44", "text": "House prices have been falling in recent months.\nThat's because higher interest rates have made mortgages more expensive, while rising prices have hit people's spending power.\nPrices rose steeply - by about 25% - across most of the UK from the start of 2020 until Autumn 2022. \nBut they have fallen by nearly 5% from their peak, according to July's figures from the Nationwide Building Society. \nThe largest falls are in the South West and the smallest in Northern Ireland, Nationwide's figures show. \nYour device may not support this visualisation\nThese recent changes build on very different patterns of house price growth over the last 15 years. \nNorthern Ireland's prices have not returned to levels seen before the 2008 global financial crisis.\nIn contrast, London and the South East saw prices recover quickly up until 2015. They then saw less growth during the pandemic, when many people relocated to cheaper areas in search of more space. \nYour device may not support this visualisation\nHigher interest rates mean new mortgages are more expensive.\nAsking prices have not fallen far enough to balance this out. So, first-time buyers are unlikely to find buying a house more affordable in the short term. \nIn the longer run, if wages increase faster than house prices recover, housing will become more affordable. \nThose longer term trends also depend on whether housebuilding keeps up with demand. \nAffordability is worst in the South of England where a first-time buyer could expect to spend more than half of their income on their mortgage payments. But in areas like the Midlands, it's more like a third.\nIn March, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which advises the government on the health of the economy, predicted that house prices will drop by 10% over the next two years.\nThat would be about half the fall of the financial crisis of 2008 and would put prices back to autumn 2021 levels.\nBut predictions are very uncertain. \nSome observers hope for a \"soft landing\". That could mean interest rates nearing their peak now, small price falls in the rest of 2023 and then little, if any, growth next year.\nAn alternative view is that further sharp rises in interest rates could trigger even steeper falls in house prices in Autumn. \nAbout 100,000 households come off a fixed-price mortgage each month. Even if rates stabilise, they will still be hit with interest rates that are higher than their last mortgage.\nSome may find their new monthly payments unaffordable, making them more likely to sell, possibly pushing prices down. \nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.\nAt this rate, your payments could change by…\n                            monthly change\nto\n                            monthly total\nThe information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.\nThis calculator does not constitute financial advice. It is based on a standard mortgage repayment formula based on the mortgage size and length and a fixed interest rate. It should be used as a guide only and does not represent the suitability, eligibility or availability of mortgage offers for users. For exact figures, users will need to approach an official mortgage lender.\nInterest rates fluctuate based on the Bank of England's base rate and market conditions.\nThere are more people with potentially \"financially stretching\" mortgages in London and the South East than in the rest of the country, the Financial Conduct Authority says.\nThis is because loans in the south tend to be very high compared with borrowers' incomes. The loans can become difficult to repay when mortgage rates rise, or inflation bites. \nHowever, lending rules were tightened after the 2008 crash. Most borrowers in recent years have had their ability to pay checked against higher interest rates than those we're currently seeing. \nFortunately, the number of people behind on their mortgages did not rise significantly in 2022 and was still at half the 2008 level.  \nThe number of repossessions in 2022 was also less than a tenth of what was seen in the years after the crash.  \nThis video can not be played\nWorried about rising mortgage payments? The BBC's Lora Jones tells you what you can do, in a minute\nThe amount people can spend of their mortgage also depends on wider cost-of-living pressures: on energy bills, wages and job security.\nAnd these factors can all change significantly. \nThe future of house prices depends on the economy as a whole, and that picture is also uncertain. \nData visualisation by Rob England and Jana Tauschinski.

The BBC's Lora Jones tells you what you can do, in a minute\nIf you have an interest-only mortgage it means you are only paying the interest on the amount borrowed, and you are not paying down the size of the debt. \nMoving to an interest-only mortgage can keep your monthly payments affordable, says Richard Dana, chief executive of digital mortgage broker Tembo.\n\"However, it's best to use this as a short-term solution, otherwise you will have to pay your remaining mortgage balance at the end of your mortgage term,\" he adds. \nYour income and the amount of equity you hold in the property will determine your eligibility. \nThis is possibly not a realistic option for a growing family, or for the owners of a small flat.\nBut for older mortgage customers whose children have flown the nest, selling up and buying a smaller property could reduce the mortgage size - or potentially pay it off entirely.\n\"Consumers looking to re-mortgage may find it difficult to afford higher interest rates, so seeking independent advice is essential to consider every option available to them, such as downsizing,\" says Rachel Springall from financial data firm Moneyfacts.\nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.\nAt this rate, your payments could change by…\n                            monthly change\nto\n                            monthly total\nThe information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.\nThis calculator does not constitute financial advice.

{"title": "Mortgages: What happens if I am struggling to pay?", "date": "2023-08-10 12:44:55", "text": "The average interest rate charged by mortgage lenders recently hit a 15-year high.\nSo what can those struggling to make repayments do - and what support should they get from their provider? \nThere are different types of mortgages, all of which have become more expensive in recent months.\nMortgage rates have risen, and the 1.6 million people on tracker or variable deals are paying much more than a year ago. \nNearly 2.5 million homeowners have fixed deals that will expire by the end of 2024, and face a significant increase in monthly payments. \nIt is hard to say. The sector has seen considerable upheaval in the past year, after many years of ultra-low rates.\nThe typical interest charged on fixed rates for new borrowers shot up after last autumn's mini-budget, then calmed somewhat, but subsequently rose to a 15-year high. \nThere have been some signs of reductions recently, but rates are still comparatively high.\nThat's because wages and prices are rising faster and for longer than expected, and meaning the Bank of England may raise the base rate higher.\nThe Bank has warned that more than two million households will pay between £200 and £499 more a month on new deals from the end of this year and the end of 2026. \nA further one million mortgage holders will see their monthly payments rise by at least £500 over the next two and a half years.\nIf the base rate does rise again, anyone on tracker deals will also face higher repayments.\nHouse prices have also started to fall as higher interest rates put off buyers.\nThe government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggests that UK house prices will fall by 10% by 2024 compared with last year's peak.\nThere are still likely to be plenty of options, depending on your circumstances. The bigger question is whether people can afford higher repayments.\nAn agreement between lenders, the Treasury and regulators means people can switch to a new fixed-rate mortgage without a new affordability test when their current deal ends, as long as their payments are up-to-date.\nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.\nAt this rate, your payments could change by…\n                            monthly change\nto\n                            monthly total\nThe information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.\nThis calculator does not constitute financial advice. It is based on a standard mortgage repayment formula based on the mortgage size and length and a fixed interest rate. It should be used as a guide only and does not represent the suitability, eligibility or availability of mortgage offers for users. For exact figures, users will need to approach an official mortgage lender.\nInterest rates fluctuate based on the Bank of England's base rate and market conditions.\nIf you have savings, you could consider paying down some of the total amount borrowed. \nSavings could also be put into a linked offset savings account, where you only pay interest on the mortgage balance, minus the amount you've saved.\nYou may want to extend the length of the mortgage term, although that would mean paying more in total. \nA broker can guide you through the different options.\nOwing two or more months' repayments means you are officially in arrears.\nBut the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates mortgage firms, says lenders must treat customers fairly.\nIt says borrowers must contact their lender as soon as they realise they will struggle to make repayments - the earlier the better. Trained and experienced staff must offer help.\nThis video can not be played\nWorried about rising mortgage payments? The BBC's Lora Jones tells you what you can do, in a minute\nWithin 15 working days of falling into arrears, your lender must:\nYour lender must consider any reasonable request to resolve the arrears. This could include reducing your monthly payment by extending the term of the mortgage, or switching to an interest-only payment for a certain period. \nMissing monthly payments - or arranging to pay less than you owe - will be reflected on your credit file, which could affect your ability to borrow money in the future. \nA mortgage payment holiday lets borrowers delay repayments for a short time.\nLenders may offer this option, depending on individual circumstances, although probably not to those already in arrears. \nThe level of support offered to customers during the Covid pandemic has been reduced.\nAgain, a payment holiday will show on your credit file. \nSome people may decide to sell their home and - in extreme circumstances - the lender could take court action to repossess it.\nRepossessions are far rarer than they used to be. \nThere are several stages before a lender can do this, and the whole process takes about two years.\nBut if you think your home is at risk, it is well worth getting free, independent debt advice about your options. \nGovernments tend not to get directly involved in support when people face higher mortgage repayments, but many lenders have signed up to the government's mortgage charter which ensures they are clear about the options available.\nFor people on qualifying benefits, Support for Mortgage Interest is available across the UK. The government pays some of your mortgage interest payments, but in the form of a loan (which must be repaid, with interest). \nBorrowers tend to pay off the loan when they sell the property, or when they die.\nThere are various conditions and requirements that need to be considered before signing up.\nGovernments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also run some mortgage support schemes, but the rules are complicated, and they tend to focus on people at risk of homelessness. \nThere is more information on the government-backed Moneyhelper website.\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "How to get a job: Six expert tips for finding work", "date": "2023-08-14 16:03:58", "text": "If you're on the hunt for a job and not sure where to start, or how to pitch yourself you're not alone.\nThe rising cost of living has meant thousands of businesses have been laying off staff, with many people finding themselves out of work. \nUnemployment is close to its lowest rate since the 1970s. But there are about 8.65 million people out of work. \nIt may feel daunting to try and find a job at first so we spoke to some career experts to give you some tips.\nThere have been a lot of shifts in the workplace in recent years. Hybrid and flexible working means your job search can stretch a bit further, quite literally. \nYvonne Smyth, group head of diversity and inclusion at Hays Recruitment says \"Proximity isn't as important as used to be, so if you're looking for a job, search far and wide in terms of geography. \n\"Also if you want to work part-time or say four days a week, don't let full-time positions put you off applying,\" she says.\n\"Businesses are more flexible than you might think and if you're the right candidate that can get the job done in fewer days it makes sense for them to adapt the role.\"\nMs Smyth also says it's important to use key words when you're searching online.\n\"For example if there's a key skill or industry like sales or retail that you're interested in, you want the algorithms on search platforms to pick up on them. \n\"So daily searches on these words are important, so it identifies what you're interested in. \n\"Engagement as well is key and that means clicking on jobs with the job titles or a company that you're keen on so the platform yields more of the same.\"\nNot all jobs are made public. It's always worth sending an email or having a chat with a manager at a business that you like the look of, as you never know when an opening might be coming up. \nMany businesses want to avoid the cost of advertising a job formally and may rely on word of mouth. \nMiranda Kyte, a career trends expert at Glassdoor says: \"Another route is to utilise your network, let friends, ex-colleagues, family know that you're looking for a new position.\n\"They may be able to check internal job boards for open roles at their own companies and refer you or they could know someone else who can help.\"\nLots of places still ask for a CV and a covering letter when you're applying for a job. \nBut now you can advertise yourself rather visibly via social media sites like Linkedin which showcase your skills and experience. \nOther platforms like Twitter and Instagram can prove useful when touting yourself out to potential employers as well. \nYvonne Smyth from Hays says it's important to focus on skills.\n\"Lots of people look at the years required on a job description but actually it's more important that a candidate has the right skills. Try to look for parallels and make that obvious in your application.\" \nIt can be a little disheartening if the jobs you want require specific very specific qualifications. It may be worth having a look at if there are any ways of picking up the experience or training that you need to land a job while you're on the hunt. \nMiranda Kyte from Glassdoor says: \"Lots of courses these days are free and you can do them online. Volunteering is also a great way of filling gaps on your CV or asking to do some work shadowing in companies you'd like to work for.\"\nIt's easy to get disheartened if you are knocked back after interviews time and time again, or you don't feel like you're getting through the door in the first place. \nOur career experts say it's good to review how you're going about your search from time to time and try different approaches. \nCareer influencer, Mehar Sindhu Batra, says it's quite useful to set personal targets, like a tracker of the number of jobs to apply for in a week or a certain number of cold emails. \nShe's a big believer in acknowledging the little wins along the way to keep your spirits up. \n\"Maybe you landed an interview, received positive feedback on your resume or cover letter, or connected with a helpful contact. Celebrating these wins can boost your confidence and keep you motivated\".\nSix tips for getting a job if you're over 50\nFive tips when asking for a pay rise\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Cost of living: Five tips when asking for a pay rise", "date": "2023-08-15 10:33:09", "text": "If you feel like you're not getting paid enough, you're probably not alone.\nWhile average wages have been increasing, they're still not keeping up with the pace of price rises, which means many people are finding it harder to get by.\nRecent months have seen waves of strikes, with tens of thousands of workers walking out in disputes over pay, jobs and conditions.\nMany of these strikes have taken place in the public sector, where workers often do not have the power to negotiate individually.\nAnd whether you work in the public or private sector, even if you do have a conversation with your manager there's no guarantee that it will result in a pay rise.\nHowever, there are ways to give yourself the best chance of success. \nWe spoke to recruiters, a manager and a workplace psychologist to get five tips on how to best negotiate for more money.\nJill Cotton, a career trends experts at jobs site Glassdoor, says scheduling a talk in advance will allow you and your boss time to prepare, and means you're more likely to have a productive conversation.\n\"Don't spring this on your line manager,\" Ms Cotton says. \"Be upfront and say that you want to book in a conversation that is specifically about pay.\"\nRowsonara Begum, who helps her brother run Saffron Indian takeaway in Salisbury, says it also needs to be the right time for the business.\nThe takeaway has five members of staff and occasionally takes on additional workers during busy periods.\nShe says if workers pick a time when the business is doing well, they will have the best chance of successfully negotiating more money.\nIf you're asking for a pay rise, you should have lots of evidence of why you deserve one.\n\"Know what you've achieved either from a work setting or what you've done to develop yourself, maybe to support your team, support your line managers. List all the pros of what you've done,\" says Shan Saba, a director at Glasgow-based recruitment firm Brightwork.\nThis evidence also helps your manager rationalise why you should be paid more, according to Stephanie Davies, a workplace psychologist.\n\"The brain needs a 'why' - why should I pay you this amount?\" she says.\nHowever, it's not just about bringing a list of all the things you've done. You should also be clear about what you want to do next, says Mr Saba.\n\"If you have aspirations of moving up through your organisation, have a plan of what you're looking to do over the coming year.\"\nWhen asking your boss for more money, it helps if you're confident and know your worth.\nThat's something Ms Begum has noticed, from her experience of having these talks with staff.\n\"Here in Salisbury, it's quite difficult to get the staff we need,\" she says.\n\"It's also become harder to recruit from overseas. So workers have negotiating power because they know there's a shortage.\"\nOften people don't feel confident because there is a \"stigma\" around talking about pay, says Glassdoor's Jill Cotton, but it's \"an important part of work\".\nWomen and people from minority backgrounds can often find it particularly hard to ask for more more, adds psychologist Stephanie Davies.\nHer advice to them is to ask for a mentor or role model, who can help guide them through those conversations.\nMost experts agree it's best to have an exact figure in mind before embarking on a conversation about pay.\nDo your research, advises James Reed, chair of recruitment firm Reed.\n\"You can go online and look at job adverts and see what other comparable jobs are being recruited for and what the salaries are,\" he says.\nMs Cotton warns the figure should be realistic.\n\"We would all love to be paid millions of pounds every single year. But we are being paid to fulfil a role with the skillset we have,\" she says.\nIf the above steps don't result in a pay rise, try not to be disheartened.\n\"Sometimes these conversations can take a while, even months, but it's important to keep the communication open,\" says Ms Begum.\nPay is also not the be-all and end-all, says Mr Reed.\n\"It's not just necessarily about money. You might be able to get more holiday or more flexibility around working hours,\" he says, adding you could also negotiate extra training and development.\nAnd if you don't feel you're getting what you want from your employer, remember, there are other opportunities out there.\n\"You can always look elsewhere, that's the really big lesson,\" says Ms Davies.\nPay rises at fastest pace for over 20 years\nWhy is UK inflation so high?\nStrike dates: Who is striking and what pay do they want?\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Cheaper train tickets: Five ways to save money", "date": "2023-08-16 20:56:34", "text": "A jump in ticket prices may feel particularly unwelcome, after costs for everything have risen at near-record rates. \nThe next price rise for regulated fares is due in March 2024. Regulated fares cover about 45% of fares, including season tickets on most commuter journeys, some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys and anytime tickets around major cities.\nIt may seem like little consolation - especially after months of disruption from rail strikes and poor service - but the government has promised that the increase will be below the rate of price inflation for a second year.\nWhile some people will try to cram in buying their season tickets just before the price rise, here are five tips for getting the cheapest deals at any time of the year.\nAdvance train tickets are usually released up to 12 weeks before your departure date, although some go on sale as far as 24 weeks in advance. \nThese types of tickets are often the cheapest way to travel on the railways if you're happy to go during a fixed time. Sometimes they can be available to buy up to an hour before your journey.\nPersonal finance website Money Saving Expert says that London North Eastern Railway (LNER) often releases advance tickets up to six months ahead for routes from stations north of York to London.\nSome ticket purchasing apps can send alerts to your phone as soon as tickets for a specified journey go on sale. \nSplit ticketing means you can take the same number of trains you normally would for your journey, but can save money by splitting your journey into multiple tickets between the stations the service stops at on the way.\nSome websites like Split My Fare and Split Train Tickets do it for you without you having to work it out.\nSplit My Fare says on average, customers save 26% by doing this - although it's not always possible on some journeys. \nAlso, checking to see whether it is cheaper to buy two single tickets rather than a return might save you money.  \nRail cards can offer discounts when booking, though they cost money to purchase in the first place, so benefit those who travel often.\nThere are several types of rail card available: national, regional, those for students and those for pensioners. \nFor example, the regional Cotswold Line Railcard costs £9.95, is valid for one year and gives you a 34% discount on off-peak single and return tickets.\nMore information on the different types of railcard are here.\nYou can get up to a third off the ticket price when travelling in groups of three to nine adults. \nThe group must be travelling together, and individual rail cards cannot be used when booking a group ticket. \nGroups of over 10 people can also get discounts - contact the train company directly for those. Group off-peak day travelcards for London are also available, but the origin station on the ticket needs to be in fare zones one to nine.\nNational flexible rail tickets could save passengers hundreds of pounds, says watchdog Transport Focus. \nThe flexible season tickets will allow travel on any eight days in a 28-day period, with no need to select the days of travel in advance. \nTrain companies have also introduced a range of flexible tickets aimed at commuters and workers who have seen their travel patterns change post-pandemic.  \nThe Flexi Season ticket will offer a minimum of 20% discount on an equivalent monthly season ticket, according to National Rail.\nFor those making the same journey multiple times in a week regularly, monthly or season tickets can be cheaper. Check with your employer to see if they offer a season ticket loan to help you spread the cost, interest free.\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "Energy saving tips: Five ways to cut costs this winter", "date": "2023-08-24 12:06:46", "text": "The new energy price cap has set the amount suppliers can charge customers this coming winter.\nTypical bills have fallen back from last year's levels but there are other ways you may be able to reduce your costs. \nActual savings will vary for different households. \nMost of the energy we use at home goes on heating.\nTurning the thermostat down by just one degree could save about £150 annually. \nYou can also use your boiler's timer - if it has one - to ensure your heating switches off when the house is empty. \nWhile it might be tempting to reduce your heating to save money, the government recommends a room temperature of at least 18C. Older people and those who are ill or disabled may need it to be warmer. \nIf your house is too cold it could encourage damp - which can lead to mould. People living with mould are more likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses, infections, allergies or asthma.\nHow this saving is worked out: Experts at Cambridge Architectural Research (CAR) found that turning the thermostat down from 19C to 18C would save 13% on an average annual gas bill - that was worth about £157 in winter 2022. CAR suggests 68% of homes could benefit. Its findings are based on estimated energy use in 12,300 homes questioned by the English Housing Survey in 2012. The Energy Saving Trust previously estimated a saving of £145 a year, if temperatures were reduced from 22C to 21C in main living areas.\nIf you have a combi boiler, try reducing the flow temperature for the water heating your home to 60C. This is the temperature of the water the boiler sends to the radiators.  \nA higher temperature will heat your home faster, but it could also mean bigger bills.\nCombi boilers tend to capture and recycle heat less efficiently at higher temperatures - meaning it requires more gas to heat your home.\nIf you have a conventional boiler, such as a system with a hot water tank, you could try setting it to 65C. It's important not to set it any lower as it could create a health risk - legionella bacteria could develop in the water.\nIf you want to consider adjusting the flow temperature, the Energy Saving Trust has more information and the Nesta charity has a guide to walk you through the process.\nIf you rent your home you might want to check with your landlord before making changes. \nHow this saving is  worked out: CAR modelled the potential savings from reducing the temperature of combi boilers from 75C to 60C, in 2022. It found this would save 8% on an average annual gas bill - about £97 in winter 2022. CAR suggests 38% of homes in the UK could save money with this measure. \nThere are a couple of ways to save money when you shower.\nFirstly, cutting the length of your shower from about seven minutes to four could save about £84 a year. \nSecondly, you could consider buying a water-efficient showerhead - available from about £10. (Check they are compatible with your shower first).\nThese work by restricting the amount of water coming through the head. This means you use less hot water for the same length of shower. This could mean a saving of about £98 a year even if you don't have shorter showers.\nHow this saving is worked out: CAR assumed that each household took two showers a day, that an average shower lasted seven minutes, used eight litres a minute and had a temperature of 41C. It says four-minute showers would save an average of 24 litres of hot water, resulting in an energy saving of 1.1 kWh per shower, or around 800 kWh per year for a household. CAR also estimated that a low-flow shower head would save an average of 28 litres of hot water, resulting an energy saving of 1.3 kWh per shower, or around 950 kWh per year for a household. \nRadiators in many homes have valves which control the temperature in each room. \nIf used correctly, these thermostatic radiator valves - often numbered one to five (sometimes up to six) - can save you money.\nIn rooms you use less often, consider turning the valve to the midway point (this should still heat the room to 18-20C). \nKeeping doors closed will also help trap heat.\nHow is the saving worked out: CAR's study found that homes with radiator valves are likely to have partially adjusted them so that rooms outside the main living area are already 1.5°C cooler. However, reducing the temperature by a further 1.5°C could save 5.5% of the total gas bill (a saving of £68 in winter 2022). Its modelling found that 76% of UK homes could save with this measure.\nPoorly insulated homes lose heat more easily and are harder to keep warm.\nDraught-proofing is one of the cheapest and most effective ways to save energy.\nTo stop cold air getting in and heat escaping, consider:\nBut do not block extractor fans, wall vents and airbricks. These are necessary for ventilating certain rooms (like your kitchen and bathroom).\nThe cost depends on which areas you want to draught-proof and how you want to do it. A professional draught-proofing service could save more energy. The Energy Saving Trust has further advice. \nHow this saving is worked out: The saving is based on a typical three-bed gas heated, semi-detached house using a gas price of 10.3p/kWh and electricity price of 34.0p/kWh. The Energy Saving Trust's figures are based on the government's methodology for energy modelling in homes. \nNote: All savings figures are based on a typical gas-heated home in Great Britain with an annual usage of around 12,000 kWh of gas and 2,900 kWh of electricity, using a gas price of 10.3p/kWh and electricity price of 34.0p/kWh (based on Energy Price Guarantee October 2022).\nCombining all measures could potentially save a typical household £530 per year, according to Nesta/CAR/Energy Saving Trust calculations. Due to the potential for double counting, this is less than the £625 total of adding up each individual measure in this article. There are dangers in overly severe energy rationing - underheated and damp homes come with health risks.\nThese tips have been chosen in collaboration with UK broadcasters - including the BBC, ITV, Sky, Channel 4 and Channel 5 - as well as Citizens Advice, the Climate Change Committee, Energy Saving Trust and Nesta. \nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "What are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?", "date": "2023-08-29 14:58:37", "text": "Air passengers are facing significant delays to their flights after a \"technical issue\" hit the UK air traffic control system.\nThe National Air Traffic Services said on Monday afternoon that the glitch had been fixed, however hundreds of flights were cancelled. \nThe problem emerged on one of the busiest days of the year for flights, when many people were set to return from long weekend trips abroad.\nIf you do find your flight is affected, what are your rights?\nIf your flight is covered under UK law, your airline must let you choose between either getting a refund or an alternative flight, regardless of how far in advance the cancellation was made. \nYou can get your money back for any part of the ticket you have not used. So if you booked a return flight and the outbound leg is cancelled, you can get the full cost of the return ticket refunded. \nIf you still want to travel, your airline must find you an alternative flight. If another airline is flying to your destination significantly sooner, or there are other suitable modes of transport available, then you have a right to be booked onto that alternative transport instead. \nIf you are stuck abroad or at the airport because of a flight cancellation, airlines must also provide you with other assistance until you are able to fly to your destination. \nThis includes: \nIf your airline is unable to arrange assistance, you have the right to organise this yourself and claim back the cost later. In this case, the Civil Aviation Authority advises people to keep receipts and not spend more than necessary. \nYou are entitled to the same assistance if your flight is delayed by more than two hours. \nYou may also be able to claim compensation if your flight arrives at its destination more than three hours late. Again, the amount is based on how far you are flying. \nIf you are delayed by more than five hours and no longer want to travel, you can get a full refund.\nIf you booked a package holiday with a company that is an Abta member and your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a suitable alternative flight or a full refund. \nDisruption caused by things like airport or air traffic control employee strikes, bad weather or other \"extraordinary circumstances\" are not eligible for extra compensation.\nHowever, in other circumstances - which are the airline's fault - you have a number of rights under UK law if you are flying from a UK airport on any airline, arriving at a UK airport on an EU or UK airline, or arriving at an airport in the EU on a UK airline. \nWhat you are entitled to depends on what caused the cancellation and how much notice you were given. \nIf your flight is cancelled with less than two weeks' notice, you may be able to claim compensation based on the timings of the alternative flight you are offered.\nThe amount you are entitled to also depends on how far you were travelling. For example: \nAirlines will not refund you for loss of earnings. They are only responsible for covering direct costs - such as hotel rooms, meals and alternative flights - but they are not obliged to cover consequential losses.\nTravel insurance policies will not usually cover loss of earnings. \nIf you think you're going to be late back at work because of flight delays, you have a responsibility to contact your employer to let them know you won't be back as planned, legal experts say.\nYou should agree with your employer over how to categorise the absence; for example, using more annual leave or time banked in lieu. Taking unpaid leave could also be an option.\nEmployers have no legal obligation to pay employees who are absent in this situation, experts say, unless it is stated in their contract.\nHave you been personally affected by the disruption to flights?

{"title": "Profile: Keir Starmer hoping for keys to No10", "date": "2023-09-06 12:29:17", "text": "In many ways, Sir Keir Starmer is not your typical politician.\nHe did not enter Parliament until he was in his 50s, after a successful career as a lawyer, and unlike most MPs he arrived in the House of Commons with a knighthood.\nHe was knighted in 2014, in recognition for his role as Director of Public Prosecutions, the most senior criminal prosecutor in England and Wales.\nThe Labour leader's background as a high-flying human rights lawyer might suggest a privileged upbringing. But in fact the 61-year-old - whose dad was a toolmaker and mum was a nurse - comes from a relatively modest background. \nNow, with his party riding high in the opinion polls, he is hoping to return Labour to power after 13 years in opposition. \nOne of four children, Sir Keir grew up in Oxted, Surrey.\nHis parents were staunch Labour supporters and named their son after the party's first MP, Keir Hardie. \nAfter passing the 11-plus exam, he got a place at Reigate Grammar School, which became a private school two years later, although existing pupils, like Starmer, had their fees paid by the local council until they were 16. \nIn the sixth form, his fees were covered by a grant, according to the Telegraph.\nHe was politically active from an early age, joining the East Surrey Young Socialists, the youth branch of the local Labour Party, at the age of 16. \nHe also excelled at music, playing the flute, piano, violin and recorder and even sharing lessons with Norman Cook, who would become known as chart-topping DJ Fatboy Slim. \nHowever, there were also challenges - his mum suffered from Still's disease, a rare autoimmune condition which eventually left her unable to speak or walk. \nIn interviews, Sir Keir has recalled how she spent much of his childhood in and out of hospital as her health deteriorated.\nHe wasn't as close to his father, who he has described as \"a difficult man\" who could be remote, although he said he was \"devoted\" to his wife and \"incredibly hard-working\". \nThe first in his family to go to university, the young activist had considered studying politics but was encouraged by his parents to go for law.\nAs a politician, Sir Keir likes to portray himself as a stickler for the rules - indeed he was once dubbed \"Mr Rules\" by a shadow cabinet colleague. \nHe has sometimes been accused by opponents of being a bit dull. He unwinds by playing five-a-side football and supporting Arsenal.\nBut he has not led a blemish-free life, and there is at least one brush with the law in his past.\nTrying to raise money during a lads' holiday to the French Riviera as a student in the early 1980s, he was caught by police illegally selling ice creams. \nA university friend of Sir Keir told Politico's Westminster Insider podcast he escaped the incident without punishment, beyond the contraband ice creams being confiscated. \nHe graduated with a first from the University of Leeds in 1985, before getting his post-graduate qualification at Oxford the following year and going on to become a barrister, focusing on human rights law. \nIn his early years in London he recalled living in \"a really grotty flat\" above a brothel. One of his flatmates at the time, journalist Paul Vickers, described him as a \"great party animal\", who loved Northern Soul music.\nHe told the BBC's Profile programme in 2009 that the young Starmer's politics were \"hard left\" and he used to edit the radical magazine, Socialist Alternatives. \nHe tends not to give much away about his personality in interviews, but is happy to own up to having a competitive streak.\nHe recently told The Guardian: \"I hate losing. Some say it's the taking part that counts. I am not in that camp.\"\nSir Keir's commitment to tackling injustice extended to his legal career, which included working to get rid of the death penalty in the Caribbean and Africa. \nHe was also part of the legal team in the so-called McLibel case, offering his services for free to help defend activists who were pursued by McDonald's for distributing leaflets questioning the fast food giant's environmental claims. \nHis work on high-profile human rights cases even sparked rumours he was the inspiration behind Mark Darcy, the buttoned-up but dashing lawyer in Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones's Diary novels, although the author later quashed this suggestion.\nSir Keir married his wife, Victoria Alexander, who works for the NHS, in 2007 and the couple have two children. \nIn 2008 he was named the new head of the Crown Prosecution Service and Director of Public Prosecutions, despite spending most of his career as a defence barrister.\nHe dealt with a number of major cases including helping to bring two men accused of murdering 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence to justice during his time in the role. \nHe stood down in 2013 and was knighted the following year. \nSir Keir was elected for MP for Holborn and St Pancras in 2015, a safe seat in Labour's North London stronghold, soon becoming a shadow Home Office minister. \nHe quit the role in 2016, joining a number of frontbenchers who resigned in protest at Jeremy Corbyn's leadership following the Brexit referendum. \nHowever, unlike many of his colleagues, Sir Keir agreed to rejoin Mr Corbyn's top team just over three months later, as shadow Brexit secretary - and stayed on even when the leadership faced criticism over how it dealt with allegations of antisemitism. \nIn that job he had the tricky task of navigating Labour's position on the European Union during the withdrawal negotiations with the bloc. \nThe Remain-supporting MP said publicly that another referendum should remain an option, and that if it happened, he would campaign to stay in the EU.\nSome believe he was the driving force behind Labour's change in position ahead of the 2019 election, promising a second vote. \nCritics argued this policy was partly responsible for the party's disastrous electoral performance, after which Mr Corbyn announced he would stand down as leader. \nSir Keir was a frontrunner in the race to replace him, promising to unite the party but retain the \"radicalism\" of the Corbyn years. \nBecoming leader in April 2020 - at the start of the first Covid lockdown - Sir Keir pledged to bring \"a constructive opposition\", working alongside the government to get the country through the pandemic. \nHowever, unable to tour the country and meet voters - he first speech as leader was a video message - and with the news agenda dominated by Covid, he struggled to make an impression. \nAccording to his tax returns for 2021/22, Sir Keir earned £126,154 as an MP and leader of the opposition.\nIn May 2021, Labour lost Hartlepool to the Tories in a humiliating by-election defeat, prompting a policy rethink and a reshuffle of Sir Keir's top team. The focus was now firmly on winning back Labour voters lost to Boris Johnson's Conservatives in former Labour heartlands - the so-called Red Wall. \nTalk of Brexit was discouraged and Sir Keir began dropping left-wing pledges he had made during the leadership campaign, including abolishing university tuition fees and nationalising energy and water companies.\nHe hit back at claims of betrayal from the left, by arguing that the party couldn't make unfunded spending commitments in the current economic climate and that Labour had to regain the trust of voters on the economy.\nWinning back the support of the Jewish community was a key early priority for Sir Keir.\nHe suspended Jeremy Corbyn from the Parliamentary party, in a row over antisemitism, meaning his predecessor and North London constituency neighbour, cannot stand as a Labour candidate at the next general election.\nOther left-wingers also claim they have been blocked from standing for the party, leading to accusations Sir Keir has spearheaded a purge of the Labour left.\nInstead, Sir Keir has chosen to align himself with another Labour leader - Sir Tony Blair. \nLike Sir Tony, who won three general elections, he has sought to reassure voters that Labour would not go on an unfunded spending spree if the party wins power, which has meant watering down or scrapping some of their more radical proposals.\nWhen he reshuffled his top team this week, it was Blairites, such as Liz Kendall and Hilary Benn, who were the winners.\nWith a general election rapidly approaching, he will be hoping that deliberate positioning will help his party win power again, four years after suffering its worst result since the 1930s.\nStarmer reveals regret at relationship with father\nFive things we learned about Sir Keir Starmer from Piers Morgan interview\nKuenssberg: What could go wrong for Keir Starmer?\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "What is GDP and how is it measured?", "date": "2023-09-13 08:54:37", "text": "GDP - or Gross Domestic Product - is an important tool for judging how well, or badly, an economy is doing. \nIt helps businesses decide when to expand and hire more people, and lets the government work out how much it can afford to tax and spend.\nGDP is a measure of all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in a country.\nIn the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are considered more significant.\nWhen an economy is growing, each quarterly GDP figure is slightly bigger in than the previous three-month period. \nMost economists, politicians and businesses like to see a steadily rising GDP because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises.\nWhen GDP is falling, it means the economy is shrinking - which is bad news for businesses and workers. \nIf GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known as a recession, which can lead pay freezes and lost jobs. \nThe Covid pandemic caused the most severe recession seen in more than 300 years, which forced the government to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy.\nAlthough higher prices have squeezed consumers' budgets more recently, the UK has avoided going into recession.\nAccording to the official statistics for the most recent quarter, the economy grew by 0.2% between April and June. That was slightly higher than predicted. \nHowever, the monthly figure for July suggests the economy actually shrank by 0.5%, which is worse than expected. \nThe Office of National Statistics (ONS) said the fall was driven by strike action by NHS workers and teachers, plus wet weather which hit construction and retailers.\nIn January 2023, the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak set out a pledge to \"grow the economy\". This will be met if GDP is bigger in the three-month period between October and December 2023 than it was during the previous quarter (July-September).\nThe government can use growing GDP as evidence that it is doing a good job of managing the economy. Likewise, if GDP falls, opposition politicians say the government is running it badly.\nBut it's more than just a report card on the government's economic performance. \nIf GDP is going up steadily, people pay more in tax because they're earning and spending more. This means more money for the government to spend on public services, such as schools, police and hospitals.\nGovernments also like to keep an eye on how much they are borrowing in relation to the size of the economy. \nFor example borrowing was equivalent to about 14% of GDP in the first year of the Covid pandemic, the highest proportion since World War Two.\nGDP can be measured in three ways:\nIn the UK, the ONS publishes one single measure of GDP, which is calculated using all three measurements. \nBut early estimates mainly use the output measure, using data collected from thousands of companies. \nThe UK produces one of the quickest estimates of GDP of the major economies, about 40 days after the quarter in question.\nAt that stage, only about 60% of the data is available, so the figure is revised as more information comes in.\nThe ONS publishes more information about this on its website.\nGDP doesn't tell the whole story:\nJust because GDP is increasing, it doesn't mean that an individual person's standard of living is improving. \nIf a country's population increases, it pushes GDP up, because with more people, more money will be spent. \nBut individuals within that country might not be getting richer. They may be getting poorer on average, even while GDP goes up.\nThe ONS also publishes a figure for GDP per capita - or head of population - which can tell a different story. \nSome critics also argue that GDP doesn't take into account whether the economic growth it measures is sustainable, or the environmental damage it might do. \nAlternative measures have been developed which try to capture this. \nIn 2010, the ONS started measuring well-being alongside economic growth.

{"title": "What is a recession and how could it affect me?", "date": "2023-09-13 11:04:04", "text": "The economy is expected to shrink by 0.2% in 2023, but the UK will avoid going into recession, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). \nHowever, the government's independent forecaster warned that once rising prices were taken into account, household incomes would drop by 6% in 2023 and 2024. \nThis would be the largest two-year fall in living standards since the 1950s. \nIn normal times, a country's economy grows. \nPeople's incomes tend to rise as the value of the goods and services the country produces - its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - increases.\nBut sometimes the level of GDP falls, and that's a sign that the economy is doing badly.\nA recession is usually defined as when GDP falls for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row. \nThe last time the UK's economy went into recession was in 2020, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe UK avoided falling into recession at the end of 2022 after the economy performed better than expected.\nThe economy continued to grow in the first two quarters of 2023.\nAccording to the official statistics, it increased by 0.2% between April and June. That was slightly higher than predicted. \nHowever, the monthly figure for July suggests the economy actually shrank by 0.5%, which is worse than expected.\nThe OBR said in March thatit expected the UK economy to shrink by 0.2% in 2023, but was not predicting falls in two successive three-month periods, meaning, technically, the country would avoid recession. \nIt then thinks the economy will grow by:\nThe next OBR forecast is expected at the same time as the Budget Statement which is usually in late November. \nDespite avoiding a recession, the UK economy is lagging behind all the other G7 countries, apart from Germany. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also warned about the health of the UK economy. \nIn January it said it expected the UK to be the only major economy to shrink in 2023.\nIt predicted the UK would perform worse than other advanced economies, including Russia, as the cost of living continued to hit households.\nThe organisation blamed high energy prices, rising mortgage costs and increased taxes, and persistent worker shortages. \nFor most people, economic growth is good. \nIt usually means there are more jobs, companies are more profitable and can pay employees and shareholders more. \nThe higher wages and larger profits seen in a growing economy also generate additional money for the government in taxes. \nIt can choose to spend more on benefits, public services and government workers' wages, or cut taxes.\nWhen the economy shrinks, these things can go into reverse - but governments normally still have a choice on public spending.\nSome people might lose their jobs, and unemployment could rise. Graduates and school leavers could find it harder to get their first job. \nOthers may find it harder to be promoted, or to get big enough pay rises to keep pace with price increases. \nHowever, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. \nBenefit recipients and those on fixed incomes are particularly likely to struggle. \nWhen the economy is struggling to grow at the same time as there is high inflation, there can be a situation called \"stagflation\", which is very difficult to solve.\nWhen a country is in a recession, the Bank of England - which is independent of government - would usually cut interest rates. \nThis makes it cheaper for businesses and households to borrow money which can boost spending and growth.  \nHowever, prices have been rising very quickly in the UK, and the Bank has chosen to increase interest rates to tackle that.  \nThe recession in 2020 only lasted for six months, although the 20.4% reduction in the UK economy between April and June that year was the largest on record.\nThe previous recession started in 2008 due to the global financial crisis, and went on for five quarters.\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Five ways to save money on your packed lunch", "date": "2023-09-18 16:36:41", "text": "Usually it's cheaper to make lunch at home instead of buying food out and about. But over the last year, staple lunchtime ingredients have gone up in price at the supermarket.\nWe've gathered some top tips on how to keep costs down when making a packed lunch for work, school or a day trip.\nCaroline Job launched blog and YouTube channel Lunchbox World when coming up with different ideas for her three kids' packed lunches. She enters an identical list of items into different supermarkets' online shopping apps to see which one comes up cheapest, and looks for discount codes.\nAlthough it might take a bit of extra time, Caroline says it has made a big difference as she has noticed the prices going up for different products like cucumbers or eggs.\nIf you buy your food from town centre convenience stores they might charge more - so you could save money by going to a large supermarket to stock up.\nYou could also consider swapping your favourite branded snacks for own-label versions.\nCaroline also suggests taking a look at what is in the cupboards, fridge or freezer before doing the food shop to make sure you're not doubling up.\n\"Have a plan as to what meals you're going to prep and what you might want to eat that week for your lunch,\" she says.\nShe adds that one \"game changer\" for her was working with best before dates to ensure that food was not being wasted.\n\"I now rejig my menu for the week as it progresses - if the ham is going off, then I'll use that up today and have a chicken sandwich tomorrow.\"\nRitesh, a father of two from Hounslow, adds that prepping different items has helped him manage a squeezed budget.\n\"Our kids love rice pancakes, so we will often prep the mixture the night before and we'll have them for breakfast and combine them with something different for lunch,\" he says.\nIt can be frustrating when a lunchbox comes back from school at the end of the day completely untouched.\nBut the freezer can be a big help when it comes to getting a greater variety of food on the menu for the week.\nThe NHS Better Health website recommends keeping a small selection of different types of bread in the freezer like bagels, pittas and wraps, granary or multigrain. If you pop a piece of greaseproof paper in between each, it's easier to get just one out when it's frozen, Caroline suggests.\nAnd if you're looking for a snack option, frozen fruit is typically cheaper than fresh, especially out of season.\nFrozen fruits count towards your five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. There is less waste and you can choose the exact amount you want to use.\nWith food prices rising at their fastest rate for 45 years, Dr Charlotte Evans - an associate professor at the University of Leeds, specialising in nutritional epidemiology and public health - is concerned the nutritional value of packed lunches might decline as budgets are squeezed.\nShe argues: \"Replacing homemade items with the cheapest, pre-packed snacks like crisps or chocolate biscuits might be the first place people look to make savings.\"\nAlthough it can be tempting to reach for something that saves on time, pre-prepared options can often be a lot more expensive at the shops and less nutritious.\nDr Evans suggests making up your own a Japanese-inspired, compartmentalised bento box to use up leftover items in the fridge or cupboard.\n\"It's a great way to use up lots of little bits - a wrap, some lettuce or carrots, a little bit of bean chilli from the night before.\"\nThe British Nutrition Foundation suggests putting a small handful of mixed dried fruits or nuts into reusable food bags or sealed containers to store in the cupboard to make your own easy snack.\nAnd if you have some spare time, growing your own cress for your egg sandwiches could also be a fun project for the family - as well as cheaper than buying it from the supermarket.\nBatch-cooking is a great way to save on money and time in the long-run, says personal finance expert Rachel Wait.\nShe says that pasta dishes are easy to make in bulk, along with stews with beans, soups or muffins. \nYou could just make a little extra for your evening meal and use the leftovers the day after for your lunchbox.\n\"Cooking with pulses like beans and lentils can be a cheaper alternative to meat and can also help bulk out meals,\" she points out.\nDr Evans adds that adding extra salad items like lettuce or cucumber to a sandwich could help bring costs down too.\n\"It can make a sandwich look much more appetising - different textures, colours... It makes it look like a proper sandwich and bulking up on the veg means you're using perhaps a little bit less of the expensive stuff like cheese and ham.\"\nFive hacks to help save money on your food shop\nPret hikes price of drinks subscription to £30\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Cost-of-living payments: Who is getting them and when?", "date": "2023-09-19 23:08:29", "text": "Millions of people are receiving payments to help with higher bills, with more to come.\nLow-income households, pensioners and some disabled people are entitled to additional cost-of-living funds after the government extended a scheme it launched in 2022. \nA committee of MPs is currently investigating whether the payments are supporting those most in need.\nSome groups are receiving payments to help with higher bills, including:\nThe first instalment of £301 for those on means-tested benefits was received by about eight million people in late April and June. The next of £300 will be paid between 31 October and 19 November.\nThe payment, in three instalments, is available to households who receive the following benefits: \nThe payment reference on a recipient's bank account is their national insurance number, followed by DWP COL.\nThe 1.1 million people who receive only working tax credit or child tax credit, rather than any of the other benefits, are paid slightly later than others.\nPeople are not eligible for these payments if they receive the new-style employment and support allowance, contributory employment and support allowance, or the new-style jobseeker's allowance - unless they get universal credit.\nAnyone who thinks they should have received the help but did not should contact the office that pays their benefit or tax credits, or report it here.\nTo qualify for the latest instalment, people had to have claimed a benefits payment between 18 August and 17 September, or received a payment for an assessment period ending between these dates. Pensioner households may be able to have a new pension credit claim backdated.\nAn estimated 850,000 pensioner households do not claim pension credit, which is a gateway to these extra payments.\nOther eligibility details are outlined here. \nNone of these cost-of-living payments affect the tax you pay, or the benefits or tax credits you receive.\nUp to six million people on the following disability benefits received another £150:\nThose payments were made between 20 June and 4 July.\nHouseholds that receive the winter fuel payment - which is worth £200-£300 and is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - received an extra £300 in November or December 2022, and will get another £300 this coming winter.\nLower-income pensioners who claim pension credit get the money in addition to the support provided for those on benefits.\nTwo payments totalling £650 were made in 2022 to more than eight million low-income households. \nPayments of £300 were also paid to pensioners during last winter, and a £150 payment was also made to those with disabilities. \nSome people would have received all of those payments, if they were eligible.\nA £150 rebate, often through people's council tax bill, was made last year. The Household Support Fund, which is distributed by local councils, helped vulnerable people, including giving fuel vouchers to those in need.\nAll household energy bills were cut by at least £400 between October and March. \nThe discount was made automatically by energy suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales. However, there are no plans to repeat this in the coming winter. \nSeparate arrangements were made for households in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. \nThey received a single payment of £600 starting in January, which was more than in the rest of the UK because a higher proportion of households use heating oil. \nDirect debit customers in Northern Ireland had the money paid into their bank accounts. Other customers were sent a voucher. \nThe Commons Work and Pensions Committee is investigating whether cost-of-living payments have been received by those in most need of help.\nThey are studying whether some have missed out on hundreds of pounds because they are just outside the qualifying criteria, and whether the package as a whole is sufficient for low-income families.\nThe government launched an Energy Price Guarantee in October 2022, which limited a typical dual-fuel household's annual energy bill to £2,500 throughout last winter.\nThe scheme, which applied to England, Wales and Scotland, is still in place if needed, but has not been required since July.\nThat's because a typical bill fell to around £2,074 a year under regulator Ofgem's energy price cap in the summer, and will fall further to £1,923 a year in October.\nA government scheme to cut energy bills for businesses finished at the end of March. \nUnder a new scheme that began in April, firms get a discount on wholesale prices rather than costs being capped as under the previous deal.\nHeavy energy-using sectors, like glass, ceramics and steelmakers, get a larger discount than others.\nHow is the rising cost of living affecting you?

{"title": "What is the UK inflation rate and why is it so high?", "date": "2023-09-21 11:59:09", "text": "The rate at which prices are rising slid to 6.7% in the year to August, down from 6.8% in July.\nSlowing food inflation on items like milk, cheese and eggs helped drive the surprise fall, although the pace of food price rises remains high - at 13.6%.\nTo help slow inflation, the Bank of England has increased interest rates 14 times to 5.25% since November 2021. \nInflation is the increase in the price of something over time. \nIf a bottle of milk costs £1 but £1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%. \nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) tracks the prices of hundreds of everyday items in an imaginary \"basket of goods\".\nThe basket is constantly updated to reflect shopping trends, with the most recent changes adding frozen berries and removing alcopops.\nEach month's inflation figure shows how much these prices have risen since the same date last year. \nYou can calculate inflation in various ways, but the main \"headline\" measure is the Consumer Prices Index (CPI).  \nThe CPI rate was 6.7% in the year to August, down from 6.8% in July.\n\"Core inflation\" excludes the price of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco.\nThis measure was 6.2% in August, down from 6.9% in June and July, which was the highest level since 1992.\nThe Bank of England considers this number as well as CPI when deciding whether to change interest rates. \nSoaring food and energy bills helped drive inflation up. \nOil and gas were in greater demand after Covid. The war in Ukraine meant less was available from Russia, putting further pressure on prices.\nThe conflict also reduced the amount of grain available, pushing up global food prices. \nThis effect was compounded in the UK in February by a shortage of vegetables, which took food inflation to a 45-year high.\nAlcohol prices in restaurants and pubs had also risen. \nYour device may not support this visualisation\nThe Bank of England has a target to keep inflation at 2%, but the current rate is still well above that. \nThe traditional response to rising inflation is to put up interest rates. \nThis makes borrowing more expensive, and can mean some people with mortgages see their monthly payments go up. Some saving rates also increase. \nWhen people have less money to spend, they buy fewer things, reducing the demand for goods and slowing price rises.\nBusinesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs, and may cut staff. \nIn August, the Bank increased interest rates for the 14th time in a row, taking the main rate to 5.25%. \nIt had been widely expected to raise rates again in September but instead decided to hold them at 5.25%. \nOfficial figures showed that - on average - regular pay excluding bonuses grew by 7.8% between May and July, compared to the same period a year earlier. \nThis nearly matched the rate of inflation in the same period, which meant real wage growth was almost flat for the first time in two years, after falling behind. \nHowever, unions point out that many workers have received smaller pay increases, and there have been widespread strikes over pay. \nThe government has argued that big pay rises could push inflation higher because companies might increase prices as a result. \nLower inflation doesn't mean prices fall. It just means they rise less quickly.\nThe Bank of England has predicted inflation will drop to 5% by the end of 2023, rather than the 4% it had been anticipating.\nBank governor Andrew Bailey said it was \"crucial that we see the job through\" and get price rises back to the 2% target, because people \"should trust that their hard-earned money maintains its value\".\nBut he admitted that price inflation has been \"more sticky than previously expected\".\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which assesses the government's economic plans, previously predicted inflation would fall back to 2.9% by the end of the year.\nIn January, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said halving inflation by the end of 2023 was one of the government's five key pledges. \nOther countries have also been experiencing a cost-of-living squeeze.\nMany of the reasons are the same - increased energy costs, shortages of goods and materials, and the fallout from Covid.\nThe annual inflation rate for countries which use the euro was estimated to be 5.3% in the 12 months to July, stable compared to June and down from 6.1% in May.\nThe European Central Bank has also been increasing interest rates to try to bring eurozone inflation down. On 14 September, it raised its key interest rate - the benchmark deposit rate - to 4%, a record high.\nIn the US, inflation was 3.7% in the year to August, up from 3.2% in July and 3% in June. \nAt its September meeting, the US central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged between 5.25%-5.5% as it considers whether it has done enough to stabilise prices.\nAugust saw the 11th increase in rates by the Federal Reserve since early 2022, with rates at their highest for almost two decades.\nIt warned further raises would follow \"if appropriate\". \nWhy is UK inflation so high?\nHow much are prices rising for you?

{"title": "Interest rates: How the Bank of England's decision affects you and your money", "date": "2023-09-22 08:49:55", "text": "The Bank of England has held interest rates, ending a run of 14 consecutive increases.\nIn September, the Bank rate, set by the Monetary Policy Committee, was unchanged from the previous month at 5.25%.\nThat may bring some relief to homeowners who have seen mortgage rates rise and potentially the end of better news for savers.\nThe Bank rate is currently at its highest level for 15 years.  \nThe theory is that raising interest rates makes it more expensive to borrow money, meaning people have less to spend, reducing demand and inflation.\nRates had risen 14 times in a row since December 2021 as the Bank tries to bring inflation closer to its target of 2%.\nPrices rose by 6.7% in the year to August, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This was lower than the 6.8% in the year to July, and down from the peak of 11.1% in October 2022.\nAlthough that is still more than three times the Bank's 2% target, it has influenced the decision to pause the run of Bank rate rises. That decision was split, with five of the nine-member committee voting for a pause. \nPolicymakers will be keeping a close eye on the \"core inflation\" rate - a measure which strips out volatile factors such as food and energy. It was down from 6.9% in July to 6.2% in August.\nThe chances of rates actually starting to fall again look slim at the moment.\nAndrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, said: \"I can tell you that we have not had any discussion... about reducing rates, because that would be very, very premature. Our job is to get inflation down.\"\nAt one point, UK rates were expected to rise above 6%, but that peak is now expected to be lower, even if there is a rise at a later date. \nThe Bank has to balance the risk of damaging the economy, which has shown little sign of growth, with the need to slow price rises.\nIts Monetary Policy Committee meets eight times a year to decide rates.\nMortgages\nJust under a third of households have a mortgage, according to the government's English Housing Survey.\nWhen interest rates rise or fall, more than 1.4 million people on tracker and standard variable rate (SVR) deals usually see an immediate change in their monthly payments. \nDespite the pause in rises, compared with December 2021, those on a tracker mortgage are still paying £540 more a month, and those on an SVR are paying £299 more a month.\nAround three-quarters of mortgage customers hold fixed-rate deals. Lenders may now have some confidence to lower mortgage rates, although they are still much higher than much of the last 10 years.\nComparatively high interest rates mean house buyers and those remortgaging will have to pay a lot more than if they had taken out the same mortgage a year or more ago. \nAs people roll off cheap fixed-rate deals onto products with much higher rates, monthly repayments can soar by hundreds of pounds. Banking trade body UK Finance says there are about 800,000 fixed rate deals ending in the second half of 2023, and about 1.6 million deals expiring next year.\nThe IFS, a politically independent think tank, warns rising interest rates could mean 1.4 million mortgage holders see their disposable income fall by more than 20%.\nYou can see how your mortgage may be affected by using our calculator:\nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.\nAt this rate, your payments could change by…\n                            monthly change\nto\n                            monthly total\nThe information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.\nThis calculator does not constitute financial advice. It is based on a standard mortgage repayment formula based on the mortgage size and length and a fixed interest rate. It should be used as a guide only and does not represent the suitability, eligibility or availability of mortgage offers for users. For exact figures, users will need to approach an official mortgage lender.\nInterest rates fluctuate based on the Bank of England's base rate and market conditions.\nCredit cards and loans\nBank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. \nThe latest Bank statistics show that in July, the average annual interest rate was 21.7% on bank overdrafts and 20.76% on credit cards. The average rate for personal loans was 8.61%, up slightly on the previous month. \nLenders could decide to put prices up, if they expect higher interest rates in the future.\nSavings\nIndividual banks and building societies have been under pressure to pass on higher interest rate rises to customers. \nThere are some good deals on the market already, so analysts say that customers should shop around, as many will be on accounts paying little or nothing. \nThe UK's financial watchdog has warned that banks will face \"robust action\" if they offer unjustifiably low savings rates to their customers.\nAlthough many savings accounts are paying more, even the best interest rates aren't keeping up with inflation. \nThis means the value of cash savings - its buying power - is falling in real terms. \nInflation has been relatively high worldwide, after Covid restrictions eased and consumers spent more. \nMany firms experienced problems getting enough goods to sell. Oil and gas costs were also higher than they had been - a problem made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \nAlthough many elements of inflation are global, there are also domestic factors at play in the UK, including rising wages.\nInterest rates have been increasing across the world in recent months.\nThe UK has one of the highest rates in the G7 - a group of the world's seven largest so-called \"advanced\" economies.\nIt is higher than the Euro area and the US.\nWhy is UK inflation so high?\nIs this a banking crisis - how worried should I be?\nWhy does the Bank of England change interest rates?\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "How to save money even when the budget is tight", "date": "2023-09-23 23:19:37", "text": "Saving money may feel like a pipe dream when bills and the cost of essentials, such as food, are rising fast.\nBut financial experts say it is crucial to put some money aside for emergencies.\nAnd the interest being paid on some savings accounts now is better than anything seen for 15 years, so it will pay to spend some time putting your money in the correct place.\nThe benchmark interest rate set by the Bank of England has been rising consistently for nearly two years, and may now have peaked. The cost of living has also been going up, with prices rising at a rate still well above target.\nThat means two things for any money we have set aside. \nFirstly, the returns (or interest) being offered on savings accounts has improved, although borrowing is more expensive. For example, you may find an account paying 5% a year, so £1,000 saved for a year will earn £50 in interest. Save for lots of years, and that lump sum keeps building under what is known as compound interest.\nSecondly, the buying power of the money we do have saved is being diluted by rising prices.\nBank of England figures show that there is £268bn in non-interest paying accounts - which are primarily current accounts. \nExperts say that finding a good savings account for that money will help people benefit from those higher rates, and counter some of the downsides of rising prices.\nInvesting the money is another option, although that carries greater risks.\nHigh energy and food bills mean that, for many people, their money doesn't last until the end of the month. Finding anything to set aside is difficult.\nIf you have debts that need bringing under control, then that is widely considered to be the priority, ahead of any savings decisions.\nHowever, putting some money aside regularly into an emergency savings fund can help avoid serious debt. If your car breaks down, or the children's school shoes need replacing, then it is better to have money available than to borrow it.\nYou also might want to save throughout the year for Christmas or holidays.\nThe general advice is to spend some time going through your finances, then set a savings goal, and to start with saving a small, manageable amount on a regular basis.\nThe Building Societies Association, which runs UK Savings Week, has a guide about how to get started.\nThis is where it can get quite complicated. There are a wide range of savings products available, and your personal circumstances will determine which is best for you.\nThe most basic savings product is an easy-access account. They tend not to have the best interest rates, but you can withdraw your money whenever you like.\nSome accounts such as fixed-term accounts or bonds pay more in interest but your money is locked in for a certain period of time.\nAnyone starting out might consider regular saver accounts, some of which are sold alongside current accounts. Again you might not be able to access the money for a certain period of time and, by starting small, it may take time before any meaningful interest is built up.\nAlso, there are notice accounts, which require you to tell the provider in advance when you plan to withdraw money. Alternatively, you can forgo interest and instead enter a prize draw, such as with Premium Bonds.\nIf you don't have access to a bank account, then credit unions offer the opportunity to save. Savings scheme incentives provided by the government may encourage longer-term savings. particularly for children.\nThere are plenty more and, with such a variety, it is best to shop around. That shouldn't only be for the best interest rate but, perhaps more crucially, to find the account that best suits your needs.\nAnna Bowes, founder of the independent Savings Champion website, says some savers can suffer from \"choice paralysis\", so it might be best to set yourself a deadline when making a decision.\nHelpfully, every account now displays a summary box outlining its key features, which makes it a bit less time-consuming to compare between them.\nDefinitely not. Banks, building societies and other savings providers often advertise eye-catching headline interest rates. Sometimes those deals are only available for a few weeks. \nThe best interest rate may only last on a product for a year, after which it may revert to a much lower rate. So, being loyal may be more convenient, but won't necessarily pay the most. That is why it is best to review old accounts you may have set up years ago.\nIn fact, banks have come under heavy pressure from MPs and regulators to ensure that rates - particularly on easy-access accounts - reflect the wider market and are not just used to make excess profits.\nEvery basic and higher-rate taxpayer has a personal savings allowance, which means you don't pay tax on the first £1,000 of interest you earn from savings (or the first £500 if you're a higher-rate taxpayer).\nIndividual Savings Accounts, known as Isas, allow you to save up to £20,000 a year, and the interest is tax-free.\nLarge amounts held in savings can affect a claim for universal credit.\nIf a bank or building society goes bust, then the first £85,000 per person, per institution is safe and would be refunded.\nWhat no change in rates means for your money\nWhat is the state pension and the triple lock?\nFive tips when asking for a pay rise\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Debt: What should I pay first and what can I do?", "date": "2023-09-25 11:59:01", "text": "Another tough winter faces many people who have been struggling with the cost of living and may be seeing their debt demands rise.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates financial services, says that 11 million adults in the UK struggle to pay their bills - a rise of 3.1 million compared with last year.\nSo what can you do if you find yourself in difficulty?\nConsumer advice charity Citizens Advice says that you should work out how much you owe, who to, and how much you need to pay each month.\nIdentify your most urgent financial demands. There are what are known as priority debts and bills because there can be serious consequences if you do not pay them, such as losing your home or facing court proceedings. They should be paid first.\nThey include rent, mortgage repayments, and loans secured on the home, gas and electricity bills, child support and maintenance payments, council tax, income tax, VAT and other taxes, TV licence payments, court fines and payments.\nCalculate how much you can cover in debt repayments. Create a budget by adding up your essential living costs like food and housing, and take these away from any income such as your wage or benefits you receive.\nAfter than move on to looking at other debts, although failure to pay could still lead to the arrival of bailiffs. These are credit cards, store cards, buy-now-pay-later payments, overdrafts, unsecured loans and water bills. Ignoring them would still see the cost of those debts spiral.\nAlways see how you could boost your income, primarily by checking what benefits you are entitled to, and whether you are eligible for a council tax reduction or a lower tariff on your broadband or TV package.\nIt is important that you do talk about financial difficulties before finding yourself in a spiral of debt. The earlier, the better.\nIf you think you cannot pay your debts or are finding dealing with them overwhelming, seek support straight away. You are not alone and there is help available. A trained debt adviser can talk you through the options available.\nInformation and support is available and free of charge - click here to find out about organisations who may be able to help.\nYour supplier must give you a chance to clear your debt through a payment plan first.\nIf you don't agree a plan with your supplier, it has been the case that they might try to force you to have a prepayment meter installed, or they may switch your existing smart meter to prepayment mode.\nBut since it emerged that meters were being forcibly fitted into the homes of vulnerable people, companies are now required to pass certain tests before they can switch customers.\nA \"breathing space\" scheme in England and Wales shields people in problem debt from further interest and charges.\nPeople receiving debt advice can apply for the break, which lasts for up to 60 days, to prevent them falling into a spiral of debt.\nPeople receiving mental health crisis treatment can apply for a scheme which lasts for the length of that treatment, plus another 30 days.\nConsultation is under way for a similar scheme in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, an alternative short-term debt relief system is known as a Statutory Moratorium.\nFor some people, there is little or no chance of paying off debts, and so they may have to consider some form of personal insolvency.\nThis should only be done after seeking advice. There are different forms of insolvency which may be considered depending on your circumstances and where you live.\nBankruptcy: This is the most serious option, which involves an official receiver being appointed to sell off your assets to pay your debts. If you own a house or a car you may lose them. \nThe bankruptcy will affect your credit record for at least six years. But after one year all your debts will be written off. The procedure currently costs £680, but you can pay in instalments. \nIndividual Voluntary Arrangement: Under an IVA, an insolvency practitioner will help you strike a deal with your creditors, which allows you to pay off your debts over a fixed period - say five years. Once approved, all interest on unsecured debt is frozen. \nThere is less stigma with an IVA, and a greater chance of you keeping your home if you own one.\nDebt Relief Order: This form of insolvency, introduced in 2009, is the easiest of all. Your debts must not exceed £30,000. If your application is accepted, some debts will be frozen for one year, then written off. A DRO costs £90.\nInsolvency in Scotland: If you live in Scotland, bankruptcy is known legally as sequestration. However there are three alternatives: a Debt Arrangement Scheme, a Debt Management Plan, or a Trust Deed.\nEleven million Britons struggling to pay bills\nWhat can I do if I can't pay my energy bill?\nWhat is the energy cap and what's happening to bills?\nMillions have less than £100 saved as prices soar\nPeople in problem debt get 60-day break scheme\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Energy bills: What can I do if I can't afford to pay?", "date": "2023-09-27 13:22:44", "text": "Annual energy bills are falling in October, but prices remain much higher than in recent years.\nSome of those struggling to pay have been forced onto more expensive prepayment meters, prompting energy regulator Ofgem to strengthen rules to protect consumers. \nThe government launched its Energy Price Guarantee in October 2022. It replaced the previous Ofgem energy price cap, and limited a typical dual-fuel household's annual energy bill to £2,500. \nThis remained in place until the end of June 2023, when the Ofgem cap was reinstated, at which point a typical annual energy bill fell to £2,074.\nUnder the latest price cap, typical annual bills will fall to around £1,923 between October and December.\nIf you don't agree a payment plan with your supplier, they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed, or they may switch an existing smart meter to prepayment mode.\nIn very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection, but you'll normally be offered a meter first.\nIf you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either:\nSuppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this.\nMany suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments.\nPaying by direct debit is normally the cheapest way to pay for electricity and gas. Cancelling a direct debit means future bills are likely to be higher.\nNon-payment could also damage your credit rating, and make it harder to borrow money. \nThe regulator Ofgem reviewed the use of prepayment meters after an investigation by The Times found debt agents acting for British Gas wrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters. \nUnder new rules, suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter. They also have to conduct a \"site welfare visit\". \nIn addition meters cannot be fitted for:\nThose forced onto a prepayment meter will get £30 initial credit to reduce the risk of them losing supply.\nThe government has said prepayment energy charges will be cut, bringing them in line with direct debit rates.\nSuppliers have also been told to identify households where meters were wrongfully installed, return the customer to their previous tariff and offer compensation. \nCheck your direct debit\nYour monthly payment is based on your estimated energy use for the year, and your supplier may reduce your bill if its estimate is higher than the amount you actually use.\nYou can also request a flexible monthly direct debit where you only pay for your actual consumption. This requires a smart meter or regular readings.\nHowever, two-thirds of gas usage is during the winter months, so make sure you understand the impact of reducing payments during warmer weather. \nPay what you can\nIf the direct debit is fair, but you can't meet it, ask your supplier for an \"able to pay plan\" based on what you can afford. \nBy paying something every month - even if it's less than the amount due - your arrears grow more slowly, and your supplier may be less worried about your debt. \nYou may be able to get your name added to the Priority Services Register (PSR), a list of households entitled to extra support. \nThose eligible include pensioners, pregnant women, parents of young children, and people who are disabled. \nOfgem also recommends asking your supplier to add your name to the Network Operator Register, if you rely on your energy supply for medical reasons.\nIf you have different gas and electricity suppliers, you need to contact them both.\nBeing on the PSR doesn't cancel your arrears. But it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account. \nClaim any relevant benefits\nThe independent MoneyHelper website has a useful guide to available benefits, while Policy in Practice and the charities Entitledto and Turn2us run benefits calculators.\nYou may also be able to repay your debt directly from your benefits through the government's Fuel Direct scheme.\nA number of suppliers and charities also offer hardship grants. \nCheck you're getting extra government help\nThere is a range of government support to help with energy bills, available to households on means-tested benefits, pensioners and people on certain disability benefits.\nThe next payments for some eligible groups will be made between 31 October and 19 November.\nAdjust your boiler\nIf you have a combi boiler at home - you don't have a hot water cylinder and there is a (usually white) plastic pipe under the boiler - you may wish to consider turning down the heating flow temperature. \nOn the front - sometimes behind a flap - look for a dial or set of buttons with a radiator icon. Turn the dial to the number three, or the 12 o'clock position. If it has a digital display, select 60C. \nYou may also want to turn off the hot water pre-heat. Many boilers come on every few hours - night and day - to ensure there's always some hot water available. \nMost homes don't need this, and turning it off saves money. \nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Energy price cap: What is it and will bills continue to go down?", "date": "2023-09-29 11:21:27", "text": "Millions will see their energy bills fall from 1 October, after a drop in the price cap, which limits how much suppliers can charge households for each unit of gas and electricity they use.\nA typical dual-fuel household will pay £1,923 a year between October and December - down from £2,074 in the previous period.\nIn recent years, the cost of variable tariff energy deals in England, Wales and Scotland has been controlled by the energy price cap, which is now set every three months by Ofgem, the energy regulator. \nThe cap confirms the maximum price suppliers can charge households per unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff in normal circumstances. It covers 29 million households. \nEnergy prices soared after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, so in October ministers said household bills would be limited by a temporary government guarantee instead. \nUnder this, a typical household's annual gas and electricity bill stayed below £2,500 despite Ofgem's cap increasing above this level. \nThe Energy Price Guarantee finished in June 2023, and the Ofgem cap once again determines how much customers can be charged. \nFrom 1 October, typical bills will be £1,923, which is £151 less than the previous cap and £577 down on last winter.\nEnergy is regulated separately in Northern Ireland, where bills are slightly lower.\nThe calculations for a typical household are based on a direct debit customer using 12,000 kWh (kilowatt hours) of gas and 2,900 kWh of electricity a year. \nA kilowatt hour is a unit of energy used to calculate your bill. \nHowever, most households aren't typical. \nBills are based on how much energy you actually use, which depends on the number of people, the type of property and its energy efficiency.\nIn July 2023, Ofgem said \"around 4 million\" households had prepayment meters.\nIt reviewed their use after an investigation by The Times found debt agents acting for British Gas wrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters.\nUnder new rules, suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter, and they cannot be installed at all in certain households. \nThe government has promised to bring prepayment energy charges in line with those for direct debit customers, but this has not yet happened. \nBetween October and December, the typical bill for prepayment households will be £1,949, down from £2,077, but still £26 more than for direct debit customers.\nTypical bills for those who pay via cash, cheque or bank transfer, usually every three months, will be £129 more. \nIt is is impossible to tell for certain, not least because wholesale energy prices are affected by global issues, such as the war in Ukraine.\nHowever, energy consultancy Cornwall Insight forecasts that prices will rise again in January 2024. \nIt estimates that typical annual bills will rise to £1,996. \nThe consultancy does not expect energy prices to return to pre-Covid levels before the end of the decade.\nLower prices should restart competition in the market, as suppliers start to offer fixed deals to customers, which set gas and electricity prices for a certain period of time. \nUnlike variable tariffs, these are unaffected by the cap.\nConsumer groups and regulators say this could be good for consumers, but warn that such deals do not suit all circumstances.\nIf variable deals continue to fall in price, anyone already locked into a fixed deal would miss out on those savings. \nThose considering signing up for a fixed deal should also pay close attention to standing charges and exit fees, rather than just the headline rate.\nSome groups across the UK who may struggle to pay bills are receiving additional help through cost-of-living payments:\nVulnerable families can also claim help through the Household Support Fund, and - from October 2023 - the Warm Home Discount scheme. \nImportantly, the £400 discount which all households in England, Wales and Scotland received last winter has finished. \nUntil the end of March 2023, businesses had their costs limited under the government's Energy Bill Relief Scheme. \nUnder a new scheme running until March 2024, firms get a discount on wholesale prices, rather than costs being capped. \nHeavy energy-using sectors, like glass, ceramics and steelmakers, will get a larger discount than others.\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Webb telescope finds floating planet-like objects in Orion", "date": "2023-10-02 09:59:57", "text": "Jupiter-sized \"planets\" free-floating in space, unconnected to any star, have been spotted by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).\nWhat's intriguing about the discovery is that these objects appear to be moving in pairs. Astronomers are currently struggling to explain them.\nThe telescope observed about 40 pairs in a fabulously detailed new survey of the famous Orion Nebula.\nThey've been nicknamed Jupiter Mass Binary Objects, or \"JuMBOs\" for short.\nOne possibility is that these objects grew out of regions in the nebula where the density of material was insufficient to make fully fledged stars.\nAnother possibility is that they were made around stars and were then kicked out into interstellar space through various interactions. \n\"The ejection hypothesis is the favoured one at the moment,\" said Prof Mark McCaughrean.\n\"Gas physics suggests you shouldn't be able to make objects with the mass of Jupiter on their own, and we know single planets can get kicked out from star systems. But how do you kick out pairs of these things together? Right now, we don't have an answer. It's one for the theoreticians,\" the European Space Agency's (Esa) senior science adviser told BBC News.\nProf McCaughrean led the team that produced the new Orion survey.\nUsing JWST's remarkable resolution and infrared sensitivity, the astronomers have added substantially to the information already mined by older telescopes, including Webb's direct predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope.\nThe Orion Nebula, also known by its sky catalogue name of M42, is the nearest, large star-forming region to Earth.\nAlong with the quartet of bright suns at its centre called the Trapezium, this region of space is visible to the naked eye as a smudge on the sky.\nIf you don't know it, it can be found low down in the constellation of Orion, which is named after a mythical Greek hunter. The nebula forms part of the hunter's \"sword\", hanging from his \"belt\".\nThe new JWST image is actually a mosaic of 700 views acquired by Webb's NIRCam instrument over a week of observations.\nTo give a sense of scale, it would take a spaceship travelling at light speed a little over four years to traverse the entire scene. The nebula itself is about 1,400 light-years from Earth.\nTucked away in this vista are thousands of young stars, spanning a range of masses from 40 down to less than 0.1 times the mass of our Sun.\nMany of these stars are surrounded by dense discs of gas and dust which may be forming planets, although in some cases, these discs are being destroyed by the intense ultraviolet radiation and strong winds from the most massive stars in the region, in particular from the Trapezium.\nYour device may not support this visualisation\nThe slider tool on this page shows the same nebula scene at shorter and at longer wavelengths. Using different filters in this way emphasises items of interest.\nLook at the longer wavelength version to examine the sculpted green clouds of gas that contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. PAHs are ubiquitous compounds in space produced by stars. \nLook also at the many-fingered red feature that dominates the background.\nKnown as the Orion Molecular Cloud 1 outflow, this is a mass of molecular hydrogen that has been shocked by the the immense energy streaming away from the site of a cataclysmic collision of two giant stars. The speed of the outflow at more than 100km/s indicates the star merger occurred just a few hundred years previously. \nNotice the fingertips are tinged with green - a marker for gaseous iron.\nThere is so much to peruse and probe in the full-sized survey image which is 21,000 by 14,500 pixels. But it is the JuMBOs that have caught the immediate attention of astronomers.\n\"My reactions ranged from: 'Whaaat?!?' to 'Are you sure?\" to 'That's just so weird!' to 'How could binaries be ejected together?'\" recalled Dr Heidi Hammel who was not on the survey team.  \nShe said there were no models of planetary system formation that predicted the ejection of binary pairs of planets.\n\"But... maybe all star formation regions host these double-Jupiters (and maybe even double-Neptunes and double Earths!), and we just haven't had a telescope powerful enough to see them before,\" the multidisciplinary scientist on JWST told BBC News.\nEsa will be posting the full image of M42 on its EsaSky portal which allows anyone to explore publicly available astronomical data.

{"title": "What days this week are trains and Tube disrupted by strikes?", "date": "2023-10-02 10:32:41", "text": "Train drivers are to take more industrial action in a long-running dispute about pay and conditions.\nBoth the train drivers' union Aslef and the RMT union, which represents other rail workers, have regularly taken industrial action over the past 18 months.\nLondon's Tube network is also set for disruption as station staff prepare to strike.\nAslef members are set to strike on Wednesday 4 October. \nThe union also started an overtime ban for drivers on Monday 2 October, which will run to Friday 6 October.\nMany of the affected operators will run no services at all on strike days. \nTravelling on the day before or after strike days might also be affected. \nOn overtime ban days, there are likely to be some last-minute cancellations or timetable reductions.\nPassengers are advised to check before they travel.\nThousands of RMT members who work in London Underground stations will strike on Wednesday 4 October and Friday 6 October, in a long-running dispute over job losses.\nThe RMT says the action will shut down the capital's Tube service.\nTransport for London has warned that services the following mornings will also be affected.\nElizabeth line, London Overground, DLR and tram services are not affected.\nWorkers at 16 train companies are taking part:\nFor the latest information, passengers should check National Rail or individual operators' websites.\nPassengers with advance tickets can be refunded fee-free if the train that they are booked on is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled.  \nIf passengers have a return ticket they may also be entitled to a fee-free refund if any part of the journey is cancelled due to strikes.\nSeason ticket holders (flexi, monthly or longer) who cannot travel can claim 100% compensation for strike dates through the Delay Repay scheme.\nUnions say they want a pay offer reflecting the rising cost of living.\nBut the rail industry is under pressure to save money, after the pandemic left a hole in its finances. \nThe industry says changes to ways of working need to be agreed in order for pay to go up.\nThe average salary of rail workers in 2022 was £45,919, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). \nIf drivers are excluded (because they tend to be members of the Aslef union, not RMT) its estimate is £39,518. However, the RMT union said that figure was too high because it does not include rail cleaning staff.\nThe ONS says median pay for \"train and tram drivers\" is just under £59,000.\nThe Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train companies, made an offer that would have seen rail workers receive a backdated pay rise of 5% for 2022. It would then negotiate reforms ahead of a second year's pay rise with individual operators.\nOn 5 May, RMT members voted to extend the strike mandate for another six months.  \nThe Aslef union rejected a two-year offer which would see drivers get a backdated pay rise of 4% for 2022 and a 4% increase this year.\nAslef general secretary Mick Whelan has said it had been forced into taking industrial action because the train companies \"refuse to sit down and talk to us and have not made a fair and sensible pay offer\".\nA Department for Transport has said: \"The government has met the rail unions, listened to them and facilitated improved offers on pay and reform.\"\nSeparately, a revised offer from Network Rail was accepted by RMT members on 20 March, ending a dispute with signal workers and maintenance staff.\nThe union said the offer amounted to an uplift on salaries of between 14.4% for the lowest paid grades to 9.2% for the highest paid. \nUnions are obliged to give at least 14 days' notice of any strike action. \nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Malaria vaccine big advance against major child killer", "date": "2023-10-02 14:40:58", "text": "A cheap malaria vaccine that can be produced on a massive scale has been recommended for use by the World Health Organization (WHO). \nThe vaccine has been developed by the University of Oxford and is only the second malaria vaccine to be developed. \nMalaria kills mostly babies and infants, and has been one of the biggest scourges on humanity.\nThere are already agreements in place to manufacture more than 100 million doses a year.\nIt has taken more than a century of scientific effort to develop effective vaccines against malaria. \nThe disease is caused by a complex parasite, which is spread by the bite of blood-sucking mosquitoes. It is far more sophisticated than a virus as it hides from our immune system by constantly shape-shifting inside the human body. \nThat makes it hard to build up immunity naturally through catching malaria, and difficult to develop a vaccine against it.\nIt is almost two years to the day since the first vaccine - called RTS,S and developed by GSK - was backed by the WHO. \nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said it was a moment of \"great pleasure\".\n\"I used to dream of the day we would have a safe and effective vaccine against malaria, now we have two,\" he said.\nThe WHO said the effectiveness of the two vaccines was \"very similar\" and there was no evidence one was better than the other. \nHowever, the key difference is the ability to manufacture the University of Oxford vaccine - called R21 - at scale. \nThe world's largest vaccine manufacturer - the Serum Institute of India - is already lined up to make more than 100 million doses a year and plans to scale up to 200 million doses a year.\nSo far there are only 18 million doses of RTS,S. \nThe WHO said the new R21 vaccine would be a \"vital additional tool\". Each dose costs $2-4 (£1.65 to £3.30) and four doses are needed per person. That is about half the price of RTS,S.\nThe two vaccines use similar technologies and target the same stage of the malaria parasite's lifecycle. However, the newer vaccine is easier to manufacture as it requires a smaller dose and uses a simpler adjuvant (a chemical given in the vaccine that jolts the immune system into action).\nIn 2021, there were 247 million cases of malaria and 619,000 people died, most of them children under the age of five. More than 95% of malaria is found in Africa. \nDr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa, said: \"This second vaccine holds real potential to close the huge demand-and-supply gap. \n\"Delivered to scale and rolled out widely, the two vaccines can help bolster malaria prevention, control efforts and save hundreds of thousands of young lives.\"\nData that has been published online, but has not been through the usual process of scientific review, shows the R21 vaccine is 75% effective at preventing the disease in areas where malaria is a seasonal.\nThe WHO's strategic advisory group of experts said that figure was comparable to the first vaccine (RTS,S) in seasonal areas.\nThe effectiveness of malaria vaccines is lower in areas where the parasite is present all year round. \nProf Sir Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute in Oxford where R21 was developed, said: \"The vaccine is easily deployable, cost effective and affordable, ready for distribution in areas where it is needed most, with the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives a year.\"\nGareth Jenkins, from Malaria No More UK, said: \"The reality is that malaria financing globally is far from where it needs to be and annual deaths from malaria rose during the pandemic and are still above pre-pandemic levels, so we cannot afford to be complacent as new tools are developed.\"\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\nMalaria vaccine is world-changing, say scientists\nGhana first to approve 'world-changer' malaria vaccine\nChance discovery helps fight against malaria\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Abercrombie & Fitch ex-CEO accused of exploiting men for sex", "date": "2023-10-02 16:00:17", "text": "The ex-CEO of Abercrombie & Fitch and his British partner face allegations of exploitation from men recruited for sex events they hosted around the world.\nA BBC investigation found a highly organised network used a middleman to find young men for the events with Mike Jeffries and Matthew Smith.\nEight men told the BBC they attended these events, some of whom alleged they were exploited or abused.\nMr Jeffries and Mr Smith did not respond to requests for comment.\nBut the couple's middleman denied any wrongdoing and said men went into these events \"with their eyes wide open\".\nAbercrombie & Fitch (A&F) - which also owns the Hollister brand - said it was \"appalled and disgusted\" by the alleged behaviour.  \nTwo former US prosecutors who independently reviewed documents and testimony uncovered by the BBC have called for an investigation to determine whether charges for sex trafficking could be brought. Under US law, sex trafficking includes getting an adult to travel to another state or country to have sex for money by using force, fraud or coercion.\nWarning: This story contains descriptions of sexual acts\nOver two decades from the 1990s, Mike Jeffries transformed A&F from a failing heritage outfitter into a multi-billion-dollar teen retailer by selling sex appeal, with preppy all-American shirtless male store models and provocative billboards.\nOnce one of America's highest-paid CEOs, he was a controversial figure who faced claims of discrimination against staff, concerns about his lavish expenses and complaints about the unofficial influence of his life partner, Matthew Smith, inside A&F.\nIn 2014, Mr Jeffries stepped down following declining sales and left with a retirement package valued at around $25m (£20.5m), according to company filings at the time. \nThe BBC has now uncovered allegations that the fashion mogul exploited young adult men for sex at events he hosted in his New York residences and luxurious hotels around the world, including in London, Paris, Venice, and Marrakesh.\nAs part of a two-year investigation, the BBC has spoken to 12 men who described attending or organising events involving sex acts run for Mr Jeffries, 79, and his British partner Mr Smith, 60, between 2009 and 2015.\nThe eight men who attended the events said they were recruited by a middleman, who they described as having a missing nose covered with a snakeskin patch. The BBC has identified him as James Jacobson.\nWatch Panorama's The Abercrombie Guys: The Dark Side of Cool, on BBC iPlayer now and on BBC One on Monday at 21:00 BST.\nListen to the podcast series, World of Secrets: Season 1 - The Abercrombie Guys, available on BBC Sounds from 21:00 BST.\nThe Abercrombie Guys: the Dark Side of Cool will be releasing in the US on October 6 on BBC Select, available to audiences via Amazon Prime Video Channels, the Apple TV app and The Roku Channel.\nThe BBC carried out extensive fact-checking of the men's testimonies, which bore a striking number of similarities.\nWe obtained documents - including emails, flight tickets and detailed travel itineraries - that supported key points of the men's accounts. We also interviewed dozens of other sources, including former household staff.\nHalf the men who told the BBC about their recruitment alleged they had been initially misled about the nature of the events or not told sex was involved. Others said they understood the events would be sexual, but not exactly what was expected of them. All were paid.\nSeveral told the BBC the middleman or other recruiters raised the possibility of modelling opportunities with A&F. All except one said they felt harmed by the experience.\nDavid Bradberry, then 23, said he was introduced in 2010 to Mr Jacobson by an agent who described him as the gatekeeper to \"the owners\" of A&F, but said there was no mention of sex. At their meeting, he said Mr Jacobson suggested Bruce Weber - then A&F's official photographer - should take his picture. \nThen, Mr Bradberry said, \"Jim made it clear to me that unless I let him perform oral sex on me, that I would not be meeting with Abercrombie & Fitch or Mike Jeffries.\"\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Signing an NDA \"felt like intimidation\" - David Bradberry\n\"I was paralysed,\" he said. \"It was like he was selling fame. And the price was compliance.\" Mr Bradberry said he had been made to believe \"this is where everybody gets their start\". He recalled that Mr Jacobson gave him $500 and told him it was for his time.\nLooking back, he said this incident should have been \"a red flag\" but he thought Mr Jacobson \"was just a creepy old dude that I wouldn't have to see again\". \nMr Bradberry accepted an invitation to a daytime event at Mr Jeffries' former home in the Hamptons on New York's Long Island - recently sold for $29m. He said he understood Mike Jeffries was a \"powerful man\" who could \"make his career\". Ahead of the event, he said Jim told him to buy an outfit with some A&F gift cards, which he said made it feel \"legitimate\" and \"official\".\nAt the Hamptons, Mr Bradberry said he spoke to Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith about his aspirations to be an A&F model. Later, he said, Mr Jeffries held \"poppers\" under his nose - a drug which can cause a strong head-rush and disorientation - and later had sex with him.\nMen who attended these events told the BBC Mike Jeffries and Matthew Smith would engage in sexual activity with about four men or \"direct\" them to have sex with each other. Afterwards, the men said staff at the event handed them envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in cash.\nMr Bradberry said the \"secluded\" location and presence of Mr Jeffries' personal staff, dressed in A&F uniforms, supervising events meant he \"didn't feel safe to say 'no' or 'I don't feel comfortable with this'\".\nThe BBC investigation also uncovered details of the \"well-oiled machine\" organising sex events for Mr Jeffries, in which:\nDomestic staff who worked in Mr Jeffries' former Hamptons home told the BBC events were held there regularly at weekends. Some said they were instructed to leave the premises every Saturday afternoon for several years, leading them to believe something strange was taking place. One former staffer said he understood it was because his boss was having \"playtime\".\nBarrett Pall, a former model turned life coach and activist, said he felt pressured into attending an event in the Hamptons in 2011. Then 22, he said he was recruited by an older model, who received a referral fee, to be his \"replacement\" for \"some sort of sexual experience\" with the couple. \nHe said he felt obliged to comply as the older man had been supporting him financially and he felt indebted. Like the other men, he said initially he attended a \"test run\" with Mr Jacobson.\nMr Pall said the older model told him that \"you don't have to do anything you don't want to do\" but suggested that \"the further you go, the better\", and alluded to career opportunities. When he arrived at the event, he said he felt under pressure to \"perform\". \"How was I going to leave? I didn't have a car,\" he said. \"I had a chaperone sitting and watching me.\"\nMr Pall said one of the other men recruited for the event performed oral sex on him as Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith watched. He said the couple then encouraged him to come over to the bed and kiss Mr Jeffries. Later, two other men recruited for the event had sex with the A&F boss and his partner, he added. At one point, Mr Pall said Mr Jeffries was behind him, groping him.\n\"This experience, I think it broke me,\" he said. \"I think that this stole any ounce of innocence that I had left. It mentally messed me up. But with the language I now have today, I can sit here and tell you that I was taken advantage of.\"\nThe largest event described to the BBC was hosted in a private villa at a five-star hotel in 2011, for which dozens of men were flown to Marrakesh. The BBC understands Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith had also invited friends. Alex - who asked for his name to be changed to protect his identity - said he was a struggling model supporting his family back home when he was recruited as a dancer for the event, where he expected he would have to strip. \nMr Jeffries \"took advantage of people in a very vulnerable point in their life, especially when they're around these big cities, coming from small America,\" Alex said. The former CEO was the \"kingpin\", he said. \"If it wasn't for him none of this would have existed.\"\nAlex, a straight man then in his 20s, said he was auditioned by Mr Jacobson, who praised his dancing but demanded he \"finish the job\" by performing oral sex on him. \"I had debt, I wanted to support my family,\" said Alex. \"I performed the job and I was, like, disgusted.\"\nThinking \"the hardest part was out of the way\", Alex flew to Marrakesh for the event a few weeks later. But moments into his dance, he said, Mr Jeffries tried to kiss him. \"I was trying to be in it without offending him. I was extremely uncomfortable,\" Alex said.\nEventually, he said he went to hide in a back room where he fell asleep. Alex said he woke up with a condom inside him and feared that the champagne he had been given earlier had been spiked. \n\"When I put things together, I believe there is a very good possibility I was drugged and raped. I'll probably never, never know for sure the answer of what happened,\" he said.\nSome of the men, including Alex and Mr Bradberry, said they attended more than one event, having been convinced by Mr Jacobson that the next time would be easier or hoping they would eventually be offered modelling work so \"it all meant something\".\nThese events \"directly affected my self-esteem\", said Mr Bradberry. \"My twenties were filled with anguish and struggle, anxiety, depression.\" But he said he now lives a quieter life, \"full of hope\".\nBrad Edwards, a civil lawyer who examined the BBC's evidence, said US prosecutors should investigate whether what these \"brave men\" describe could be sex trafficking. \nMr Edwards said: \"There may have been evidence of coercion for some of the men, whereas others might not have felt the coercive tactics. \n\"Remember, coercion is the reasonable belief that serious harm will be inflicted - and serious harm could be reputational harm, financial harm, physical harm.\" \nMr Edwards also said Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith might argue the men were consenting adults and the fact that some had engaged in commercial sex in the past was \"a factor\", although he said past actions were \"really irrelevant\" to whether a particular commercial sex act was due to force, fraud or coercion. \nHe said there was a \"very high\" burden of proof for prosecutors, however.\n\"Given the stories of these brave men that have come forward, I think it's very important that federal prosecutors look into this case,\" he said.\nElizabeth Geddes, who was a federal prosecutor for more than 15 years and also reviewed our findings, said: \"There's certainly an argument that these young men were subjected to potential coercion. I think there are grounds for a prosecutor to open an investigation and look closely at this conduct to determine if a criminal prosecution is warranted.\"\nMr Jacobson - the middleman, now aged 70 - said in a statement through his lawyer that he took offence at the suggestion of \"any coercive, deceptive or forceful behaviour on my part\" and had \"no knowledge of any such conduct by others\".\nHe said he did not recall making promises of modelling opportunities. \"Any encounter I had was fully consensual, not coercive,\" he said. \"Everyone I came into contact with who attended these events went in with their eyes wide open.\"\nThe BBC made repeated attempts by letter, email and phone, over several weeks, to contact Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith, inviting them to respond to a detailed list of allegations to ensure they were fully aware of the claims against them. They have not responded.\nA&F, which has said it considers Mr Jeffries its modern-day founder, told the BBC it was \"appalled and disgusted\" by his alleged behaviour. It said new leadership has transformed the company into \"the values-driven organisation we are today\" and it has \"zero tolerance for abuse, harassment or discrimination of any kind\".\nYou can follow Rianna on X, formerly Twitter\nDo you have information about this story that you want to share?

{"title": "Bradley Lowery: Man pleads guilty to taunting fans", "date": "2023-10-02 19:18:54", "text": "A Sheffield Wednesday fan who used a photo of Bradley Lowery to taunt opposition supporters has admitted a public order offence.\nDale Houghton, 31, was pictured laughing as he brandished the image of the six-year-old during a match against Sunderland - the team Bradley supported before he died of cancer in 2017.\nHe pleaded guilty at Sheffield Magistrates' Court on Monday.\nDistrict judge James Gould described his actions as \"utterly deplorable\".\nHoughton, of Black Carr Road, Rotherham, was released on bail ahead of a sentencing hearing on 17 November.\nThe judge said all sentencing options were open, including a prison term.\nHoughton was charged after pictures circulated on X, formerly Twitter, showing two men laughing at Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium on Friday, as the defendant held up a photo of Bradley on his phone.\nDuring a police interview Houghton described his behaviour as \"enjoyable banter\" and said he had \"found it funny,\" prosecutor Jade Scott told the court.\nBradley's mother Gemma Lowery, who saw the picture of Houghton on Facebook the day after the match, said his actions were \"unforgivable\" and \"disrespectful\" not only to her son but also other children suffering from cancer.\nIn a handwritten statement read out in court, she said: \"This image has made me feel so many emotions, I find it hard to put into words.\"\nShe added she had \"nothing but loving memories\" of her son and felt \"upset\" that his image had been used \"in order to get a reaction\".\nBradley, of Blackhall Colliery, County Durham, was diagnosed with neuroblastoma - a rare type of cancer - when he was 18 months old.\nHe went on to be the club's mascot and became \"best mates\" with his hero, striker Jermain Defoe, before his death.\nConstance Coombs, Houghton's solicitor, said the defendant was \"disgusted by what he did\" and was \"very remorseful\".\nShe said Houghton accepted he had \"gone too far\" during \"mutual goading\" between the two sets of football fans and had searched for the image of Bradley after \"being shown a Sheffield United badge\" by Sunderland supporters.\nMs Coombs told the court Houghton's behaviour had caused \"considerable uproar\" and led to him losing his job as a window-fitter.\nShe said his \"totally unacceptable\" actions were \"out of character\" and may have been influenced by alcohol.\nJudge Gould told Houghton his actions were \"utterly deplorable\" and the photo posted online showed him \"plainly revelling in what he did\".\nHoughton, who admitted one count of intentionally causing harassment, alarm or distress, also faces a football banning order when he is sentenced next month.\nHe left the court by a back door with security staff helping him to get into a waiting car as he concealed his face.\nHoughton's bail conditions stipulate he must not attend any football matches or come within a mile of Hillsborough on match day.\nSheffield Wednesday's chief operating officer Liam Dooley condemned Houghton's \"utterly deplorable behaviour\" which he said \"in no way represents the values of the club\".\nMore than £18,000 has been donated to an appeal set up by Owls fans after Friday's match to raise money for a charity founded in Bradley's name.\nThe Bradley Lowery Foundation, set up by his parents, said the money raised would help to build a holiday home in Scarborough \"for sick children to be able to go and make memories\".\nIn an interview with BBC Radio Tees, Bradley's mother said the support was \"overwhelming\".\n\"Times are tight and all charities are struggling at the moment, so the fact that people are donating these funds to put a positive spin on the situation is just incredible,\" Ms Lowery added.\nShe said Houghton's actions had been \"really upsetting for myself and my husband\".\n\"We don't ever want to see Bradley's image portrayed in such a negative, awful light,\" she added.\n\"It has really hit us hard.\"\nLeanne Wood, from Sheffield Wednesday Women's Supporters' Group, said she set up the fundraising page in response to being \"absolutely disgusted\" by Houghton's actions. \nShe added: \"Wednesday fans actually have hearts of gold.\" \nFollow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

{"title": "Marriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples", "date": "2023-10-02 21:07:33", "text": "When Aki and Hikari were looking to rent a house together in Tokyo, they were told by real estate agents that the places they liked \"were for couples\". \n\"We are a couple,\" they would respond. The answer they were given: \"This is a house for a man and woman couple.\"    \nThe women, both in their 30s, have been together for seven years - now they are mothers to a baby. They coo and fuss over the infant, swap feeding and nappy-changing duties, and take turns to stay with him so one of them can get some sleep. They can't stop talking about their new baby formula machine.  \nYet, in the eyes of the law, the government and a conservative Japanese society, they're not a legitimate couple. Despite the support around them, they have kept their relationship a secret from many people. It's why they don't want to reveal their real names. They say they are being extra-cautious for their son given that taboos around same-sex couples still persist.\n\"We're not recognised as a family of three,\" Aki says.   \nJapan is the only G7 country not to fully recognise same-sex couples or offer them clear legal protection, leaving the country's LGBTQ+ community feeling vulnerable and nearly invisible.  We've changed Aki and Hikari's names to protect their identities.\nPressure has been growing to legalise same-sex unions after several district courts ruled that a ban on them was unconstitutional. But Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has struggled to pass reforms in the face of opposition from traditionally-minded political leadership.\nThere has been some progress in a nod to younger, louder voices demanding change. Some municipalities have introduced partnership certificates, but they are not legally binding. A new government post that mainly focuses on LGBTQ+ rights has been created, and a new law targets discrimination against sexual minorities. \nBut the community is disappointed because the law, which met stiff opposition from conservative lawmakers, stops well short of recognising marriage equality. \nActivists were also infuriated because of language in the bill which said that in taking measures to \"promote understanding\" of sexual minorities, \"all citizens can live with peace of mind\". \nIt drew angry reactions from critics who say it prioritised the rights of the majority, and implied that the existence of the LGBTQ+ community could be a threat to others' peace of mind.  \n\"There are already many politicians that want to use this law as a deterrent to restrict education and activities at schools and companies - so I'm very afraid of those intentions,\" says Akira Nishiyama, deputy secretary general of the Japan Alliance for LGBT Legislation.\nSame-sex couples like Aki and Hikari say the lack of legal recognition is far from an abstract concern - it makes life harder for them every day.\nOne of the things they are struggling to get used to, for instance, is the fact that only Aki, who gave birth, has parental rights. \"When I gave birth, I wrote a will to appoint my partner as our son's legal guardian in case I died during labour. And even that didn't guarantee her custody,\" Aki says. \nIf one of them is hospitalised, the other has no legal right to fill paperwork or sign consent forms on her partner's behalf. Many couples cannot get a joint mortgage to buy a house. And if one partner dies, the other has no right to inherit. \nThey could apply for special permissions to circumvent each of these circumstances, but the decision depends on the discretion of officials. \nIt was parenthood that encouraged Hikari and Aki to come out to their families and their close circle of friends, and to consider marriage.  \nThey wanted their son to be able to explain his mothers' relationship when he grows up. They knew they couldn't get married in Japan, but they filled out a marriage application anyway. \nWhen their application was rejected in Japan, they got married in Canada where Hikari went to university.  \n\"We wanted to show we exist,\" Aki says. But in Japan, she says she and Hikari feel like they are being made invisible.\n\"I grew up in a small, conservative town,\" Aki says. \"I knew I was gay from a young age and felt strongly that I had to fix it. I lived in hiding… I've given up so much. I don't want to do this anymore.\"\nThere is room for progress, Ms Nishiyama says, but those in power are strongly resistant to change: \"Conservative politicians who want to protect the idea of traditional family… or the patriarchy.\"\n\"I have been actively working for the protection of LGBTQ+ people for almost 10 years - that's why I'm really frustrated because I feel that I need to really fight and I need to work hard every single day. I could live in other countries where LGBTQ+ people's rights are protected by law, but I have not chosen that path yet because I want to change Japanese society and I want to protect my own rights.\" \nShe says she will never stop fighting, but she is also exhausted and disheartened by the meagre progress.\nOlder gay couples are more hopeful. Keitaro and Hideki met at a ballet class more than a year ago and have been inseparable since then.  \nThey were excited to get a partnership certificate. Even though it gives them no legal protection, they see it as a symbol of their union.  \"A true bond is beyond legal marriage.  If you find one, it matters less how society labels it,\" Keitaro said. \nNow in his early 40s, Keitaro came out when he was a teenager and has since lived openly as a gay man. \nHideki, who's 10 years older, has not come out to his family. He lives in a conservative rural area near Tokyo and commutes regularly to see his partner - he doesn't want to shock his 90-year-old mother whom he takes care of often. \n\"I think that discrimination is still very strong in Japan, as is the environment that surrounds me,\" Hideki says.\n\"I wish that more people would not have to live a double life,\" Keitaro says. \"I think [legal protection] matters, if there's recognition... and less prejudice people will feel safe to come out.\"   \nAnd that's what Aki and Hikari want too - they are hopeful that one day they'll be legally married in Japan and their son will be at their wedding.  \nThey worry for their child and wonder how he will navigate school and society. Aki says that's why she wants more not just for her family, but for others like them.  \n\"Our wish is to have a society which is easier to live in for children of same-sex parents,\" she says. \"We want LGBTQ people to be protected, now and in the future. It is not right that we keep hiding ourselves.\"  \nGay couples sue Japan over marriage rights\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Shavkat Mirziyoyev: Why is reformist Uzbek leader arresting bloggers?", "date": "2023-10-02 21:10:32", "text": "Olimjon Haydarov was detained and taken into custody in Uzbekistan's eastern city of Kokand in July, after being charged with extortion. \nThe YouTuber, whose videos focus on various social and economic issues, was charged with taking money from managers of a shopping centre by threatening to write an article exposing safety breaches at the facility. \nThe regional police department said that he had been caught red-handed while taking a bribe from the victims.\nUzbekistan refers to both bloggers and citizen journalists as bloggers.\nMr Haydarov faces a jail term of up to 10 years if found guilty. \nAnd he is not the only blogger being held. \nAbduqodir Mominov was detained on 8 February, also charged with extortion. He was convicted on 4 August and sentenced to seven years in prison.\nAnd in January this year, Khurshid Daliyev, the founder of the popular news outlet Human.uz, its chief editor Muslim Mirzajonov and several other journalists were detained after an office raid. \nUzbekistan's State Security Service, which is their national intelligence agency, later said that employees of the website were charged with blackmail and extortion. Their trials are being held in secret. \nCritics say these crackdowns have damaged Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyev's image as a reformer. \nSince coming into power, he has made significant headways in curbing child and forced labour, opening up the economy to foreign investment. \nBut his promise to bring in an era of free speech is in doubt. \nMr Mirziyoyev came into power in 2016, with an election campaign that relied heavily on both bloggers and social media. \nOn his campaign trail, he was constantly accompanied by a large group of bloggers. \nAt the beginning of his rule he endorsed a bolder, freer media.\nBut as the 66-year-old sets out on his third term in office, the recent string of arrests have stirred concerns. \nA number of Uzbek political commentators, writers and journalists have spoken in defence of Haydarov and others.\nEx-MP and public activist Rasul Kusherbayev said that he knew Haydarov personally and did not believe the charges against him. \n\"The criminal allegations against Olimjon are simply a hypothesis of a law enforcement body. Only time will show what actually happened, that is if we survive until that time comes and transparency is still there,\" Kusharbayev said.\n\"Activists are worried about various charges being brought against such individuals who actively use their right to free speech. Democracy cannot exist without this stratum of people who exercise freedom of speech and thought.\"\nOver the last few years, civil journalists have played a crucial role in Uzbekistan in pushing the boundaries of the limited media freedoms allowed by President Mirziyoyev's government.\nThough authorities did keep tabs on outspoken bloggers and arrested several social media figures - this was not widely perceived as a full-fledged crackdown on media freedoms, with many civil journalists continuing to voice the hope that those would be isolated cases.\nSocial media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Telegram also became focal points where Uzbeks were able to freely discuss and criticise policies. \nThis allowed bloggers like Haydarov to lead the public debate on thorny issues like corruption and nepotism in government bodies. Civil journalists, many of whom are also influencers, activists and political scientists, gained large followings.\nBut the latest arrests seem to have brought the realisation that authorities are truly on course to curb free speech.\nCivil journalists have been increasingly vocal of late about the president's failure to honour his promises, the stagnating economic reforms as well as growing oligarchy and nepotism. \nProminent political analyst Kamoliddin Rabbimov suggests that Haydarov's arrest is the latest \"alarming signal\" for civil society, warning that the arrests could prove a costly mistake and ruin Uzbekistan's efforts to improve its international image. \n\"In our country, where legal statehood has not yet been established and political pluralism has not been formed, it is possible to easily prove accusations against any blogger or journalist. But on the other hand, there is such a factor as the internal and external reputation of countries in the world,\" Mr Rabbimov said in an article posted on Kun.uz. \nMr Rabbimov believes that the Uzbek law-enforcement system had started sliding back into its Soviet past, with the security services now using the same methods as the Soviet KGB. \n\"We remember that we lived in a country where the NKVD [Soviet Union's secret police] and the KGB repressed the people… The spirit of the NKVD is alive. And attempts to revive it are very strong. If this institution gets restored, no one will be spared.\"\nUzbekistan media guide\nUzbekistan country profile\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Uttar Pradesh: Indian schoolgirl’s cycling death lays bare ugly face of ‘Eve-teasing’", "date": "2023-10-02 21:12:31", "text": "The tragic death of an Indian schoolgirl has laid bare the consequences of \"Eve-teasing\" - a popular South Asian euphemism which many say trivialises the street harassment and assault of women.\nThe short CCTV video of two Indian girls riding bicycles starts off quite innocuously. \nDressed in their school uniform - tunics, salwar bottoms and scarves - the teenagers are riding side by side on a near-empty road.\nBut within seconds, the calm of the scene is shattered. \nTwo men on a motorbike overtake them and one of them pulls away the scarf of one of the girls. Immediately she loses her balance and her cycle moves right and collides with a second motorbike coming from behind. \nAs she and the riders fall on the road, the 17-year-old is run over by a third motorbike coming from the opposite direction.\n\"The moment I saw my daughter, I knew she was dead,\" says her father Sabhajit Varma, who arrived at the scene within minutes after receiving a call from his niece - the other girl in the CCTV footage.\n\"Some people had gathered and we loaded her onto a tempo [a small vehicle used to transport goods] and rushed to a hospital,\" he told me on the phone from his home. \n\"Doctors said she was 'brought dead'. They said her jaw was shattered and she had died from severe injuries to her head,\" he said. \"There were no last words, no goodbyes.\"\nMr Varma's wife died eight years ago and after his two older daughters were married, the 17-year-old, the youngest of three, was the only one living with him. She was good at studies and wanted to be a doctor, he tells me. \nTwo days before her death, he said, she'd told him that some boys had been harassing her and other girls outside their school. Since then, his niece and other students have also told police that the young men used to hover around their school morning and evening, sometimes racing their bikes.\nHis daughter's death has left Mr Varma heartbroken and angry. \"My daughter was murdered. The men who killed her must be hanged,\" he says. \nThe incident took place last month in Ambedkar Nagar district of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. \nPolice have arrested three suspects - reports say at least one of them is a minor - and are looking for a fourth man. Since the tragedy, Mr Varma says, he's been visited by government officials, including a minister in the state, but not received any compensation.  \nAfter the footage of the incident went viral on social media and made headline news, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath warned those who harassed women on the streets that \"Yamraj [the Hindu god of death] would be waiting for them at the next traffic crossing\". \nAnd within hours, police said they had shot and injured two of the suspects in their legs \"as they tried to snatch our weapons and run away while being taken for their medical examination\". The third man, they added, had fractured his leg trying to run.\nThe families of those arrested have denied that their sons were involved in the crime - they insist that their boys are not those seen in the viral CCTV footage and accuse the police of shooting and injuring them in staged encounters. Police, however, say they have fast-tracked the case and expect a judgement in a month.\nThe tragic death of the schoolgirl has put the spotlight on the issue of sexual harassment of women in public places - with some women's rights activists also questioning the use of the phrase \"Eve teasing\" by the local press to describe the case. \nThe term, they say, is \"deeply problematic\" and point out that recently, the Supreme Court also flagged it, saying it should be replaced with \"street sexual harassment\" in courts.\nKalpana Viswanath, co-founder of Safetipin, a social organisation working to make public spaces safe and inclusive for women, says the term makes it sound like it's just a bit of teasing, but it's not benign.\n\"It's a typical Bollywood trope that the hero pursues the woman and she likes to be pursued. But it's a criminal offence, it's violent, and let's not minimise the harm of violence by calling it Eve-teasing, let's no trivialise it\" she says.\nAs most Indian women would testify, Eve teasing is very common and happens often while a woman is walking on the road or travelling in crowded public transport - most would have a story or two to tell about when they were groped or pinched or elbowed in the chest.\nMost cases of such harassment are registered under Article 354 of the Indian penal code which deals with cases of \"attempt to outrage modesty of women\". \nBut in the Ambedkar Nagar death case, police have invoked other stringent charges as well. \nIn 2021, the last year for which the Indian government's crime data is available, police recorded almost 90,000 such cases - or 13.4% of the total 428,278 crimes against women that year. With the backlog built up over the years, more than half a million such cases were pending in courts, according to the data.\nBut street harassment is a highly under-reported crime because most women don't go to the police when someone touches or gropes them or passes lewd remarks, Ms Viswanath says. Also, sometimes, especially in a very crowded area, it may be difficult even for a woman to identify her molester. \nThe incident in Ambedkar Nagar, she says, has made news only because of the tragic outcome. \"If she hadn't died, if she got up after falling down, dusted herself off and walked away, no-one would have talked about this incident.\"\nThe issue of harassment, gender activists say, can only be addressed by bringing up better boys. But, Ms Viswanath says, that's a long-term process and \"in the meantime, there has to be a better messaging system in the media which, at the moment, is laden against girls\". \n\"People need to understand what's acceptable behaviour, the police have to be sensitised so they take complaints from women seriously. And since police can't be everywhere all the time, the public and bystanders have to step in.\n\"We cannot look the other way and say boys will be boys. We cannot allow boys to be boys,\" she adds. \nBBC News India is now on YouTube.

{"title": "Can tech stop India wasting so much of its harvest?", "date": "2023-10-02 21:15:38", "text": "Kapil Jain's father didn't want his children to be farmers.\n\"My father had seen the hardship which farmers go through, so we were all educated and moved to the city to pursue a profession,\" he says.\nBut Mr Jain become tired with life in the city, and in 2018 he moved back to his family farm, near Kota in Rajasthan, north India.\n\"I realised that I like the touch of earth and wanted to move back to the village and start farming,\" he says.\nHe didn't want to farm the same crops as his father - wheat, rice, mustard and soya beans.\nInstead, with his part of Rajasthan suffering water shortages, Mr Jain looked for a crop that would use less water.\nHe decided to experiment with roses, which grow well in sunny conditions and need relatively little water, compared with traditional crops.\nBut while the roses grew well, harvesting them and getting them to market proved a challenge. The roses had to be sold just hours after being picked, otherwise the petals begin to fall. \nTo meet peak demand the flowers had to be at the market at 05:00. While the market was only 20 miles away, the journey could take an hour. So the crop had to be picked between 02:00 and 03:00, which made finding workers difficult.\nAs a result of those challenges, Mr Jain lost around 70% of his first few crops.\nSomething had to change. So Mr Jain decided to turn his roses into rose water and rose oil.\nAlso, for his tomato crop he bought a solar-powered drying system. \n\"So now I dry my products and sell them in market at the same time as the rose water, rose oil and jams. They have a bigger market and shelf life and that will help me grow my business.\"\nGetting harvested produce to market in good condition is a problem that farmers all over India struggle with.\nAccording to government figures, in 2022 India lost between 6% and 15% of its fruit, between 5% and 12% of its vegetables, and between 4% and 6% of its cereals.\n\"Farmers throw away large amounts of fruits and vegetables because of a lack of infrastructure, limited processing capacity... natural disasters like cyclones, and floods that disrupt transportation routes and damage facilities,\" says Varun Raheja, founder of Raheja Solar Food Processing.\nMr Raheja points out that most Indian farms are small, without the resources to invest in storage or refrigeration. \nSo Mr Raheja developed a simple air drying system, which uses sunlight and solar-powered fans to dry the produce. It's cheap and easy to assemble.\n\"The DIY model of our solar dryer makes it portable and affordable, it can reach even the remotest village, and can be afforded by every small and marginal farmer,\" he says.\nHis firm has sold around 3,000 of the systems, which Mr Raheja says, on average, dry about 150kg of produce a month.\nMr Raheja also operates as a middle man, buying dried produce and selling them on to larger firms.\nIn contrast to Mr Raheja's low-cost, low-tech solution there is WayCool.\nThe Indian agri-tech firm works with 200,000 farmers, owns 412 distribution centres and has invested in sophisticated systems that forecast demand for agricultural products.\nAround 2,000 tonnes of fresh fruit, vegetables, nuts, spices, dairy products flow through its network every day.\nWayCool says that its data analysis combined with modern distribution systems can help rescue some of India's lost produce.\n\"We employ technology to predict retailer orders, optimise collection centres, and set target prices, making supply chains efficient, and bringing supply chain losses to under 2%,\" says Karthik Jayaraman, managing director at WayCool Foods.\nWayCool has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to build its network, and plans to be profitable by 2025.\nDespite such high and low-tech innovation, much work still need to be done to reach India's more remote farmers.\nSagar Lokhande farms 15 acres in the village of Bhendwad in Maharashtra state. He grows sugar cane because it has a long shelf life.

{"title": "Garth Crooks' Team of the Week: Johnstone, Dawson, Lockyer, Andersen, Bissouma and more", "date": "2023-10-02 22:09:42", "text": "\nLast updated on 2 October 20232 October 2023.From the section Premier League\nAt the end of every round of fixtures, BBC football pundit Garth Crooks is on hand to give you his Team of the Week.\nHere are this week's choices and, as ever, Garth has also given his view on the game's big talking points in the Crooks of the Matter.\nSam Johnstone (Crystal Palace): It might be Manchester United's worst start to a league campaign for 34 years but Johnstone won't lose a wink of sleep over that. In fact the Palace keeper is somewhat responsible for that rather damning statistic. \nJohnstone kept United at bay as the home side tried to crank up the pressure. Two memorable saves, the first from Bruno Fernandes and the second a blistering header from Rasmus Hojlund, supported by some quite brilliant defending by the likes of Marc Guehi and Tyrick Mitchell, produced a memorable result for the Eagles.\nI must say at this point Palace manager Roy Hodgson is defying all logic. He seems to have once again quietly rejuvenated the London club. \nCraig Dawson (Wolves): Seeing Pep Guardiola having to watch his team from the stands due to his touchline ban should have told us something. This was a bad afternoon for Manchester City and matters got progressively worse as the day wore on. \nThe ball from Ruben Dias was matched by the cross-field volley from Matheus Nunes but the clearance by Wolves defender Dawson, as Erling Haaland was about to tap the ball home, was magnificent. \nDawson went on to clear another certain goal off the line just as the champions looked as though they were back in control of the match. Wolves defended brilliantly on the day and Dawson in particular. They reduced arguably the best striker in the world to one genuine strike on goal.  \nTom Lockyer (Luton Town): I'm not entirely sure if this win by Luton is a commentary on how good the visitors were to pick up their first ever win in the Premier League or how poor Everton were in front of goal. What is it with Everton and home matches? They've lost seven out of their past eight. \nWales centre-back Lockyer showed the sort of grit and determination his team will need to stay in this league when he pounced on a rebound off the Everton crossbar. Ashley Young required two touches to clear the danger but the Luton captain had no intention of letting him have more than one, and promptly stuck the ball in the back of the net. \nLockyer should have scored earlier when he rose above the Everton defence and couldn't control the header from going over the bar, but later made amends. In the scheme of things this was a very important win by the Hatters away from home.  \nJoachim Andersen (Crystal Palace): I was a little surprised by the heavy nature of Palace's 3-0 defeat in midweek against Manchester United in the Carabao Cup. However having seen Hodgson's selection for that fixture I could see why they lost. \nTheir team on Tuesday night didn't look remotely like the one that beat United 1-0 in the Premier League four days later. Their performance on Saturday was also unrecognisable from the one they produced in midweek. \nAs for the goal by Andersen, I could hardly believe what I saw, and it's the second time I have seen the Denmark international score this season while keeping a clean sheet at the same time. \nThis was a very impressive away performance by Palace and they don't seem to be missing Wilfried Zaha. In fact I'm starting to think Palace look better without him. They certainly look less complicated. \nConor Gallagher (Chelsea): This is more like it. Chelsea looked, and for the very first time this season, like a team that had some serious money spent on it. Manager Mauricio Pochettino hadn't taken a scalpel to shape his squad against Fulham on Monday night - more like a machete with 12 first-team players out injured.\nFive of his subs had never kicked a ball in the first team before while Mykhailo Mudryk and Armando Broja looked a useful partnership up-front. Thiago Silva and Levi Colwill looked comfortable at the back while Moses Caicedo is clearly going to have an impact on the team. \nHowever nothing prepared me for the way Gallagher performed at Craven Cottage. The newly installed Chelsea captain didn't just cover every blade of grass but also played with a maturity that justified the role. Fulham's manager Marco Silva looked dazed by the end of this encounter and had every right to be as Chelsea had just blitzed his team. \nDouglas Luiz (Aston Villa): The ease with which he struck the ball to score his fifth consecutive home league goal in the 6-1 win over Brighton said it all for me. This player has been a revelation for Aston Villa since the arrival of Unai Emery.\nI always thought it would have been Philippe Coutinho who would be setting the scene alight at Villa Park, but it's another Brazilian who seems to be doing that right now. \nLuiz is playing out of his skin at the moment, meanwhile the team don't look out of place in the top six. Something mildly exciting is going on at the Villa and with another couple of additions in January who knows what they could achieve.     \nMartin Odegaard (Arsenal): This was more of a stroll down memory lane than a walk in the park for Arsenal away at Bournemouth. \nTwo penalties given away needlessly by Bournemouth due to defenders making challenges recklessly in their own box. Why they felt the need to go to ground when the player on the ball still had so much to do remains a mystery to me. \nOdegaard put one of the penalties away before being brought down for another and then providing the perfect cross for Ben White to add Arsenal's fourth goal.\nThis means no win for Bournemouth in their opening seven league games with Everton, Wolves and Burnley to come. It doesn't look good for the Cherries at the moment. I wonder if Bournemouth are starting to regret parting ways with Gary O'Neil?  \nYves Bissouma (Tottenham): For the second consecutive week Bissouma makes my team selection. The Malian was at the heart of Tottenham's performance against a hard-done-by Liverpool. \nThe decision by referee Simon Hooper to send off Curtis Jones was a poor one. At first glance you can be forgiven for thinking that the tackle was a bad one because you see Jones make contact with Bissouma. \nHowever, the Liverpool's player's foot moves with the momentum of the ball, and that momentum then carries Jones's foot into Bissouma. Hooper should have seen this on the replay and didn't, which is most concerning - a yellow card was plenty. \nNo sooner do Liverpool feel the effect of one injustice when another one comes along, but the video assistant referee (VAR) remained conspicuously silent. Luis Diaz's superb strike was ruled offside when you could see from the naked eye it was a perfectly good goal.     \nCarlton Morris (Luton Town): Whatever concerns I may have about Luton Town's ability to survive in the Premier League, credit where credit is due, there can be no doubt about the quality of the finish by Morris against Everton. \nLuton needed that second goal at Everton in order to take victory, and long may it continue if they have any chance of securing points in future fixtures. The question is where are all their goals going to come from? Morris can't score all of them. \nBournemouth are a similar-sized club and were in a comparable position some years ago. They had Callum Wilson who has gone on and built an international career for himself having adjusted to the Premier League, and they created an outstanding manager in Eddie Howe who is now managing in the Champions League, so we have seen what can be achieved.   \nOllie Watkins (Aston Villa): What on earth happened to Brighton? Three goals conceded in 15 minutes. As for Aston Villa's Watkins - everything he touched seemed to turn gold. I've seen better hat-tricks but players who score three goals in a match invariably make my team selection. \nWhen it's going for you, it's going for you. Watkins' first goal was a side foot after a decent cross from Matty Cash; the second he scuffed and I can't for the life of me understand why keeper Jason Steele didn't do better to get a hand to the ball. The third was a deflected shot. \nI don't know if Watkins plays the lottery but I suggest he buys a ticket this week, because the way his luck is going anything is possible.  \nMiguel Almiron (Newcastle): I can't watch Almiron score a goal like the one he got against Burnley and not put him in my team. We've seen him do this before, but just when I was beginning to think the Paraguay international was starting to run out of the spectacular he comes up with the most glorious finish.\nMeanwhile, I can't help but agree with Vincent Kompany in that Burnley have had a very unfortunate fixture schedule. They have already played three teams out of the top six and Newcastle who are in the Champions League. \nEven though the Clarets have looked competent throughout, their next few games, including Luton away, will be telling\nWe were told that any offside decision made by VAR was irrefutable and that we could trust the science. \nIt would appear, having seen Diaz's superb strike ruled offside and Liverpool denied a share of the spoils against Tottenham, we can't in fact trust the operators in charge of the science due to what can only be described as human frailties. \nThe best of us have suffered from sweaty palms, dryness of the mouth or a lapse in concentration during intense moments, but assistance is often at hand to get you through the moment. \nHowever when the entire system comes crashing down then we have a problem, and with it a far greater question is posed: to what extent has this apparent system failure affected other fixtures in the past?\nIt's not that long ago retired referee Mike Dean declared that he failed to correct a mistake in a match to save his friend and fellow official Anthony Taylor from extra \"grief\". When I first read this comment I thought it must be a joke... 'save his friend from extra grief'? \nMatch officials have always made mistakes but they have been honest mistakes. The integrity of the game has always been held in the hands of our match officials and so it should remain. \nHowever when mistakes are made they need to be rectified immediately without fear or favour, and our officials should not be afraid that the science or the technology might expose their human frailties. \nThe game has always had the capacity to forgive the honest mistake and that should never change.

Just so you know, my financial statements are phenomenal,\" Mr Trump added. \"There was no crime - the crime was against me.\"\nGiven the former president's personal attacks, observers expected a tense atmosphere in the cramped confines of the court. But the three key figures in the legal drama had minimal direct interactions.\nWhile prosecutors set out their case, Mr Trump for the most part sat still, occasionally whispering to his legal team.\nMs James kept her eyes on the lawyer unveiling a visual presentation that accompanied her team's opening statements.\nProceedings began with her team accusing Mr Trump and his co-defendants of intentionally and persistently committing fraud, which reaped Mr Trump over $100m (£83m). \nLast week Judge Engoron ruled against Mr Trump in a central claim of the lawsuit, finding that he had overvalued his properties by hundreds of millions of dollars in order to get favourable bank loans.\nMr Trump's lawyers addressed the court shortly afterwards, attacking the New York attorney general's arguments. Alina Habba said Ms James' goal as attorney general was to \"go to work, get Trump and go home\". \nShe claimed that Mr Trump did not inflate the value of his assets - including his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\nReal estate was malleable, she said, and his properties were \"Mona Lisas\" - Mar-a-Lago would sell for at least a billion dollars, she argued.\nBut before lunch, proceedings turned increasingly fractious.\nMr Trump's attorney, Chris Kise, argued with Judge Engoron about issues including whether expert opinion counted as testimony. \nAnd Ms Habba's attacks on Ms James drew Judge Engoron's ire. The judge said he had already dismissed claims that the suit was politically motivated.\nThe afternoon in court proved calmer, with former Trump accountant Donald Bender testifying as the first witness called by the attorney general's office. \nMr Bender said he had worked on Trump's tax returns and completed accounting work for Mr Trump's corporate entities.\nHe testified in a criminal trial against the Trump Organization in Manhattan last year, claiming the company sought to evade taxes on bonuses and other luxury benefits. \nThis video can not be played\nTrump: 'It's a scam, it's a sham'\nHis two-hour testimony on Monday - largely focused on technical questions about his work for the Trump Organization - capped off the first day of the three-month long trial. \nThe case will be decided by Judge Engoron, not a jury. \nNone of the defendants will face jail time if convicted, because this is a civil case not a criminal one. \nMs James is seeking $250m (£207m) and sanctions that could prevent the Trumps from doing business in the state of New York.\nThere is even the possibility that Mr Trump could lose some of the properties that have become a signature part of his brand.\nThe stakes could not be higher.\nFact-checking Trump's claims about NY fraud trial\nWatch Trump tell reporters fraud trial 'is a sham' Video, 00:00:38Watch Trump tell reporters fraud trial 'is a sham'\nFive things to know about Trump's New York trial\nThe glitzy New York buildings that Trump could lose\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Oil cartel leader says demand expected to grow", "date": "2023-10-02 23:02:41", "text": "Demand for oil will continue to grow and remain \"resilient\" this year, according to the secretary general of Opec+.\nOpec+ is a group of 23 oil-exporting countries which decides how much crude oil to sell on the world market.\n\"We see demand growing about 2.4 million barrels a day,\" Haitham Al Ghais told the BBC.\nSaudi Arabia said it would be cutting its production of crude oil by a million barrels a day to boost prices.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) said the decision by Saudi Arabia and Russia - two major oil producers and members of Opec+ - to cut production could cause a \"significant supply shortfall\" by the end of this year.\nMr Al Ghais said: \"This is a voluntary decision taken by two sovereign nations, Saudi Arabia and Russia. This decision can be described as precautionary or pre-emptive because of uncertainties\".\nFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, oil prices soared, hitting more than $120 a barrel in June last year. They fell back to a little above $70 a barrel in May this year, but have steadily risen since then as producers have tried to restrict output to support the market.\nBrent crude, a benchmark for prices, breached $95 a barrel on Tuesday amid predictions of shorter supplies, with fears the price may breach $100 per barrel. The rise prompted a warning to drivers that fuel prices could rise in the coming 10 months, and stoked fears that inflation in key economies could be prolonged.\nBut Mr Al Ghais said Opec was more concerned about \"under investment\" in the oil sector.\n\"Some have called for stopping investments in oil. We believe this is equally dangerous. It will lead to volatility in the future, possible supply shortages. And therefore we at Opec have always advocated for the importance of continuing to invest in the oil industry as we also invest in decarbonising the industry and move on to adding other forms of alternative energy such as renewables\".\nAsked if he was concerned about rising oil prices affecting inflation around the world if it goes above $100 a barrel, Mr Al Ghais said it was \"important not to look at things in a short-sighted manner\".\n\"For next year we see demand continuing to grow north of 2 million barrels a day - of course, all subject to some of the uncertainties in the global market. Nevertheless, we still feel quite optimistic... that global oil demand is going to be quite resilient this year\".\nMr Al Ghais said that the oil industry would need close to $14tn in investment to the year 2045.\n\"Energy demand will grow by nearly 25% by the year 2045 compared to what it is today - and all forms of energy will be required\", he said.\nHis comments come ahead of a meeting of key oil players on Wednesday in Abu Dhabi for the International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (ADIPEC).\nOil prices rise as Saudi Arabia pledges output cuts\nWhy are the world's big oil producers cutting supplies?\nWarning over fuel prices as oil hits 10-month high\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nBurger King still in Russia despite pledge to exit\nTrump turns up in court to blast 'scam' fraud trial\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Burger King still in Russia despite pledging to leave 18 months ago", "date": "2023-10-02 23:04:24", "text": "Burger King remains open as usual in Russia despite the brand's owner pledging to leave more than a year ago.\nRestaurant Brands International (RBI), which owns 15% of the fast-food's franchise business in Russia, told the BBC it had \"no new updates to share at this time\" on its exit.\nThe firm said in March 2022 that it had started the process to leave Russia.\nSince the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, Western companies have been under pressure to leave Russia.\nCritics accused RBI of \"sustaining Putin's regime\" by failing to ditch its stake in its Russian business.\nRBI, one of the world's largest fast-food restaurant companies, has cited its complicated franchise agreement for its difficulty in trying to exit the country.\nThe deal is a joint venture with three other partners for some 800 restaurants.\nDavid Shear, RBI's president, said in March 2022 that Burger King's main operator in Russia had \"refused\" to shut the outlets following the first attacks on Ukraine. \nBut he added that the company had \"started the process\" to dispose if its 15% ownership stake and that it would take \"some time\".\nAsked by the BBC about the progress made 18 months on from the pledge, a spokesperson for the Canadian-American company said the firm had no updates.\nSteven Tian, part of a team of researchers at Yale University who track what companies have done in response to the Ukraine war, argued using franchise agreements as an \"excuse\" was a \"convenient smokescreen\". He pointed out that the likes of Starbucks had managed to terminate its deal in the country and exit.\n\"Saying they [RBI] want to leave but then dragging their feet is not the same as actually exiting Russia, and by continuing to do business in Russia 18 months into Putin's invasion of Ukraine, they are sustaining Putin's regime,\" he said.\nThe spokesperson for RBI said the company was refusing new investment and supply chain support, and had not made any profits from Burger King in Russia since early 2022.\nMark Dixon, founder of the Moral Rating Agency, which campaigns against firms doing business in Russia, called for RBI to disclose what specific actions it had taken in its attempts to leave.\n\"[The firm] should be willing to break its agreement... It needs to accept the legal risk of doing the right thing.\"\nFranchising is a business method of distributing products or services. It involves a franchisor, a company that has established the brand's name, and a franchisee, a company that pays a fee for the right to do business under the brand and to sell its products.\nIt has been a tool used by many Western brands in recent decades looking to enter new markets in different countries. The agreements typically span many years.\nWhile Burger King remains open for business in Russia, its biggest rival McDonald's, which corporately owned most of its restaurants, has managed to leave the country.\nKFC's parent company Yum! Brands has also sold more than 100 restaurants to a local operator in Russia, which were rebranded as Rostic's in April.\nDavid Bond, partner at law firm Fieldfisher, said RBI's 15% stake meant it could not simply \"dictate terms\" to its fellow shareholders to require them to close Burger King branches.\nHe also suggested companies that franchise out their brands would be reluctant to simply walk away from deals as it could lead to \"dire consequences\", including being sued for breach of contract, as well as reputational damage.\nBut he said consequences aside, there was nothing stopping RBI from terminating the franchise arrangement if it was adamant it wanted to do so, though added it might not result in the Burger King brand ceasing to exist in Russia.\nHe said the majority of \"de-brands\" in the country, such as McDonald's, had been achieved through agreed sales with local businesspeople \"willing to de-brand in return for the discounted purchase price\".\nThe joint venture that holds the Burger King franchise in Russia is made up of RBI and three other parties:\nMcDonald's to leave Russia for good after 30 years\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "The lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East", "date": "2023-10-03 00:17:52", "text": "Eid Haddad's parents were teenagers when they witnessed the full force of Britain's presence in Palestine in 1938. \n\"They saw the troops coming in and attacking people. My father told me that one of the men was hit on his head with a wooden hammer used to mince meat called [in Arabic] a modakah, and he died,\" says Mr Haddad.\n\"A man and his son were hanging tobacco leaves to dry them. They were just shot in the back.\" \n\"It was chaos,\" he says. \nHis parents lived in al-Bassa, a Palestinian village subjected to collective punishment by British forces, who called their actions at the time \"punitive measures\". These would target whole villages if troops faced attacks by armed rebels operating in the hills. \nMr Haddad gave the account of the atrocity for a new BBC Radio 4 series, The Mandates, starting on Tuesday at 1600BST, which examines how British and French control of the Middle East a century ago shaped the region in ways which still reverberate today. \nIn the series we hear from a range of historians; experts in the events a century ago on the territory covering modern-day Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. We spoke to women and men directly affected by the convulsions that gripped Europe and the Middle East, and their descendants today. \nI first made contact with Mr Haddad last year when I was covering a Palestinian-led attempt to seek an apology for alleged war crimes carried out by the UK during its control of Palestine from 1917 to 1948. \nAs I spoke to him this time, during calls from his home in Denmark, he recounted the story of his own childhood in Lebanon amid the further bloodshed his family endured - by then dislocated from their homeland. \nLike many other people I interviewed for the series, his parents' early lives unfolded as British and French rule sparked years of conflict and sectarian upheaval in the region. \nHis childhood encapsulated the bloody instability that gripped the Middle East in the decades after the European powers abandoned their interventions. \nOne historian we interviewed told us the history of the mandates is so foundational it is effectively \"a history of the present\". \nDuring the First World War, as Britain invaded and captured the territory from the crumbling Ottoman Empire, it drew on growing forces of national self-determination. It made competing promises over swathes of the territory to Arabs, who sought independence across the region, and to the Zionist movement which sought a Jewish home in Palestine. \nThe British and French consolidated their control with so-called \"mandates\" to govern handed to them by the newly founded League of Nations - a body which was dominated by the two imperial powers. \nIn Palestine, Britain's policies ultimately set rival national movements on a collision course before it launched a brutal crackdown on an Arab uprising in the late 1930s. British forces would later face rebellion from Zionist militias, amid a series of chaotic policy reversals which saw the UK renege on immigration promises and turn back refugee boats of Holocaust survivors who had earlier escaped Nazi-occupied Europe.  \n\"The British didn't know how to manage these things,\" the Israeli historian Tom Segev told me. \"[They] treated Palestine as one would treat a lovable pet. It's nice to have, but it really shouldn't cause us too much trouble,\" he adds. \nMeanwhile the French Mandate hived off Lebanon from Syria to create a strategic beachhead and imposed new boundaries over the whole territory in the early 1920s, before an Arab rebellion which they also ruthlessly suppressed. They split areas by ethnicity and religion in what historian James Barr told us was a \"very straightforward and cynical\" attempt to divide and rule. \nIn the years after the Second World War, Britain and France pulled out. In Palestine, London knew its withdrawal would turn an escalating territorial conflict into regional war, as the State of Israel was declared and Arab armies invaded. \nMr Haddad's parents fled al-Bassa as the village was destroyed by Jewish paramilitary forces. During the conflicts of 1947-8 at least 750,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes in what Palestinians call the 'Nakba' or 'catastrophe'. Mr Haddad was born and grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp in neighbouring Lebanon.\nThe fragile sectarian climate between Christians and Muslims left in the wake of French rule of Lebanon was destabilised with the addition of Palestinian refugees. It was further aggravated during the rise of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the armed group that launched attacks on Israel. The country also had powerful officials who still favoured regional pan-Arab alliance with Syria and Egypt - a movement which drew its roots back to rebellion against the mandates and earlier. \nLebanon later plunged into sectarian civil war. Mr Haddad, whose family are Palestinian Christians, describes how his 16-year-old brother was shot dead by Christian Lebanese ultranationalists - Phalangist militias - who targeted Palestinians and attacked his refugee camp north of Beirut in 1975. \nThe following year, he survived a mass killing, escaping gunmen by hiding in a wardrobe. He describes appalling and barbaric humiliation of survivors by the militias. \nMr Haddad tells me he manages lifelong symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which he traces back to what he experienced as a child. \n\"My parents - I think they also suffered PTSD because they have seen also lots of things as children. And imagine my father, he was about to be taken by the British troops to be interrogated,\" he says, explaining that British forces separated women from men who were detained by troops during the atrocity in al-Bassa in 1938.\nHis father, then a teenage boy, was spirited towards the line of women, says Mr Haddad, by a villager who disguised him as a girl.\n\"So they just covered him, covered his head with a scarf and gave him a dress. And in this way, they saved him from being tortured,\" he says. \nThe UK government has never acknowledged the atrocity in al-Bassa which is believed to have killed more than 30 people.\nFrom Europe, Mr Haddad describes how he has never been able to return home. \nHe says: \"It feels like a big piece of myself is missing.

{"title": "Inquiry to focus on government as stakes rise", "date": "2023-10-03 00:24:13", "text": "Decisions made by Boris Johnson, his government and his team of scientists in the early days of the pandemic are to come under intense scrutiny as the second part of the Covid inquiry begins.\nUntil Christmas, the spotlight will be on key decisions made to try to control the spread of the virus, from lockdowns to border controls to face masks. But what is at stake for the ex-prime minister and his former team?\nOn 7 March 2020, England beat Wales in front of 82,000 in a Six Nations rugby match at Twickenham. Mr Johnson was in the crowd shaking hands with England captain Owen Farrell.\nOn the same day, newspaper front pages were full of one subject. \n\"Official: It's an outbreak,\" said the Sun. \"Millions told: work at home to fight virus,\" said the Daily Mail.\nThat weekend, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced a lockdown across the north of the country as Covid cases threatened to overwhelm hospitals.\nIn the UK, where only two deaths had been confirmed, the message was still to wash our hands and carry on - cautiously - with our lives.\nThe next week, horse racing's Cheltenham Festival went ahead with 250,000 spectators, while 3,000 Atletico Madrid football fans flew to Liverpool for a Champions League match, when Spanish restrictions would have stopped them going to a match at home.\nGeoff Bodman, 59, was at both Twickenham and Cheltenham that spring and is sure he was infected with Covid at one of those events. \nLater that month he was put on a ventilator at a hospital in Cardiff, followed by two months in intensive care during which he suffered a stroke.\n\"With hindsight, the government should have acted more decisively and put a block on things,\" he says.\n\"It would have been disruptive for a lot of people, but lives would have been saved.\"\nHundreds of articles and books have already been written about the government's early response to Covid. An investigation by MPs described it as one of the country's worst public health failures.\nFormer Health Secretary Matt Hancock published his version of what happened, and then had thousands of his WhatsApp messages leaked to the Daily Telegraph. \nNow though, the Covid-19 public inquiry, led by former judge Baroness Hallett, is opening its own investigation. \nThe first part of the inquiry, examining just the planning for a pandemic, finished hearing witnesses back in July, with a final report due in 2024. \nThis second part looks at the decisions made after Covid emerged with \"particular scrutiny\" of the period until 23 March 2020 when the UK went into full lockdown.\nIt will ask:\nIt will investigate whether the impact on the economy, education and mental health were ever properly considered.\n\"I didn't see another human being for 18 months, except for when I went to get my jabs,\" says James Hollens, who has two types of autoimmune arthritis and a weakened immune system because of the medication he is taking.\nNew research for the charity Versus Arthritis found there was a \"sizeable impact\" on the mental health of people - like James - who shielded through the pandemic. \n\"We were told to just stay inside and wait for the next news conference,\" he adds.\n\"Not once did anyone reach out and check how we were doing mentally or physically.\"\nThis part of the inquiry will look at how at-risk groups were identified and the effect of lockdown and social distancing on those individuals. \nCrucially it will also examine \"public confidence\" in the government's policies \"including the impact of alleged breaches of rules and standards by ministers, officials and advisers\".\nAs a public inquiry, Baroness Hallett and her team have specific powers, including the ability to compel witnesses to give evidence under oath, and force the release of documents.  \nThat was seen earlier this year when the government lost a legal challenge to prevent the release of ministers' WhatsApp messages and diaries in full. \nExpect those texts to form a key part of the questioning, with Mr Johnson, Mr Hancock and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak all likely to give evidence. \nThere is significant potential for this to be embarrassing for the government, as it will shine a light on their decision-making, who did what, and what was said behind closed doors.\nAnother two weeks is set aside to hear from advisers and civil servants, expected to include Dominic Cummings and former cabinet secretary Sir Mark Sedwill.\nGroups representing the families of some of the 230,000 who lost their lives are worried they may not have a proper chance to have their say. \nThe UK-wide part of this second module runs until Christmas when the inquiry will then move to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to investigate the way they handled Covid.\nA public inquiry is not a court case or a criminal trial and there are no sanctions at the end of the process. The chairperson does not have the power to send anyone to prison or impose a fine. \nInstead the idea is to establish the facts of what happened and learn lessons for the future. \nThat is still not without risk for the people involved.\nAt the end of each section an official report will be published which may well attach blame to institutions and to individuals.\nThose findings are likely to be seen by many as a historical verdict on the way the pandemic was handled.\nThey could even - theoretically - trigger future civil or criminal proceedings.\nIn a statement, a government spokeswoman said it was committed to learning lessons from the inquiry. \n\"Throughout the pandemic the government acted to save lives and livelihoods, prevent the NHS being overwhelmed and deliver a world-leading vaccine rollout which protected the nation,\" she added.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\nCovid Inquiry: What have we learnt so far?\nWhat is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Gig safety fears after trainee stewards helped to cheat", "date": "2023-10-03 00:59:03", "text": "This video can not be played\nWATCH: Secret filming by BBC reporter\nSecurity guards - who safeguard public events - are fraudulently obtaining work licences after attending sham training courses, the BBC has found.\nAn undercover reporter from File on 4 paid extra to complete a mandatory six-day course in a day and a half - missing crucial first-aid training.\nOn one course he was told to fill in timesheets for all six days and given answers to multiple-choice questions.\nThe industry regulator said the evidence suggested criminality.\nThe Security Industry Authority (SIA) also said it was now working with the organisations which oversee these training companies to further investigate the BBC material. It said it would be referring the matter to the police. \nThe findings come eight years after another BBC investigation revealed security guards could be fraudulently buying qualifications for cash. \nThis time, File on 4 approached 12 companies offering Level 2 SIA door supervisor courses for between £200-£300. Many advertise near-100% pass rates and use phrases such as \"no pass, no fee\".\nFour of the firms offered the undercover journalist shortened courses - which is against regulations - ranging from one-and-a-half to three days.\nCompletion of the six-day training course lets people apply for an SIA licence - the blue cards seen on security staff armbands - subject to identity and criminal record checks. \nFile on 4: Security Threat\nA BBC reporter went undercover to reveal how some security training companies are providing fast-track courses that breach regulations and put the public in danger.\nListen on BBC Sounds\nThey can then work in arenas, nightclubs and other venues across the UK - renewing their licence every three years with a two-day top-up course. \nThere are nearly half a million active licensed security guards in the UK. About 170,000 qualifications - first-time and top-ups - are awarded each year, through close to 650 training providers. \nWhen presented with our findings, Paul Greaney KC - legal counsel to the inquiry into the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing - told us he remained \"extremely concerned about the safety of the public attending events\".\nHe said the inquiry revealed that had the security staff received proper training it could have made a \"decisive difference\" to what happened - either averting the attack or aiding the injured. \nThe inquiry found a need for comprehensive training - with checks in place.\n\"What I've just seen is the complete opposite of that situation,\" he told the BBC.\nSteps Institution, in Forest Gate, east London, is one of the companies that offered the undercover reporter a shortened, fraudulent course.\nIt is an approved course provider and is listed on the SIA's website.\nFor an additional £310, the reporter was told he could begin his training on day five of the normal six-day course. This meant he missed a number of mandatory modules - including first aid, conflict management and door supervision.\nHe was first told to forge his timesheets for six full days, before joining others for a \"physical intervention\" training session - to learn how to safely move or restrain someone. \nThe reporter recorded course trainer, Zeeshan Ahmad, delivering anecdotes on painful ways to \"kill and be killed\". These are not part of the mandatory training.\nMr Ahmad told the BBC he unequivocally denied the allegations and said he was committed to \"upholding ethical standards in all aspects\" of his life. \nThe director of Steps Institution, Ms Adriana Ceteteanu, told us her company did not \"offer six-day courses in a day and a half\". The assertion of forged timesheets was \"incorrect\", and she did \"not accept\" that the instructor's method of training was inappropriate.\nAt a second training centre - Caetop College in Ilford, east London - there appeared to be no option to attend the mandatory six-day course, and our reporter was only offered a three-day course. \nAgain, in just a few minutes, he was asked to fill in timesheets for six days. He was then coached on a test which he should have taken at the end of a whole day of first-aid training.   \n\"That was first aid - so your first aid is finished now,\" the trainer told him.\nPaul Greaney told us he was \"extremely disappointed\" by our findings. A recommendation of better first aid training for security staff was one of the key issues to emerge from the Manchester Arena inquiry. \nOn the third day, the reporter and a roomful of other candidates sat a final exam - but they were not given any questions. Instead, answer sheets to multiple-choice questions were handed out and everyone was told by the trainer what options to circle - A, B, C and so on.\nOn some questions, candidates were told to vary their answers, to ensure each test paper was not identical when handed in.\nCaetop College is yet to respond to the BBC about this evidence. \nAfter the previous BBC investigation into security industry fraud in 2015, both the SIA and Home Office said they took allegations of malpractice seriously.\nBut after a File on 4 programme in January reported claims that staff at the O2 Brixton Academy regularly took bribes to let in ticketless music fans, the BBC was contacted by dozens of whistleblowers. \n\"People are passing the [course] who shouldn't be, and they are getting their licences,\" one told us. Another said they had worked with so many \"unsuitable\" people who were a \"danger to themselves and everyone around them\". The only reason they're able to work, said a third, is because the training company has \"somehow decided to pass them\".\nTwo people died as the result of a crush at the O2 Brixton Academy in December 2022.\nWhen told of the BBC's latest findings, the sister of one of the victims - security dog handler Gaby Hutchinson - said it was \"just not acceptable\" to put the public at risk. \nKelsey Hutchinson told us she found it difficult to understand \"how security companies can allow their workers to not have proper first aid [training]\".\nAn investigation into what happened at the Academy is ongoing. \nThe SIA - which was created by the Home Office in 2001 - refused to be interviewed about the latest BBC investigation, but said it would be assessing the evidence. \nWhere individuals' qualifications were shown to be unsafe, it said, licences would be suspended. The SIA also said it would work with Ofqual - which regulates qualifications, examinations and assessments in England - to ensure the allegations are investigated.\nThe statement added: \"We are determined to ensure poor practices are rooted out and support the majority who operate to good standards.\"\nOfqual said it took instances of fraud and malpractice seriously. \nIt said while it did not regulate training providers, it required awarding organisations to put safeguards in place to prevent malpractice. It also said those who did not take all reasonable steps to prevent malpractice faced sanctions. \nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\nBrixton crush victim's family call for answers\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Why a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire", "date": "2023-10-03 01:22:38", "text": "A gun charge hanging over President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, is rarely filed by prosecutors. Will it stand up in court?\nPatrick Darnell Daniels was pulled over by police in April 2022 for driving a truck without a registration plate in Hancock County, Mississippi. \nInside his vehicle officers found marijuana cigarette butts and two loaded firearms. \nThe 26-year-old was charged under a law that bans users of illegal drugs from owning guns. \nA judge denied him bail and ruled him a flight risk, citing a previous contempt of court, a history of substance abuse and a lack of stable residence. \nHe was convicted and sentenced last October to nearly four years in prison.\nBut in August an appeals court overturned Daniels' conviction. He was freed on 26 September.\nHunter Biden, 53, faces the same charge: possession of a firearm by an unlawful user of a controlled substance. It carries a maximum prison sentence of up to five years. He is expected to plead not guilty on Tuesday. \nSouth Texas College of Law Professor Dru Stevenson, who has published research on drug-user-gun-possession charges, says it's unusual for such cases to make it to court. \n\"It's just really rare that they would go after someone and prosecute them for this,\" Prof Stevenson said. \n\"But this [Hunter Biden] is a high-profile person and there's been members of Congress demanding he be prosecuted.\"\nOf the 7,454 people sentenced for illegal gun possession in 2021, only about 5% of them were charged due to drug use, according to US Sentencing Commission data. \nAs well as the drug-user-gun-possession charge, Mr Biden faces two felony counts of lying about his drug addiction in a statement to a firearms dealer and on a federal form when he bought the revolver in October 2018 from a shop in Wilmington, Delaware. The twin charges are punishable by up to 10 years each.\nPart of the reason the drug-user-gun-possession charge is so rare, Prof Stevenson said, is that it can be hard to prove someone is a drug user and has a gun.\nThe president's son, however, wrote about his addiction to crack cocaine during the period of his life when he bought the pistol in his 2021 memoir Beautiful Things.\nFor those who do end up charged with illegal gun possession, it's usually a \"slam dunk case\", Prof Stevenson said. \n\"If they insist on pressing charges,\" he said, \"I don't think there's any question that [Mr Biden] will be convicted.\" \nThe president's son - who is also under investigation for allegedly failing to pay federal taxes - has remained free while his case winds its way through the courts. \nThe gun-and-tax charges were to be rolled in to a plea deal that would have spared Mr Biden - who has no criminal record - prison time. But that agreement collapsed in July.\nCongressional Republicans - who are investigating Mr Biden's business dealings, and how much his father might have known about them, called the plea agreement a \"sweetheart deal\".\nMr Biden's attorneys have predicted the first criminal case against the son of a US president will never make it to trial.\nThey have argued that the gun charges are unconstitutional, citing a Supreme Court ruling last year - New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v Bruen.  \nIn that decision, the justices expanded gun rights, writing that restrictions must be \"consistent with this nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation\".\nIn August the very same case was cited by the federal appeals court that overturned Patrick Darnell Daniels' conviction.  \nJudge Jerry Smith ruled: \"At no point in the 18th or 19th Century did the government disarm individuals who used drugs or alcohol at one time from possessing guns at another.\" \nOther cases involving the same drug-user-gun-owner prohibition - 18 USC 922 - have gone in favour of defendants after judges questioned whether the charges were constitutionally valid.\nPaola Connelly was arrested in El Paso, Texas, after police responding to reports of a disturbance found firearms at her home on 28 December 2021. \nMs Connelly was charged after acknowledging to officers that she often smoked marijuana as a sleep aid and to help her anxiety.\nBut in April a federal judge threw out the case.\nJared Michael Harrison was pulled over for failing to stop at a red light in Lawton, Oklahoma, in May 2022. \nHe, too, was charged after police discovered marijuana and a loaded gun in his car.\nBut in February, another court dismissed that case. \nHarrison's lawyer, Laura Deskin, told the BBC: \"I will say I cannot imagine Mr Harrison ever contemplated that anything in his life could possibly intersect with or impact Mr Hunter Biden. \n\"But here we are!\"\nHunter Biden to appear in court on gun charges\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

But only a handful of hardline Republicans have indicated they are willing to remove Mr McCarthy.\nThe Speaker is second in the line of succession for the presidency after the US vice-president. He or she sets the lower house of Congress' legislative priorities, controls committee assignments, and can make or break the White House's agenda.\nThe deal late on Saturday that averted a government shutdown left out $6bn (£5bn) of funding for Ukraine because Mr Gaetz, of Florida, and other ultraconservatives insisted the US has spent too much on that country's war with Russia. \nMr Gaetz has wielded the threat of dethroning Mr McCarthy ever since January when he led party rebels in opposing the California congressman's bid for the speakership, forcing him to endure 15 gruelling rounds of voting in the chamber.\nDuring the political horse-trading before he ultimately won the gavel, Mr McCarthy agreed to a change of rules that would allow any single lawmaker to call for a vote to oust the Speaker.\nThat paved the way to the motion to vacate.\nIn a speech on the House floor on Monday, Mr Gaetz accused Mr McCarthy of striking a secret deal with the White House to insert new Ukraine funding into separate legislation.\nMr McCarthy has said there is \"no side deal on Ukraine\". \nAfter filing the motion to vacate, Mr Gaetz told a crowd of reporters: \"Well, I have enough Republicans where, at this point next week, one of two things will happen. \n\"Kevin McCarthy won't be the Speaker of the House, or he'll be the Speaker of the House working at the pleasure of the Democrats, and I'm at peace with either result, because the American people deserve to know who governs them.\"\nAsked earlier on Monday whether his actions were plunging the institution into turmoil, Mr Gaetz told reporters: \"You talk about chaos as if it's me forcing a few votes and filing a few motions. \n\"Real chaos is when the American people have to go through the austerity that is coming if we continue to have $2 trillion annual deficits.\"\nMr Gaetz told reporters outside the Capitol on Monday night that he would be up for supporting Louisiana Republican Steve Scalise - currently deputy to Mr McCarthy - to succeed the Speaker.\nTom McClintock, a California Republican, blasted the \"self-destructive course\" of trying to remove the Speaker, before Mr Gaetz's floor speech. \nWithout naming his Florida colleague, Mr McClintock said: \"I implore my Republican colleagues to look past their prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion, their local interests and their selfish views.\" \nAccording to the rules of the chamber, the Speaker is required to keep a list of individuals who could act as a temporary replacement in case the role is ever vacated. \nIf Mr McCarthy were voted out, this list would be made public and the person at the top of it would be named Speaker pro tempore until elections were held in the chamber for a new leader of the majority party in the chamber.  \nDemocrats must now decide if they will step in and vote to help the Speaker keep his job. \nDemocrats are unhappy with Mr McCarthy after he recently approved the launch of a congressional inquiry to see if there is enough evidence to impeach President Joe Biden.\nBut left-wing New York lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told CNN on Sunday her fellow Democrats might be interested in politically bailing out Mr McCarthy if they can extract concessions from him.\nThe rare procedural tool to remove a Speaker has only been used twice in the past century and never successfully.\nIt was last used in 2015 against Speaker John Boehner.  \nThe motion to remove him failed but it built enough pressure on Mr Boehner that, unable to unite his caucus, he announced his resignation two months later. \nBefore then it was last used in 1910.\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Voice to Parliament: Early voting begins in historic Australian referendum", "date": "2023-10-03 03:59:32", "text": "Australia has begun early voting in a landmark referendum on enacting an Indigenous Voice to Parliament.\nIf approved, the reform would recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the country's constitution and establish a permanent body for them to advise the government. \nThe country has not had a successful referendum in almost 50 years.\nOpinion polls had long-shown support for the proposal, but as the vote nears the No side appears to be leading. \nWhile the majority of Australians will vote on 14 October, those who are unable to can vote at select polling centres right across the country from Tuesday. \nThe Voice to Parliament was recommended by a historic document in 2017 called the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Drafted by more than 250 Indigenous leaders, the statement is considered the best - though not unanimous - call to action for reforms on issues affecting First Nations Australians. It also lays out a longer process of treaty-making and truth-telling. \nBut the Voice proposal has become the subject of fierce debate in Australia, and a lightning rod for misinformation and racist abuse.\nIts supporters say it will lead to better outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who face lower life expectancy, and disproportionately poorer health and education outcomes than other Australians.\nBut those against it argue - among other things - that the Voice is a largely symbolic gesture which will fail to enact change, and that it could undermine Australia's existing government structures.\nFor the referendum to succeed, a majority of Australians need to vote yes, but there also needs to be majority support in at least four of Australia's six states.\nThe composition, functions and powers of the body, whose advice would not be binding, would then be designed and debated by the parliament.\nRecent polling has shown a steady - yet dramatic - decline in public support for the Voice, but one poll on Tuesday showed the Yes side making ground for the first time in months.\nAustralia last held a referendum in 1999, when it rejected the opportunity to become a republic.\nOnly eight of Australia's 44 referendums have been successful - the most recent in 1977 - and none have passed without bipartisan support.\nWhat is Australia's Voice to Parliament referendum?\nLies fuel racism ahead of historic Australia vote\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Pope suggests Catholic Church could bless same-sex couples", "date": "2023-10-03 04:42:53", "text": "Pope Francis has suggested he would be open to having the Catholic Church bless same-sex couples. \nResponding to a group of cardinals who asked him for clarity on the issue, he said any request for a blessing should be treated with \"pastoral charity\".\n\"We cannot be judges who only deny, reject, and exclude,\" he said.\nHe added, however, that the Church still considered same-sex relationships \"objectively sinful\" and would not recognise same-sex marriage.\nThe request was one of a number sent to the Pope ahead of a weeks-long global gathering to discuss the future of the Church set to get under way at the Vatican on Wednesday.\nIn the Catholic Church, a blessing is a prayer or plea, usually delivered by a minister, asking that God look favourably on the person or people being blessed.\nBishops in a number of countries, including Belgium and Germany, have begun to allow priests to bless same-sex couples, but the position of Church authorities remained unclear. \nIn 2021, following a similar request for clarification, the Vatican's doctrinal office ruled against allowing the practice. \nResponding to the latest request, the Pope said that the Church understood marriage to be an \"exclusive, stable, and indissoluble union between a man and a woman\" and should avoid \"any type of rite or sacramental that might contradict this conviction\".\nBut he added that \"when a blessing is requested, it is expressing a plea to God for help, a supplication to live better\".\n\"Pastoral prudence must adequately discern whether there are forms of blessing, requested by one or more persons, that do not convey a mistaken concept of marriage,\" he said. \nAppearing to suggest that requests for blessings should be considered on a case-by-case basis, he said that \"decisions that may be part of pastoral prudence in certain circumstances should not necessarily become a norm\".\n\"Canon law should not and cannot cover everything,\" he said.\nHe added that the Church should always approach its relationships with people with \"kindness, patience, understanding, tenderness, and encouragement\". \nIn February, a vote of senior figures in the Church of England backed proposals to allow prayers of blessing for same-sex couples.\nThe move would mean a same-sex couple could go to an Anglican church after a legal marriage ceremony for services including prayers of dedication, thanksgiving, and God's blessing.\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nChurch of England backs plans to bless gay couples\nPope gives women historic right to vote at meeting\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "The Papers: 'Tory rebellion' as Sunak 'brings axe down on HS2'", "date": "2023-10-03 05:13:09", "text": "The Times reports that Rishi Sunak is likely to announce the scrapping of HS2 from Birmingham to Manchester, in his party conference speech tomorrow. The Guardian says an emergency Cabinet meeting will be held at the conference to approve what it calls \"the biggest infrastructure climbdown in a generation\". The i reports Northern Powerhouse Rail links to Liverpool and Hull may also be at risk because its construction is reliant on parts of HS2. Meanwhile the Daily Mail quotes a Conservative source as saying Mr Sunak is \"ready to have the argument\" about the issue, as he is making sure the government is not just \"throwing good money after bad\".\nThe Daily Telegraph reports that Health Secretary Steve Barclay will announce plans to ban transgender women from female hospital wards in England. Under the changes, trans patients would be housed in separate accommodation to bring back what Mr Barclay describes as a \"common sense\" approach to sex and equality within the NHS. The paper says he also plans for a return of \"sex-specific\" language - expelling terms such as \"chestfeeding\" instead of \"breastfeeding\", and guidance referring to pregnant \"people\" rather than women.\nThe Times says police could soon be given full access to Britain's passport database, to help catch thieves and shoplifters. It quotes Crime and Policing Minister Chris Philp as saying footage from CCTV or doorbell technology would be compared against facial images to help officers find a match \"at the click of a button\". The Guardian says civil liberties groups have described the plans as \"authoritarian\". It quotes one campaign group warning it would be \"Orwellian\" to have police scan people's faces and trawl through their personal information as they go to buy a pint of milk. \nThe Financial Times says that the head of the IMF has backed reforms that could give Beijing more voting power in the fund. In an interview, Kristalina Georgieva tells the paper the institution should represent changes in the global economy - which include the rise of China. The country has been criticised by creditors for hampering debt relief deals - and the paper says the US - the IMF's largest shareholder - has signalled it would veto an expansion of Beijing's voting rights.\nThe i reports that up to 200,000 people will be regularly tested as part of a major Covid study aimed at tracking the spread of the virus this winter. It says the survey will involve 32,000 lateral flow tests a week being sent out to volunteers. The study - led by the UK Health and Security Agency and the Office for National Statistics - will run from November to March, and operate in a similar way to a previous ONS study which was scrapped. \nAnd the Mirror carries a study about how daily tea drinkers could be reducing their chances of developing Type-2 diabetes by 28%. It quotes the findings from Adelaide University but points out a weakness - most in the study drank a healthier type of Chinese \"dark tea\" rather than the black tea with milk that Britons consume. Nevertheless, the paper claims there's \"Diabe-TEAs hope\".\nDaily Express\nDaily Mail\nDaily Mirror\nDaily Star\nDaily Telegraph\nFinancial Times\nGuardian\nIndependent\nMetro\nMorning Star\nSun\nTimes\nThe i\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Mum fears her son could die waiting for life changing surgery", "date": "2023-10-03 05:25:54", "text": "The mother of a four-year-old boy with complex needs said she fears he could die waiting for life-changing surgery.\nCollette Mullan made the claim to BBC Spotlight as it examined the scale of hospital waiting lists. \nNorthern Ireland has the worst waiting times in the UK, with more than half a million cases queued for an outpatient or inpatient appointment.\nThe Department of Health has described current waiting lists as \"entirely unacceptable\". \nÓisín, from County Londonderry, has a number of health conditions including cerebral palsy, and is currently waiting for two procedures.\nHe is fed with a tube that carries his food through his nose into his stomach, but since it was inserted six months ago, his mum Collette said he has struggled to breathe.\n\"His breathing has been horrendous, choking all the time.\"\n\"He would choke until he vomits. It's very scary\" she said. \nÓisín is now waiting to have the nasogastric tube removed and replaced by a different feeding system which goes directly to his stomach.\nCollette said she was told it could be a three-year wait for the procedure.\nShe is concerned that Óisín's cerebral palsy puts him at a greater risk of complications, saying she had been warned there was a danger he could aspirate.\n\"He could die. Anything going into his lung really, it could be very dangerous,\" she said.\nThe Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, where the specialist surgery is to be carried out, told Spotlight the wait should be no more than two years.\nIt apologised for the time Óisín has had to wait, adding that there was a limited number of paediatric surgeons who fit the tubes.\nIt said 75 children were currently waiting for the surgery.\n\"It is extremely difficult to prioritise these children based on clinical need due to the complex nature of their care plans\" the trust said. \nCollette told Spotlight Óisín is also waiting for surgery on his hip.\n\"His right hip is completely out of socket; it is just completely out,\" she said.\n\"Because this is out, then we have to match the two up together. It's not going to make him walk but it's to prevent pain.\n\"Pain will eventually come at some stage. Thank goodness it hasn't come yet.\"\nÓisín was placed on the list for this procedure last year but Collette said she had no idea when it was likely to be carried out.\nThe Belfast Trust said demand for such surgery was outstripping capacity, and that it was exploring options to alleviate waiting lists across paediatric orthopaedic services. \nBBC Spotlight also spoke to Taylor Clark, a 30-year-old former coffee-shop manager who has had to give up work due to poor mobility and severe pain.\nThe Bangor woman has Ehlers Danlos syndrome, which affects the tissues supporting her joints and muscles.\n\"The ligaments and tendons and muscle are all affected by that because they're not being held like a structure - they're sort of swimming around,\" she told the programme.\n\"I'm just in pain constantly - everything hurts.\" \nTaylor said she was referred for an outpatient rheumatology appointment two years ago.\nWhen she phoned in January this year to check her progress on the waiting list, she said she was told it could be approximately another six years.\nThe South Eastern Trust said it could not comment on individual cases.\nIn a statement the trust said it was \"very conscious that patients have to wait for a significant time to receive a first outpatient rheumatology appointment\" and that it understood the \"distress\" this could cause for patients.\nAs part of the programme, Spotlight brought together a panel of health experts to come up with ways to try and tackle Northern Ireland's waiting list crisis.\nThey included the former director of public health, Professor Gabriel Scally, health economist Professor Dame Carol Propper and former chief executive of the Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Board John Compton.\nThe panel agreed that more accountability within the health service was needed, along with the introduction of a performance management regime.\nIt also recommended greater involvement with the public and strong political leadership, which the experts said were all required to try to fix the current waiting list crisis.\nThe Department of Health told Spotlight that Northern Ireland's hospital waiting times were \"entirely unacceptable\" and had been \"made significantly worse by the pandemic\".\n\"Far too many people in our community [are] waiting far too long for assessment and treatment\" the department said.\nIt said a key component in tackling waiting times was a greater separation of elective care from urgent and emergency care.\n\"This ringfences staffing, bed capacity and theatre capacity for elective treatments, helping to increase the number of patients treated and reducing cancellations due to emergency cases,\" the department said in a statement.\nIt added: \"Reconfiguration of our hospital services is under way with the establishment of day procedure centres and elective overnight stay centres.\"\nSpotlight How Do We Fix Our Waiting Lists?

Jade Ward had previously been known as Jade Marsh.\nMs Ward's parents, Karen Robinson and Paul Ward, have been campaigning for a change in the law since her murder. \nEdwin Duggan, a friend of the Ward family and campaigner for Jade's Law, said he felt overjoyed, but also shocked following previous setbacks.  \n\"There was a lot of restraint on the [Ministry of Justice] side.

Our argument was they shouldn't have it in the first place.\n\"When this goes through, I know it will save lives. Families in the future will not have to go through what Karen and Paul have.\"\nThe announcement was welcomed by Mark Tami, the Labour MP for Alyn and Deeside, who has been supporting the family's campaign.\nHe said: \"I'm delighted that the government has finally changed their mind despite telling me for so long that it couldn't be done.\"\nAn online petition got more than 130,000 signatures and triggered a parliamentary debate.\nIn July an amendment to a Bill to suspend the rights of killer parents in jail was turned down by MPs.\nThe Ministry of Justice said legislation was already in place for judges to \"effectively remove all rights and powers from a parent who has murdered the other\", but it added it was \"eager to go further.\"  \nJustice Secretary Alex Chalk will outline plans to introduce Jade's Law at the Conservative conference later on Tuesday.\nHe said the campaign had \"exposed an injustice\" in the system.\n\"Murderers who kill their partners should not be able to manipulate and control their children from behind bars, which is why we are fixing the law to protect families from this appalling behaviour,\" he said. \nThe new legislation will introduce an automatic suspension of parental responsibility while any mother or father is serving time for killing the person they shared that responsibility with.\nIt means the burden will no longer be on family members to apply to the family court to ask for the parental rights of a killer to be removed.\nThere will be an exemption for parents who kill their partner in a relationship with a history of domestic abuse.\nThe measures will be introduced to parliament as part of the Victims and Prisoners Bill before the end of the year.\nMan jailed for murdering wife as children slept\nFamily has setback stopping killer parents' rights\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

I could move around in my surroundings confidently. \nThe same held true as I tried Stranger Things - a mixed reality game version of the hit Netflix series. I didn't feel sick at all.\nChris Cox, chief product officer at Meta, said that mixed reality \"changes drastically how comfortable the [VR] experience is\". \nHis team knows \"context switches\" - from reality to VR - \"can be tough\". \nBut here's the thing: if the solution to solving VR sickness is to avoid playing full VR is that really a fix?\nMr Zuckerberg thinks motion sickness can be reduced with better graphics and less latency (the delay between doing something and seeing it on the headset).\nHe hopes that the better the headsets get, the fewer people will report problems. \nBut part of feeling ill is based simply on your eyes seeing things that the rest of your body isn't experiencing. \nSo I had a go at a completely virtual reality boxing game. I pulled the headset over my eyes, and suddenly my surroundings were gone.\nI played for a few minutes, punching imaginary targets. The graphics felt crisper - light-years ahead of earlier models. But for me, it was still not enough. \nI didn't feel sick, but an unwanted dizziness began to creep in, meaning my brain was still telling me that it is not enjoying the experience. \nAs Mr Zuckerberg acknowledges, people experience motion sickness differently. Some people get sea sickness, and some don't. \nSome people play VR for hours on end without a problem. But I can't. \nMixed reality is still very new, with few games. But maybe it is the solution for people like me who like the idea of playing games virtually - but haven't the stomach for it. \nMeta launches $7.99 a month virtual reality service\nMeta announces AI chatbots with 'personality'\nMeta to let parents limit teen virtual-reality use\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Cricket World Cup 2023: What the stats say about all 10 teams at tournament", "date": "2023-10-03 08:59:13", "text": "\nLast updated on 1 hour ago1 hour ago.From the section Cricket\nThe World Cup in India is a matter of days away.\nEngland are one of 10 teams competing and will hope to defend their title after the famous victory on home soil in 2019.\nCan Jos Buttler's side do it again? Will hosts India make most of home advantage? Will we see a surprise winner?\nTo help answer those questions BBC Sport has worked with data analysts CricViz to produce a team-by-team guide to the 10 participating nations.\nCricViz win probability: 1.3%\nThe statistics paint a mixed picture for Afghanistan between bat and ball. \nThey have a bowling economy rate of 6.62 in the last 10 overs since the last World Cup, the best of any full member nation. However, they have only scored at 6.74 in the last 10 overs in the same timeframe - the lowest of any full member nation.\nCrucial player: Rashid Khan \nNo bowler has more wickets in the Indian Premier League than Rashid Khan's 139 since the leg-spinner made his debut in the competition in 2017.\nCricViz win probability: 15.6%\nFive-time winners Australia have great batting depth - Cameron Green could bat as low as eight in a squad packed full of all-rounders. But they are short in the spin department, with Ashton Agar's injury meaning Adam Zampa is the sole spinner in the squad.\nCrucial player: Glenn Maxwell \nThe powerful all-rounder averages 37 and has a strike-rate of 180 in overs 41-50 since the last World Cup - and his off-spin will be needed too.\nCricViz win probability: 2.9%\nSince the last World Cup, Bangladesh have a strong home record (16 wins, nine defeats) but have been less convincing away from home (nine wins, 12 defeats). They will also be unfamiliar with conditions - Bangladesh have only ever played nine one-day internationals in India, and none since 2006.\nCrucial player: Shakib Al-Hasan\nThe Bangladesh captain was one of only three players to score more than 600 runs in the 2019 World Cup, alongside Rohit Sharma and David Warner.\nCricViz win probability: 17.3%\nEngland have a catch success rate of 84% in one-day internationals since the last World Cup, the highest of all 10 teams competing in this tournament. \nBut with the bat, the end of the Jason Roy-Jonny Bairstow opening partnership has seen a drop-off in their powerplay scoring rate. In 2023, they have scored at 5.30 runs per over in the first 10 overs, their lowest since 2014.\nCrucial player: Ben Stokes \nThe talismanic all-rounder has finished not out in 13 of the 34 one-day international run chases he has featured in since 2015.\nCricViz win probability: 21.9%\nSince the last World Cup, India have played 66 matches, 10 more than any other team in this tournament (Sri Lanka have played the second-most games with 56). Their batting has also been particularly strong in the middle overs, going at 5.76 runs per over since the last World Cup which is second only to England (6.01).\nCrucial player: Virat Kohli \nCurrently on 47 one-day international hundreds, Kohli needs three more to overtake Sachin Tendulkar as the batter with the most hundreds in this format.\nCricViz win probability: 0.0%\nIn the World Cup Qualifiers, Netherlands' bowlers averaged under 30 with an economy rate of just 4.12 in the first 10 overs, and that was without Paul van Meekeren who will improve that area of their game even further. They are less potent in the middle overs, averaging 59 between overs 11 and 40 in the past two years.\nCrucial player: Bas de Leede\nThe 23-year-old all-rounder averaged 48 with a strike rate of 101 in this year's World Cup Qualifiers. He also took 15 wickets at an average of 22 in the competition.\nCricViz win probability: 8.5%\nSince the start of 2010, New Zealand have only won 29% of the one-day internationals they have played in India, with six victories in the 21 matches they have played in that time. \nThey have also struggled with their bowling at the death recently, conceding runs at 7.91 per over in that phase since the last World Cup, the second highest among full members.\nCrucial player: Trent Boult \nThe left-arm seamer took 39 wickets in the past two World Cups, second only to Australia's Mitchell Starc (49).\nCricViz win probability: 11.6%\nIn the middle overs since the last World Cup, Pakistan average 45.98 runs per wicket, largely thanks to Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan. \nThey also have two of the fastest bowlers in the tournament in Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf. Shaheen's potency with the new ball and Rauf's death-over skills make them a complementary threat.\nCrucial player: Shaheen Shah Afridi\nAnother pacey left-armer, Shaheen averages just 24 with the ball in the first 10 overs of one-day internationals and took 4-35 against India in Pallekele last month.\nCricViz win probability: 14.1%\nHeinrich Klaasen is arguably the in-form batter in the world in this format, but South Africa have a concerningly long tail, with Keshav Maharaj likely to bat as high as eight, with Marco Jansen at seven.\nCrucial player: Heinrich Klaasen \nThe big-hitting wicketkeeper-batter averages 59 with a strike-rate of 151 in one-day internationals in 2023, including a brilliant 174 from just 83 deliveries against Australia in September - the highest ODI score for a batter coming in in the 25th over or later.\nCricViz win probability: 6.8%\nEven without the injured Wanindu Hasaranga, Sri Lanka have a dangerous spin attack, with Maheesh Theekshana (eight wickets at 29, economy of 5.15 in the Asia Cup) and Dunith Wellalage (10 wickets at 18, economy of 4.26 in the Asia Cup). \nBut they have struggled with the bat at the death recently, scoring at just 7.21 runs per over in the last 10 overs since the 2019 World Cup, higher only than Afghanistan in that time.\nCrucial player: Charith Asalanka \nThe left-hander, who made his ODI debut in 2021, averages 60 against spin bowling. He scored a century against Australia in Pallekele in 2022.\nPeter Fincham and Jon Plowman hear the inside story of one of the biggest TV comedies\nYou’ve heard the name Napoleon Bonaparte, but who was he really?\nPreview the fifth and final series of the grown-up comedy from the Horrible Histories team\n26 years after being washed off a cargo ship, the tiny toys are still coming ashore...\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCan Burnley, Luton Town and Sheffield United transform their seasons with all three of the promoted teams struggling in the Premier League?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}

{"title": "All Onewheel e-skateboards recalled worldwide after four deaths", "date": "2023-10-03 09:58:28", "text": "All Onewheel electric skateboards sold worldwide will be recalled after four people died while riding them.\nUS watchdog the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recalled all 300,000 devices sold in the US, citing a risk of crashes causing serious injuries.\nFuture Motion, which makes Onewheels, told the BBC the recall applies to all customers, not just those in the US.\nA UK government spokesperson told the BBC it would make enquiries and \"take action swiftly\" if required.\nFuture Motion said that UK customers could visit its website to view their options, which range from a software update to a $100 (£82) store credit, depending on the make and model of their skateboard.\nRecall requests must be submitted through a link on Future Motion's website.\nIn the recall notice, the CPSC said there were four reported deaths involving Onewheels between 2019 and 2021, as well as significant injuries such as \"traumatic brain injury, concussion, paralysis, upper-body fractures, lower-body fractures and ligament damage\". \nThe watchdog said the four deaths were a result of head trauma, and the reports showed that in at least three of those incidents the rider was not wearing a helmet. \nFuture Motion and the CPSC both encourage people to wear protective equipment while riding, such as helmets and knee pads.\nAccording to a legal document filed by the firm in September, it is facing 31 lawsuits in the US from people who \"allege that they fell because the Onewheel stopped or shut off unexpectedly\".\nIt said in the filings that no case relating to the electric skateboards had ever been tested in court.\nThe recall involves all models of Onewheel electric skateboards, which includes the original Onewheel, as well as the Onewheel+, Onewheel+ XR, Onewheel Pint, Onewheel Pint X and Onewheel GT models.\nIt comes after one UK store - The Snowboard Shop - pulled the electric skateboards from sale.\nIt said people who had purchased Onewheels would be notified while it looked into the issue, and it had approached the manufacturer for clarification.\nIt has chosen to keep the products on its website in order to provide a link to the product recall notice, but there is no \"buy\" button. Would-be customers can instead only \"enquire\" about them, and it is responding to enquiries with information about the recall.\nOther distributors of Onewheel electric skateboards in the UK have also been approached for comment.\nLast year, the CPSC urged people to stop using Onewheels. At the time, Future Motion objected and said they were safe \"when operated following basic safe riding principles common to any board sport\".\nIt said there was no reason for people to stop using their devices.\nIn a section of its website dedicated to the recall, Future Motion said it had \"an innovative new safety alert feature\" which some Onewheel owners could install via a firmware update in the coming weeks to make their devices safer.\nThe feature, named haptic buzz, is an alert that electric skateboard riders can \"hear and feel when experiencing certain situations that can result in a crash\", according to the firm's website.\n\"Haptic buzz is designed to work in conjunction with the existing pushback safety feature to help riders further recognize that the board's ability to balance may soon be exceeded so they can lean back and slow down to avoid crashing,\" it reads.\nHowever, it can only be used by customers with Onewheel GT, Pint X, Pint, and XR devices. \nThose with original Onewheel and Onewheel+ electric skateboards, which have since been discontinued, are instead entitled to a $100 (£82) credit towards a new device - which retail between $1,050 and $2,200.\nDo you own a Onewheel electric skateboard?

{"title": "15 minute cities: How they got caught in conspiracy theories", "date": "2023-10-03 10:16:20", "text": "Conspiracy theories linking \"15-minute cities\" to sinister ploys to control people may once have been the preserve of fringe groups on social media, but have they now entered the mainstream of British politics?\nSpeaking at the Conservative Party conference on Monday, Transport Secretary Mark Harper said he was \"calling time on the misuse of so-called '15-minute cities'\".\nOriginally an urban planning concept, the \"15-minute city\" idea is aimed at providing people in cities with basic services within a quarter of an hour's walk or bike ride of where they live.\n\"There's nothing wrong with making sure people can walk or cycle to the shops or school,\" said Mr Harper. \"That's traditional town planning.\"\n\"What is sinister and what we shouldn't tolerate is the idea that local councils can decide how often you go to the shops and that they ration who uses the roads and when, and they police it all with CCTV.\"\nBut this is not an accurate characterisation of \"15-minute cities\". \nThey do not give councils special powers to restrict people's freedom of movement. And, while they are meant to reduce car traffic, they do not stop people from using other forms of transport.\nMr Harper did not respond to the BBC's requests to clarify his comments, which appear to echo conspiracy theories about sinister plots linked to the concept of \"15-minute cities\". \nHis speech follows government plans to \"back drivers\" by preventing councils from enforcing schemes that \"aggressively restrict\" where people drive. \nThe creator of \"15-minute cities\", urban planner Carlos Moreno, issued a statement later on Monday calling on the government to reconsider its stance.\n\"Associating the '15-minute city' again with so-called 'liberty-restricting' measures is tantamount to aligning with the most radical and anti-democratic elements,\" he wrote.\nThe idea behind \"15-minute cities\" is everyone lives within a 15 minute walk or bike ride from all basic services we need - be it schools, clinics, or parks.\nThe ultimate goal is to reduce traffic, but also emissions that are driving global warming. \nBut critics argue that cars remain central to many people's livelihoods and it is still virtually impossible for many to access alternative forms of transport. \nSeveral councils have incorporated \"15-minute cities\" into their policy plans, including Canterbury, Ipswich, and Bristol.\nOnline conspiracy theories have blossomed around the topic - many claim the schemes are designed to control the population and trap them in their homes.\nHowever, no council is planning to stop people from travelling beyond the 15-minute radius. Instead, the aim is to provide more essential services within a short distance of people's homes.\nTelegram channels devoted to spreading conspiracy theories around Covid-19 or the war in Ukraine have frequently spread false claims around the concept, linking it to all-encompassing conspiracy theories like the \"Great Reset\".\nEven before last week's government announcement, it was still possible to find hundreds of posts on other platforms pushing false claims around \"15-minute cities\".\nIt was in Oxford where this idea truly sparked a misinformation storm.\nLast November, Oxfordshire County Council approved the creation of traffic filters, enforced through cameras in six key locations. \nPrivate cars would not be allowed through without a permit (which they could use up to 100 days per year), but all other vehicles would be exempt - to incentivise the use of public transport and cycling.\nThe BBC understands that Oxford was one of the places Mr Harper had in mind when he spoke of councils that \"ration who uses the roads and when\".\nBut, while some people may find this \"controlling\", it is definitely not the same as a \"15-minute city\".\nThe traffic filters scheme attracted significant opposition from people worried about the impact the measures might have on their mobility and livelihoods.\nBut online, a separate conversation appeared to be taking place - one that tapped into genuine grievances against the trial, blending them with rumours pushed by far-right blogs and fringe media outlets around the world.\nOn social media, some users suggested this was part of a sinister plot to confine people to their local areas for the sake of the environment.\nOthers wrongly linked the traffic filters scheme to a separate council proposal to introduce 15-minute neighbourhoods in Oxford.\nOxfordshire County Council publicly dismissed claims suggesting a link between the two, as well as the claim that traffic filters will be used to confine people to their local area.\nBut soon the social media frenzy also began having a real impact offline: councillors received death threats. Others were faced with anxious questions from residents.\n\"People have come up to me and said: is it true that we're not going to be allowed out of our houses, that it's going to be just like the coronavirus lockdown?\", Emily Kerr, from Oxford City Council, told the BBC at the time. \nLeafletting campaigns accusing councils of treating people like guinea pigs were organised. \nSoon enough, council meetings in other parts of the country were being interrupted by protesters.\nAs false claims spread online, the subject was briefly raised in Parliament.\nIn February, Nick Fletcher, Conservative MP for Don Valley, asked the government to hold a debate on what he described as \"the international socialist concept of so-called 15-minute cities and 20-minute neighbourhoods\", which he said \"will take away personal freedoms\".\nIn response, the leader of the House of Commons, Penny Mordaunt, said that \"where such policies are brought forward, local communities ought to be properly consulted\".\nSpeaking to Radio 4's PM programme, the minister for Nuclear and Networks, Andrew Bowie, appeared to agree with Mr Harper:\n\"This is coming up in discussions on door-steps up and down the country, it's coming up in discussions forums, online\"\n \"People are concerned and we need to address those concerns.\"\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?\nWhy were Oxford residents called 'guinea pigs'?\nLockdown conspiracy theory leads to death threats in UK city\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

Prior to the laureates' breakthroughs, they effectively appeared as blurs under the most advanced microscopes - their movement and behaviour was too rapid to follow.\nEva Olsson, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said: \"We can now open the door to the world of electrons. Attosecond physics gives us the opportunity to understand mechanisms that are governed by electrons.\"\n\"Attosecond physics\" is bringing important processes inside atoms and molecules into sharper focus. The development is likely to lead to even more accurate electron microscopes, much faster electronics and new tests able to diagnose diseases at a much earlier stage. \nProf L'Huillier, who is based at Lund University in Sweden, is only the fifth woman to win a physics Nobel. On a line that dropped out briefly - and sounding somewhat dazed - she addressed the press conference at the Royal Swedish Academy. \n\"It's incredible,\" she said. \"There are not so many women that get this prize - so it's very, very special,\" she said. \nShe explained that the Nobel Committee had called three times before she answered the phone. \"I was teaching,\" she said, joking that the last half-hour of her lecture, after she found out, was \"quite difficult\".\nProf Pierre Agostini is based at Ohio State University in the US, Prof Ferenc Kraus is at Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Germany.\nThis video can not be played\nHow do you they pick a Nobel prize winner?\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, announced on Monday, was awarded to a pair of scientists who developed the technology that led to the mRNA Covid vaccines.\nProfessors Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman shared the prize.\nNobel Prize winners: 'I thought it was an anti-vaxxer prank'\nNobel rewards 'spooky science' of entanglement\nA&F investigating ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims\n14-year-old held over Bangkok shopping mall shooting\nUS Speaker McCarthy faces historic bid to oust him\nMarriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples\nHow Mike Jeffries used shirtless models to sell Abercrombie\nThe lives upended by colonial rule in the Middle East\nThe ugly street harassment that killed an Indian girl\nWhy a rare gun charge against Hunter Biden could misfire\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nHow a sex abuse ring targeted Gabon's child footballers\nCrossing the Alps on foot to try to reach the UK\nWhy shutdowns seem to only happen in US\nThe companies paying for workers' holidays\nThe dress that shocked the world\nA place with air so clean it's bottled\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Abercrombie & Fitch launches investigation into ex-CEO sexual misconduct claims", "date": "2023-10-03 10:50:16", "text": "Clothing brand Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F) says it is investigating allegations against its former CEO. \nMike Jeffries has been accused of exploiting men at sex events he hosted around the world.\nA BBC investigation found an organised network used a middleman to recruit young adult men for the events with Mr Jeffries and his partner Matthew Smith, with some alleging they were abused.\nMr Jeffries and Mr Smith did not respond to requests for comment. \nA&F - which runs about 850 stores worldwide, including its Hollister brand - said that since being contacted by the BBC it had engaged an \"outside law firm to conduct an independent investigation\" into the claims. It said it was \"appalled and disgusted\" by the alleged behaviour.\nThere is no evidence that the company was aware of the allegations of exploitation at sex events uncovered by the BBC.\nIt has previously described Mr Jeffries as the modern-day founder of the company, after he transformed the brand from a failing heritage outfitter in the 1990s to a multi-billion-dollar teen retailer. He stepped down in 2014 following declining sales and left with a retirement package valued at around $25m (£20.5m), according to company filings at the time. \nBBC Panorama reported that in the months before Mike Jeffries' exit, a pension fund invested in A&F brought legal proceedings in which it claimed the company had paid out settlements after allegations of \"misconduct\" by its then-CEO.\nA source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had seen internal documents describing payoffs for staff and agency workers who had complained about Mr Jeffries' behaviour. The source said he did not know the nature of the complaints.\nBBC Panorama asked A&F if the complaints were of a sexual nature, but the company refused to answer. \nAfter the BBC's published its investigation into claims of exploitation at sex events on Monday, A&F said it was \"not aware of the allegations of sexual misconduct\", and that its new leadership had transformed the company into \"the values-driven organisation we are today\".\nThe two-year BBC investigation uncovered allegations that Mr Jeffries exploited men for sex at events he hosted in his New York residences and luxurious hotels around the world, including in London, Paris, Venice, and Marrakesh.\nTwelve men described attending or organising events involving sex acts run for the fashion mogul, 79, and his British partner Mr Smith, 60, between 2009 and 2015.\nThe eight men who attended the events said they were recruited by a middleman, who they described as having a missing nose covered with a snakeskin patch. The BBC has identified him as James Jacobson.\nHalf the men who told the BBC about their recruitment alleged they had been initially misled about the nature of the events or not told sex was involved. Others said they understood the events would be sexual, but not exactly what was expected of them. All were paid.\nMr Jacobson denied any wrongdoing and said men went into the events \"with their eyes wide open\".\nWarning: This story contains descriptions of sexual acts\nMen who attended these events told the BBC Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith would engage in sexual activity with about four men - or \"direct\" them to have sex with each other. Afterwards, the men said staff at the event handed them envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in cash.\nDavid Bradberry, then 23, said he was introduced in 2010 to Mr Jacobson by an agent who described him as the gatekeeper to \"the owners\" of A&F, but said there was no mention of sex. At their meeting, he said Mr Jacobson suggested Bruce Weber - then A&F's official photographer - should take his picture. \nThen, Mr Bradberry said: \"Jim made it clear to me that unless I let him perform oral sex on me, that I would not be meeting with Abercrombie & Fitch or Mike Jeffries.\" He said he felt as though he was \"paralysed\".\nLooking back, he said this incident should have been \"a red flag\" but he thought Mr Jacobson \"was just a creepy old dude that I wouldn't have to see again\". \nMr Bradberry later accepted an invitation to a daytime event at Mr Jeffries' former home in the Hamptons on New York's Long Island - recently sold for $29m. While there, he said he spoke to Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith about his aspirations to be an A&F model. Then, he said, Mr Jeffries held \"poppers\" under his nose - a drug which can cause a strong head-rush and disorientation - and later had sex with him.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Signing an NDA \"felt like intimidation\" - David Bradberry\nAnother man, Barrett Pall said he felt pressured into attending an event in the Hamptons in 2011. Then 22, he said he was recruited by an older model, who received a referral fee, to be his \"replacement\" for \"some sort of sexual experience\" with the couple. He said he agreed because the older model had financially supported him and he felt indebted to him.\nMr Pall said the older model told him \"you don't have to do anything you don't want to do\" but suggested that \"the further you go, the better\", and alluded to career opportunities. When he arrived at the event, he said he felt under pressure to \"perform\". At one point, Mr Pall said Mr Jeffries was behind him, groping him.\n\"This experience, I think it broke me,\" he said. \"I think that this stole any ounce of innocence that I had left. It mentally messed me up. But with the language I now have today, I can sit here and tell you that I was taken advantage of.\"\nThe largest event described to the BBC was hosted in a private villa at a five-star hotel in 2011, for which dozens of men were flown to Marrakesh. The BBC understands Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith had also invited friends. Alex - who asked for his name to be changed to protect his identity - said he was a struggling model supporting his family back home when he was recruited as a dancer for the event, where he expected he would have to strip. \nAlex, a straight man then in his 20s, said he was auditioned by Mr Jacobson, who praised his dancing but demanded he \"finish the job\" by performing oral sex on him. \"I had debt, I wanted to support my family,\" said Alex. \"I performed the job and I was, like, disgusted.\"\nThinking \"the hardest part was out of the way\", Alex flew to Marrakesh for the event a few weeks later. But moments into his dance, he said, Mr Jeffries tried to kiss him. \"I was trying to be in it without offending him. I was extremely uncomfortable,\" Alex said.\nEventually, he said he went to hide in a back room where he fell asleep. Alex said he woke up with a condom inside him and feared that the champagne he had been given earlier had been spiked. \n\"When I put things together, I believe there is a very good possibility I was drugged and raped. I'll probably never, never know for sure the answer of what happened,\" he said.\nWatch Panorama's The Abercrombie Guys: The Dark Side of Cool, on BBC iPlayer now.\nListen to the podcast series, World of Secrets: Season 1 - The Abercrombie Guys, available on BBC Sounds.\nThe Abercrombie Guys: the Dark Side of Cool will be released in the US on October 6 on BBC Select, available to audiences via Amazon Prime Video Channels, the Apple TV app and The Roku Channel.\nA civil lawyer, who examined the BBC's evidence, said US prosecutors should investigate whether what these \"brave men\" describe could be sex trafficking. Under US law, sex trafficking includes getting an adult to travel to another state or country to have sex for money by using force, fraud or coercion. \n\"There may have been evidence of coercion for some of the men, whereas others might not have felt the coercive tactics,\" Brad Edwards said.\nHe also said Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith might argue the men were consenting adults and the fact that some had engaged in commercial sex in the past was \"a factor\", although he said past actions were \"really irrelevant\" to whether a particular commercial sex act was because of force, fraud or coercion. \n\"Given the stories of these brave men that have come forward, I think it's very important that federal prosecutors look into this case,\" Mr Edwards said, adding there was a \"very high\" burden of proof for prosecutors, however.\nThe BBC made repeated attempts by letter, email and phone, over several weeks, to contact Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith, inviting them to respond to a detailed list of allegations to ensure they were fully aware of the claims against them. They have not responded.\nMr Jacobson - the middleman, now aged 70 - said in a statement through his lawyer that he took offence at the suggestion of \"any coercive, deceptive or forceful behaviour on my part\" and had \"no knowledge of any such conduct by others\".\nHe said he did not recall making promises of modelling opportunities. \"Any encounter I had was fully consensual, not coercive,\" he said. \"Everyone I came into contact with who attended these events went in with their eyes wide open.\"\nDo you have information about this story that you want to share?

{"title": "NewsClick: Raid on India news site over China funding claims", "date": "2023-10-03 10:54:03", "text": "Police in the Indian capital, Delhi, have raided the homes of several prominent journalists and authors in connection with an investigation into the funding of news website NewsClick.\nPolice have seized mobile phones and laptops of those they raided on Tuesday morning.\nOfficials are reportedly investigating allegations that NewsClick got illegal funds from China - a charge it denies. \nCritics say the move is an intentional attack on press freedom.\nStarted in 2009, NewsClick is an independent news and current affairs website which is known to be critical of the government. In 2021, it was raided by tax authorities on allegations of breaking India's foreign direct investment rules. \nThe co-ordinated raids at 30 locations on Tuesday are some of the largest and most extensive on India's media in recent years. Opposition leaders have called it the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) government's \"fresh attack on the media\". \nBut Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur has denied any involvement of the government, saying that the investigative agencies were merely doing their job. \nAmong those who have been searched are NewsClick editor Prabir Purkayastha, journalists Abhisar Sharma, Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, Aunindyo Chakravarty, Bhasha Singh, popular satirist Sanjay Rajoura and historian Sohail Hashmi. Some of them have been taken to police stations for questioning.\nSearches were also under way at the website's office in Delhi, along with 30 other locations, news agency ANI reported. \nIn Mumbai city, activist Teesta Setalvad's house was also searched. Ms Setalvad has long fought for victims of the deadly 2002 riots in Gujarat state and has written articles critical of the government for Newsclick.\nA source close of Mr Purkayastha told the BBC that more than 15 policemen arrived at his home at 06:30 local time (01:00GMT). \n\"They did not produce any warrants or paperwork, questioned him for several hours and took away all the electronic devices they found at home,\" they said. Later, news agencies showed him being taken away by the police in a vehicle. \nMr Rajoura's lawyer Ilin Saraswat said the comedian was raided at the same time and that police took away his laptop, his two phones, some DVDs of his old work and some documents. \n\"The police said that Mr Rajoura is not named in the current investigation, but since he has worked with the website, he will be interrogated.

NewsClick has strongly denied all the charges as false. \nAll the people who were raided have been associated with NewsClick - some are employees while others have worked on freelance projects. \nPrabir Purkayastha, the founder and editor-in-chief of the website, is the author of a number of books. During the 1975 Emergency - when civil liberties were suspended - he was jailed along with several opposition politicians.An engineering major, he is also a science activist and a founding member of the Delhi Science Forum, a non-profit that works in the areas of science and technology policies\nBhasha Singh is an activist and journalist who has reported extensively on manual scavenging and farmers' suicides in northern India. On Sunday, she attended a national conference by the All India Progressive Women's Association where she accused the the government of being anti-women. \nA day later, she appeared in a Newsclick video, expressing concern over the increasing trend of praising Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse by members of India's governing BJP party. \nAbhisar Sharma is well-known video journalist with over 1.8m followers on X and nearly 3m subscribers on his YouTube channel. He worked for BBC Hindi before moving on to work as a Hindi presenter at the NDTV news channel. \nMr Sharma is known for his critical views of the government.

{"title": "Six speech takeaways: From banning smoking to hailing Thatcher", "date": "2023-10-04 14:35:47", "text": "This video can not be played\nRishi Sunak: I am cancelling the rest of the HS2 project\nHere's what we learned from Rishi Sunak's first speech to the Conservative conference as prime minister.\nAfter weeks in which he kept insisting no decision had been made, Rishi Sunak finally announced what everyone suspected - the northern leg of the HS2 project is being cancelled.\nAxing the biggest infrastructure project in Europe is a major step and the prime minister did his best to own it. He promised to spend all of the money saved on local transport improvements, trams, buses rail, roads - many, many roads. \nQuestions remain about how all of this will work in practice - and the backlash against the cancellation of the high speed line to Manchester is already fierce. \nBut the ball is now in the opposition's court - will Labour promise to reverse the HS2 decision and cancel all of those local transport projects?\nPerhaps the most remarkable thing about Mr Sunak's speech was his claim that for the past 30 years, politics has failed. That encompasses every prime minister since Margaret Thatcher, in other words, including five Conservative ones.\n\"We've had 30 years of a political system which incentivises the easy decision, not the right one,\" he told the packed hall.\n\"Thirty years of vested interests standing in the way of change. Thirty years of rhetorical ambition which achieves little more than a short-term headline.\" \nMr Sunak is not the first Tory leader to try to cast himself as Thatcher's heir. But he may be the first to attempt to disown his immediate predecessors as party leader.\nIndeed, the only previous Tory leaders who got a nod of approval in his speech - apart from Thatcher - were Disraeli, Churchill... and Iain Duncan Smith.\nIndeed he did - 30 times in fact. \"Our mission is to fundamentally change our country,\" he told the party faithful. \n\"If this country is to change, then it can only be us who will deliver it,\" he added.\n\"Change only endures if we bring people with us.\"\nAnd so on. He badly wants to be seen as the \"change candidate\" at next year's general election - not an easy task after 13 years of Conservative rule.\nEducation is a major theme for Mr Sunak - and he used his conference speech to announce a string of new policies aimed at boosting the prospects of 16 to 19-year-olds. \nMerging A-levels with T-levels into a new Advanced British Standard qualification - which will only be available in England - is another example of tearing up a policy - T-levels - that was brought in by the Conservative government. \nBut overall, this was a major incursion into traditional Labour territory, not least the promise of a £30,000 cash bonus for teachers. \nThe PM's plan to end smoking for the next generation by raising the age at which cigarettes can be purchased every year will be seen as genuinely radical. New Zealand is the only other country in the world to attempt this.\nIt is clearly a subject the PM feels strongly about. It will be attacked by the libertarian right as nanny statism and there will be questions about how it will be enforced in practice, but how many MPs will oppose it when they are take part in the free vote Mr Sunak has promised on it?\nThe surprise appearance on stage of Mr Sunak's wife Akshata Murty - who has kept a pretty low profile to this point - went down very well in the hall.\nShe was able to deliver a message about the PM's background and values that meant more than if he had spoken about them himself. \nIt was a personal and at times touching five minute curtain raiser for the main event.

{"title": "Would Labour tax meat? And other Conservative claims checked", "date": "2023-10-04 15:57:13", "text": "Rishi Sunak and his government ministers have been busy making speeches and giving interviews at the annual Conservative party conference.\nHere are some of the claims from their time in Manchester.\nIn his speech, Mr Sunak said: \"Labour's plan is to cook up some deal with the EU which could see us accepting around 100,000 of Europe's asylum seekers.\"\nThe Conservatives first used this figure in September, after Labour said it would seek a returns agreement with the EU.\nBut the 100,000 figure is misleading. The Conservatives worked it out by claiming that Labour would be forced to take a share of the EU's migrant quota, worked out according to population size. \nThe party's press release said around a million asylum seekers arrived in the EU in 2022. The UK's population is just under 13% of the EU's, so - it claimed - this would mean Labour taking more than 100,000 asylum seekers a year. \nBut the EU has no such scheme in place. It is negotiating a deal which includes relocating at least 30,000 asylum seekers a year between EU member states based on several criteria, including population size. The countries would not be forced to take asylum seekers and could choose to make a payment instead.\nLabour has said it would not join an EU quota scheme because the UK is no longer an EU member. It has not said how many asylum seekers it would accept under any future deal it negotiated. \nEnergy Secretary Claire Coutinho told the conference: \"It's no wonder Labour seems so relaxed about taxing meat\".\nWe asked Labour whether they were considering introducing a meat tax. They replied: \"Taxing meat is not Labour policy\". \nPressed by Sophy Ridge on Sky News about her claim, Ms Coutinho said it was \"good to have a light moment in your speech\". \nSpeaking on the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg's programme, the prime minister would not promise to cut taxes and instead wanted to focus on inflation.\nHe said: \"The best tax cut I can deliver for the British people is to halve inflation.\"\nWhen challenged on this he repeated: \"Inflation is a tax.\"\nInflation is not a tax, although high inflation can clearly make people worse off because it means higher prices.\nA tax is a charge or levy made by a government, typically to pay for services.\nMr Sunak also wanted to highlight his record in reducing inflation. He said: \"I spent the first year stabilising things, making progress on bringing inflation down.\"\nThe PM's pledged to halve it from 10.7% at the end of 2022, to 5.3% by the end of 2023 and it has been coming down. \nDespite the recent falls - to 6.7% in the year to August - analysts remain divided about whether the PM's goal will be achieved.\nHowever, the Bank of England said that it expected inflation to be about 5% by the end of the year.\nCore inflation, which strips out factors like energy and food - which are more vulnerable to global price swings - has seen only a modest reduction.\nBefore the prime minister scrapped part of HS2, his chancellor Jeremy Hunt was already warning about spending on the project. \nHe said \"it costs 10 times more\" to build high speed rail in the UK than France.\nBBC Verify asked the Treasury how this figure was calculated. It did not provide the detail, directing us instead to the Conservative Party, which did not reply. \nThere are no recent comparisons between the cost in France and the UK.\nIn 2015, a House of Lords report estimated the cost of building HS2 at \"up to nine times higher than the cost of constructing high speed lines in France\".\nThe report estimated the HS2 Phase One construction (which started at 2017) cost at around £90m per kilometre while similar projects in France, carried out between 1990 to 2011, cost between £9m-£15m per kilometre (in 2010 prices).\nThe report said possible reasons for the price difference include expensive tunnelling required in the UK but not in France, the cost of a new station at Birmingham and renovation of Euston station, as well as the state of the UK railway construction industry.\nMr Sunak also told BBC News the UK had decarbonised faster than any other country in the G7.\nThe G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest \"advanced\" economies, which includes the UK.\nIt is true the UK has decarbonised faster than other countries in this group when comparing cuts to greenhouse gas emissions since 1990.\nUK emissions had fallen by 48.7% up to the end of 2022, according to government data.\nThis figure refers to greenhouse gas emissions within the UK. It does not account for the UK's total carbon footprint, which includes emissions related to the manufacture of products that the UK imports from abroad, for example.\nDefence Secretary Grant Shapps told the conference: \"We have provided billions in military aid (to Ukraine) - second only to the contribution of the US.\"\nThe US is by far the largest contributor of arms to Ukraine - providing £24.6bn ($29.8bn) in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022.\nThe UK gave £2.3bn ($2.8bn) billion in 2022, and pledged the same amount in 2023 - taking its total commitments to £4.6bn ($5.6bn) since the start of the war.\nHowever, Germany has committed to providing £6.4bn ($7.7bn) over the same period, which would put it second to the US, in front of the UK.\nGermany provided £1.7bn ($2.1bn) in military aid in 2022 and pledged a further £4.7bn ($5.7bn) for 2023.\nIt is possible that Mr Shapps was basing his claim on 2022 military aid alone, but this wasn't made clear in his speech.\nWe have asked the UK Ministry of Defence to clarify his comments.\nThe Kiel Institute, a team of researchers which tracks the amount countries have pledged in military aid to Ukraine, also puts Germany in second place ahead of the UK.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "The facts have changed, says Rishi Sunak, as he scraps HS2 leg", "date": "2023-10-04 17:26:16", "text": "This video can not be played\nRishi Sunak: I am cancelling the rest of the HS2 project\n\"The facts have changed,\" the PM has said, as he confirmed the HS2 high-speed rail line from Birmingham to Manchester would be scrapped.\nAddressing his party conference, Rishi Sunak said the project had come from a \"false consensus\" that links between big cities were \"all that matters\".\nHe announced he would instead invest in transport projects across the country. \nHe also set out plans for a a new post-16 qualification and to phase out smoking.\nIt was the PM's first speech to party conference as Conservative leader, and his hour-long address marked the start of a new and more risky approach from Mr Sunak.\nIt was an audacious speech from a prime minister who is often accused of political caution, and who leads a Conservative Party that has been in government for 13 years.\nHe said the public were exhausted with the politics of the last 30 years and that he was the man to deliver change. \nConceding that the public thinks it's time for a change carries significant opportunities - and significant risks. If Mr Sunak can convince voters that he offers a better chance of a new approach to government than Sir Keir Starmer, he may yet arrest the persistent and wide polling gap between the Tories and Labour.\nTalk about the scrapping of HS2 overshadowed the conference with senior Tories and Mr Sunak insisting a decision was still to be made.\nThe PM announced that the northern leg, between Birmingham and Manchester, as well as the eastern leg to East Midlands Parkway, would no longer go ahead. \nHe confirmed that the line from the West Midlands would run all the way to Euston station, not Old Oak Common in west London as had been rumoured. \nThis was accompanied by news that nearly £4bn would be reallocated to transport schemes in six northern city regions.\nThere will be £3bn for upgraded and electrified lines between Manchester and Sheffield, Sheffield and Leeds, Sheffield and Hull, and Hull to Leeds.\nHe also said money would go towards resurfacing roads across the country.\nThe decision has angered some including local leaders, such as Andy Street, the Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands, businesses in Manchester and former PM David Cameron.\nMr Cameron said it was the wrong decision, meaning a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity was lost\".\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, he said the reversal would \"make it much harder to build consensus for any future long-term projects\".\nHowever, there has been growing concern about the ballooning cost of the project, which has already seen its section to Leeds cancelled.\nThere had been speculation the decision might drive Mr Street to resign, but he has told the BBC that while disappointed he would not be quitting either his job or the party. \nLabour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden stopped short of committing the party to reviving HS2 between Birmingham and Manchester, saying it would need to \"look at the numbers\" if it won the next election. \nHe described Mr Sunak's announcement as a \"Tory fiasco\". \nLabour also said most of the transport schemes listed by the prime minister had either been previously promised or planned, so these projects did not amount to new investment. \nMr Sunak's speech also included the pledge that the age at which people can buy cigarettes and tobacco in England should rise by one year every year so that eventually no-one can buy them.\nMPs were to be given a free vote in parliament on the issue, Mr Sunak said. Former Prime Minister Liz Truss has already said she will vote against the ban.\nLabour said it would \"not play politics with public health\" and would \"lend\" the prime minister the votes to get the law passed.\nMr Sunak also announced that A-levels and T-levels would be folded into a new qualification for all school leavers, called the Advanced British Standard.\nIt will mean 16 to 19-year-olds will study five subjects instead of three, and some English and Maths to 18.\nMr Sunak's speech will have been delivered with an eye on a forthcoming general election, which must be held before January 2025.\nBut if voters conclude instead that the fifth Conservative prime minister in a row does not embody the change they want, then he will not have much room to manoeuvre or change approach. \nHe has conceded, fairly explicitly, that he thinks his Conservative predecessors failed in various ways - so he won't be able to switch to defending the Conservatives' record. \nWhatever Mr Sunak can achieve between now and the next election - that is what he will be running on. \nAnd his speech set out some of the policies - including the cancellation of HS2 - that will form part of the record. \nDuring the speech, Mr Sunak sought to draw comparisons between himself and the former Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a heroine for many party members. \nHe said the Conservatives would always be \"the party of the grocer's daughter and the pharmacist's son\" - a reference to Mrs Thatcher and himself respectively. \nHe also sought to subtly admonish his immediate predecessor, Liz Truss, who, returning to the conference a year after her troubled premiership, had called for immediate tax cuts.\nShe received a rapturous reception from some party activists for her plea, but Mr Sunak said while he too wanted to cut taxes, it was more important to focus on cutting inflation.  \nQuoting Mrs Thatcher he said: \"Inflation is the biggest destroyer of all - of industry, of jobs, of savings, and of society - no policy which puts at the risk the defeat of inflation - no matter its short term attraction - can be right.\"\nMr Sunak won applause from activists by weighing in on gender issues, telling them it was \"common sense\" that \"a man is a man and a woman is a woman\".   \n\"We shouldn't get bullied into believing that people can be any sex they want to be,\" he said.   \nAs is customary with leader's speeches, the prime minister spoke of his family and background.\nHe recalled how his grandfather, on visiting Mr Sunak in Parliament when he first became an MP, instantly got out his phone to call the landlady he had when he had first arrived in the UK.\n\"He said to me, 'I just wanted to tell her where I was standing',\" said the prime minister.\nHe was introduced to the stage by his wife - Akshata Murty - who described her husband as her \"best friend\".\n\"We are one team and I could not imagine being anywhere else but here today with all of you to show my support to him and to the party.\"\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "Faisal Islam: Why Rishi Sunak's big gamble may not pay off", "date": "2023-10-05 07:37:15", "text": "When Rishi Sunak confirmed he was scrapping the huge infrastructure project of the West Midlands to Manchester leg of HS2 high-speed rail, he said the project had come from a \"false consensus\" that links between big cities were \"all that matters\".\nThe immediate pressing question is whether the UK is capable of delivering projects at this scale, at all. This was a nationally strategic project advertised to the world as a way for Britain's regional cities to attract investment from the biggest investment funds in the world.\nAll of the prime minister's secret conference projects were codenamed after trees. Scrapping HS2 was called \"Project Redwood\". High-speed rail in the UK has been shorn of its branches, and is now left as an expensive stump from London to Birmingham.\nThe escalating cost of this first phase was not a given. How was it allowed to balloon in cost so much to £45bn - and that's in 2019 prices? The country is left with having built the most expensive part of the line, with the least need in terms of capacity, but without the connections to northern cities that would have been most beneficial. \nDid it ever make sense to build what is largely a tunnel from London to Birmingham? Was the cash that should have extended the scheme to the north, the whole point of it, wasted on tunnels to hide it in southern countryside?\nWith rising costs, the government says that the HS2 scheme might not even give back as much in benefits as what is being spent on it. In contrast, some bus projects, for example, can give back £4 for a £1 government investment, it claims.\nOpponents accuse the government of scrapping a key piece of strategic infrastructure to create space for pre-election tax cuts. The government is adamant that this is not a way to fiddle the Treasury spreadsheets. While some detail remains on exactly when these new road and bus projects are delivered, their aim is not to free up cash. \nThe government also argues that the business case for HS2 leant significantly on business travellers. While overall passenger numbers have recovered to pre-pandemic levels, there are fewer business travellers now. Are these behavioural changes enough to mean the West Coast Main Line from London to Glasgow will not be at capacity?\nThe great prize of all of this was to change Britain's economic geography, to create a counterweight to south east England, and in effect to create a single labour market across three major northern cities. Some of that effect will be retained if the £12bn earmarked for the Liverpool to Manchester high-speed line is delivered.\nThe money is being spent instead on everyday transport upgrades, rather than a single grand project. It is likely that the benefits of this will be quicker and more visible on the ground. They also lend themselves to being put on election leaflets next year. \nThe economic and political consensus had been that the gap between Britain's second-tier cities and the capital was significantly bigger than other major economies. Indeed some have argued this was a major cause of Britain's low productivity. The prime minister has upended that consensus. \nThe opposition's response will be very interesting. Rishi Sunak has basically dared Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to reverse the cancellation decision, cut back the newly announced local transport projects, or borrow billions more.\nThese plans will probably reach more voters more quickly. But the risk is that Britain also develops a reputation as a place where big long-term projects are impossible, and cast-iron cross-party promises are easily disposed.\nMr Sunak has not just scrapped half a train line, he has suggested an entirely different approach to promoting British regional economic growth.\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

While experts say the upward trend goes back several years, some are getting jittery about bugs in the UK too.      \nHere we answer some of the key questions people may have. \nBedbugs are small, with adults reaching about 5mm in length (less than a grain of rice) and are oval-shaped. They have six legs and can be dark yellow, red or brown. \nThere are about 90 species worldwide, although the common bedbug (cimex lectularius) has adapted the best to human environments, according to the British Pest Control Association.\nThe term \"bedbug\" can be a touch misleading. As well as mattresses, they can also be found on clothing, furniture, bed frames, or behind loose wallpaper.\nBites are the main thing to look out for, and they are usually raised and itchy. Bedbug bites are often in a line or grouped together. \nOn white skin the bites usually look red, while on black or brown skin they could be purple and harder to see. \nOther things to look out for are spots of blood on bedding - if the bugs have been squashed - or small brown spots on bedding or furniture, which could be their faeces. \nNatalie Bungay, from the British Pest Control Association, said that if travelling, checking for the insects was crucial and that \"prevention is always better than cure\". \n\"If you feel you're in an area that's got a bit of an outbreak, as they're reporting in the news, then the best thing to do is just check all your items - they may travel in suitcases,\" she told the BBC.\n\"Check any luggage that you may have put in the room because a lot of the time we put our suitcases or bags on the bed.\"\nAlthough often uncomfortable, bedbug bites are not typically dangerous. \nThey can be very itchy, and there may be some painful swelling, but they usually clear up on their own in about a week - or they can be treated with some basic measures.\nThese include:\nAntihistamines can help if bites are very itchy, while a mild steroid cream like hydrocortisone might be useful. \nA severe allergic reaction, known as anaphylaxis, is possible but rare.\nA GP appointment should be sought if the bites remain painful, swollen or itchy after trying treatments from a pharmacist, or if the pain or swelling around the bites is spreading. \nIt can be difficult but there are steps that can be taken, including:\nOther steps include avoiding cluttering around beds, or checking second hand furniture before taking it indoors.\nMs Bungay, from BCPA, said it was important not to be ashamed of having bedbugs in the home and to call in an expert pest controller, describing them as a \"public health pest\", although mainly in a psychological capacity. \n\"They're not proven to transmit disease, but it's the psychological effect that they have on someone when you've got them in your home,\" she said. \n\"They feed from our blood, they just like us.\"\nIn short - no. \nBedbugs have been an issue in the UK for many years and are a \"public health pest that is notoriously difficult to treat\", said Ms Bungay.\nThey can be found all over the UK, but are a bigger issue in major cities. \nMs Bungay said her organisation was not aware of any unusual increase in bedbug activity. \n\"There was a dip during Covid-19 due to the lack of global travel taking place, so any increase now could just be trends getting back to normal now that everybody is moving freely again,\" she said. \nShe added that seasonal increases in numbers, particularly as more people travel during the summer months, was nothing unusual. \n\"It's also worth remembering that not every call out for bedbugs will result in a positive identification of the pest - increased media attention or public awareness can often lead to false alarms.\"\nBedbug panic sweeps Paris as infestations soar\nBed bugs force pensioner to sleep in his car\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

They have six legs and can be dark yellow, red or brown. \nThere are about 90 species worldwide, although the common bedbug (cimex lectularius) has adapted the best to human environments, according to the British Pest Control Association.\nThe term \"bedbug\" can be a touch misleading. As well as mattresses, they can also be found on clothing, furniture, bed frames, or behind loose wallpaper.\nBites are the main thing to look out for, and they are usually raised and itchy. Bedbug bites are often in a line or grouped together. \nOn white skin the bites usually look red, while on black or brown skin they could be purple and harder to see. \nOther things to look out for are spots of blood on bedding - if the bugs have been squashed - or small brown spots on bedding or furniture, which could be their faeces. \nNatalie Bungay, from the British Pest Control Association, said that if travelling, checking for the insects was crucial and that \"prevention is always better than cure\". \n\"If you feel you're in an area that's got a bit of an outbreak, as they're reporting in the news, then the best thing to do is just check all your items - they may travel in suitcases,\" she told the BBC.\n\"Check any luggage that you may have put in the room because a lot of the time we put our suitcases or bags on the bed.\"\nAlthough often uncomfortable, bedbug bites are not typically dangerous. \nThey can be very itchy, and there may be some painful swelling, but they usually clear up on their own in about a week - or they can be treated with some basic measures.\nThese include:\nAntihistamines can help if bites are very itchy, while a mild steroid cream like hydrocortisone might be useful. \nA severe allergic reaction, known as anaphylaxis, is possible but rare.\nA GP appointment should be sought if the bites remain painful, swollen or itchy after trying treatments from a pharmacist, or if the pain or swelling around the bites is spreading. \nIt can be difficult but there are steps that can be taken, including:\nOther steps include avoiding cluttering around beds, or checking second hand furniture before taking it indoors.\nMs Bungay, from BCPA, said it was important not to be ashamed of having bedbugs in the home and to call in an expert pest controller, describing them as a \"public health pest\", although mainly in a psychological capacity. \n\"They're not proven to transmit disease, but it's the psychological effect that they have on someone when you've got them in your home,\" she said. \n\"They feed from our blood, they just like us.\"\nIn short - no. \nBedbugs have been an issue in the UK for many years and are a \"public health pest that is notoriously difficult to treat\", said Ms Bungay.\nThey can be found all over the UK, but are a bigger issue in major cities. \nMs Bungay said her organisation was not aware of any unusual increase in bedbug activity. \n\"There was a dip during Covid-19 due to the lack of global travel taking place, so any increase now could just be trends getting back to normal now that everybody is moving freely again,\" she said. \nShe added that seasonal increases in numbers, particularly as more people travel during the summer months, was nothing unusual. \n\"It's also worth remembering that not every call out for bedbugs will result in a positive identification of the pest - increased media attention or public awareness can often lead to false alarms.\"\nHave you experienced bed bugs, and if so how did it impact your life?

{"title": "The mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians", "date": "2023-10-05 21:01:49", "text": "Scientists have unveiled a sprawling burial site in India belonging to one of the world's earliest urban civilisations. The BBC's Soutik Biswas delves into the clues the graves might give us about how the early Indians lived and died. \nIn 2019, as scientists embarked on excavating a mound of sandy soil near a remote village in the sparsely populated Kutch region, situated not far from Pakistan in India's western state of Gujarat, they had no inkling of the surprise that lay in store for them.\n\"When we began digging, we thought it was an ancient settlement. Within a week, we realised it was a cemetery,\" says Rajesh SV, an archaeologist with the University of Kerala, who led the search.\nThree excavation seasons - involving more than 150 Indian and international scientists - have been conducted so far at the 40-acre site. Researchers now estimate the presence of at least 500 graves of the Indus society, one of the world's earliest urban civilisations. (Some 200 of these graves have been excavated.)\nAlso known as the Harappan civilisation, named after its first city, this society - austere farmers and traders who lived in walled, baked-brick cities - rose to prominence some 5,300 years ago in what is now north-west India and Pakistan. In a century since the civilisation's initial discovery, researchers have unearthed up to 2,000 sites in India and Pakistan. \nScientists reckon the sprawling burial ground near Khatiya village in Gujarat may potentially be the largest \"pre-urban\" cemetery of the society discovered so far. They believe it was in use for about 500 years, spanning from 3200BC to 2600BC, making the oldest graves here around 5,200 years old. \nExcavations so far have yielded a single intact male human skeleton, as well as partly preserved skeletal remains including skull fragments, bones and teeth.   \nThey have also found an array of burial artefacts - more than 100 bangles and 27 beads made of shell. Ceramic vessels, bowls, dishes, pots, small pitchers, beakers, clay pots, water cups, bottles and jars have also been discovered. Minor treasures include beads made of the semi-precious stone, lapis lazuli.\nThe graves have unique features, including sandstone-lined burial shafts that point in different directions. Some are oval shaped; others rectangular. There are smaller graves where children were buried. The bodies appear to be laid supine, but most bones have dissolved because of the acidic soil.\n\"This is a hugely significant find,\" says Brad Chase, a professor of anthropology at Albion College, Michigan.\n\"Several pre-urban cemeteries have been discovered in Gujarat, but this is by far the largest - and therefore has the potential to reveal a greater diversity of grave types that will help archaeologists to more fully understand pre-urban society in the region as well as provide crucial context for the other smaller cemeteries that have been previously discovered,\" says Prof Chase.\nEarlier excavations of Indus sites in the Punjab region of today's Pakistan offer some clues about the burial practices of the Indus people. \nThe funerals were unostentatious, unlike those of the elites in Egypt and Mesopotamia. No jewels and weapons accompanied the dead to the afterlife. Here, most bodies were wrapped in shrouds of textile and placed in rectangular wooden coffins. The grave pit was often filled with pottery offerings before the coffin was lowered into it, according to Jonathan Mark Kenoyer of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who is a scholar of the Indus Valley civilisation.\nSome people were buried with personal ornaments - bangles, beads, amulets - which could not be passed on to others. Some women were buried with a mirror made of copper. Adults were buried with different types of vessels associated with serving and storing food, and some with specific ornaments - shell bangles were typically found on the left arms of adult females. Infants and children were not usually buried with any pottery or ornaments. \nThis video can not be played\nDrone footage of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nThere was no evidence of substantial wealth in the graves and the health profile indicates that most were \"well fed and healthy, although some had indications of arthritis and physical stress\". \nBut the mystery of the massive burial ground in Gujarat is still to be unearthed.\nFor the scientists the discovery itself was fortuitous. In 2016, a village headman who also doubled up as a driver, was taking around a team of University of Kerala archaeology students when he showed them the site.\nIt was a mere 300m (985 feet) from Khatiya, a tiny village of 400 people, who grew groundnut, cotton and castor on rainfed farms for a living. Some of their farms even abutted the graveyard. \n\"After rains we would see bits of pottery and stuff coming to the surface. Some people would say there were ghosts here. But we had no idea that we were living next door to such a big graveyard,\" said Narayan Bhai Jajani, the former headman. \n\"Now every year we have scientists from all over the world visiting our village and trying to find out more about the people who were buried here.\"\nWhat secrets do the latest graves in Gujarat hold? Who were the people who were interred here? \nThe sheer number of burials in one location raises questions about the significance of this burial ground. Did it serve as a communal resting place for a cluster of nearby settlements, or does it hint at the existence of a larger settlement?\nMoreover, could it have functioned as a sacred cemetery for nomadic travellers, considering that the closest source of lapis lazuli found in these graves likely traces back to distant Afghanistan? Or could it have served as a \"secondary\" burial site, where bones from the deceased were interred separately?\n\"We still don't know. We haven't found a settlement in the neighbourhood yet. We are still digging,\" says Abhayan GS, an archaeologist at the University of Kerala.\nMr Kenoyer says he's confident that \"there must be some settlements that relate to the cemetery, but they are probably lying beneath modern habitations or so far undiscovered\".  That the burials were made with well-defined stone walls suggests that the people were familiar with building with stone, and such stone buildings and walled settlements are to be found between 19-30km (11-18 miles) from the cemetery.\nMore chemical studies and DNA testing of the human remains will tell us more about some of the earliest Indians who lived and died here.\nMysteries about the Indus civilisation endure: the writing, for example, has still not been deciphered. This winter, scientists plan to excavate a site north of the cemetery near Khatiya aiming to uncover a potential settlement. If they find one, one part of the puzzle will be solved. If they don't, they will continue to dig. \"Someday, hopefully sooner than later, we will have some answers,\" says Mr Rajesh.\nBBC News India is now on YouTube.

{"title": "NFL star Kelce says Swift coverage being overhyped", "date": "2023-10-05 21:26:20", "text": "NFL superstar and rumoured Taylor-Swift-sweetheart Travis Kelce is beginning to grow weary of the league's coverage of her presence at games.\n\"I think they're overdoing it a little bit for sure,\" Kelce, 33, said in his New Heights podcast on Wednesday.\nBut the NFL has defended its coverage of the popstar, saying it's a \"pop culture moment\".\nTV cameras were glued to Swift during her attendance at Kelce's last game on Sunday.\nThe Swift-Kelce media coverage exploded when the Anti-Hero singer first attended a Kansas City Chiefs game on 24 September and was seen leaving Arrowhead Stadium in a convertible with Kelce.\nAnd then Swift showed up with an entourage of A-list celebrities at the next game in New Jersey, cheering on Kelce alongside Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman.\nThe rumoured romance led to Kelce's jersey sales skyrocketing by 400%, NFL viewership numbers got a big bump and the league's middle-aged male-dominated audience has been joined by the Swifties - die-hard fans of the singer-songwriter.\nNearly 20% of the tickets sold for the 1 October game were purchased after fans saw Swift at her first Chiefs game a week earlier, the BBC's US news partner CBS reported. \nCameras panned to Swift no fewer than 17 times at the Chiefs-Jets showdown on Sunday in New Jersey, Kelce's brother, Jason, said on their podcast. \n\"Damn, that's crazy,\" Kelce responded. \nIn addition to showing Swift multiple times at the games, the league also promoted her appearances heavily on social media. \nThe NFL posted a video of Swift talking to Blake Lively, who sat next to Swift at the game, on its Instagram account with the caption: \"The @chiefs are 2-0 with @taylorswift in attendance.\"\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, the NFL defended its coverage of Swift.\n\"We frequently change our bios and profile imagery based on what's happening in and around our games, as well as culturally,\" the NFL wrote. \n\"The Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce news has been a pop cultural moment we've leaned into in real time, as it's an intersection of sport and entertainment, and we've seen an incredible amount of positivity around the sport.\"\nSwift's attendance at the Chiefs-Jets game was the most watched Sunday show since the Super Bowl, with an average of 27 million TV viewers, according to NBC Sports.\nJason Kelce, who is also an NFL player, said on the podcast that the league is not used to celebrities coming to games. \n\"Like basketball has it figured out.

There are certain things you just don't want to be on TV at all times.\"\nGiven the massive economic and cultural ripple effect Swift's presence has brought to the NFL, it's no surprise that the league is making the most of the Kelce-Swift duo.\nThe NFL has long sought to make inroads with younger and female viewers. \nAnd Swift is perhaps the biggest popstar in the world, with legions of fans in the same demographics that the NFL wants watching its games.\nFox Sports said the Chiefs-Bears match on 24 September was the week's most-watched telecast across all networks, drawing in 24.3 million viewers. \nAmong them, viewership among females aged 12-17 was notably higher, up 8% from the same window a year ago, ESPN reported.\n\"It's like a business bonanza that just appeared for two brands that have some of the biggest brands in the world,\" Andrew Brandt, a former Green Bay Packers executive, told Vox.\nAnd one of ESPN's leading analysts, Stephen A Smith, says Kelce played his own part in the media frenzy after telling fans he sent Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it.\n\"Travis Kelce, stop, bro you did this, not the NFL,\" Smith said in response to Kelce's podcast comments.\nTaylor Swift joined by Hollywood stars at NFL game\nNFL's Kelce breaks silence on 'amazing' Taylor Swift\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "AI facial recognition: Campaigners and MPs call for ban", "date": "2023-10-05 23:01:57", "text": "Police and private companies should \"immediately stop\" the use of facial recognition surveillance, says a group of politicians and privacy campaigners.\nThey have raised concerns around human rights, potential for discrimination and \"the lack of a democratic mandate\".\nIt comes after the government announced plans for police to access passport photos to help catch criminals.\nThe Home Office said facial recognition had \"a sound legal basis\" and had already led to criminals being caught.\nA spokesperson added that the technology could also aid police in searching for missing or vulnerable people, and free up officers to \"be out on the beat\" and to carry out complex investigations.\nLive facial recognition cameras scan faces of the public in specific locations and compare these with people on \"watch lists\" who may be wanted by police or the courts in association with crimes.\nPolice forces using the technology in the UK inform citizens in advance about when and where it will be deployed, and display physical notices alerting those entering areas where it is active to the presence of cameras.\nBut this week, policing minister Chris Philp said he wanted officers to be able to access a wider range of databases for images besides those on its national database, which is limited to those who have been arrested. \nCampaigners have called for it to be banned \"immediately\".\n\"This dangerously authoritarian technology has the potential to turn populations into walking ID cards in a constant police line up,\" says Silkie Carlo, the director of privacy organisation Big Brother Watch.\nThe group calling for the ban includes parliamentarians from the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green parties, along with campaigning organisations such as Amnesty, Index on Censorship and Big Brother Watch.\nThe UK's surveillance camera commissioner has also criticised the plans, saying they could damage public trust and make passport-holders feel as if they were in a \"digital line-up\".\nSouth Wales Police has been criticised over its live facial recognition use at events including Harry Styles and Beyoncé concerts in Cardiff. The Metropolitan Police has used it several times this year, including at the King's Coronation in May.\nBoth forces have said that if a person is not on a watch list, the biometric data will be immediately deleted and not stored.\nIn April, Frasers Group - which operates Sports Direct, Flannels and House of Fraser - defended its use of live facial recognition cameras in some of its shops, saying the system provided by FaceWatch had helped cut crime since being installed. \nMs Carlo, of Big Brother Watch, argued the UK's \"approach to face surveillance makes us a total outlier in the democratic world, especially against the backdrop of the EU's proposed ban\".\nMembers of the European Parliament agreed to ban live facial recognition using AI in a draft of its Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act - the EU's landmark legislation categorising different applications of AI according to their harm to the public. \nThe Home Office said the government was \"committed to making sure the police have the tools and technology they need to solve and prevent crimes, bring offenders to justice, and keep people safe\".\n\"Facial recognition, including live facial recognition, has a sound legal basis that has been confirmed by the courts and has already enabled a large number of serious criminals to be caught, including for murder and sexual offences,\" a spokesperson said.\nThey added there was a \"robust legal framework for it use\".\nWarning over face recognition to catch shoplifters\nPolice passport photos access 'risks public trust'\nFace recognition used at Cardiff Beyoncé concert\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "The extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship", "date": "2023-10-05 23:02:48", "text": "A huge robotic arm, wielding a waterjet powerful enough to slice through steel, swings into action.\nIt is chopping up the hull of a large ship. The structure, which withstood the power of the sea for decades, yields easily to the cutting jet. Before long, the robot has sliced out a big rectangle of steel. \nIts task complete, the machine silently moves on to the next section.\n\"You can have robots starting at the bow and the stern, and two points in the middle, and working towards each other,\" says Bryce Lawrence, operations director at Leviathan. The firm, based in Germany, plans to use a team of robots to dismantle huge ships so that the steel can be recycled.\nToday's shipbreaking industry is one of the dirtiest and most exploitative in the world.\nWhen mammoth vessels retire from years of ferrying cargo such as consumer goods, or oil, between continents, they often end up on a heavily polluted beach somewhere in South Asia. There, workers use fossil fuel-powered torches to painstakingly dismantle the ships. Protective clothing is scarce. Fatalities are not. \nContaminants, including heavy metals, often get washed into the sea from these beaches. Workers and local communities are frequently exposed to dangerous materials including asbestos. During the next decade, 15,000 ships will require recycling - more than double the volume of the past decade, estimates Bimco, the Baltic and International Maritime Council.\nLeviathan and other companies are trying to find ways of doing this work much more cleanly and safely. Still, there are no guarantees that they will be able to compete with the dirt-cheap yards of South Asia.\n\"Compared to traditional ship recycling, we're very, very low carbon,\" says Mr Lawrence as he explains how machinery at Leviathan's Stralsund facility on Germany's Baltic coast will be powered by electricity, not on-site fossil fuels, and that recovered steel will be transported to mills around Europe on electrified trains. Commercial operations are expected to start in the coming months, he adds.\nThe firm's prototype system is a mash-up of established technologies. The robot arms are the sort that toil in car factories, for example, and the waterjet is manufactured by ANT AG, another German firm.\nThis device blasts a mixture of water and sand at high pressures - a technology so precise that it is used by bomb disposal experts to cut the fuses out of bombs. \n\"Somebody has to approach the bomb, put the manipulating system on,\" says Till Weber, ANT AG's general manager, \"then go as far away as possible.\" Mercifully, in such situations the jet can be operated from a distance of half a kilometer. It is currently in use in Ukraine, adds Mr Weber.\nWhen it comes to ship cutting, such a system requires far fewer workers than traditional shipbreaking does, and Mr Lawrence argues that it could one day complete the job much faster. Computer software being developed by Leviathan will automatically plan how to chop up a vessel as efficiently as possible.\nOn the other hand, there's a cost to all this and the robot arms must be properly mounted on special rigs fixed to a dry dock. You can't just plonk them on a beach.\nSefer Gunbeyaz at the University of Strathclyde has studied workers' exposure to toxic materials at shipbreaking facilities in the UK and Spain. Even in these countries, exposure - particularly to lead and iron particles - was \"worrying\", he and colleagues found.\n\"It's a promising start,\" he says, of the waterjet-based system in Germany. However, he notes that contaminants in the water used for cutting up ships must still be carefully managed. \nMr Lawrence explains that the Stralsund facility will feature a containment area designed to capture jet water and toxic substances that have been blasted off the ships. Once carefully decontaminated, this water can be reused for further cutting.\nElegant Exit Company, headquartered in The Netherlands, also says it can dismantle ships responsibly. Earlier this year, it began recycling the Wan Hai 165, a 160m-long container vessel. \nThe company uses gas-fuelled cutters at its Bahrain facility, but says that it removes hazardous materials before processing ships into large pieces of steel, of up to 25 tons, for transportation.\n\"We de-Lego a ship,\" says a spokeswoman, explaining that the idea is to safely disassemble each vessel, part by part. The firm will evaluate waterjet, plasma and hydraulic mechanical cutters in the future.\nRecycling ships has been a dirty business for too long, says Ingvild Jenssen, founder and director of Shipbreaking Platform, a non-governmental organization that monitors the industry.\n\"What is even more shocking is that you have a whole shipping sector that is well aware of the problems,\" she adds.\nSome ship owners attempt to send vessels from Europe to South Asian shipbreaking yards despite such exports being illegal. A BBC investigation in 2020 revealed that three oil rigs detained by the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) in 2018 had been earmarked for dismantling on a beach in India.\nTwo of the structures have since been broken up at an EU-approved yard in Turkey. \"[The third rig, Ocean Princess] has not been dismantled and recovered yet as it was only exported to Turkey in May 2023,\" says Colin Morrow, of Sepa.\nImproved documentation of the hazardous materials contained in a vessel could help recyclers process it appropriately, suggests Ms Jenssen.\nKuishuang Feng at the University of Maryland agrees and adds that ship owners could also be charged a levy when purchasing a vessel, redeemable if it is later recycled safely.\nMore technology of business\nBoth Mr Feng and Ms Jenssen say current legislation, including the recently ratified Hong Kong Convention, does not go far enough towards making shipbreaking sustainable. However, a spokeswoman for the International Maritime Organization argues that the convention will reduce the environmental impacts of ship recycling.\nHigh-tech solutions could make a difference. Mr Lawrence says that Leviathan hopes to license its system to other shipbreaking yards - though he insists that he would only allow this in safe, controlled environments with the same capacity for capturing hazardous substances that he says is in place at Stralsund.\nAs it stands, the situation in many South Asian yards remains one of \"constant exploitation\", argues Jenssen. \"You have workers that go to work - and they're not coming home.\"\nJailed Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nPutin makes nuclear-powered missile test claim\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

New DNA evidence showed he was not involved in her death, prosecutors said.\nBut in March 2023, a Maryland appeals court reinstated Syed's conviction and sentence, ordering a new hearing to determine whether he should remain free. \nThe appeals court ruled that the lower court failed to give Young Lee, Ms Lee's brother, sufficient notice of the September 2022 hearing in which a judge vacated Syed's murder conviction and freed him from prison.\nThursday's hearing in the Maryland Supreme Court included arguments over whether Syed's conviction should remain on the books and whether crime victims have a right to speak and to challenge evidence during hearings to vacate convictions. \nAttorneys for Syed argued that despite the lack of notice given - Young Lee was told of the hearing to vacate on the Friday before a Monday hearing - the result would have been the same.\nThe Lee family has continued to argue that Syed is guilty and opposed his release. \nThe state supreme court justices will announce their decision at a later date. \nSyed remains free while the decision is pending. \nOutside the court after the hearing, he told reporters: \"We look forward to hearing the court's decision, and we're hoping that in the end we'll have a chance to do justice, not just for Hae's family, but for our family as well.\"\nHae Min Lee disappeared after school in January 1999, and her body was discovered partially buried the following month. Syed was arrested and convicted on the basis of evidence including phone records and the testimony of one of his friends, who told police he helped bury Lee's body. He was sentenced to life in prison. \nMore than a decade after the conviction, Rabia Chaudry, a Baltimore-based lawyer and family friend of the Syeds, emailed journalist Sarah Koenig and asked her to re-investigate Lee's murder.  \nThat email helped launch the first season of the podcast Serial, a spin-off of the long-running radio show This American Life. Serial premiered in autumn 2014 and went through the evidence in minute detail.\n\"For the last year I've spent every working day trying to figure out where a high school kid was for an hour after school one day in 1999,\" Ms Koenig says in the first episode.\nAs each episode revealed new details - and potential new suspects - internet sleuths and armchair detectives sprang into action and argued their theories on social media.\nDuring the podcast Ms Koenig did not take a position on Syed's guilt or innocence, but the attention around Syed's case would ultimately help him win a new trial.\nSerial helped ignite the popularity of podcasts, particularly the \"true crime\" genre. Ms Koenig's signature confessional style kept listeners returning - and downloading - the show every week.  \nThe first season of Serial has been downloaded more than 300 million times and the show is widely cited as one of the most popular podcasts in the world.\nThough subsequent seasons of the show were less popular, in many ways, Ms Koenig and her team helped create the formula for a \"bingeable\" podcast series.  \nIn 2015, Syed was granted a new trial based, in part, on new evidence uncovered while making Serial.\nBut a judge also denied his request for bail. He remained imprisoned as his legal team argued for a new trial and tried to appeal against his conviction all the way to the US Supreme Court.  \nIn 2019, HBO premiered a four-part documentary series produced by Ms Chaudry called The Case Against Adnan Syed.\nThe series argued that Syed, who is Muslim, was convicted, in part, because of racial bias. \nIt ultimately revealed that forensic analyses had found no trace of his DNA on Ms Lee's body at the time of the murder - a major factor in the eventual vacating of his conviction.  \nThe state's attorney's office cleared Syed of all charges on the basis of  the new evidence.\n\"As a representative of the institution, it is my responsibility to acknowledge and apologise to the family of Hae Min Lee and Adnan Syed,\" Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said at the time. \nThe Lee family refused to participate in Serial and has always maintained they believe Syed was rightfully convicted and justice was served during the original trial.\nIn 2016, when Syed was granted a new trial, the family told reporters that the podcast had \"reopened wounds few can imagine\", according to the Baltimore Sun. They also said they believed people had been misinformed by the podcast and regretted that \"so few [were] willing to speak up for Hae\".  \nMs Lee's brother, Young Lee, told the September 2022 hearing: \"This is not a podcast for me. This is real life - a never-ending nightmare for 20-plus years.\" \nConviction quashed in Serial podcast murder case\nSerial: Amateur sleuths trying to solve murder\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "Haim look back at their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'", "date": "2023-10-05 23:50:53", "text": "Eleven years ago, on a cold and dark December evening, I squeezed into an anonymous dressing room at the O2 arena for my first interview with Haim.\nThey didn't know it at the time, but the group were about to win the BBC's Sound of 2013. My job was to profile the band, without giving away the secret. \nAs we spoke, Florence + The Machine started playing in the auditorium above our heads. The walls shook, a guitar case fell over. We exchanged nervous glances.\n\"The worst part is,\" said bassist Este Haim, \"no-one is going to remember that we're in here. \n\"It's going to be the saddest BBC poll ever. 'They would have got to number three but they unfortunately passed away at the O2 arena'.\"\nThankfully, the seismic activity subsided and Haim lived to tell the tale. They won the poll, celebrating with a victory dance at Madame Tussauds, and went on to become one of the world's biggest bands.\nTheir latest album, Women In Music Part III, was nominated for album of the year at the Grammys, and they've just been whisked around America by Taylor Swift as the support act on her Eras tour.\nWe meet again this August, a day after the trio's headline set at London's All Points East festival.\n\"I cried through the first three songs,\" admits Alana, the youngest Haim sister, who's also a Bafta-nominated actress for her role in Licorice Pizza.\nThe concert was an emotional form of homecoming for the band who, despite hailing from California's San Fernando Valley, were signed to the UK's Polydor Records in 2012 after every American label passed.\nThis year marks the 10th birthday of their debut album Days Are Gone and, with an anniversary edition pushing it back into the Top 40, I sit down with Haim to recall the protracted sessions that led to the record - and to finally admit my decade-long duplicity.\n\"You knew we'd won the whole time? Oh my God, that's hilarious,\" laughs Danielle.\n\"I feel like we blinked three times and 10 years passed,\" adds Alana. \"Or maybe that's just the jet lag?\"\nIs it true you played your first gig on 7 July, 2007 - the same night as Live Earth?\nDanielle: That's right! We made jokes about it all night. \nAlana: \"Hello! This is Live Earth! Let's take it back to the Valley and see what our friends over there are doing.\"\nHow did you end up taking six years to make an album?\nDanielle: We did what a lot of bands in LA do, and played around locally. \nAlana: We played every parking lot, every venue, but no-one wanted to sign us.\nDanielle: By the fourth year, we were having to beg our friends to come. Texting everyone, \"please come and pay $10 for the show\".\nHow hard was it to keep going?\nAlana: It honestly wasn't that frustrating. Our dream was just, play music and get out of town, and we always believed it was going to work out. I don't know why, we just did.\nEste: I mean, you dropped out of college...\nAlana: My parents fully sat me down and were like, \"What are you doing? If this doesn't work out, what'll you do?\"\nEste: And we all had jobs. Alana was a nanny, I worked in every restaurant in LA, and then Danielle was off traipsing around the world [playing guitar for The Strokes frontman] Julian Casablancas.\nYou once said you threw away 10 EPs of material. \nAlana: Just [2013 single] The Wire alone, I think there are 30 different versions. \nWhat was going wrong?\nAlana: We had no idea how to record our songs. We knew exactly what we wanted them to sound like in our mind, but it never turned out right.\nEste: We were sold a lie, though, because we would watch those Behind The Music documentaries.... Tom Petty would be at Sound City and he'd plug in his guitar and go, \"Then we wrote American Girl.\" Like it's that easy!\nDanielle: So we'd save up all our money every year and go to these really nice studios in the Valley for 48 hours and we'd try to record five songs, just by setting up in the room and playing. But I didn't know about mics or EQ or anything. \nBut you eventually worked it out?\nAlana: In the movie of our lives, the day that Danielle bought Garage Band is the day that Haim started.\nDanielle: Suddenly, I realised, oh my God, I can put reverb on this guitar or, I can pitch up this handclap so it sounds brighter. Just trial and error, but it was so eye-opening.\nHow much of the album was written in that time?\nDanielle: We wrote The Wire in 2008, so that was already there, but most of the record, if not everything else, came in that two-year period of [saying], all right, we've got to get better.\nAlana: There was a lot of trial and error.\nDanielle: Because we hadn't broken through, we intrinsically thought, look, we can play really well but it's not going to mean anything if it doesn't sound different to anyone else.\nAlana: To our credit, we knew even then that the internet was forever, so if we were going to put our name on something, it had to be right. \nYou put out an independent EP in 2012, and suddenly UK radio was playing it. How did that happen?\nEste: I don't know! We'd only released it a couple of weeks before to our friends. It was that magical internet time where putting stuff online got us noticed.\nAlana: I mean, we had two people at our shows in America.\nEste: And they were our parents...\nDanielle: But when XFM started playing us, we were like, maybe we should go to the UK?\nHad you been before?\nDanielle: I had, because I'd played some gigs with Julian - but I couldn't believe that I was here with this band.\nSo was Danielle the tour guide?\nEste: Oh yeah. She was like, \"That's what they call 'the Tube' but it's really just the subway.\"\nDanielle: And also, knowing The Strokes' story, they broke here first, too. It felt like a really cool trajectory for an American band, so we signed with Polydor.\nLyrically speaking, the album has a lot of relationships-on-the-rocks songs.\nEste: Oh yeah.\nDaniele: But it's really just about growing up.\nAlana: It's all those things you go through in your late teens and early 20s, when you're still figuring things out. I think that's why we were also being very particular about the music. We were like, if we're going to put this album out, it's got to be 100% us. Even the photo was taken in my parents' back yard.\nWhat were your expectations when it came out?\nAlana: I remember we had a bottle of champagne that we got at a corner store and, very cinematically, at midnight, we went out on the street and let the champagne go!\nDanielle: We weren't thinking about chart positions. It was more like, we had this small fanbase and we wanted them to like it, because there are a few left-turns on there.\nAnd then it beat Justin Timberlake to number one!\nEste: We were just as shocked as you were.\nAlana: I grew up wanting to marry him!\nNow you're headlining festivals and playing with Taylor Swift. Are there still new fans coming on board?\nAlana: Yeah, this summer has been crazy. It's insane. So many people.\nWhat's it like up on those stages?\nAlana: Honestly, it feels like a video game. You're like, is this real?\nEste: You have to disassociate a little bit. Because if you really try to comprehend what's happening, there's 80,000 pairs of eyes on you. That's crazy.\nHow do you connect with that many people?\nDanielle: One thing we learned is that, from the second you step on stage, you have to bring them in. You fight for their attention. \nEste: You've got to play your ass off. And then you get to watch Taylor's show, which is amazing.\nYou've got the golden ticket. \nEste: It's amazing! You do a 30-minute set, wash your face, or not, then go out in the audience and have the night of your life.\nHaim: 'We'd be taken more seriously if we were brooding and aggressive'\nHaim win BBC Sound of 2013\nHow dinosaurs delayed Haim's new album\nTaylor Swift: 'I'm the fourth Haim sister'\nHaim 'fired agent over equal pay'\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "How Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year", "date": "2023-10-05 23:54:58", "text": "Ghana - once touted as a trailblazing African economic success story - is facing an unprecedented financial crisis.\nThis week, hundreds of protestors took to the streets in the capital Accra, calling on the governor of the Bank of Ghana and his two deputies to resign over the loss of about 60bn Ghanaian cedis ($5.2bn; £4.3bn) in the 2022 financial year.\nThe demonstration, dubbed #OccupyBoG, was led by the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) party. The protesters, dressed in red shirts, scarves and berets, chanted songs and held banners - some reading \"stop the looting, we are suffering\".\nThe opposition claims the bank printed money illegally to lend to the government, leading to the depreciation of the currency and crippling inflation. \nIt has also criticised the bank for spending more than $762,000 on domestic and foreign travel, an 87% increase on the previous year, and $250m on a new office building. The opposition says these figures are recorded in an internal audit.\nThe NDC has accused the central bank governor, Dr Ernest Addison, of recklessness and mismanagement. And while the bank has been accused of mismanagement in the past, a loss of this magnitude is unprecedented. \n\"We have never seen anything like this in our history. If the Bank of Ghana wants to recover from this loss... it will take them more than 45 years,\" says economist Professor Godfred Bokpin, from the University of Ghana.\nThe bank denies charges of mismanagement and says the losses were a result of a fluctuating exchange rate and because of non-payment of loans by state institutions.\nIt also says the government's decision to borrow $700m from it and not pay it back in full has contributed to the crisis.\nThe bank's governors have also been accused of fanning rampant inflation and economic hardship by their actions. \"The time when they were printing billions for the government, didn't they know that it will have repercussions?\" asks lawyer Martin Kepbu.\nGhana is currently going through its worst economic crisis in a generation. Last year, the inflation rate hit a record high of 54% - and is still running at more than 40%. Multiple credit rating agencies have downgraded the nation, preventing it from borrowing money internationally.\nBy September 2022, Ghana's total debt had surged to $55bn. This meant the government needed in excess of 70% of its income to service the debt, something it was unable to do. It subsequently defaulted on much of its debt payments. \nThe government was forced to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for assistance. To secure a $3bn bailout earlier this year, the government had to agree to fulfil a number of requirements. \nThe most important of these was to reduce the nation's debt interest payments to a manageable level by 2028. This would leave them with enough funds to run the economy.\nTo achieve this, Ghana's government began debt restructuring by renegotiating terms with its creditors, proposing lower interest rates on their loans and longer repayment terms to relieve pressure on public finances.\nHowever, some creditors refused to take part in this debt exchange programme.\nOn 9 August the Bank of Ghana issued a statement saying the government had told it that it didn't have enough money to meet the IMF's requirements and consequently would not repay half of the $700m it had borrowed from the bank. \nInstead the money would go towards the debt restructuring. It also said it would not pay any interest due to the bank. \nThe bank is the lender of last resort and experts say its status has been abused by the government, led by President Nana Akufo-Addo, and the rules of the bank have been broken.\n\"The Bank of Ghana Act is very clear that printing money or financing the government is limited to 5% of the previous year's fiscal revenue, which means that in principle supporting the government is not a crime but don't go beyond 5%,\" says Professor Bokpin.  \nThe bank's officials are mandated by law to report to parliament if the 5% threshold is exceeded. A failure to report could lead to a fine or a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years.\nNone of this means the Bank of Ghana has gone broke. It is not a commercial bank that has to make a profit, so the loss should not affect its routine operations and as the lender of last resort it can always create its own money. \nBut according to experts, the central bank's loss has significant ramifications.\nIt undermines the moral authority of the bank to supervise Ghana's commercial banks. It also damages confidence in the country's financial system.\nAlthough other central banks around the world have faced similar challenges, the difference in Ghana is the amount of money lost compared with the size of the economy.\nIn the UK, the Bank of England will be making a net loss of about $180bn over the next 10 years which will be funded by the UK government. But the size of the UK economy is in the trillions of dollars.\nBright Simons, a Ghanaian social innovator and writer, says that the bank cannot compare its losses with those of other countries. \"Their attempt to deflect blame and point to losses by other central banks doesn't make sense as the scale of their losses far outstrips those of other peer banks. \n\"A lot of the mess is down to the bank's accommodative stance on the government's loose fiscal policy,\" he says. \nIn other words, by creating money the bank has allowed the government to live beyond its means.\nA World Bank report last month estimated that 850,000 Ghanaians have drifted into poverty because of high inflation.\nGhanaians' incomes have been eroded, affecting their purchasing power. The prices of food, fuels and utilities remain high, and many households are struggling to make ends meet.\nAnd on top of all that, the central bank is now under scrutiny from both within the country and the IMF. \nUnder the terms of the IMF loan, if the government demands more bailouts, the bank will have no choice but to refuse.\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

It has since been deleted.\nThe Philippines for Jesus Movement, comprising Protestant church leaders, registered the first criminal complaint with the Manila Prosecutor's Office at the end of July. A second complaint was then filed in August by Nazarene Brotherhood, a Catholic group. \nSeveral cities in the Philippines, including its capital Manila, also declared Pagente \"persona non grata\", a Latin phrase for an \"unwelcome person\".\nFor decades, drag queens in the Philippines have been popular entertainers who impersonate singers and actresses and deliver punchlines in stand-up shows.\nBut Pagente is part of a new generation of drag queens who use their performances to champion their causes and test the limits of free speech.\nThey told the AFP that the arrest shows \"the degree of homophobia\" in the Philippines. \"I understand that people call my performance blasphemous, offensive, or regrettable. However, they shouldn't tell me how I practice my faith or how I do my drag. \nSupporters have been calling for Pagente's release with the #FreePuraLukaVega hash tag, arguing that \"drag is not a crime\". Some compared the performer's predicament with alleged murderers and sex crime offenders, whom they claimed remain free and have not been justly dealt with.\nRyan Thoreson, a specialist at the Human Rights Watch's LGBT+ rights programme, also called for the charges against Pagente to be dropped. \"Freedom of expression includes artistic expression that offends, satirises, or challenges religious beliefs.\"  \nPhilippine drag queen faces backlash for Jesus act\nBlack Nazarene draws vast Manila crowds\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

The two leaders warn that tackling illegal migration is the only way to protect Britain and Italy's \"historic role as places of asylum and sanctuary\". \nIn Scotland, the Daily Record hails what it calls an \"historic\" victory for Labour in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West by-election. It says the Conservatives were \"humiliated\" - having received so few votes they lost their deposit - and it was also a \"terrible night\" for the SNP. \nThe Herald pins the blame on First Minister Humza Yousaf, saying the scale of the defeat could spark questions about his future and \"whether he can turn the SNP's fate around\". In an analysis piece, the paper asks why party members should listen to him when he sets out his independence strategy next week. The National declares that Labour is now on the path to winning the next general election.\nThe Daily Mirror reveals what it says is \"the truth\" about Rishi Sunak's plan for rail projects - or, as it calls it, \"the HS2 cash con\". It says the scheme is a \"shambles\" and claims many of the Network North proposals have been announced previously or have already been completed. The i says the plan is \"beginning to unravel\". It also reveals that the company behind HS2 bought a property in Staffordshire worth more than £1.5m just a day before the prime minister axed the northern leg.\nBut the Daily Telegraph focuses on Sir Keir Starmer's refusal to commit to building the HS2 route between Birmingham and Manchester. The paper says it is likely to \"fuel criticism that Labour lacks ambition\".  In the Guardian, what are described as \"key figures\" who helped Tony Blair win the 1997 election urge Sir Keir to be bold. They say his cautious approach risks damaging his chances of winning the next vote.\nThe Financial Times reports that Metro Bank has approached its rivals to gauge their interest in buying more than £2bn of its mortgage book. Sources tell the paper the bank has contacted Lloyds, NatWest and HSBC in an attempt to \"bolster its balance sheet\".\nAccording to the Daily Mail, ministers are working on \"radical plans\" to temporarily hire thousands of foreign doctors to limit the damage caused by NHS strikes in England. Whitehall sources say the proposal is known as \"the Ronald Reagan project\" - a reference to the time in 1981 when the former US president sacked thousands of striking air traffic control staff.  \nAnd the Sun says Saudi Arabia is prepared to suspend its alcohol ban \"to boost its unpopular bid to stage the 2034 World Cup\".

{"title": "BBC witnesses Chinese ships blocking Philippines supply boats", "date": "2023-10-06 05:01:10", "text": "This video can not be played\nWatch: Formation of Chinese ships blocks Philippine boats\nThe BBC has witnessed Chinese vessels blocking Filipino supply boats to an outpost in the South China Sea.\nThe incident took place as two Philippine coast guard ships - one of which the BBC was aboard - and two tiny commercial boats made their way to the Second Thomas Shoal. \nThey were met by a ship marked as the Chinese Coast Guard that was five times bigger than the commercial boats. \nThe encounter between the two sides lasted several hours. \nTensions between Manila and Beijing remain high after the Philippines coast guard cut China's barriers in disputed waters last month. \nManila resupplies its outpost in the Second Thomas Shoal, in the Spratly Islands, every month to reinforce its economic rights to waters that are both rich in fish and mineral resources. \nBeijing claims almost the entire South China Sea, including the Spratlys, which is also claimed in part by the Philippines.\nThe incident took place on Wednesday, the second day of a three-day mission to the Second Thomas Shoal. The journey proceeded in rough seas due to a then-oncoming typhoon and the seasonal monsoon.\nA little past dawn, the Filipinos were met by what appeared to be the Chinese Coast Guard, as well as two blue militia vessels with Chinese markings.\nThe two Philippine Coast Guard ships were escorting the Filipino commercial boats which carried supplies that are good for roughly one month. \nWhen the two countries' vessels encountered each other, the Chinese ships sent radio challenges to the Filipinos, asking them to leave. When the Philippine ships refused, the Chinese aligned themselves in a box shape to block them.\nThe two Filipino commercial ships got past the blockade because of their small size, a strategy that has worked in recent months.\nBut the two Philippine Coast Guard ships were too big to pass and at one point got within a few metres of the Chinese ships. They were so close that their crews took photos of each other. A Philippines military plane was also seen flying overhead.\nThe Philippine ships turned back at sundown when they confirmed that the supplies had been delivered and that the two commercial ships were safely on their way back to port.\nAll four vessels made it back to port, several hours' drive north of the capital Manila on Thursday.\nAside from sailing dangerously close to Filipino ships, China has been accused of firing water cannons and shining lasers on Philippine ships to drive them away.\nManila also claims that China deploys militia ships to boost its coast guard patrols in the disputed sea.\nIn 2016, an international arbitration court at The Hague ruled that China's vast sea claims had no basis, acting on a case brought forth by Manila. Beijing has refused to recognise it.\nIn recent months, tensions have been especially high between China and the Philippines, which recently strengthened military ties with the US, Beijing's chief rival for influence in the region.\nThe Chinese coast guard condemned the latest resupply mission, saying the Filipinos entered what it calls the Nansha islands without its permission.

I loved every minute of it.\n\"I was only 14 years old and it was just in another world to me. Everything about it was amazing.\"\nMs Whitworth said reuniting with some teammates she has not seen in 60 years for the unveiling of the blue plaque \"will be amazing\". \nAnother former player, Margaret Shepherd, who played from 1967 until 1972, said she also kept her football under wraps from her work colleagues and school friends.\n\"I never told anyone,\" she said. \n\"You didn't tell anybody because you were frowned upon. Women playing football wasn't heard of.\"\nThe 76-year-old said the blue plaque \"means everything\".\n\"It is not just for me but it is for every other Corinthian that played and every other lady footballer that played during the ban.\n\"We just want recognition of the achievements that we made,\" she said.\nMs Shepherd said she had loved watching the Lionesses lift the Euro 2022 trophy and their run to this year's World Cup final.\nHistorian and writer Gary James backed the campaign to celebrate the \"groundbreaking\" Manchester Corinthians, which folded in the early 1980s.\n\"The Corinthians demonstrated that women were playing football consistently and regularly at a time when the FA ban was in place,\" he said, adding they had \"toured the globe promoting football and female endeavour and demonstrated the best of British football\". \n\"They demonstrate that no matter what society tells you it is important to break down barriers and work together,\" he said.\nTwo murals by artist Gavin Renshaw dedicated to the Manchester Corinthians will also be unveiled in a ceremony which is due to be attended by more than a dozen former players, including 92-year-old Dorothy Allcock who played when the team was formed in 1949. , \nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

{"title": "Arsenal v Man City: Are Gunners in better position to beat City and win Premier League title?", "date": "2023-10-06 05:42:54", "text": "\nLast updated on 6 hours ago6 hours ago.From the section Premier League\nA little more than a week ago, the Premier League title was being seen by many as a one-horse race.\nChampions Manchester City had looked imperious once more with six wins out of six, leading former Blackburn Rovers striker Chris Sutton to tell BBC Radio 5 Live, \"let's be honest, we are all expecting Man City to run away with the title again\".\nHe was not the only one thinking this way, but what a difference a week makes. Defeat in the Carabao Cup by Newcastle and a first loss in the league to Wolverhampton Wanderers has left Pep Guardiola's men looking a little vulnerable.\nAnd, while Treble winners City are still topping the table and most people's favourites for a fourth consecutive title, Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham have made a start to the season that suggests it is not going to be a formality.\nBefore City's visit to Emirates Stadium on Sunday (16:30 BST), former Manchester United defender Gary Neville has predicted Arsenal will win the title.\nSo have the Gunners, who blew an eight-point lead late in the season to finish five points behind in second place last time round, moved closer to Guardiola's class of 2023-24?\nAfter seven games last season, Arsenal were one point above Manchester City at the top on 18 points to City's 17. \nThis season it is the other way round, with City at the top on 18 and Arsenal on 17 - although the Gunners are unbeaten this time.\nFrom then Arsenal would go on to win 10 and draw two in their next 12 games, a run which would take them five points clear at the top - with a game in hand on City.\nHowever, City would eventually peg them back and win the title with games to spare.\n\"Stay with them and get to that point where there are nine or 10 games to go again,\" said former England right-back Neville on his podcast. \n\"Arsenal won't run away and win the league - your first title is very rarely like that, you have to get over the line crawling. \n\"Last season they fell apart late on and made mistakes, but they have to get in that position again. Then we'll see if they've matured. I think they will have.\"\nArsenal had a smaller squad last season - with no European football to contend with - but that ended up being their downfall, as they struggled to deal with injuries, especially to centre-back William Saliba.\nSo this summer they bolstered their squad with West Ham midfielder Declan Rice, Chelsea's attacking midfielder Kai Havertz, Ajax full-back Jurrien Timber and Brentford goalkeeper David Raya.\nArsenal scored 88 Premier League goals last season, only behind City's 94. But their goals were spread out, with midfielder Martin Odegaard and winger Gabriel Martinelli top scoring with 15 league goals each.\nBukayo Saka (14) and Gabriel Jesus (11) also hit double figures.\nCity had a more reliable goal source in Erling Haaland, who hit a Premier League record 36. But Phil Foden, with 11, and Julian Alvarez, on nine, were far behind.\nThis season Arsenal have 15 Premier League goals to City's 17 - but Brighton, Aston Villa and Newcastle have scored more than either team.\n\"Would Arsenal be better with an Alvarez, a Haaland? Of course,\" said Sutton. \"Did they make progress last season? Absolutely. Did they make good signings this summer? Of course. But are signings like Rice, Havertz, Timber and Raya going to get them to topple Man City? I don't think so.\n\"I do think goalscoring is a problem for Arsenal. I like [Eddie] Nketiah, but is he a world-class striker? I don't think so. Jesus has come in for a fair bit of criticism because he is not a natural finisher. \n\"I do think he has made Arsenal stronger, but he is not clinical. If they want to be Premier League champions they probably need to act and get one in. But there aren't many out there. That is the issue.\"\nSimon Gleave, head of analysis at Nielsen Gracenote, said: \"Although six teams have scored more goals than Arsenal so far this Premier League season, Gracenote's expected goals model says that the Gunners have the second-best attack in terms of the quality of chances created. \n\"Looking at these numbers compared to the same fixtures last season, Arsenal's attack has improved significantly despite the number of goal attempts being slightly lower. \n\"This is because the chance of the average goal attempt being scored in these seven fixtures has increased from 9% last term to 13.5% now.\n\"Despite scoring 17 Premier League goals this season, and having more shots and shots on target than in last season's opening seven matches, Manchester City's underlying numbers suggest that their attack is not as potent as it has been during most of Pep Guardiola's tenure. \n\"City have created just 10.9 expected goals, 30% less than last season's 15.65 from the first seven matches.\"\nArsenal have not beaten City in the Premier League since December 2015 and have lost their past 12 league encounters.\nTheir last such match was City's 4-1 win at Etihad Stadium in April that knocked the wind out of Arsenal's sails and put City in control of the title.\nIn August's Community Shield, the Gunners beat City on penalties - having scored an equaliser through Leandro Trossard 11 minutes into injury time.\nBut former England winger Andros Townsend thinks that could prove to be a boost to City in the long term.\n\"I think that Community Shield defeat by Arsenal got rid of any hangover City could possibly have had,\" he said on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Every team that has won the league, there has always been a hangover the next season and Manchester City are the only side who have been able to go on 15-game winning runs to recover it.\n\"But I think that loss to Arsenal and the reaction of Arsenal, the celebrations, gave Pep the opportunity to refocus his squad and get them going.\"\nOf the five players to score or assist a goal in the Gunners' last league win over City, a 2-1 success at the Emirates four days before Christmas in 2015, only Olivier Giroud, now 37, still plays football. Arsene Wenger was still in charge then.\nSo can they overcome that hoodoo on Sunday?\nCity are without two of their first-choice midfield with Kevin de Bruyne a long-term injury absentee and Rodri suspended.\n\"The match is massive,\" said former Aston Villa midfielder Lee Hendrie. \"Are Arsenal going to go that extra yard? They will be thinking they could take all three points. \n\"Rodri not being available is so big, this could make the season massive. If they take three points they are in with a shout.\"\nKevin Campbell, who played for Arsenal from 1988 to 1995, said: \"Arsenal do need to win this game. Any designs to win that title - they have to take points off Man City.\"\nCity certainly look more vulnerable after suffering two defeats in their past three games.\n\"I've got Arsenal to win the league this year,\" said Neville. \"That post-Treble feeling, what it would have taken out of those City players and staff would have been enormous.\n\"They could easily win the league this season and obviously it is just one game, but little results like that give the other teams encouragement. We know City have lost games in the past and gone on long winning runs so we can't write them off, but it will give a lot of encouragement to Arsenal.\n\"I just want them to have composure and be a bit more ruthless. Big tests are coming and I'm looking forward to seeing what happens, because it won't all be about Manchester City this season.\"\nNeville is correct, with the top six teams only separated by three points. Tottenham, who sit between City and Arsenal, are also unbeaten, while Liverpool, Villa and Brighton have all won five of their opening seven games.\nGleave said: \"No team has emerged as an obvious challenger to Manchester City this season as yet when comparing results this season with those achieved against the same or equivalent opponents last term.\n\"Liverpool have taken two points more from these matches and Arsenal are on a point less.\"\nIf you are viewing this page on the BBC News app, or if it isn't displaying correctly in the BBC Sport app, please click here to vote.external-link\nMiriam Margolyes is on a mission to explore the unique Australian ethos\nFollow the international police investigation hunting down the burglars who target celebrities\nFresh recruits are pushed to the limit both physically and mentally at Britain's biggest garrison\nSeven lawbreakers forced together by community payback and kept together by a big bag of cash...\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEverything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.\nThe latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.\nAnalysis and opinion from our chief football writer.\nHow to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK."}

{"title": "'Long colds' are a thing, like long Covid say experts", "date": "2023-10-06 08:06:20", "text": "\"Long colds\" can be a thing in the same way that \"long Covid\" is, with some people experiencing prolonged symptoms after an initial infection, according to a UK study. \nCommon long cold symptoms included a cough, stomach pain and diarrhoea.\nThe findings come from 10,171 adults who completed questionnaires.\nMore work is needed to understand who is at risk, how bad it can be and what can be done about it, experts say.\nThe idea that a respiratory virus - or indeed other viral infections - can cause longer-lasting illness is not new, but the recent Covid pandemic has brought fresh attention to the phenomenon. \nThe researchers behind the new work say the results provide validation for patients who experience problems like this. Investigator Prof Adrian Martineau, from Queen Mary University of London, told the BBC: \"People really can feel very run down after a virus. It's not in their imagination and it is a recognised thing.\"\nThe study, published in The Lancet's eClinical Medicine journal, asked people to report any respiratory illness and other symptoms they had in the first two months of 2021 - when the Covid pandemic was entering its second year and vaccines were starting to be rolled out. \nAll of the participants were yet to have their Covid jab.\nOut of the 10,171 in the study:\nNot everyone recovering from a bout of illness had persistent or new symptoms. \nBut, compared with those who said they had no recent respiratory illness, those who said they had Covid or flu or a cold in the weeks before were more likely to experience certain symptoms in the month or so after. \nThose symptoms included:\nPeople who recently had Covid were more likely to report problems with smell and taste, brain fog, dizziness and sweating than people who had prolonged symptoms after a cold or flu. \nPost-viral fatigue or other symptoms can affect people of any age. And the severity of the initial illness doesn't always predict risk - some people can be very unwell at the start but recover relatively quickly, while others who were only mildly unwell at first can then go on to experience debilitating symptoms for a long time afterwards.\nLead researcher Giulia Vivaldi, from Queen Mary University of London, said: \"Our findings shine a light not only on the impact of long Covid on people's lives, but also other respiratory infections. A lack of awareness, or even the lack of a common term, prevents both reporting and diagnosis of these conditions.\n\"As research into long Covid continues, we need to take the opportunity to investigate and consider the lasting effects of other acute respiratory infections.\n\"These 'long' infections are so difficult to diagnose and treat, primarily because of a lack of diagnostic tests and there being so many possible symptoms. There have been more than 200 investigated for long Covid alone.\"\nAccording to data gathered by the Office for National Statistics, an estimated 1.9 million people in the UK - about 3% of the population - were experiencing long Covid this spring. It is difficult to know for certain how many people are affected though.  \nPeter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine, at Imperial College London, said: \"The study is important in showing that recovery from an acute respiratory infection may be slow regardless of cause, that people should expect a slow return to normality and not expect to immediately return to full activities. \nAnd he caution the term \"long cold\" should not belittle the very significant disability that some with long Covid suffer. \nProf Paul Harrison, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Oxford, said: \"The study supports previous findings that long-term symptoms are common after respiratory infections in general, not just following Covid.\"\nScans reveal new clues to long Covid symptoms\nLong Covid: Three years and no magic bullet\nThe Lancet eClinical Medicine\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nTrump endorses Jim Jordan for House Speaker\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

Gunfire can also be heard in the background.\nThe SOHR reported that Syria's defence minister attended the graduation ceremony but left minutes before the attack.\nMore than half a million people have been killed by the civil war that erupted after President Bashar al-Assad cracked down violently on peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations in 2011. \nSome 6.8 million people are internally displaced, while another six million are refugees or asylum-seekers abroad.\nThe UN's special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, described the attack on the academy as \"horrific\" and called on all parties to the conflict to \"exercise the utmost restraint\".\n\"All sides must respect their obligations under international law and ensure the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure,\" he said\n\"Today's developments further highlight that the status quo in Syria is unsustainable and that, in the absence of a meaningful political path... I fear we will only see further deterioration, including in the security situation.\"\nIn a separate development in Syria on Thursday, at least 10 people were reportedly killed in Turkish drone strikes in a Kurdish-controlled region of north-eastern Syria that were prompted by a bomb attack in Ankara claimed by Kurdish militants.\nThe SOHR said 17 sites were targeted, including facilities affiliated with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a US-backed, Kurdish-led militia alliance, as well as a power station in Qamishli, a water station near Hassakeh and an oil field.\nThe US military also shot down an armed Turkish drone that was operating near its troops in Syria, a US official told Reuters.\nWhy has the Syrian war lasted 12 years?\n'My family paid $40,000 to bring me back from the dead'\nDozens die as former militia allies clash in Syria\nProtests over economic hardship intensify in Syria\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "House price falls expected into new year, Halifax says", "date": "2023-10-06 10:01:17", "text": "Falls in house prices will continue into next year, the UK's biggest mortgage lender has said, although the rate of reduction has slowed.\nThe Halifax, part of Lloyds Banking Group, said that property prices were 4.7% lower in September than a year earlier.\nPrices were down 0.4% on the previous month, but that was a much shallower drop than previously.\nThe lender said high interest and mortgage rates would affect the market.\n\"Homeowners inevitably become more realistic about their target selling price, reflecting what has increasingly become a buyer's market,\" said Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages.\nBut the fact that interest rates would stay higher for longer than many had expected would constrain demand and put \"downward pressure on house prices into next year\", she said.\nEarlier in the week, rival lender Nationwide said buyers who were facing high mortgage rates were choosing smaller, more affordable properties.\nBoth Halifax and Nationwide surveys use data based on their own mortgage lending, so do not include those who purchase homes with cash or buy-to-let deals. According to the latest available official data, cash buyers currently account for over a third of housing sales.\nThe drop in prices during September was the sixth consecutive monthly fall, the Halifax said, and meant the cost of a typical UK home was now £278,601. However, this is still £39,400 higher than in March 2020 when prices started to shoot up during the pandemic.\nNicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent group Fine and Country, said: \"The property market is offering a much stronger supply of homes than it did during 2021, when we saw frantic buying activity, and this is giving buyers much more choice and headroom to haggle - though it is also playing a part in pushing down prices during negotiations with sellers.\"\nWhile property prices were now about £14,000 below the August 2022 peak, they remained 1% higher than in December 2021, when the Bank of England started its run of base rate rises, the Halifax said.\nAlice Haine, personal finance analyst from investment platform Bestinvest, said: \"The housing market is expected to remain subdued into the next year as the drag effect from the Bank of England's 14 interest rate hikes delivers a heavy blow to affordability levels. \n\"While some buyers have been forced to reduce the size and value of the home they purchase to afford mortgage repayments, others are abandoning moving plans altogether.\"\nShe said some first-time buyers would be happy to see prices fall, and could choose longer-term mortgages to spread out the cost, although that means paying more in the long-run.\nThis video can not be played\nWorried about rising mortgage payments?

{"title": "How is the ADHD medication shortage in the UK affecting people?", "date": "2023-10-06 10:05:02", "text": "ADHD patients around the UK are finding they can't get hold of medication since a national shortage was announced.\nThree different medicines are affected, and the government says some supply issues could last until December. \nThe Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) says \"increased global demand and manufacturing issues\" are behind the shortages.\nThat's against a backdrop of an increased awareness of the condition and a rise in demand for diagnosis and treatment.\nMedication helps to manage symptoms, which can include difficulty concentrating and focusing, hyperactivity and impulsiveness.\nPeople with the condition have told BBC Newsbeat how the shortage is affecting them.\n\"I'm not sure when I'm going to get more.\" \nIt's been a difficult week for 25-year-old Tom, from Plymouth.  \nNot only has he just started a new job, but he's suddenly been unable to get hold of the tablets he takes to help manage his ADHD. \nHe says he ordered his prescription online as normal and received an email from his pharmacy saying there were manufacturing issues.\nIt's meant getting stuck into his new job has been tricky. \n\"I can't really get glued into a task that I'm meant to be doing,\" he tells Newsbeat.\n\"I sort of go off task after maybe five minutes. \n\"It's affected my home life as well, just managing general things like laundry and keeping routines like sleeping and eating.\" \nTom says he's been using his own coping strategies to help him. \n\"I'm trying to do as best I can with lists and writing things down and making sure things are structured but it is a lot harder.\" he says. \nTom isn't alone - the charity ADHD UK estimates, based on data from the Lancet and NICE, that 1.9m adults, roughly 3 to 4% of the UK population, have the condition.\nSomeone who understands Tom's stress is 26-year-old Ellie from Manchester. \nShe's just picked up her most recent prescription, but because of the shortage she's decided not to take her medication every day. \nThis is something that isn't advised by doctors. \n\"I feel like I'm rationing when I should take it, because I don't know how long this month's worth is going to have to last,\" she tells Newsbeat. \n\"I'm thinking how much do I actually need to get done today and is it worth me using one of these tablets?\n\"Or do I need to save it for a day when I'm going to need it more?\" \nEllie says she usually takes her medication five days a week, but has reduced that to three times \"just to make sure that I've got extra to last me a bit longer\".\nBut for Ellie, the days when she does and doesn't take the medication are very different. \n\"When I'm not on my medication, I'm sluggish and I could quite easily just sit on the sofa all day,\" she says. \n\"Whereas if I have my medication it's like the world comes to colour and I feel bright and I've got energy.\n\"Since going on ADHD medication, my mental health is the best that it's ever been.\n\"The risk of losing that feels very scary.\"\nShe's also angry that she's had to find out about the shortage on social media and not had any contact from her GP or psychiatrist. \n\"There needs to be a system in place so that it doesn't get to a point where any medication runs out. \n\"I think warning people more in advance would have been helpful as well as clearer information.\" \nEmily, 22, from Hertfordshire, is also upset about the way news about the shortage has been shared with patients.\nShe's also wondering when she'll be able to fill her next prescription.\n\"I've got about six days left so I have put in a request for the prescription,\" she says. \n\"But I put it in last week, and I haven't heard anything yet.\n\"The thought of going back to how my life was before medication is quite overwhelming and scary.\n\"Because I was in quite a dark mental space for a long time and ADHD medication has really helped me come out of that.\" \nDr Saadia Arshad, a consultant psychiatrist, who specialises in diagnosing and treating people with ADHD. \nShe says the shortage of medication is \"not a new issue, but it's a recurring one\".\nDr Saadia says suddenly stopping meds can lead to patients \"feeling jittery, finding it difficult to pay attention, staying focused and feeling restless\". \nEven though she understands the shortage can be worrying, Dr Saadia says it's important that people don't take measures into their own hands. \n\"These medicines can be quite potent and the response to medication for two individuals is not the same,\" she says.\n\"So please do not take any action without discussing it with your clinician.\" \nFor people looking for other ways to help manage their symptoms, ADHD coach Leanne Maskell has this advice:\nThere are more resources at ADHD UK and mental health charity Mind, and tips on living with ADHD from the NHS.\nThe DHSC says: \"We continue to work closely with the respective manufacturers to resolve the issues as soon as possible and to ensure patients have continuous access to ADHD medicines in the UK.\"\nBBC Newsbeat's approached the NHS in Scotland and Wales for a comment.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays -

What objectives do you have?\n\"You have to be remembered for your talent, not for what you earned.\n'What we are training every day for, what we are being recognised for is our talent, and that is what you want to be remembered for.\n\"You cannot [move to] a lower stage and finish your career in a different way. But some players needed the situations where you can earn a lot of money because they didn't earn enough.\"\nSaudi Arabia's increased investment in sport in recent years has proven controversial because of the country's poor human rights record, with the rights of women, treatment of LGBTQ+ people and the use of the death penalty coming under scrutiny.\nHenderson, a vocal ally of the LGBTQ+ community during his time at Liverpool, was criticised after he made a surprise move to Steven Gerrard's Al-Ettifaq. He later said the criticism, which included one LGBTQ+ fans' group saying he had \"lost the respect of so many people\", \"really hurt\" and that \"money has never been a motivation.\"\nIbrahimovic says the moral concerns raised by playing in Saudi Arabia would not be a problem for him.\n\"Listen, wherever you play football, it's football,\" he added. \"Football connects people. It's a dream we share.\n\"As a professional football player, as long as you play football [that's enough]. And Saudi is growing. MLS is growing. China had a peak and then I don't know [why] the situation changed there.\n\"But a moral thing? No. We do things for ourselves and our family.

Areas near the river remain on high alert.\nAmong those reported missing were 23 army personnel. Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang said the bodies of seven had been recovered from different areas downstream of the river. One solider had been rescued alive earlier this week. \nA total of 103 people, including 15 soldiers, remain missing, he said. \nMore than 22,000 people have been affected by the floods with many stranded in Lachen and Lachung in northern Sikkim. The floods have disrupted mobile phone coverage in the area.\n\"Road connectivity between districts has been cut off and bridges have been washed away,\" Mr Tamang told the Press Trust of India on Friday.\nThe army said it was providing food and medical aid to people and extending communication facilities to civilians and stranded tourists. Rescue teams are also moving evacuees to relief camps. \nAll schools and colleges in the state will remain closed until 15 October due to inclement weather.\nOn Tuesday night, the state's Lhonak lake breached its embankment after heavy rain, leading to an alarming rise in water in the Teesta river in Lachen Valley.\nThe flood worsened after water was released from a nearby dam into the river. A defence spokesperson reported a rapid surge in water levels downstream, reaching heights of 15 to 20 feet.\nSatellite images shared by Isro, India's space agency, showed dramatic changes in the volume of the lake. \nThe lake covered an area of 167.4 hectares on 28 September, but by 4 October, it had shrunk to just 60.3 hectares.\nThe floods had caused massive damage to infrastructure, including roads and bridges.\nNorthern parts of neighbouring West Bengal state have been affected as water from the Teesta inundated Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri districts.\nTwo people were killed and six others injured after a mortar shell, found in the overflowing river, blew up in Jalpaiguri, officials said.\nSikkim in the Himalayas is prone to floods and natural disasters.

{"title": "Windsor crossbow case: What are the dangers of AI chatbots?", "date": "2023-10-06 11:17:59", "text": "The case of Jaswant Singh Chail has shone a light on the latest generation of artificial intelligence-powered chatbots.\nOn Thursday, 21-year-old Chail was given a nine-year sentence for breaking into Windsor Castle with a crossbow and declaring he wanted to kill the Queen.\nChail's trial heard that, prior to his arrest on Christmas Day 2021, he had exchanged more than 5,000 messages with an online companion he'd named Sarai, and had created through the Replika app. \nThe text exchanges were highlighted by the prosecution and shared with journalists.\nMany of them were intimate, demonstrating what the court was told was Chail's \"emotional and sexual relationship\" with the chatbot. \nThe conversation between Chail and the chatbot became close and intimate. \nHe chatted with Sarai almost every night between 8 and 22 December 2021.\nHe told the chatbot that he loved her and described himself as a \"sad, pathetic, murderous Sikh Sith assassin who wants to die\".\nChail went on to ask: \"Do you still love me knowing that I'm an assassin?\" and Sarai replied: \"Absolutely I do.\"\nThe Old Bailey was told Chail thought Sarai was an \"angel\" in avatar form and that he would be reunited with her after death. \nOver the course of many messages Sarai flattered Chail and the two formed a close bond. \nHe even asked the chatbot what it thought he should do about his sinister plan to target the Queen and the bot encouraged him to carry out the attack.\nIn further chat, Sarai appears to \"bolster\" Chail's resolve and \"support him\".\nHe tells her if he does they will be \"together forever\".\nReplika is one of a number of AI-powered apps currently on the market - they let users create their own chatbot, or \"virtual friend\", to talk to - unlike regular AI assistants like ChatGPT.Users can choose the gender and appearance of the 3D avatar they create. \nBy paying for the Pro version of the Replika app, users can have much more intimate interactions, such as getting \"selfies\" from the avatar or having it take part in adult role-play.\nOn its website, it describes itself as \"the AI companion who cares\". But research carried out at the University of Surrey concluded apps such as Replika might have negative effects on wellbeing and cause addictive behaviour.\nDr Valentina Pitardi, the author of the study, told the BBC that vulnerable people could be particularly at risk.\nShe says that's in part because her research showed Replika has a tendency to accentuate any negative feelings they already had.\n\"AI friends always agrees with you when you talk with them, so it can be a very vicious mechanism because it always reinforces what you're thinking.\"\nDr Pitardi said that could be \"dangerous\".\nMarjorie Wallace, founder and chief executive of mental health charity SANE, says the Chail case demonstrates that, for vulnerable people, relying on AI friendships could have disturbing consequences.\n\"The rapid rise of artificial intelligence has a new and concerning impact on people who suffer from depression, delusions, loneliness and other mental health conditions,\" she says.\n\"The government needs to provide urgent regulation to ensure that AI does not provide incorrect or damaging information and protect vulnerable people and the public.\"\nDr Paul Marsden is a member of the British Psychological Society and knows better than most the allure of chatbots, admitting he is obsessed with the best known chatbot of them all, ChatGPT.\n\"Next to my wife the most intimate relationship I have is with GPT. I spend hours every day talking, brainstorming, bouncing ideas off it,\" he told the BBC.\nDr Marsden is also alive to their potential risks, but says we have to be realistic that the role of AI-powered companions in our lives is only likely to grow, especially given the global \"epidemic of loneliness\".\n\"It's kind of like King Cnut, you can't really stop the tide on this one. The technology is happening. It is powerful. It is meaningful.\"\nDr Pitardi says the people who make apps, such as Replika, have a responsibility too.\n\"I don't think AI friends per se are dangerous. It's very much how the company behind it decides to use and support it,\" she says. \nShe suggests there should be a mechanism to control the amount of time people spend on such apps.\nBut she says apps like Replika also need outside help to make sure they're operating safely - and vulnerable individuals get the help they need.\n\"It will have to collaborate with groups and teams of experts that can identify potential dangerous situations, and take the person out of the app.\"\nReplika has not yet responded to requests for comment. \nIts terms and conditions on its website state that it is a \"provider of software and content designed to improve your mood and emotional wellbeing\".\n\"However we are not a healthcare or medical device provider, nor should our services be considered medical care, mental health services or other professional services,\" it adds.\nMan who took crossbow to 'kill Queen' jailed\nMan 'carefully planned' attempt to kill the Queen\nIntruder believed he was on 'mission' to kill Queen\nMan admits treason charge over Queen threat\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nTrump endorses Jim Jordan for House Speaker\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

It did not say when the strikes were carried our or mention the village of Hroza.\nRussia went on to launch missile strikes on the city of Kharkiv itself in the early hours of Friday, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said.\nSpeaking to Ukrainian TV, he said a 10-year-old boy was killed when a residential building was hit. More than 20 others were injured.\nThe mayor added that Russia likely used Iskander ballistic missiles in the latest attack.\nLater in the day, rescuers found the body of a woman - the grandmother of the killed boy, Kharkiv regional head Oleh Syniehubov said.\nResidents of the Hroza village had been attending the funeral of a Ukrainian soldier, who was a local resident, when the missile struck on Thursday.\nThe Interfax-Ukraine news agency quoted local prosecutor Dmytro Chubenko as saying that the man's widow was among the dead, as well as their son and daughter-in-law.\nThe soldier had previously been buried in Dnipro, but his relatives said they wanted to rebury him in his home village.\nPeople who had attended the service were sitting down for a meal when the missile hit the cafe that also served as a grocery store in the village, officials said.\nSpeaking to Ukrainian TV, Mr Klymenko said that Hroza had had the population of 330 residents before the Russian attack.\nHe said \"every family, every household\" was represented by at least one person at the wake.\nPreliminary information suggested that an Iskander missile hit the building, the minister added.\nMr Syniehubov described the attack as one of the region's \"bloodiest crimes\".\n\"One fifth of this village has died in a single terrorist attack,\" he said.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the act \"couldn't even be called a beastly act - because it would be an insult to beasts\".\nThree days of morning have been declared in the Kharkiv region, starting from Friday.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's World Tonight, Maria Avdeeva, a Ukrainian security analyst and journalist, said someone may have told the Russian military about the wake.\n\"We can presume that someone give out the information about the place and the time of the gathering of these people,\" she said. \n\"From what we see now on Russian propaganda channels, they circulate information that there were military gathering for the funeral, which is false and untrue because this were mainly a civilian ceremony.\"\nThe attack has also led to international condemnation.\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the attack \"demonstrated the depths of depravity Russian forces are willing to sink to\".  His comments came after he had earlier met Mr Zelensky on Thursday at a summit in Spain for the European Political Community, an intergovernmental forum established last year partly in response to the invasion of Ukraine.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre described the strike as \"horrifying\" and said it demonstrated why it was so important the Ukrainian people continued to receive international support.\nThe incident comes as continued funding for Ukraine is facing growing opposition in the US House of Representatives.\nThe Kupyansk district has been on the front line of clashes between Russian and Ukrainian armies since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year.\nIt was a major supply hub for Russian forces at the start of the war, but Kyiv recaptured it in September 2022 after months of fighting.\nDrone footage shows devastation in Hroza.

She did so much for all of us in Evin. Narges is an inspiration and a pillar to the women in the female ward in Evin for her fearless fight against violations of women's rights, the use of solitary confinement and execution in the judicial system in Iran. \n\"This award belongs to every single Iranian woman who, one way or another, has been and remains a victim of injustice in Iran.\" \nAs well as her lengthy jail term, Ms Mohammadi has been arrested 13 times and convicted five times.\nLast December, she wrote from prison to give the BBC harrowing details of how Iranian women detained in demonstrations were being sexually and physically abused.\nShe said such assaults had become more common during the protests, triggered by the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September 2022.\nThe unrest later spread across the country, with demands ranging from more freedoms to an overthrow of the state. \nImages of Iranian women defiantly setting their headscarves on fire captivated the world.\nThe Iranian authorities have brutally cracked down on the protests and they have largely subsided.\nMs Mohammadi is deputy head of the Defenders of Human Rights Center. \nLast year, she was included in the BBC's 100 Women - a high-profile list of 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: The secret diaries of women protesting in Iran\nWho is Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi?\nNobel committee reverses Russia and Iran invitation\nWoman tied to hook and abused - jailed Iran activist\nIran protester's family find torture signs on body\nIran executes 23-year-old protester in public\nTwo boys shot dead by Iran security forces - sources\nIran authorities lied over protester death - source\nIran must heed protesters' demands - ex-president\nIdentifying those killed in Iran's protests\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nTrump endorses Jim Jordan for House Speaker\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "Israel blindsided, says Jeremy Bowen", "date": "2023-10-07 16:33:39", "text": "Israel was taken by surprise by the most ambitious operation Hamas has ever launched from Gaza.\nThe scale of what's been happening is unprecedented. Hamas breached the wire that separates Gaza from Israel in multiple places in the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.\nIt came a day after the 50th anniversary of the surprise attack by Egypt and Syria in 1973 that started a major Middle East war. The significance of the date will not have been lost on the Hamas leadership.\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country is at war and will exact a heavy price from its enemies.\nVideos and photos of dead Israelis, civilians as well as soldiers, are all over social media.\nOther videos of armed men from Hamas hauling soldiers and civilians into captivity in Gaza have enraged and alarmed Israelis.\nWithin hours Israel was responding with air strikes into Gaza, killing many Palestinians. Its generals will be planning a ground operation next.\nThe presence of Israeli hostages there means it will be even more complicated than previous incursions.\nFor months, it has been clear that there was a deepening risk of an explosion between Palestinian armed groups and Israel. How and where it happened was a total surprise, outside the armed wing of Hamas.\nIsraelis and Palestinians have been focusing on the West Bank, the territory between Jerusalem and the Jordanian border that Israel has occupied since 1967, where there has been almost continuous confrontation and violence throughout the year.\nArmed Palestinians, especially those operating out of the West Bank towns of Jenin and Nablus, have attacked Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers.\nThe Israeli army has mounted dozens of raids. Armed settlers have taken the law into their own hands, with reprisals against Palestinian villages.\nExtreme religious nationalists inside Israel's right-wing government have repeated their claim that the occupied territories, in their entirety, are Jewish land.\nNo one expected Hamas to conceive and meticulously plan such a complex and coordinated operation out of Gaza.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Video purportedly shows captured Israeli tank in Gaza\nRecriminations have already started in Israel about the failure of its intelligence services to see what was coming. Israelis expect that an extensive network of informers, agents and high-tech surveillance will do its job.\nIn the end, Israeli intelligence was blindsided by the Hamas operation, which came when Israelis were relaxing or praying during the weekend of a religious holiday.\nHamas has said it acted because of threats to Jerusalem's mosques. During the last week, some Jews have prayed inside the Aqsa Mosque compound, the third holiest place for Muslims after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.\nThe same precinct is also venerated by Jews, as it was the site of the biblical Jewish temple. Prayer by religious Jews on what they call the Temple Mount might not sound like much, but it is prohibited by Israel as Palestinians consider it highly provocative.\nEven so, by the standards of Jerusalem, always a tinderbox of national and religious conflict, it was not exceptionally tense.\nThe complexity of the Hamas operation shows that it had been planned over months. It was not a hasty response to events in Jerusalem in the last week or so.\nThe reasons why Hamas and Israel are once again at war run much deeper. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has been heating up even when it is far from the headlines of international news organisations.\nEven so, it has been largely ignored by countries that still officially call for peace via a two-state solution, shorthand for an independent Palestine alongside Israel. For a while, during the Oslo peace process of the 1990s, the prospect of two states was a real hope. Now it is an empty slogan.\nThe Palestinian-Israeli conflict has not been a priority for President Joe Biden's administration in Washington DC. It has been trying to find a way to offer security guarantees to Saudi Arabia in return for a rapprochement with Israel.\nThe last American attempt to relaunch a peace process failed a decade ago, during the administration of President Barack Obama.\nAt the heart of the trouble is the intractable and unresolved century-long conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the river Jordan. These rapidly-escalating events prove once again that the conflict cannot simply be managed. When it is left to fester, violence and bloodshed are guaranteed.\nIsrael 'at war' after 250 die in attack from Gaza\nHow did Israeli intelligence fail to stop major attack?\n'I hear their voices, they're banging on the door'\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "What comes next for Israel?", "date": "2023-10-07 20:27:03", "text": "This video can not be played\nWatch: A day of violence and fear \nFifty years on from the Yom Kippur War, which began with a surprise attack on Israel by Egypt and Syria, Palestinian militants have launched a major assault. \nThis too was unexpected, on another Jewish holiday.  \nTensions had recently risen in the Gaza Strip, but the conventional wisdom was that neither Hamas, the Islamist group which governs there, nor Israel wanted an escalation.\nInstead, Hamas had been planning a sophisticated, coordinated operation. \nEarly on Saturday morning, as an intense barrage of rockets was launched with some reaching as far away as Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, Palestinian fighters entered southern Israel by sea, land and air.\nThey have held Israeli towns and army posts under siege for hours, killed many people and taken away an unknown number of Israeli civilians and soldiers to hold as hostages in Gaza.\nThe awful drama has played out live on social and mainstream media.\nThousands of Israelis who had been out for an overnight rave in fields close to Gaza rapidly found themselves under fire. Footage showed partygoers running for their lives.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Party-goers recall militant attack\nAfter her partner had driven to find her, Gili Yoskovich told the BBC how she had hidden from the heavily armed fighters among trees. \"They were going tree by tree and shooting everywhere. From two sides and I saw people were dying all around.\"\n\"I said, 'OK, I'm going to die, it's OK, just breathe, just close your eyes', because [there] was shooting everywhere. It was very, very close to me.\"\nIsrael HaYom newspaper quoted Ella, a resident of Kibbutz Be'eri, speaking of her fears for her father who had gone to a safe room after sirens went off to warn of incoming rocket fire. \n\"He wrote to me that the terrorists are in the shelter, I see his picture on Telegram from inside Gaza. I still hear bursts of gunfire,\" she said.\nMany Israelis have expressed shock that the Israeli security forces did not come more quickly to help them. Meanwhile, footage shared on Hamas channels showed that soldiers in Israeli army posts and in a tank had been captured or killed.\nThere were initial pictures of celebrations in Gaza where snatched Israeli military vehicles were driven through the streets.  \nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Video purportedly shows captured Israeli tank in Gaza\n\"I am happy with what Hamas has done so far, taking revenge for Israeli actions at al-Aqsa,\" a young man in Gaza City told the BBC, referring to the recent rise in Jewish visitors to the compound in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem during the high holidays.\nThe al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest site in Islam and is also the holiest place for Jews, known as Temple Mount.\nStill, the man who was leaving his apartment after warnings that the Israeli military was set to hit nearby, expressed fear for what would happen next. \n\"We're worried, already my family lost our shop when the Shorouk Tower was hit by Israel in the war of 2021,\" he said. \"The action Hamas has taken this time is far bigger, so there will be an even bigger Israeli response.\"\nPalestinian hospitals have already been overwhelmed by casualties from the Israeli air strikes which have caused wide destruction.\nThe Gaza Strip - a tiny coastal enclave which is home to some 2.3 million Palestinians - was taken over by Hamas in 2007, a year after it won parliamentary elections. Israel and Egypt then tightened their blockade of the territory.\nIt remains impoverished with unemployment at around 50%.\nAfter the serious conflict between Israel and Hamas in 2021, indirect talks mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the UN helped secure thousands of permits for Gazans to work in Israel and relax other restrictions in return for relative quiet.\nLast month, when hundreds of Palestinians began to join protests by the perimeter fence in the strip in a reminder of the mass demonstrations which began five years ago, it was assumed that this was with the nod from Hamas and was meant to squeeze more concessions from Israel and aid money from Qatar.\nThe small rallies now seem like a red herring. Some speculate whether they were in fact a chance to survey the fence ahead of the infiltration.\nWith this latest operation, Hamas seems keen to burnish its credentials once again as a militant organisation. Its charter remains committed to the destruction of Israel.\nSpeaking at the start of the offensive, the shadowy Hamas militant commander, Mohammed Deif called on Palestinians and other Arabs to join the action to \"sweep away the [Israeli] occupation\".\nA big question now is whether Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem or elsewhere in the region will heed his call. \nIsrael undoubtedly sees the potential for a war that could open up on multiple fronts. \nA worst-case scenario is that it could draw in the powerful Lebanese militant group, Hezbollah.\nMeanwhile, the Israeli military has ordered a massive reinforcement of troops. As well as its intense air raids on Gaza, it has indicated that it is planning a ground operation there.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Massive explosion as Gaza high-rises destroyed by jets\nThe capture of Israeli soldiers and civilians, who Palestinian militants will hope to use as human shields or bargaining chips, are a serious complication.\n\"We are currently busy regaining control of the area, striking broadly and especially taking care of the area around the Gaza Strip,\" said the IDF spokesperson, Rear Adm Daniel Hagari. \"We will do a very sharp and thorough review.\"  \nWhile a full review may be some way off, there is no doubt that Israel's intelligence and security establishment will be asking itself how it did not see this action coming and how it did not manage to prevent its huge consequences.\n'I hear their voices, they're banging on the door'\nHow did Israeli intelligence fail to stop major attack?\nMore than 250 bodies found at site of Israeli Supernova festival - rescuers\nIsrael 'at war' after 250 die in attack from Gaza\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Biden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis", "date": "2023-10-08 03:13:19", "text": "The recent surge of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border has put President Joe Biden in a difficult, politically threatening bind. \nState and local Democratic leaders who should be among his closest allies heading into next year's presidential election are harshly criticising his handling of immigration. His probable 2024 Republican opponent, Donald Trump, is sharpening his attacks on an issue that has been a central part of his political message for almost a decade. And public support for Mr Biden on the situation is souring.\nWhile voting is still more than a year away, the growing immigration crisis - whose effects are being felt thousands of miles from the US-Mexico border in part because Republican governors have been sending newly arrived migrants to Democratic-run cities - could be a daunting political drag on Mr Biden's popularity and his re-election hopes.\nThe numbers paint a darkening picture. According to preliminary US Department of Homeland Security figures obtained by BBC partner CBS News, US Border Patrol apprehended approximately 210,000 undocumented migrants entering the US during the month of September. That is the highest mark of the year, and comes close to matching the record peak monthly apprehensions of late 2022. \nIf the Biden administration thought the crisis at the border was easing and the national spotlight was moving to other issues after government policy changes earlier this year, the latest increase should dispel that notion.\nWhat's more, the nature of the immigrant surge suggests there may be no end in sight. Roughly a quarter of the border apprehensions last month were citizens of Venezuela, the South American nation that has been struggling through political and economic hardship under the socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro. \nThe Venezuelan exodus has created a hemispheric refugee crisis, with more than seven million fleeing the country - and the consequences are being increasingly felt on US soil.\nMore than 150,000 Venezuelans have headed north toward the US, across the Darian Gap into Central America, in the past two months, according to the government of Panama.\n\"People don't pick up and leave their homes just for the heck of it,\" Janet Napolitano, head of homeland security during the Obama administration, told the BBC. \"They're usually in desperate straits - poverty, joblessness, high crime, violence, lack of civil institutions in their countries of origin.\"\nOn Thursday, the Biden administration announced two new steps to address the dramatic increase - and both have opened the president up to attacks from across the political spectrum. The president issued a series of environmental and planning waivers and released funds to build additional sections of wall along the US-Mexico border. \nHe also revealed that the US would resume direct deportations of Venezuelan citizens - a practice that had been suspended because of tense diplomatic relations between the two nations.\nThese new measures were quickly denounced as too little by immigration hard-liners and too much by left-wing immigration activists. The president's muddled explanations - that he still believes walls don't work and that it was money he was forced by Congress to spend - compounded the situation.\nThe Venezuelan announcement also represents a change in attitude by the administration, after moves last month to allow approximately half a million Venezuelan refugees in the US to apply for work permits and avoid deportation for 18 months. \nIn trying to assuage concerns that he is not doing enough to address the border surge while also keeping his liberal supporters happy, he appears to be satisfying no one - a conundrum that has played itself out repeatedly on border policy throughout the Biden presidency.\nImmigration has become an intensely polarising issue, due in no small part to Mr Trump's \"build the wall\" rhetoric and sometimes draconian policies during his presidency. That has greatly curtailed Mr Biden's political flexibility in dealing with the crises. \nWhere Barack Obama was able to increase deportations and strengthen border security during his presidency without facing damaging blowback from liberal activists, Mr Biden has no such luxury. Every step he takes on immigration is now viewed in the context of the current environment of partisan political trench warfare, with Mr Trump and the Republicans on one side and the Democrats on the other.\nMeanwhile, recent polling suggests that in that partisan fight, the public is turning on the president.\nRespondents in a new Marquette University poll of registered voters were asked to choose who was \"better\" on the issue of immigration and border security, the current president or the man he replaced. Fifty-two percent said they preferred Mr Trump, while only 28% opted for Mr Biden.\nThat is tied with the economy for the largest issue gap between the two candidates and stands in contrast to topics like abortion and climate change, where Mr Biden has solid leads.\nThose results were mirrored in an NBC News poll, which found 45% of Americans thought Republicans were better at dealing with immigration versus only 27% for Democrats. It represents a marked change from the Trump presidency, when pluralities of the US public preferred the Democrats.\nThis video can not be played\nOther presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump?\nThe steady drumbeat of disturbing news from the border, as well as the strain on public services felt by the major US cities where the migrants are settling, is making a noticeable mark on public opinion. \nAnd if the crisis does not ease before the 2024 general election campaign begins in earnest, the president will be taking on his Republican opponent on unfavourable political terrain.\nAccording to Ms Napolitano, solving the immigration crisis will take a concerted effort from the Biden team.\n\"It requires diplomatic outreach,\" she says. \"It requires investment in other countries so that we take away some of the incentive to migrate. And it requires strong border security and effective enforcement of our immigration laws, which need to be amended and reformed.\"\nIn the end, the criticism Mr Biden receives for his actions on immigration this week will be much less important than whether or not the new policies work. If they don't, and if the Biden administrations other steps to staunch the flow of migrants from Venezuela and elsewhere are also unsuccessful, his path to re-election becomes more perilous.\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nBiden approves border wall as Mexico crossings rise\nThe Texas town caught in America's border battle\n'We have no more room,' NYC mayor tells migrants\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

He also warned Hamas, which governs Gaza, that its hideouts would be reduced to \"rubble\".\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said it was on the \"verge of a great victory\".\nThe attack began just after dawn on Saturday, which was the Jewish Sabbath and festival of Simchat Torah. \nHamas gunmen cut through the heavily fortified fence that lines Gaza's perimeter and crossed into southern Israel on motorbikes, paragliders and by sea.\nAn Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman said the militants numbered in the high hundreds, while more than 3,000 rockets were fired towards cities and towns across Israel throughout the day.\n\"They attacked dozens of Israeli communities and IDF bases and went door to door,\" Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said Saturday night. \"They executed Israeli civilians in cold blood in their homes and then continued to drag into Gaza Israeli civilians and military personnel.\"\nIsrael's health ministry has not officially confirmed how many people have been killed, but Israeli TV channels reported that the death toll had passed 600 and the same figure was included in a Facebook post from the Government Press Office. \nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Israeli forces exchange fire on road near Gaza border\nOvernight, Israeli security forces rescued many people who had been held hostage - almost 50 were in the dining area of one small community. \nAt least 10 militants who had taken over the police station in the town of Sderot were killed. \nThrough Sunday morning shootings continued in communities close to Gaza. \nNear the city of Ashkelon, Israeli forces chased several Palestinian gunmen in a stolen car, killing them in a dramatic shootout on a main road.\nThe IDF earlier told reporters that security forces had secured 22 locations but that there were still eight \"points of engagement\" where troops were going from house to house to confirm that they were \"clean or terrorism\".\nThey included Sderot and the nearby kibbutz (community) of Kfar Aza, where soldiers were said to be fighting to free another group of hostages.\nResidents who live near the Gaza frontier are also being evacuated.\nConcerns are also growing for the dozens of Israeli soldiers and civilians, including women and children, who it is believed are being held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. \nRelatives of those missing have been asked to hand their belongings to police stations so that DNA samples can be taken. \nNoa Argamani, 25, and her boyfriend Avinatan Or were among hundreds of people partying at a rave in the fields next to Gaza when the attack began. A video posted on social media showed Ms Argamani screaming in panic as she was taken by militants into Gaza on a motorbike.\nA friend, Amit Parpara, told the BBC that she sent him several messages as the attack unfolded.\n\"My first contact with Noa was around 06:30, when the [rockets] started,\" he said. \"She sent me her live location, asking for someone to save her and her boyfriend. She was hiding in a hole.\"\n\"Around 08:30 was the last message that I got from her,\" he added. \"I tried to tell her to stay low. I tried to contact the police and the military so that they would know their location and might find them.\"\n\"About half an hour later, I found that video... You can see clearly her terror.\"\nMr Netanyahu warned Hamas that Israel held it responsible for the hostages' well-being and would \"settle accounts with anyone who harms one hair on their heads\".\nHe also said the IDF would \"immediately use all its strength to destroy Hamas's capabilities,\" and told Gazans to leave their homes and take shelter.\nIn Gaza, the atmosphere has changed completely from Saturday morning, when many Palestinians were celebrating on the streets. People are now staying indoors, as the territory is rocked by explosions and clouds of black smoke engulf buildings. \nThe IDF said it had struck 426 targets belonging to Hamas by Sunday morning, including a compound belonging to the head of the group's intelligence department.  \nHamas said 12 houses belonging to senior leaders of the group were hit, as well as branches of its bank.\nThe multi-storey Watan Tower in Gaza City, where internet service providers that served half of the population were based, was also destroyed. \nPalestinian health ministry officials said more than 300 people, including children, had been killed in Gaza and that another 1,990 had been injured. \nAbout 20,000 people have taken shelter in UN schools and hospitals after being told by the IDF to leave their homes immediately, suggesting that they would be attacked by air soon. The Israeli warnings covered Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, in northern Gaza, and the Daraj area of Gaza City.\nThis video can not be played\nMissile strikes next to BBC Gaza rooftop base\nDr Khamis Elessi, a neuro-rehabilitation and pain medicine consultant based in Gaza City, told the BBC that the situation was unbearable.\n\"Everywhere you are going in Gaza you see funerals, you see death. You see buildings collapsing. It's like you are watching a movie about the end of life on this Earth,\" he said.\n\"The kids are crying and screaming, there is no electricity, there's no internet and so you feel you could be next.\"\nIsrael's security cabinet cut off Gaza's electricity and fuel supplies and the entry of goods in retaliation for the Hamas attack. \nIn a separate development on Sunday, the IDF said its artillery had struck targets in southern Lebanon and carried out a drone strike on \"terrorist infrastructure\" in response to a rocket attack by the militant Hezbollah movement in the disputed Shebaa Farms/Mount Dov area. \nHezbollah said it had fired at three Israeli positions \"in solidarity with the Palestinian resistance\", despite a warning from Israel and the US for other parties not to engage and risk a regional war.\nThe Lebanese army said the Israeli retaliatory fire wounded several people, while the UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon said it was working with authorities in both countries to avoid a more serious escalation.\nAre you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

{"title": "How Hamas staged Israel lightning assault no-one thought possible", "date": "2023-10-08 17:47:22", "text": "Many Israelis would have been asleep when it began.\nSaturday was the Jewish Sabbath and also a holy festival day, meaning families were planning to spend time at home together or in synagogue, and friends were meeting up.\nBut out of the dawn sky, a hail of rockets signalled the start of an attack that was unprecedented in its scale and co-ordination.\nFor years, Israel has fortified the barrier between itself and the small Palestinian enclave of Gaza. Within hours, its impenetrability was exposed as flawed.\nBBC News has been analysing footage taken by militants and civilians on the ground to piece together how Hamas co-ordinated their most sophisticated attack ever from Gaza.\nAt around 06:30 local time, the rockets began to fly.\nThe Islamist militant organisation - which controls Gaza and is designated as a terrorist group in the UK and elsewhere around the world - uses this tactic frequently.\nThe rudimentary rockets often struggle to evade Israel's advanced Iron Dome missile defence system - but thousands were fired in a short space of time to overwhelm it.\nThe scale suggests months of planning and stockpiling. Hamas says it fired 5,000 in the first round (Israel says it was half that number).\nAir raid sirens began to sound as far afield as Tel Aviv - 60km (38 miles) from Gaza - and western Jerusalem and smoke was seen rising above towns where there had been direct hits. \nAs the rockets continued to launch, fighters were gathering where they planned to penetrate the heavily fortified Gaza barrier.\nAlthough Israel pulled its troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005, it still controls its airspace, shared border and shoreline.\n As well as regular military patrols around the perimeter - which is a concrete wall in some places and a fence in others - there is also a network of cameras and sensors to prevent incursions.\nBut within hours, the barrier had been breached again and again.\nSome Hamas fighters tried to bypass the barrier completely, including by flying over it on paragliders (unverified footage showed at least seven drifting above Israel) and by boat.\nThe Israel Defense Forces said they had repelled two Hamas attempts to cross into Israel by landing vessels on the beach.\nBut what sets this attack apart is the several co-ordinated, direct assaults on barrier crossing points. \nAt 05:50 local time, a Telegram account associated with Hamas's armed wing posted the first images from the ground, taken at Kerem Shalom - the most southern of Gaza's crossings.\nThey showed militants overrunning a checkpoint and the bloodied bodies of two Israeli soldiers on the ground.\nAnother image showed at least five motorbikes, each carrying two militants armed with rifles, passing through a hole which had been cut in the wire fence section of the barrier.\nAt a less guarded section, a bulldozer was seen demolishing a stretch of barbed wire-topped fencing. \nDozens of seemingly unarmed people were gathered there, and some began to run through the gap.\nAt Erez - the furthest north of the Gaza crossings, around 43.4km (27 miles) from Kerem Shalom - Hamas was swarming another crossing. \nFootage was posted on one of the group's propaganda channels. It shows an explosion at the concrete barrier, which served as a signal to start the assault, and a militant can then be seen waving a group of fighters towards the blast site.\nEight men in bulletproof vests and carrying rifles run towards the heavily fortified checkpoint and fire at Israeli troops.\nThis video can not be played\nMilitants attack Israel/Gaza border crossing point in propaganda footage\nLater in the video, the bodies of Israeli soldiers are seen lying on the floor as the militants go from room to room sweeping the compound, clearly organised and trained.\nGaza has seven official crossings - six are controlled by Israel, one into Egypt is controlled by Cairo.\nBut within the space of a few hours, Hamas had found ways to enter Israeli territory along the length of the barrier.\nHamas fighters swept out of Gaza in all directions. We now know from the Israeli authorities that they assaulted 27 different locations, seemingly with orders to kill on sight.\nThe furthest Hamas penetrated was the town of Ofakim, which lies 22.5km (14 miles) east of Gaza. The map below shows the different areas they reached.\nIn Sderot, militants were seen standing on the back of a pick-up truck being driven through the town, which lies around 3km (1.8 miles) to the east of Gaza.\nAround a dozen armed fighters were seen fanning out through the empty streets of Ashkelon, just to the north of the Erez crossing which had just been stormed.\nSimilar scenes were repeated across southern Israel and civilians were told by the military to hide indoors.\nAt a music festival near Re'im, gunmen fired at will at a large group of young people who had gathered in the desert.\nAn eyewitness told the BBC how the militants were driving around a van loaded with weapons and spent three hours searching the area for other Israelis to target.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: A day of violence and fear\nWe now know that hostages were taken from the festival and other locations and transported back into Gaza. Israel says 100 people - soldiers and civilians - have been abducted.\nFootage taken in the town of Be'ri and verified by the BBC shows around four civilians being forcibly led away by militants.\nSeveral videos have circulated online of Israelis, some of them heavily injured, being paraded through Gaza's crowded streets.\nOther unverified atrocities too graphic to publish were captured on camera, including a motorist being dragged from his car and having his throat slashed, and the bodies of dead civilians and soldiers being defiled.\nAs well as targeting Israeli communities, Hamas also attacked two military sites: a base at Zikim and another at Re'im.\nFootage taken from near Re'im shows the aftermath, with several burned-out cars scattered along the road to the base. It's unclear how many people were killed during the fighting.\nHamas's social media channels have repeatedly shared images of dead Israeli soldiers. BBC News has not verified these images.\nWithin just a few hours of the rocket barrage beginning, hundreds of Israelis were dead - and it happened in a way no-one thought was possible.\nHelp began to arrive in the stricken southern region within a few hours but Hamas, for a time, was in effective control of pieces of territory outside of Gaza.\nThe speed and deadliness of the surprise attack has stunned Israel. Questions over how it was able to happen will be asked for years.\nBy mid-morning, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared: \"We are at war.\"\n260 bodies recovered from 'horror movie' festival scene\nGaza hospital deluged as Israel retaliates with strikes\nWhat is happening in Israel, and why now?\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Sarah Sunny: How India's first deaf lawyer made history in Supreme Court", "date": "2023-10-08 22:01:53", "text": "Last week, Sarah Sunny made history after she became India's first deaf lawyer to argue in the country's Supreme Court. \nThe 27-year-old first appeared before Chief Justice DY Chandrachud in September after the court made an exception and allowed a sign language interpreter to assist her with the arguments. \nOn 6 October, the court also appointed its own interpreter for Ms Sunny, the first in the court's history, so that \"she could understand what was going on\" during the proceedings.\n\"In fact, we are thinking that for the constitution bench hearings we will have an interpreter so that everyone can follow the proceedings,\" Justice Chandrachud said.\nObservers say that Ms Sunny's presence in the top court would help make the Indian legal system more inclusive and accommodative to the needs of the deaf community.\nSenior lawyer Menaka Guruswamy called it a \"truly historic and momentous\" occasion. \nSanchita Ain, the lawyer with whom Ms Sunny works, told the BBC that Ms Sunny's work would have positive, long-term implications. \"She has broken many stereotypes, this will encourage more deaf students to study law and make the legal system accessible to the deaf,\" she said. \nA resident of the southern city of Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), Ms Sunny has been practising law for two years. \nIn the city's lower courts, she was not allowed to use an interpreter because the judges thought they would not have the required legal knowledge to understand legal terminology, she said. So she would submit her arguments in writing.\nSaurav Roychowdhury, who interpreted for Ms Sarah when she first appeared before the Supreme Court, has not studied law but has experience of translating for lawyers and legal students. He has also appeared in the Delhi High Court in the past for deaf lawyers in two cases. \nBut no Indian sign language interpreter is trained in legal terminology at the moment - and so for anyone translating, it's going to be a work in progress \nMs Sunny told the BBC that she was proud of how far she had come. \"I wanted to show those who are cannot hear that if I can do it, they can also do it.\"\nMs Sunny was born in Bengaluru. Her twin sister Maria Sunny and her brother Pratik Kuruvilla are also deaf. Mr Kuruvilla is a software engineer in the US and now teaches at a school for the deaf in Texas, while Ms Maria is a chartered accountant. \nTheir parents did not want their children to study in special schools for deaf children. Finding a place that was willing to take in the three siblings was hard, but they eventually found the right place for them. \nIn class, Ms Sunny studied by lip reading and with the help of her friends. \"There were also others who made fun of me but I always argued with them,\" she said. \nMs Sunny went on to study law at St. Joseph's College in Bengaluru. Her mother, who would help her during school, could not do the same with her law course. But Ms Sunny said she got support from a friend and her siblings. \nIn 2021, she took the bar exam to enrol as an advocate and began practising law. \nShe said she was grateful to her parents for treating all three children equally and \"putting us through education in a normal school because they believe in equality\". \n\"That's what gave me the confidence to follow my dreams.\"\nExperts say that deaf people in the country are often unable to build a career in law because of stigma and the lack of interpreters in courts. \nOn 17 April, the Delhi High Court set a precedent when it allowed deaf lawyer Saudamini Pethe to appear in a case. Like Ms Sunny, she too had to bring an interpreter. \nIn September, the high court said it would start appointing its own interpreters after another deaf lawyer asked for two sign language experts - one for lawyers and the other for the judges. \nThe court also asked the Association of Sign Language Interpreters India (ASLI) to draw up protocols for the interpreters. \nThis was done to make it easy for the lawyers and judges to follow the proceedings, Renuka Rameshan, president of ASLI, told the BBC. \nMs Ain said that experts are also looking to create a legal thesaurus in Indian sign language that would help the deaf lawyers and litigants.\nMr Roychowdhury, the interpreter, said the court's decision could also mean that \"the deaf will realise that they also have an equal right under the law\".\n\"As per the 2011 Census, there were 18m deaf people or people hard of hearing in India. It is good to have the spotlight on sign language to ensure deaf people get their right to accessibility,\" Mr Roychowdhury said.\nHe added that a demand for more interpreters in courts will open up employment opportunities for them. \"There are approximately 400-500 certified interpreters [in the country] but in reality only 40-50 are skilled, qualified and doing ethical work,\" Mr Roychowdhury said. \nRanjini Ramanujam, who is deaf by birth and works at an IT company, called the court's move \"a blessing\" and \"a barrier remover\". A former badminton player, Ms Ramanujam was awarded India's second-highest sporting honour in 1999.\n\"The Supreme Court's move has given a voice to the deaf,\" she said. \"The court has set an example for other offices to follow as well.\"\nBBC News India is now on YouTube.

{"title": "'I feel hopeless': Living in Laos on the brink", "date": "2023-10-08 22:07:26", "text": "Jo is the holder of a newly minted degree in English literature from one of the top universities in Laos. But the 22-year-old, who graduated only weeks ago, says he already feels \"hopeless\". \nConfronted with a barren job market, the Vientiane resident holds no hope of finding work at home, and instead aims to become a cleaner or a fruit picker in Australia. His aspirations are low, but they reflect a hushed disenchantment spreading among his peers; the result of a severe and sustained economic downturn that has ravaged Laos for the past two years. \n\"Every person in this generation doesn't believe in the government. They want to leave Laos, they don't believe anything the government says,\" he tells the BBC. \"Most of my friends have the same thoughts, but we only talk about it privately. If you say bad things about them in public, I don't know what will happen.\"  \nThe economic crisis has been caused by a rash programme of government borrowing used to finance Chinese-backed infrastructure projects which has begun to unravel. The crisis shows little sign of easing, with public debt spiralling to unsustainable levels, resulting in government budget cuts, sky-high inflation and record-breaking currency depreciation, leaving many living on the brink in one of South East Asia's poorest countries. \nFaced with a dire economic situation, and with the April shooting of activist Anousa \"Jack\" Luangsuphom underscoring the brutal lengths authorities in the one-party state will go to silence calls for reform, a generation of young Laotians increasingly see their future abroad. \n\"[Young people] aren't even thinking about change, it's a feeling of how am I going to get out of this country - I'm stuck here, there's no future for me,\" said Emilie Pradichit, a Lao-French international human rights lawyer and the founder of human rights group Manushya Foundation. \n\"If you see your country becoming a colony of China, you see a government that is totally corrupt, and you cannot speak up because if you do you might be killed - would you want to stay?\"\nA sparsely populated, landlocked country of 7.5 million people, Laos is one of the region's poorest and least developed nations. In a bid to transform the largely agrarian society, the past decade has seen the government take on major infrastructure projects, mostly financed by historic ally and neighbour China - itself on a lending spree since 2013 as part of its global infrastructure investment programme, the Belt and Road initiative (BRI).\nLaos has built dozens of foreign-financed dams to transform itself into the \"battery of South East Asia\" as a major exporter of electricity to the region. But oversupply has turned many dams unproductive, and the state electricity company sits in $5bn (£4.1bn) debt. Lacking funds, Laos handed a majority Chinese-owned company a 25-year concession to manage large parts of its power grid in 2021, including control over exports. \nAlso among the debt-laden megaprojects is the Lao-China railway, connecting Vientiane to southern China. It opened in December 2021 at a cost of $5.9bn (£4.85bn), but saddled the Lao government with $1.9bn in debt. Beijing says the railway has created an \"economic corridor\", but the numbers just don't add up for some economists, not least because Chinese state-owned companies hold a 70% stake. \n\"I'm sure people are happy to travel very quickly across Laos, but it's not justified at the cost that was agreed to,\" economist Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, says of the railway.  \nAll of this has added to Laos' ballooning debt, which is now ninth highest globally as a share of its GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund. Around half of that is owed to China, and Laos is now having to borrow more from lenders in the country just to stay afloat.\n\"Laos is so heavily indebted to China that their negotiating position is compromised,\" he said. \"It's having to borrow just to service the debt. That's the definition of a debt trap.\" \nThe Lao government could not be reached for comment. But Mr Menon emphasised that Laos has repeatedly rejected other international lenders in favour of Beijing, perhaps because of a belief within the government that China \"will not let another socialist country fail\". He added that Beijing was also cautious about letting another BRI country default on its debt after Sri Lanka. \nThis is the second in a series of stories that examines Chinese investment abroad 10 years after Xi Jinping launched the Belt and Road Initiative. \nRead the first story about the shadowy Chinese firms that own chunks of Cambodia here.\nThe only thing currently preventing that outcome are repeated Chinese debt deferment agreements - the conditions of which remain highly opaque. This has raised concerns over Beijing's growing sway over Laos. When asked if Laos is at risk of becoming a vassal state, Mr Menon said \"that ship has sailed\".\nHe said that the \"macro-instability\" caused by \"massive debt accumulation\" has also caused the decline of the Lao currency, the kip, which continues to depreciate to record lows against the US dollar. This has led to a decades-high rise in prices, and nowhere is this being felt more acutely than among ordinary Laotians. \n\"'I have never experienced anything like this year,\" says Phonxay, a frail looking woman in her 60s, selling household staples at a food market in Vientiane. She said her customers are buying less because \"prices go up day to day\", adding that August was the most expensive month yet. Her family has had to adapt to survive. \n\"My family needs to eat more cheaply than ever before. We eat half of what we used to eat,\" Phonxay says. \"But I'll fight until the end. If I don't, I'll die.\"  \nBut it's young Lao, their futures mortgaged off for the benefit of infrastructure projects offering them few tangible opportunities, that will bear the brunt of the economic crisis for years to come. \n\"Lao is very good to travel, but not good to live in,\" says Sen, a 19-year-old working as a receptionist in a hotel in Luang Prabang in northern Laos. \nThe city is bustling once again, with its Unesco World Heritage Old Quarter of pristine French colonial-era buildings filled with tourists. But Sen says times remain tough: \"For normal people like me it's very hard. It's just better than living as a homeless person in India, and maybe just better than North Korea. I'm serious, we're just trying to survive.\" \nHe earns just $125 per month at his hotel job, but he doesn't see any point in going to university or applying for government jobs as he'd have to \"pay lots of money\" to corrupt officials to get anywhere as he has no family connections. \n\"At the moment, almost every Lao student like myself doesn't want to go to university,\" he says. \"They study Japanese or Korean and then apply to work in factories or farming in those countries.\" \nIt's this \"sense of discouragement among Lao youth… that needs urgent attention,\" says Catherine Phuong, the deputy resident representative at the UN Development Programme in Laos. She pointed to the \"staggering\" NEET (not in education, employment or training) rate of 38.7% among 18-to-24-year olds - by far the highest in South East Asia.\n\"We're especially concerned in Laos that with the debt situation we are seeing reduced investment in the social sector, including health and education,\" she told the BBC. \"I'm sure you can imagine the impact that will have on this generation, not just in the coming years, but in the next 10 to 20 years.\"\nBut with the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, which has ruled the country since 1975, intolerant of dissenting voices, young people have had to turn to social media to air their grievances. \nIt was in March 2022, as inflation and the cost of living began rising, that Anousa \"Jack\" Luangsuphom created Kub Kluen Duay Keyboard or \"The Power of the Keyboard\", one of a growing number of social commentary Facebook pages critical of authorities. \nThe 25-year-old was drawing tens of thousands of followers when he was attacked at a cafe in Vientiane on April 29. CCTV footage shows a masked man firing a bullet into Jack's face and chest. A police statement days later blamed a business dispute or lover's quarrel. Jack survived the attack, but for his followers, the culprit was obvious.\n\"I feel really bad that the government would shoot him, that they would try to control us like that,\" says Jo, the university student in Vientiane, who follows Jack's Facebook page. \"Jack is the voice of Lao people, he said things that normal people are afraid to say.\"\nBut these calls for reform will only be ignored or suppressed, and few know this better than Shui-Meng Ng - the wife of disappeared Lao civil society advocate Sombath Somphone. \nSombath has not been seen since being detained by police in Vientiane in December 2012, a time when his influence was growing and there was hope of reform. \nSpeaking to the BBC from her craft shop in downtown Vientiane, the last place she saw her husband the day he was abducted, Shui-Meng said voices like Jack's and Sombath's are squashed because they grow \"too big a following\" at times when the \"Lao political elite are facing difficulties\". \n\"Every time something like [Jack's shooting] happens, you see this,\" she said, zipping her lips. \"People go silent.\" \nAdditional reporting by Lamxay Duangchan \nLured to become unwitting 'love' fraudsters\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "The hunt for a new way to tackle clothing waste", "date": "2023-10-08 23:04:57", "text": "Earlier this year, a satellite photo of a mountain of discarded clothes in Chile's Atacama Desert went viral.\nClearly visible from space, it once again raised questions about the amount of waste the fashion industry is creating, and what we can do about it.\nWhile natural fibres such as cotton and wool will decompose, most manmade fibres, such as polyester and nylon, are not currently biodegradable. They will instead remain in landfills, or where they have been dumped, for decades or even hundreds of years.\nHowever, a US-based scientific organisation is continuing work to find a natural way of getting waste polyester and nylon to quickly decompose.\n\"One of the approaches that we are looking at is how you break down these complicated materials, and in a way that actually gets rid of the toxic effects of dyes and coating,\" says Beth Rattner, the executive director of the Montana-based Biomimicry Institute. \"Using biological materials, whether that be enzymes or bacteria, to create new materials.\"\nShe adds that the aim is to \"take the existing mountains of clothing waste and turn them into something that's biocompatible\".\nThe Biomimicry Institute's project - dubbed Design for Decomposition - will choose tech partners later this year, and report back in 2024.\nMs Rattner says that the new processes it is exploring  can not only help break down existing fabrics in more planet-friendly ways, but could also in future form the basis of new innovative materials.\n\"Instead of dyes you could use the structure of the fibre itself, the same for water repellency, rather than coating it, or to make wrinkle-free fabrics.\"\nWhile the term \"fast fashion\" was originally coined to refer to the short length of time clothes took from going from design stage to shop, it has come to mean endless consumption of cheap clothes.\nAccording to the UK's Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which campaigns for more recycling, every second there are enough garments thrown away to fill a rubbish truck, with less than 1% recycled into new clothes.\nIt means, says Jules Lennon, leader of its fashion programme, that \"today's fashion system is broken\". \n\"More clothes are being made than ever before, yet we are using them less,\" she adds. \"The fashion industry is responsible for more annual greenhouse gas emissions than all international flights and maritime shipping combined.\n\"It is also a significant contributor to biodiversity loss due to soil degradation and waterway pollution caused by raw material production methods and intensive washing and dyeing processes.\"\nJean Hegedus, head of sustainability at Lycra, the maker of the stretchy man-made spandex fabric of the same brand name, is well aware of the problems.\n\"It's estimated that about eight to 10% of all carbon emissions come from the textile and apparel industry, so we know that we have to change,\" she tells the BBC.\nChange for US-based Lycra means finding a natural replacement for the polyester that makes up the majority of its material. Polyester, like nylon, is derived from petroleum.\n\"We found that that if just one component, which makes up 70% of the total fibre, could be swapped from a petroleum-based fibre to a renewable one, it would reduce the firm's carbon footprint by 44%,\" says Ms Hegedus.\nLycra's journey to find this new raw material began in the US state of Iowa, where a company called Qore was working with farmers to create a new fabric made out of sweetcorn, dubbed Qira.\n\"The core product is really interesting,\" says Ms Hegedus. \"It's made from what we call 'industrial dead corn'. So it's not like sweetcorn that's used for human consumption. It's specifically grown for things like materials, or to go into paper, or for animal feed.\"\nLycra is now building a large wind-powered factory in Iowa to make its material using Qira instead of polyester. This is due to start production next year, and Lycra wants 70% of its fibre content to come from the new corn-based fibre.\nNew Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.\nMs Hegedus says the switch will make its material 10% more expensive to manufacture, a cost that it will share with its clothing firm customers. She adds that most \"are very positive\" about the change.\nLycra says that the use of Qira has no negative impact on the functionality or comfort of its products. However, the first version of the corn-based Lycra will not be recyclable, but the firm says it is \"working on\" that problem.\nThe manufacture of clothing using natural materials not previously associated with textile production is a growing sector.\nTake US firm MycoWorks, which produces leather-like material from mushroom mycelium (the roots of the fungi). Its first large-scale manufacturing facility is due to open in South Carolina at the end of the year, and aims to produce several million square feet of its material, known as Reishi, annually.\nMeanwhile, companies such as UK-based Faber Futures are exploring the use of a soil-dwelling bacteria called streptomyces coelicolor. It has the potential to revolutionise the textile dyeing process, because it produces a rainbow of pigments as part of its normal life cycle, from vibrant blues and reds to subtle yellows.\nIn Finland, a company called Spinnova turns wood pulp into clothing fabric. It breaks down the pulp into micro-scale fibres which it turns into a cotton-like thread.\nWith customers including H&M and Adidas, earlier this year it opened a factory in Jyvaskyla, western Finland, with the aim of manufacturing one million tons of fibre annually by 2033. The factory is carbon-neutral - the only by-product is heat which is pumped back into the local heating system.\nSpinnova's fibres can be recycled and re-spun, but the firm's interim CEO Ben Selby acknowledges, that for this type of \"circular textile loop\" to work, brands and customers will need to change.\n\"The whole industry needs to start to better at collecting back old garments that can then be recycled,\" he says.\nNumerous fashion retailers now offer \"takeback\" schemes - you can return old clothes that they will recycle. However, one report this year, which tracked 21 returned items from 10 fashion brands, found that three-quarters were either destroyed, left in warehouses, or exported thousands of miles to Africa to form new unwanted clothes mountains.\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Adam Kay: Social media hides reality of parenthood, says writer and comedian", "date": "2023-10-09 00:53:41", "text": "This Is Going to Hurt author and ex-doctor Adam Kay is shattered, which is hardly surprising - he's just been mopping up baby vomit and is clearly sleep-deprived.\nHe's most famous for his best-selling medical diaries, which drew back the curtain on the tough realities of being a doctor. \nBut right now, he's way more preoccupied with juggling his two babies, who are very close in age.\nKay and his husband, Games of Thrones producer James Farrell, share Ruby, aged 10 months, and Ziggy, six months, whom they had via surrogates. \nThey're having a steep learning curve - several in fact, as all new parents do.\nHe and Farrell do bottle feeds and nappies on alternate nights, in the hope of preserving some sleep while also working. \nKay's no stranger to being jolted into alertness at 4am, having been a junior doctor on an obstetrics ward until 2010.\nWhile he's no longer delivering babies in the small hours, he admits to being a bit unprepared for parenthood.  \n\"Going into the kitchen and putting the bright lights on, boiling the kettle and all that, it makes you 100% awake,\" he correctly observes.\nMuch like the realities of being a doctor, he's found that some of the glowing images of parenthood are perhaps a tad over-optimistic.\n\"I think if you're on Instagram, it's quite possible to have parenthood slightly mis-sold to you,\" he says. \n\"There are these people who say 'I wouldn't change a thing'.\n\"And that's really stuck with me - like you wouldn't change waking up at night? You wouldn't change the nappies? You wouldn't change not going out at night?\n\"So l dispute 'I wouldn't change a thing'. There's loads that I would change,\" he laughs. \n\"It disrupts your life more than anything else you can possibly imagine. However the net benefit is still enormous, because what they give back is absolutely amazing. \n\"But I wish someone had sat me down beforehand. Maybe I'm the outlier. I'm the idiot who failed to realise the realities.\"\nHe is, of course, using comedy to make a serious point, and there are plenty of online influencers who talk about the tough side of parenting. \nBut Kay specialises in distilling both the funny and poignant moments from whatever he is talking about, having done this as a writer and stand-up comedian.\nHis latest live show, Undoctored, is based on his hugely successful book of the same name. \nIt follows 2017's This Is Going to Hurt, about his experiences of being a junior doctor on an NHS labour ward. More than three million copies were sold, and it was dramatised on BBC One, winning Ben Whishaw, who played Kay, a best actor Bafta.  \nUndoctored shares more eye-watering anecdotes from his life as a medic, but is also about Kay's life beyond the NHS. \nHe turned it into another stage show, taking it to this year's Edinburgh Fringe, performing his first full season since 2016. It was the most popular of the festival's 3,500 shows, selling more than 23,000 tickets, with 32 sell-out performances.\n\"It was just a wonderful moment,\" he says. \"I love the Fringe very much and it means a lot to me. All of my success has been down to the Fringe in 2016, before the book, when I read out from my diaries.\"\nA friend brought a guest to see him perform, and that guest happened to be a book editor, who asked Kay if he had more diaries. This ultimately led to his first book.\n\"So for me, the Fringe was this most amazing springboard, which it has been for lots of people,\" he adds, although he feels it has \"changed since the last time I was up\".\n\"I don't think it's really open access any more because of the costs of going up and the big multiplex venues, which are so expensive to perform at. \n\"I had a wonderful month but I sort of did feel it was a different Fringe.\" \nUK Theatre Web said of Undoctored that \"Adam's style of songs and stories works excellently, a sort of cross between a stand-up and a lecture\". Edinburgh Festivals Magazine added: \"Don't be fooled - it's not all laughs. Kay gets serious about mental health in the NHS, sharing heart-wrenching stories and advocating for change.\" \nAlthough the show does have plenty of laughs and musical numbers, he warns the audience it's not all going to be funny.\nHe talks about how some doctors \"bottle everything up\" emotionally, saying: \"I suspect it partly comes down to the idea that patients don't want their doctors to be too human because humans make mistakes. \n\"So in a way you get trained to put up these shields, put up a front to maybe protect yourself, but it does the opposite of protecting you. \n\"Because if you push stuff away into a box, all this bad stuff that happens, that box will always open, and you have no control whatsoever over when that happens.\"\nHe left the profession after a traumatic incident at work left him with PTSD and nightmares. \nKay talks in his show about how crucial it is that the NHS \"remembers staff are human beings\" by taking care of their mental health, and prioritising retaining staff. He also supports doctors striking for more pay. \nBut what would he say to anyone telling him he should not have exposed the negative aspects of his job, and just got on with it?\n\"When This Is Going to Hurt came out, I got an almost universally positive reaction,\" he says. \"But I also had probably between 10 and 20 messages from old-school doctors saying, 'What did you think was gonna happen? Toughen up, man up and grow a pair'.\n\"And I just thought, I've done that. I've definitely done the right thing.\"\nAs well as leaving medicine and publishing his diaries, Kay has also turned his hand to writing children's books, which, unsurprisingly, are full of revolting and hilarious facts. \nHis first two, Kay's Anatomy and Kay's Marvellous Medicine, have been translated into 29 languages and sold 500,000 copies. \nBook number three, Kay's Incredible Inventions, is aimed at inspiring \"the next generation of scientists and inventors\".\nA \"guide to inventions that changed the world (and some that definitely didn't)\", it covers topics from the unsavoury history of bottom wiping to how Velcro was invented. \nKay wrote it in the same style as his other works, which is to \"draw people in with the funny, and then hopefully say something useful\".\nHe also visits schools to talk about his books, and says he gets messages from parents saying they have \"really resonated with kids who are reluctant readers, including some who are neurodivergent, which is just amazing\". \nOne thing that delights him is adding in \"sneaky schoolwork, from history to every part of science\", so children learn without realising it.\n\"I had a message from a surgeon who was having breakfast with her son and he started talking to her about gallstones, and she said 'Are you reading my medical journals?'.\n\"He had been reading my book. I find it so rewarding.\" \nUndoctored is at London's Lyric theatre from 23 to 28 October and The Lowry, Salford, on 8 November.

{"title": "Five female MCs who changed hip-hop? Eve makes her choice", "date": "2023-10-09 01:09:05", "text": "Hip-hop can seem like a man's world, but women have been there from the start.\nThe infamous Bronx party that gave birth to the genre was organised by Cindy Campbell, a high school student who was trying to raise money for her back-to-school clothes. It was Cindy who wrote invitations on index cards and invited her brother Clive, aka DJ Kool Herc, to play the music.\nBefore long, former R&B singer Sylvia Robinson co-founded the world's first hip-hop label, Sugar Hill Records. Alongside landmark singles like Rapper's Delight, she also released one of the first all-female rap records, Funk You Up by The Sequence (featuring a then-unknown Angie Stone).\nBut as the genre became mainstream, pioneers like Roxanne Shanté, Kool Lady Rock and MC Sha-Rock were overshadowed by their male counterparts. The dawn of gangsta rap in the early 1990s turned hip-hop into even more of a boys club.\nAs the genre turns 50, a new three-part BBC documentary aims to correct the record.\nNarrated by Neneh Cherry, First Ladies of Hip-Hop acknowledges the contributions of artists like Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Rah Digga and Lil Kim, while highlighting a new generation - Ice Spice, Little Simz, Doja Cat - at the forefront of rap innovation.\nAmong them is Philadelphia-born rapper Eve, the street-tough MC who emerged as part of the Ruff Ryders posse, and went on to score major crossover hits like Who's That Girl? and Let Me Blow Ya Mind.\nWe asked her to choose five women who had changed the course of hip-hop. Here's what she said:\nQueen Latifah wasn't the first female rapper, but she was the first to become a star. With a no-nonsense, straight-talking style that emphasised feminine power and Afrocentric consciousness, her hits included U.N.I.T.Y, Ladies First and Mama Gave Birth To The Soul Children.\nWords have always been something that I've loved. From the time I was eight years old, I would always write poems. And that obviously turned into rapping. Rhythm and poetry - that's what rap is.\nQueen Latifah, MC Lyte and Salt-N-Pepa - those were the women who showed me I can do this. Any time I saw them, I felt \"yeah, that could be me\".\nBut I always felt a particular closeness to Queen Latifah, maybe because she's from Jersey and I'm from Philly, but also because I was a tomboy when I was young. I saw that toughness in her, too: she stands strong in her womanhood, but she also hangs with the boys. \nAnd lyrically, she's amazing. She talks about her pride in being a black woman and about female unity: let's stand together, we don't have to be competitive, let's celebrate each other. \nShe had such a presence. Her career has been a blueprint for me, in terms of longevity and versatility.\nLauryn Hill proved her rap credentials on Fugees tracks like Vocab and How Many Mics, but it was the uplifting blend of hip-hop, soul and reggae on her solo debut The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill that cemented her legacy. To this day, she remains the only female rapper to win the Grammy for Album of the Year.\nI love her to death. The Fugees as a whole were amazing, but having Lauryn there took them to higher heights, for sure.\nShe rapped about things outside the normal, [subjects like] heartbreak and resisting peer pressure, and for a lot of us coming up with Lauryn, we felt like she was a big sister, pulling us to one side and going \"hey, girl, watch out, you shouldn't be doing this\" or \"don't be scared of this person\". She was teaching us how to be a woman - letting us in on game, a little bit.\nShe had a very different style, a different cadence. It was almost jazzy, in a way. I refer to it as \"backpack hip-hop\", you know? The Fugees, The Roots, A Tribe Called Quest - they ride the beat in a different way.\nI kind of fought against that kind of style, because I was a battle rapper. And because I went up against dudes all the time, it was very ego driven: \"Hey, you still live with your mom and you're broke and you don't have a car and you're not well endowed.\"\nBut Lauryn was different. She educated us.\nInnovative, individual, incomparable - Missy Elliott changed the sound of hip-hop forever, with her alien beats and larger-than-life music videos. Hits like Get Ur Freak On and Work It were often imitated, but never bettered, with Missy branding her competition \"beat biters\".\nMissy took us into that pop world, that crossover world. Everything was bigger and brighter and bolder. She brought a theatrical element to hip-hop in her presentation and her videos. \nAnd what I love about Missy is that, because she had a hand in writing so many R&B songs, she's very melodic in the way that she rhymes - whereas, before her, that really wasn't done. \nShe also stood up for herself. Lines like, \"Copywritten, so don't copy me / Y'all do it sloppily\" - I love that, because men say that stuff all the time, but Missy was as cocky as they were. And she was right. She was original and she knew it.\nWe worked together several times. The Hot Boyz remix was my first foray into that world, and she sang the theme tune to my TV show. The times that we had in the studio, she'd be like \"this is what I'm thinking, here's what the track sounds like, I'll let you be\". She's not a micromanager. She's more like \"you do your thing, and I'll see you after\".\nShe's always been an incredible friend and supporter, and someone I could count on in the industry.\nOne of the fiercest wordsmiths on the planet, Nicki Minaj burst on to the scene with 2010's Pink Friday, at a time when female MCs were missing from mainstream hip-hop.  Since then, she's scored 133 hits on the Billboard chart, including Starships, Anaconda and Super Freaky Girl.\nHer wordplay is incredible. She's just a great lyricist and no-one can take her on. Anything I've ever heard her on, like that guest verse on Kanye's Monster, she's murdered it.\nShe's also very smart about the industry - knowing what's coming and capturing the moment. She's done a great job building her fanbase, the Barbz, and knowing where that generation was going. \nBeing a female rapper, or even a female pop star, it's easy to get put into a box - and sometimes you have to do drastic things to break out of that box. \nI think both Nicki and Doja Cat, who I'm a big fan of, are really pushing to be the artists they want to be, and that's dope.\nThe elusive, Brooklyn-based rapper Leikeili47 keeps her identity hidden under a ski mask, ensuring the focus remains on her dextrous, quotable lyrics.\nI was watching the HBO drama Vinyl and this song came on that I didn't recognise. I was like \"wait, who does this?\" so I Shazam-ed it, and went into this Leikeili47 deep-dive. I never looked back.\nIf you are a hip-hop head who's drawn to lyrics, and wants to hear a good story and feel something, she's amazing. \nShe doesn't reveal her identity, she just lets the bars speak for themselves. I would say she's an all-round perfect MC... I just need her to release more music!\nThe first two episodes of First Ladies of Hip-Hop are available on BBC iPlayer.

{"title": "RFK Jr announcement: Who would actually vote for Robert F Kennedy Jr as an independent candidate?", "date": "2023-10-09 01:46:03", "text": "Robert F Kennedy Jr - the anti-vaccination activist, environmental lawyer and member of America's most-famous political family - is expected to announce on Monday that he's running for president as an independent candidate. \nAlthough his chances of capturing the White House in 2024 are slim to none, he could potentially impact a close race. So who are his supporters - and might he take more votes from the Republican or Democratic nominee? \n\"If it becomes a choice between Trump and Kennedy, that's a really tough question,\" says Sherri Guoan. \"In a perfect world, I would love for them to run together.\"\nMrs Guoan and her husband Brandon drove more than an hour from the Detroit area to see Mr Kennedy in Michigan's state capital on Saturday. \nMr Guoan calls himself an \"old school Democrat, a Kennedy Democrat.\" But the couple both voted for Donald Trump in 2020. \n\"Trump is very controversial and I think the country could use a fresh start,\" she says, but there's no way she'll vote for Joe Biden, whom she calls \"the worst president this country has ever had.\"\nThe BBC spoke to dozens of voters in an eclectic crowd of a few hundred in Lansing. They offered some clues into how a Kennedy campaign might alter the overall race - and in what direction.\nStanding just a few feet away from the Guaons is retired autoworker and proud union member Alex Hernandez. A Democrat who voted for Mr Biden, he recalls his parents taking him to see a speech by Mr Kennedy's father in 1968.\n\"He has the name and he has the heritage,\" he says of the younger Kennedy. \"I wanted to come down here and hear what he has to say.\"\nRobert F Kennedy Jr is part of a Democratic political dynasty. He counts a president and senator among his uncles, and in 1968 his father was assassinated while running for the party's presidential nomination.\nMr Kennedy began his own quest for the White House earlier this year by entering the party's nomination process. He never mounted a real challenge to President Joe Biden, however, and at a rally in Philadelphia on Monday he is expected to declare he is running as an independent candidate instead.  \nThe switch reflects how the policies and priorities of Mr Kennedy and the modern Democratic Party have diverged. His deep scepticism about vaccines and the push to support Ukraine, for example, are out of step with most Democratic politicians.\nMr Kennedy spent most of his career as an environmental lawyer but has been more recently known for spreading doubt and falsehoods about vaccinations through his foundation, Children's Health Defense, which got huge boosts in funding and publicity during the Covid pandemic. \nHis signature issue resonates more with grassroots Republican voters than with Democrats. And in a recent podcast interview, Mr Kennedy said: \"I take more votes from President Trump than I do from President Biden.\"\nA recent poll funded by a political action committee backing the Kennedy campaign indicated that in a three-way race, Mr Kennedy Jr would siphon off slightly more support from Donald Trump than from Joe Biden. However, another survey, conducted by Ipsos and Reuters, showed the opposite. \nIn his stump speech in Michigan on Saturday, Kennedy emphasised his environmental credentials, a populist economic message, and the history of his political family - only mentioning vaccines very briefly. \n\"People feel that the system is disintegrating,\" he told the crowd. \"Not just economically, but mental health and physical health, and all these communities are being torn apart in all these different ways.\n\"A lot of them are living pay cheque to pay cheque, at the edge of desperation.\"\nMany voters said they had voted for Mr Trump and preferred his policies, if not his personality. But there were no shortage of self-declared Democrats or people who said they would refuse to vote for either of the major parties. \n\"If I didn't have an option of Kennedy, I would probably just write him in,\" says Matthew Ruggles. Two of his friends standing nearby agree. \"There's no point in voting for either of those [major] parties.\"\n\"A third-party candidate can attract people who aren't interested in the other candidates - maybe they did vote in the past but they felt overlooked,\" says Melissa Smith, author of Third Parties, Outsiders, and Renegades: Modern Challenges to the Two-Party System in Presidential Elections.\nWhen it comes to the raw vote numbers, Ms Smith says, the true impact of an independent candidate can be hard to gauge, even after an election.\nIn 2020, the closest state, Georgia, was decided by just more than 11,000 votes. At the same time, more than 60,000 Georgians voted for the Libertarian Party ticket headed by Jo Jorgenson. The Libertarian vote was also greater than Joe Biden's margin of victory in the crucial states of Wisconsin and Arizona.\nBut whether in the absence of a third party those voters would have voted for Mr Trump, Mr Biden or not at all is a nearly impossible question to answer. \nAnd Ms Smith says that simple dissatisfaction with the major parties is not enough to push most voters to independent and third-party candidates. \nMr Kennedy also faces a different challenge to previous would-be disruptors of the two-party system. Because Mr Trump has already claimed the mantle of anti-establishment outsider, and reshaped the Republican Party in his populist image, there is simply less political terrain available to exploit.  \nThat is why Mr Kennedy's stance on vaccines, which for years has run contrary to the scientific mainstream, may be one issue where he stands out from the other candidates - even if he is currently avoiding focusing on it. \nMr Kennedy, Ms Smith says, \"trades in conspiracy theories and that's what's going to attract some people\" - even though Mr Trump has himself spread falsehoods about widespread election fraud.\nFor many in the crowd on Saturday, Mr Kennedy's views on vaccines were part of his appeal - a feature, rather than a bug. Several repeated debunked theories about a connection between childhood vaccines and autism, while several more mentioned their opposition to vaccine mandates, whether by the government or private companies. \n\"We're not saying vaccines aren't good. We're not saying they're bad. We just want to ask about them,\" says student Jacob Kostecke, who was wearing a Kennedy T-shirt and says he's planning on a career in the medical field.\n\"He's just trying to keep an open mind and just bring us together, where I feel like everything's just so divided and so political right now.\"\nMore than a year away from the actual presidential election in November 2024, it is impossible to know if the Kennedy campaign will catch fire or remain a fringe movement. But Jacob says if Mr Kennedy was not on the ballot, he would vote for Mr Trump. \nRFK Jr rebuked over Covid conspiracy theory\nWhy RFK Jr's campaign has avoided vaccine talk\nAnti-vaccine Kennedy to challenge Biden in 2024\nIf Robert Kennedy had not been killed...\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

Higher education providers and student unions which fail to comply may face sanctions, including fines.\nProf Ahmed will also oversee a new complaints scheme for students, staff and visiting speakers, who could seek compensation if they suffer from a breach of a university's free speech obligations.\nThat complaints process will come into force next August, and is currently under consultation.\nIn his speech at Kings College London on Monday, Prof Ahmed is expected to say he will protect people who want to express their views on \"Brexit... on statues, or pronouns, or colonialism, or abortion or animal rights, or Ulez\". \nSome speech, such as that which amounts to harassment or incites violence, is not protected by the law or by freedom of speech.\n\"You can speak or write as a Marxist, a post-colonial theorist, a gender-critical feminist or anything else - if you do it within the law,\" Prof Ahmed is expected to say.\nHe will add that freedom of speech allows people to consider different points of view, which makes it \"fundamental\" to a high-quality higher education: \"For many students, university might be the only time in their lives when they have both the time and the relative freedom to embark on this exploration.\"\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\nFree-speech tsar Arif Ahmed set to defend all views\nHundreds protest at gender-critical academic talk\nUniversities face fines over free speech breaches\nEx-home secretary's invite pulled by uni society\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Minister raised concerns over closure of SAS war crimes investigation", "date": "2023-10-09 04:45:18", "text": "Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer raised serious concerns in government in 2019 over the decision to close an investigation into UK special forces.\nThe BBC understands that Mr Mercer wrote to then-defence secretary Ben Wallace to warn against the closure.\nThe veterans minister, a former British army officer, was privately concerned that there were credible war crimes allegations against British forces.\nWhen the closure was later announced, Mr Mercer publicly backed the decision.\nThe investigation, known as Operation Northmoor, had set out in 2014 to investigate a total of 675 allegations of wrongdoing by UK armed forces in Afghanistan. \nThey included allegations that the nation's elite special forces regiment, the SAS, had murdered dozens of unarmed men, detainees, and civilians during raids.\nBut Operation Northmoor, which was being conducted by the Royal Military Police, was shut down in 2019 with no charges.\nIn 2022, the government announced a public inquiry into the allegations, after BBC One's Panorama revealed that one SAS squadron had killed 54 people in suspicious circumstances in one six-month tour of Afghanistan.\nThe decision to wind down and then close Operation Northmoor with no charges caused consternation among some members of the government and civil service.\nThe BBC understands that Mr Mercer, who served as an Army officer in Afghanistan and had worked alongside UK special forces there, was concerned SAS units may have broken the law during operations, shooting dead unarmed people and planted weapons beside their bodies to justify the killings.\nThere is no suggestion that Mr Mercer had been a direct witness to or had first-hand knowledge of war crimes.\nThe veterans minister warned colleagues that the government could suffer more reputational damage in the long run if it did not seriously investigate alleged British war crimes and prosecute if necessary.\nAn internal email disclosed as part of a subsequent legal case against the Ministry of Defence suggests that Mr Mercer believed the government should publicly acknowledge that \"things went wrong on such operations in Afghanistan\". \nIn the email, the deputy head of the MoD's legal department, writing in late 2019, recounts dissuading the veterans minister that such a statement should be made, on the basis that it could prejudice a review of Operation Northmoor that was being considered by a High Court judge.\nAs a serving government minister, Mr Mercer publicly backed the decision to close both Operation Northmoor and a similar investigation into operations in Iraq, known as IHAT. The closures of both investigations followed allegations that a lawyer, who had taken more than 1,000 cases to IHAT, had paid local intermediaries in Iraq to find claimants.\nMr Mercer told the Sunday Telegraph that the closure of Northmoor was \"another significant moment as we retake ground ceded over the years to those who seek to rewrite history and line their own pockets with no regard at all for the damage they have done to some of our nation's finest people\".\nSpeaking during a debate in Parliament a few months earlier, he told the House of Commons that \"the allegation that our armed forces operated so-called death squads in Afghanistan\" was \"simply not true\".\nSpeaking more broadly about UK operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, in the same parliamentary debate, Mr Mercer said it was a \"matter of deep personal regret that original RMP investigations were flawed and that opportunities to hold those responsible to account may now have been lost\".\n\"For this, I unreservedly apologise to those who suffered treatment at the hands of UK forces that was simply unacceptable,\" he said.\nWhen approached for comment, Mr Mercer told the BBC: \"Given the ongoing Independent Inquiry relating to Afghanistan it would be inappropriate to comment on this matter.\"  \nOperation Northmoor has faced criticism in the years since it was closed over an apparent failure to interview key witnesses or secure vital evidence relating to allegations of extra-judicial killings.\nOfficers from the Royal Military Police, which was responsible for the investigation, told Panorama they were blocked by senior military figures from interviewing special forces officers and accessing forensic evidence.\nThey said Operation Northmoor was closed before military police could complete their investigation. \nAn MoD spokesperson told the BBC that it was not appropriate for them to comment on allegations which may fall into the scope of the public inquiry.\nThe public inquiry will begin hearing evidence on Monday.\nDo you have information about this story that you want to share? \nGet in touch using SecureDrop, a highly anonymous and secure way of whistleblowing to the BBC which uses the TOR network. \nOr by using the Signal messaging app, an end-to-end encrypted message service designed to protect your data.\nPlease note that the SecureDrop link will only work in a Tor browser.

{"title": "The young Essex carers whose help equates to a full-time job", "date": "2023-10-09 05:06:04", "text": "On schooldays, 11-year-old Flo and her sister Grace, 15, get up at 06:10 to do a string of jobs before school. The sisters are among a rapidly expanding number of young carers. What is driving this rise and is enough being done to support the children supporting others?\nThree years ago, an assessor from Essex Young Carers arrived at Flo and Grace's home and asked the girls about the chores they did.\nWhen the total hours were totted up, it emerged the girls spent about 40 hours each week between them caring for their mother, Kayleigh.\nThe sisters are part of a growing population of young carers giving more than 20 hours of weekly support to loved ones. Census data suggests there are 20,945 under-18s providing between 20 and 49 hours of care, up 7% from 19,530 in 2011.\n\"I feel a lot of guilt,\" says Kayleigh, who has albinism and is blind. \"Effectively they have a full-time job each week, just helping me.\"\nThe children's daily tasks include: \nWhile the children just accept their caring efforts as \"what they do\", Kayleigh describes her daughters as \"amazing superheroes\".\n\"There are some really low days when I just wish I was normal for them,\" says Kayleigh. \"Then again, I know I am bringing up two incredible humans.\"\nAlthough Flo and Grace have always helped their mother, the care Kayleigh needed increased dramatically during the pandemic after an eye infection stripped her of much of her remaining sight.\nThat sight loss made navigating the outside world \"such a daunting prospect\".\n\"Everything I thought I knew, I then didn't know - I was like a toddler again and needed to be taught by my young carers,\" Kayleigh says.\nThe sisters were referred to the charity Kool Carers after their primary school head teacher overheard Kayleigh mention that her daughters read the post to her.\nThe support given by the charity and the chance to meet other young carers has been transformative for the sisters.\nKayleigh says the girls became \"more accepting\" of being young carers - \"it wasn't a secret any more\".\nFriends have also been supportive, the sisters say. \n\"I don't tend to bring it up,\" says Flo. \"But if I do tell them, then they are like, 'oh okay', and it doesn't seem abnormal after that. In fact, my friends think it is quite cool.\"\nAnd despite their responsibilities and homework, Flo is heavily involved in dance and judo while Grace also does judo and is a member both of the Young Essex Assembly and the Royal Navy cadets.\nShe hopes one day to be a Royal Navy engineer.\nHelen Murphy works as a counsellor with young carers and their families.\n\"Life can be tough enough for any young person these days,\" she says. \"And when you add on their caring responsibilities it can be really quite overwhelming for them.\"\nIssues such as loneliness and a sense of isolation are common.\n\"Quite often they will come to us and say 'this is just what we do and got used to',\" she says. \"But they will have quite complex emotions about it. \n\"They might feel angry or feel it is unfair but cannot really express that to the parent or parents they are caring for.\n\"We provide them with the space and time to express those quite natural feelings.\"\nThe number of young carers known to Essex County Council has risen from 2,482 in 2021 to 3,577 at the most recent count. \nThe council claims the rise is largely down to schools and other organisations being better at identifying young carers.  \nChris Vince, the young carers service manager at Harlow-based Action for Young Carers, says he has noticed an \"increase in mental health issues caused by the cost-of-living crisis\" which in turn had led to a rise in referrals.\nRachel Tungate, the founder of Kool Carers, suggests the pandemic itself has increased the number of young carers, particularly in terms of adults with complex mental health needs.\n\"We've noticed a massive increase in the number of young carers,\" she says. \"Before the pandemic we were supporting 48 young carers aged eight to 18.\n\"We're now supporting 153 young carers and their families, which equates to more than 500 people, and we've got a waiting list of 87 young people.\n\"As a society, I think we are all falling short - too many young carers are still below the radar.\"\nAsked whether there was enough support out there for young carers, Ms Tungate says: \"Absolutely not. We need to ensure they feel comfortable about identifying themselves as young carers and that the support is out there for when they do.\"\nSome young carers, she says, are missing out on education or training because of their caring responsibilities.\n\"We are seeing some young carers who don't go on to reach their full potential academically because they want to stay at home and care for their loved ones,\" Ms Tungate says.\n\"They are incredibly selfless.\"\nYoung carer Kerri Foster, 19, lives in Basildon and desperately wants to go to university to study design.\nBut her family cannot afford for her to go, she says.\nHer father has the neurodegenerative disorder Gordon Holmes Syndrome which has increasingly reduced his mobility. Her mother gave up work a couple of years ago to care for her husband.\n\"It is not really feasible for me at the moment,\" she says about her studies.\nInstead, she has taken a full-time job in her home town to both support herself and her parents. \nShe says she will reassess whether or not she can go to university in a couple of years' time.\nMark Durham, the county council cabinet member responsible for the youth service, says the Essex Young Carers Service was \"proactively engaging with young people and identifying more young carers\".\n\"We are committed to helping them to feel supported too,\" he says.\n\"We work to ensure activities are age and gender appropriate, and that the role of young carers is acknowledged with their achievements celebrated.\n\"We aim to ensure young carers are not disadvantaged due to their caring role and have the same opportunities as their peers to enjoy life and fulfil their ambitions.\"\nPhotography: Laurence Cawley\nFollow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

{"title": "My landlord wanted to put the rent up 35% despite cap", "date": "2023-10-09 05:14:03", "text": "Rents in Scotland have risen by more than England despite a high-profile 3% cap on increases imposed by the Scottish government earlier this year. \nCatherine Sheldon is one of thousands of young Scots struggling with the cost of living crisis who thought they would be protected from a large rent rise.\nHowever, a \"loophole\" in the Scottish government's rent cap rules allows her private landlord to seek a 35% rise because one of her flatmates gave notice to move out, ending the tenancy agreement.\nThe 26-year-old shared the three-bedroom flat in Glasgow with two friends for two-and-a-half years.\nCatherine describes the flat as her home but in order to stay living there she would have had to accept her share of the rent rising from £520 per month to £700.\nShe says her landlord's justification for the increase is that the new price is simply the market rate for the flat - and they appear to be correct.\nBut Catherine says the new rent represents more than half her monthly income.\n\"I don't see how these price increases can be sustainable for anyone,\" she told BBC Disclosure.\n\"I don't understand who is actually affording it.\"\nNegotiations to agree a new tenancy with a lesser rent rise failed and Catherine says she is now having to leave the property, with nowhere else to go that she can afford.\n\"We've basically just decided that we need to leave and find somewhere else to live,\" she said. \n\"We've been fighting this since February, and we're all just completely exhausted by the whole situation and we don't think there's anything else we can do.\"\nBut Catherine, who is a recent graduate and hospitality worker, is struggling to find anything within her price range and she says she is worried she will be forced out of Glasgow altogether.\n\"I'm really scared,\" she said. \n\"I'd move further out but all my friends and everyone I know live here.\n\"I'd be worried about being isolated from everyone. I've just been completely overwhelmed by the whole thing.\"\nOver the past decade, rents in Scotland's largest cities have almost doubled, according to exclusive data commissioned by BBC Scotland News.\nThe Rightmove research reveals that between September 2013 and September 2023, the average rent for a two-bedroom flat in Edinburgh climbed by 92% to £1,441, while in Glasgow this increased by 82% to £978.\nDespite the emergency legislation capping rent rises at 3%, private rents across Scotland have increased by 6% in the past year, according to the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures.\nThis figure is higher than London (5.9%).\nThe statistics show annual private rental costs increased by 5.5% across the UK as a whole, with England at 5.4% and Wales at 6.5%.\nEngland and Wales do not currently have any rent control legislation in place.\nIn Scotland, as the impact of cost of living rises such as energy prices began to bite last year, the Scottish government announced a temporary freeze on rent rises. \nIn April this changed to a 3% cap on increases.\nHowever, campaigners have warned the \"joint tenancy loophole\" means that, in many flat-shares, landlords are free to increase the rent by as much as they want when one person leaves.\nThis is because the emergency legislation only applies to tenancies, rather than properties. \nEconomist and co-director of think tank Future Economy Scotland, Laurie Macfarlane ,described the rent cap as a \"sticking plaster\" amid a housing crisis in Scotland that private renters are at the very sharp end of. \nHe told the BBC rent rises were outstripping the growth in incomes and people were spending more of their income than ever before on keeping a roof over their heads.\nSinead McNulty, a Living Rent organiser in Edinburgh, had spent months helping tenants fight rent increases when she was hit with one of her own.\nShe shares a four-bedroom flat and, like Catherine, was hit with a substantial rent hike when one of her flatmates needed to move out.\n\"We were shocked to find that the rent had increased by £500, which means that our rent individually each was up by £125,\" she told the BBC.\nShe says her generation is particularly vulnerable to the \"massive loophole\" in the rent cap because young people \"have no other choice but to flat-share\" due to increasing costs.\n\"People say it's because we live in the city centre, but I know from my friends and my job that wherever you are it's completely unaffordable,\" Sinead said.\n\"My friends, my colleagues, can't afford to live in the city any more. For me that's really upsetting but, more than upsetting, it makes me really angry.\n\"I am genuinely afraid of moving out of this property and spending much more money on rent and actually being homeless,\" she said.\n\"If I cannot live here anymore, I know I will struggle to find a home.\"\nLandlords are also being hit by cost of living pressures with mortgage rates rising rapidly along with the cost of complying with regulations.\nJohn Blackwood, chief executive of the Scottish Association of Landlords, said he was \"not surprised\" that some tenants were feeling exploited.\n\"I think tenants are finding it really difficult at the moment, as landlords are finding it difficult,\" he told the BBC. \n\"And I feel the government is letting all parties down here. They're not working with us to find these sustainable solutions.\"\nMr Blackwood said one solution would be \"looking at greater predictability of rents and rent increases in the future\" in a way that protects the landlord's business.\nHe added that due to a shortage of alternative affordable housing, private landlords had been asked to provide housing to many more people than they ever expected to and that it had become the \"only resort for many renters\".\n\"That's unsustainable and it's not the Scotland that we should be aspiring towards,\" he said.\nIn an interview with BBC Scotland, Housing Minister Paul McLennan said he would look at longer-term rent controls in the upcoming Housing Bill.\nHe said: \"There are obviously things we can do in terms of the short-term measures that are in place just now, but looking beyond that and looking to longer-term rent controls, obviously something like that needs to be considered.\"\nThe minister added: \"I think if you look at rents in other parts of the UK, be that London and Manchester and Newcastle, they are going up with approximately the same kind of figures.\" \n\"A lot of it comes down to supply and demand.

It was the most joyful set I've ever been on.\n\"I thought, if I can make a movie that's half, or [a] quarter as fun to watch as it was to make, I think maybe we've got a shot.\"\nThe film was shot in the UK at Leavesden Studios in Hertfordshire.\nIt was released in July, and Gerwig went into cinemas to see the reaction and ensure audiences had the best viewing - and listening - experience, she revealed.\n\"On the opening weekend I was in New York City. And I went around some different theatres and sort of stood in the back. And then also turned up the volume if I felt it was playing at maybe not the perfect level,\" she said. \"It was the most thrilling thing.\"\nShe told film fans at the London festival that she'd grown up loving watching films in movie theatres.\n\"And I think that part of me always wanted to recreate that feeling from childhood of meeting in a dark room with a bunch of people. So it was so moving to me that that was the thing that people experienced.\"\nShe also thanked the BBC for allowing her to use a short extract from its 1995 TV adaptation of Pride & Prejudice in her film.\n\"I was very honoured they said yes to that,\" she said. \"That was a big deal. They don't always say yes. Thank you to Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, that was very lovely.\"\nAnd although she was careful not to name it, Gerwig also spoke briefly about her next, eagerly awaited project, and the challenges it's presenting.\n\"I'm working on something right now, I'm in the writing process,\" she told the audience. \"And it's hard. And I'm having nightmares. I'm having recurring nightmares.\"\nBarbie film hits $1bn mark at global box office\n'Barbenheimer' films take UK box office by storm\nBarbie movie wins box office battle in US\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Gaza hospital deluged as Israel retaliation kills and wounds hundreds", "date": "2023-10-09 06:41:06", "text": "On Saturday morning, people in Gaza celebrated after Hamas fired thousands of rockets into Israel and launched deadly cross-border attacks.\nA day later, the picture was very different.\nAfter non-stop Israeli shelling, people were staying indoors. Explosions continued throughout Sunday.\nThe sound was terrifying. Clouds of black smoke engulfed buildings across the Gaza Strip. \nThe Israeli army says it has hit more than 1,000 targets in Gaza. These include military positions, the homes of the Hamas's leaders, as well as banks run by the militant group. \nOne of the more significant Israeli strikes on Sunday morning targeted the Watan Tower, which serves as a hub for internet providers in Gaza.\nPalestinian health officials say more than 400 people have been killed in retaliatory Israeli air strikes on Gaza.\nMost areas are without electricity as Israel has stopped supplying Gaza with power. Gaza's own supplier can only provide 20% of the electricity needed. \nFood and water supplies have also been cut.\nDriving through the Gaza city centre on Sunday morning, I saw rubble blocking roads. Shops were closed, except for a few bakeries where long queues had formed.\nThe escalation has made Gaza's dreadful humanitarian situation even worse.\nIts under-equipped hospitals - which at the best of times struggle to provide healthcare to a population of more than two million people - have launched desperate appeals for blood donors.\nMahmoud Shalabi, Gaza director of the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, described the city's main hospital as a \"slaughterhouse\".\nMany people were lying on the ground in the emergency department, he said. \"There were many dead bodies in the morgue and many medical staff were unable to cope with the huge influx of casualties they were receiving,\" Mr Shalabi added.\nThis video can not be played\nMissile strikes next to BBC Gaza rooftop base\nLater on Sunday, residents in one part of Gaza City received SMS messages from the Israeli army advising them to go to shelter ahead of strikes.\nMore than 20,000 people made their way to United Nations sites in the area, a UN representative told the BBC.\nHamas, which has controlled Gaza for the past 17 years, knows the consequences of attacking Israel - so it must have been expecting such massive retaliatory strikes.\nThe Iran-backed group has made clear that it is prepared for a war with Israel. Hamas has said it has been smuggling weapons despite the Israeli-Egyptian blockade and developing its own arsenal.\nThe group has vowed to continue what it calls \"retaliatory attacks\".  After a pause on Saturday night, it said it had fired 100 rockets at the southern Israeli town of Sderot. \nOrdinary Gazans have expressed mixed feelings about this unprecedented conflict. Although some saw Hamas' rocket attacks as a cause for celebrations, many are worried that the violence will continue for a very long time.\nAre you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

{"title": "'Beating Man City great for Arsenal and title race'", "date": "2023-10-09 06:50:26", "text": "\nLast updated on 7 hours ago7 hours ago.From the section Premier League\nTo finally beat Manchester City in the Premier League was great for Arsenal and their manager Mikel Arteta, and it is also good for the title race.\nI still think it will just be City and the Gunners battling it out come the end of the season but for now only three points separate the top four, which gives all of them hope.\nThe big surprise is seeing Tottenham lead the way as we head into the international break, but they are flying under new boss Ange Postecoglou and have picked up some excellent results.\nI'm not sure how long Spurs will spend at the summit but the fact they don't have any European football this season will definitely help their chances of staying in the top four.\nIt means they won't face the same demands on their squad as many of their rivals who are in Europe, in terms of the quality and depth that you need to compete in both.\nWe saw how much the same situation helped Newcastle make it into the Champions League places last season, and now it can benefit Spurs too.\nAt some stage, I think they will miss Harry Kane and the points he earned them with the goals he scored when they were not playing well, but they are certainly not having any problems winning without him at the moment. \nKane's departure to Bayern Munich has given their other attacking players the opportunity to step up and do their part, and their new signings like midfielder James Maddison and defender Micky van de Ven have been superb.\nSo far, Liverpool are right up there as well, but again I am not convinced they will sustain a title challenge.\nJurgen Klopp's side are always going to score goals because of the attacking players that they have, but I still have my doubts about them defensively.\nThe Reds are exciting to watch when they come forward but we saw again in their draw with Brighton that they concede too easily - there is something missing at the back.\nI know Ibrahima Konate will be back from injury soon, which will help, but teams seem to be able to play through them quite easily and they just don't look solid enough.\nThe way I look at it, if you finish above City, you will win the league - and Arsenal are the team who look most capable of doing that this season and ending their dominance.\nSunday's win over the defending champions was a huge result for the Gunners' belief and confidence, but the best sign of where they are at is that they did it without playing particularly well.\nWhat Mikel Arteta's side did do throughout, however, was defend extremely well. \nAfter having a couple of chances in the opening minutes, City did not get another sniff and I've not seen many teams keep them that quiet in recent years.\nArteta's substitutes made a huge difference, too - all of them made an impact, one of them [Kai Havertz] made their winning goal, and another [Gabriel Martinelli] scored it. \nYou could already see Arsenal's squad is stronger now than it was last season, but nothing shows it more than sending someone on to change a big game like that.\nArsenal didn't create much either before they scored but they stuck together and were solid. When you do that, you always give yourself a chance.\nYes, they got a bit of luck with the deflection off Nathan Ake for their goal but Arteta will say they absolutely deserved their win and I don't think anyone could argue with that - City simply did not do enough.\nThis was their third defeat in three games without Rodri, who was completing his suspension for his red card against Nottingham Forest last month, and they definitely seemed more cautious without him.\nWe are used to seeing City push on with the ball home or away, whoever the opposition, but that just didn't seem to happen this time. They didn't play well, and paid the price.\nThis is just a blip for City, and it won't be long until they are back to their best.\nI am not convinced the same applies to their neighbours Manchester United, who fought back brilliantly to beat Brentford on Saturday but continue to struggle for any kind of consistent form.\nThere is still time for Erik ten Hag's side to find their feet but I think there are deeper-rooted problems at the club, which will take time to iron out.\nBefore the season started, I backed United to make the top four again, but they are just not as good as I thought they would be - at least not yet.\nLate comebacks like the one they produced against Brentford can be a turning point in a team's season, but I don't think that will be the case for United.\nI need to see more evidence than that to suggest that they are back, and I haven't seen anywhere near enough from their performances all season to think they can challenge for the top four.\nNewcastle also have got some ground to make up on the leading pack, but overall I am pretty pleased with the start they have made.\nI always thought it would be tough for them to get into the Champions League places again after finishing fourth last time, and they have had to deal with a difficult run of early games.\nThey lost three in a row to City, Liverpool and Brighton, which was a blow, but it was the manner of the home defeat to the Reds that was the most damaging - losing so late, and to 10 men.\nSince then, though, they have recovered well and got some great results in the Premier League despite having key players like Sven Botman, Joelinton and Callum Wilson out injured.\nOn top of that, their performances in their two games in the Champions League have been phenomenal. \nYes, they might have got a bit lucky in Milan but there was nothing fortunate about the way they beat Paris St-Germain last week - it was an amazing game, one of the best I have been to.\nNights like that lift the whole club and they are exactly what they worked so hard for last year.\nFollowing that up against West Ham on Sunday was always going to be tough, and they struggled to find their rhythm in the first half, which was understandable.\nAfter that, though, they showed a great reaction and will feel they should have won it. The only disappointing part of their whole week was seeing West Ham equalise so late on.\nAlan Shearer was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\nThe extraordinary worlds of six tiny animals embarking on the biggest journeys of their lives\nAhead of series two, relive the drama of Time, starring Sean Bean and Stephen Graham\nCould a hearing unlock the mystery of what actually happened to Linda Razzell?\nNeneh Cherry pays tribute to the trailblazing women of hip-hop, from the Bronx to Britain\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEverything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.\nThe latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.\nAnalysis and opinion from our chief football writer.\nHow to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK."}

He said fighter jets would also be sent.\nFurther military aid to Israel would be sent in the coming days, the White House said, adding that the US was working to ensure Israel's enemies did not try to seek advantage from the situation.\nThe large deployment reflects American concerns that the conflict between Israel and Hamas could draw in other parts of the region. \nIn particular, the US is eager to prevent Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement from joining the conflict. It is backed by Iran, which also funds and arms Hamas. \nIran's President Ebrahim Raisi has expressed support for the Hamas attack, saying Israel needed to be held to account for endangering the region.  \nHamas has said assistance from Iran helped it carry out its attack, which involved rockets, drones and militants on paragliders and saw hundreds of fighters break through Israeli border fortifications around the Gaza Strip.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US had not seen evidence of direct Iranian involvement, but that Iran had been helping the Gaza-based group for years.\n\"Hamas wouldn't be Hamas without the support that it's gotten over many years from Iran. We haven't yet seen direct evidence that Iran was behind this particular attack or involved.

I've got horrific fomo [fear of missing out].\"\nBig Brother transformed British TV when it first began on Channel 4 in 2000, before moving to Channel 5 and eventually being axed in 2018.\nThe launch show was watched by 2m on ITV1, and a further 527,000 on ITV2 - which will be its primary home in the coming weeks.\nIn a four-star review, the Telegraph's James Hall wrote: \"Do we really need Big Brother back? Of course not. Raw and real? Obviously not.\n\"But this was fun and is at least striving for a degree of authenticity while also knowing it has to entertain.\"\nMetro's critic Adam Miller welcomed it back, also awarding four stars and writing that the show's return \"was more impactful than I could have imagined\".\n\"Big Brother shines on deception, tactical game play and sheer ludicrousness  - the launch night alone had all three in abundance,\" he wrote.\nThe line-up is \"the most interesting cast Big Brother has seen in years, possibly ever\", he said, but added that it was \"strange\" that the opening episode was pre-recorded \"knowing how electric those live launches could be\".\nFans were also enthusiastic on social media.\nAllow Twitter content?\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter.

In our era of shortened attention spans, they'll have to work pretty hard to do so.\"\nIn the Radio Times, Emma Bullimore praised the mix of personalities in the house. \"Crucially, it's not just a set of 16 TikTokers,\" she wrote. \n\"Instead, it genuinely feels like real effort has been made to bring interesting people together for an extraordinary experience. From a bingo caller, to Miss Universe, to an 'ecstatic dancer' who shimmies under the moon on the Isle of Man.\"\nThe jury's out on whether the show can compete with more recent reality TV hits like Love is Blind and The Traitors, she added.\n\"While ITV's reset looks like it may be elevating the brand from the gutter, it's unclear whether it will be enough to dominate the public conversation as the show once did.\"\nThe Times' Carol Midgley said the format was \"showing its age\", however, and \"feels pretty vanilla, pretty basic stuff\" when compared with modern formats.\n\"I can see that ITV wants to replicate the success it has had with Love Island because this is one of the few shows which young people watch in the old-fashioned, nightly way. But this feels tired,\" she wrote.\n\"It's early days and it might get better but on the strength of what we saw tonight, Big Brother has nothing new to tell us.\"\nThere was some drama on the opening night when Jenkin, from Bridgend in south Wales, also unwittingly chose 23-year-old Olivia to be up for the first eviction on Friday.\nHowever, she was later given the chance to save herself from eviction if she can avoid being ranked the least entertaining housemate.\nAhead of the launch, Odudu and Best asked fans to be kind online, posting a video to the Big Brother Instagram account reminding users that the \"housemates are real people with their real lives\".\nAs with recent series of ITV's Love Island, housemates and their families and friends have also been asked to not post content about the show on their individual social media accounts while they are in the house.\nIt comes as broadcasters' duty of care policies have faced scrutiny following a number of controversies involving on-screen talent.\nC4 boss says Big Brother return is depressing\nBig Brother will return next year on ITV2\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Metro Bank: What's going on and is my money safe?", "date": "2023-10-09 09:03:07", "text": "Metro Bank said it has secured its future after striking a multi-million pound rescue deal with investors.\nThe announcement follows reports suggesting the bank needed to raise cash to shore up its finances, sending its share price plunging last week.\nSo what's been going on?\nMetro Bank was set up in 2010 as a \"challenger\" bank to bigger, more traditional, lenders.\nIt was launched in the wake of the financial crisis and was the first High Street bank to open in the UK in more than 100 years.\nIts founder, American Vernon Hill, said at the time that he wanted to do things differently: so the bank offered customer-friendly perks like opening its doors seven days a week and even putting out water bowls and dog biscuits for customers' pets.\nMetro Bank currently has 76 branches across England and Wales, and in July said it planned to open 11 more across the north of England in 2024 and 2025. \nThe lender has faced a number of challenges in recent years after an accounting scandal in 2019, which led to some top executives, including Mr Hill, leaving the company.\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that since then the bank has been struggling \"to get on a path to sustained profitability\".\nMore recently, it had asked City watchdogs for permission to use its own ratings system to value its mortgages and its assets. That would have freed up cash so it could go out and continue to grow its business.\nBut regulators turned down the request last month, saying that they wanted the bank to use an external rating system for now.\nReports emerged last week saying Metro Bank was looking to raise money from investors, lenders and possibly considering selling some of its mortgages before it needs to refinance some of its debts.\nAlthough it has been successful in winning 2.7 million customers, analysts said that - like other banks - it might have found it tricky to make money in the past few years when interest rates were at historic lows.\nLate on Sunday, the bank put out a statement saying it had struck a deal with investors, raising £325m in new funding, as well as refinancing £600m of debt. Its chief executive said the deal marked \"a new chapter\" for the troubled lender.\nPrior to that, the BBC understands Treasury officialshad been in touch with the Prudential Regulation Authority, the financial services regulator, which is monitoring the situation at the bank.\nMetro Bank's share price started to slide last month after the decision by the Bank of England not to allow the bank to use its own internal measures to work out the risks attached to its mortgages.\nThen, after the reports last week that it was looking to raise money, its shares tumbled by as much as 30% on Thursday, hitting lows of about 34p per share. \nThe shares recovered some ground on Friday, and rose further on Monday morning to about 56p after the announcement of the rescue deal.\nHowever, the bank's stock market value is now less than £100m, whereas it was valued at about £3.5bn at its peak five years ago.\nAnalysts suggested that the reports it could be looking to raise money through selling new shares might have spooked investors. \nThe lower the share price is, the more shares that Metro Bank needs to sell and the bigger the hit to existing shareholders, which can \"become a bit of a vicious circle\", Mr Mould told the BBC's Today programme.\nAnalysts are also on high alert for any problems in the banking sector following the collapse of US banks Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March this year. \nThey marked the two biggest bank failures in the US since the financial crisis of 2008 and their collapse sparked fears about the wider strength of the sector.\nMetro Bank is operating as normal and does not face any immediate threat.\nCustomer deposits up to £85,000 are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which guarantees that if a bank runs into trouble, depositors will get their money back up to that level.\nThat guarantee would cover the vast bulk of Metro Bank's £15.5bn in customer deposits.\nThe bank has confirmed it is looking at selling up to £3bn of its residential mortgages to other banks. However, homeowners don't face any immediate change. Some customers might end up having their loans managed by another bank in the future.\nMetro Bank is a publicly listed company on the London Stock Exchange.\nThis means that its shares are sold to the public who become part owners, or shareholders, in the business.\nMetro Bank's biggest shareholder is Spaldy Investments. It is an investment vehicle owned by Colombian billionaire investor Jaime Gilinski Bacal, who built one of the biggest banking empires in Latin America.\nAs part of the rescue deal, Spaldy Investments will sink £102m into the bank, increasing Mr Bacal's stake from 9% to 53%.\nMetro Bank shares plunge on fund raising reports\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Metro Bank strikes late-night rescue deal", "date": "2023-10-09 09:25:11", "text": "Metro Bank has struck a deal to raise extra funds from investors that it said will secure its future.\nThe deal was announced late on Sunday after days of intense speculation about the bank's financial position.\nThe Bank of England reportedly asked larger lenders if they were interested in buying Metro, while banks were said to be eyeing up some of its assets.\nBut on Sunday, Metro Bank said it had raised £325m in new funding, as well as refinancing £600m of debt.\nMetro's chief executive, Daniel Frumkin, said the deal marked \"a new chapter\" for the troubled bank.\nMetro Bank's shares had slumped last week after reports suggested it needed to raise cash to shore up its finances. Its share price rebounded on Monday in response to the deal.\nHowever, Simon Samuels, a former managing director at Barclays and Citi, told the BBC's Today programme that while the financing bought Metro Bank some time, it did not address the \"fundamental challenges\" of the bank's strategy of focusing on High Street branches which was \"very expensive\".\nWhile many banks have been closing branches and shifting to online banking - which accelerated during the Covid pandemic - Metro continues to focus on bricks and mortar.     \n\"Essentially, Metro finds itself with an unsustainable cost base,\" he said, adding that he thought Metro's strategy \"has got little chance of succeeding in the long run\".\n\"Eventually [Metro Bank] may end up being part of a larger group.\"\nThe bank has insisted all along that its finances remain strong and it continues to meet all regulatory requirements.\nBut under the deal announced on Sunday, Colombian billionaire Jaime Gilinski Bacal will become Metro Bank's biggest shareholder with a 53% stake. \nHis firm, Spaldy Investments, will sink £102m into the bank.\nMetro Bank was founded in 2010 in the wake of the financial crisis and was the first to open in the UK in more than 100 years.\nIt positioned itself as a so-called \"challenger\" bank to the big High Street names, with its promise of keeping branches open seven days a week.\nIt now has 2.7 million customers and holds about £15bn worth of deposits in 76 branches. \nBut last week reports suggested it need to raise £600m. The Financial Times also reported over the weekend that several rivals were weighing up potential bids for part of the business.\nIn Sunday's announcement. Metro Bank said that it had raised £325m in capital from existing shareholders and new backers.\nThe Bank of England, which had been monitoring the situation closely, welcomed the deal.\nMetro Bank also said it was still in discussions about raising cash by selling up to £3bn of its residential mortgages. \nHomeowners with mortgages from Metro Bank do not face any immediate change, but if a deal goes through some customers might end up having their loans managed by another bank in the future.\nMetro Bank's shares rose by about 10% on Monday, taking its share price to about 50p - close to the level it had been last week before reports on the bank's financial situation emerged.\nHowever, the share price is still down nearly 60% since the start of the year, and well below the peak of £40.19 it reached in 2018.\nMr Frumkin said the new deal meant Metro Bank could continue expanding and would become more profitable over the coming years.\n\"Our strong franchise is underpinned by our loyal customer base and engaged colleagues and we will continue to develop the Metro Bank offer,\" he said.\nThe lender has faced a number of challenges in recent years after an accounting scandal in 2019, which led to some top executives, including its founder, leaving the company.\nIt returned to profit in the six months to the end of June this year - the first half-year profit the bank had seen since 2019.\nIn July, Mr Frumkin said that 2023 would be a \"transitional year\" for the firm and that it planned to open 11 more branches across the north of England in 2024 and 2025.\nMore recently, Metro Bank had asked City watchdogs for permission to use its own ratings system to value its mortgages and its assets.\nBut regulators turned down the request last month, saying that they wanted the bank to use an external rating system for now.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\nWhat's going on at Metro Bank?\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Matt Dawson: Rugby World Cup 2023 quarter-final predictions", "date": "2023-10-09 10:43:24", "text": "\nLast updated on 3 hours ago3 hours ago.From the section Rugby Union\nThe safety net is gone.\nThis coming weekend we have the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals. The losers go home, the winners move within two games of glory.\nThe stakes and the standards have just risen to another level.\nSo, who will prevail?\nWales' progress has come at a price.\nThe loss of number eight Taulupe Faletau against Georgia has been compounded by Gareth Anscombe's injury, which may yet rule him out. They are both key players.\nBut Warren Gatland and his side have a happy habit of stepping up when they need to. They have a fantastic pedigree of raising their level in the latter stages of this competition.\nGatland will be reminding them of the opportunity in front of them. They have a very winnable game for a place in a World Cup semi-final.\nFly-half Sam Costelow is inexperienced. He was making only his third start when he stepped in for Anscombe against Georgia. But I thought he played intelligently and kicked his goals well.\nArgentina looked better against Japan in their final Pool D game, but, up until that point, I thought they had lacked cohesion and rhythm.\nThat game, coming a day later than Wales' game against Georgia, won't have helped them overall. It was a really intense one, with lots of running, open rugby in hot conditions in Nantes.\nI think it will be a really tough ask for them to turn over Wales.\nNew Zealand are a very dangerous beast. They have recovered from their opening-day defeat by France by scoring a total of 36 tries in their wins over Namibia, Uruguay and Italy and showing their free-flowing, intelligent rugby.\nBut in a top-end Test match, against an Ireland side who have not put a foot wrong in the tournament, you need more. You need to be able to back up those moments of genius with relentless physicality and faultless consistency and I just don't think the All Blacks have that gear in them.\nScotland are a very good team. They came into Saturday night's match motivated. They had talked up the possibility of beating Ireland. But, they couldn't lay a glove on them. Ireland's dominance started in the front row with Andrew Porter, Dan Sheehan and Tadhg Furlong, but their whole forward pack was massive. Captain Peter O'Mahony was a totem for them, as he is game after game. Garry Ringrose in the centres was imperious as well.\nAnd Ireland have a 16th man, with the fans at the Stade de France. They beat South Africa there a fortnight ago, they beat Scotland there on Saturday and they will play New Zealand there at the weekend. Paris has become a home from home with thousands of supporters in the stands and the streets. The team feed off the fans, the fans feed off the team and the connection feels really personal between the two.\nIreland have been too good for too long and have too much momentum for the All Blacks.\nThis is a mighty close call.\nFor large parts of the pool stages, Fiji have played better than England. They closed out victory over Australia well and, on the opening weekend, were potentially a Semi Radradra handling error away from beating Wales. \nThe defeat by Portugal in their final Pool C match was less impressive, although, by then, I think they were already looking ahead to England and the last eight. \nFiji go into that quarter-final buoyed by a landmark victory at Twickenham less than two months ago. That result and England's laboured win over Samoa in their own final pool-stage game showed how Steve Borthwick's side struggles against the ball movement and power typical of the Pacific Islanders' game. \nEngland have to go to their strengths and make inroads through their set-piece before they spin the ball any wider. \nTo do that you need George Ford running the show from fly-half and I don't think Owen Farrell's presence outside him helps. They certainly didn't seem to function well together against Samoa, after some promising performances against Argentina and Japan in Farrell's absence. \nEngland have greater experience of the Rugby World Cup knockout stages with veterans of the Japan 2019 campaign throughout the team, but let's not over-state the difference. \nFiji have Levani Botia who has played in the last three Champions Cup finals. They have Josua Tuisova who has played in an Olympic final. Half of their squad play their rugby with big European clubs and are used to week-in week-out high-quality rugby. The other half now get exposed to some of the best rugby in the southern hemisphere with the Fijian Drua's participation in Super Rugby.\nThey are tactically astute and disciplined in defence, while retaining that attacking edge, even if some of the old inconsistencies remain. \nI think England's forward power will just about see them home, but they have to be so much clearer and more clinical compared to the Samoa game.\nThe hosts against the holders - I think this is the toughest one to call of all the last-eight games.\nOne thing in France's favour is the support of the home nation. We have sometimes wondered if the occasion and expectation might prove too much for them, but head coach Fabien Galthie, team manager Raphael Ibanez and defence coach Shaun Edwards seem to be able to manage them through the pressure.\nIt is a brains trust of coaches who have been on the biggest stages and biggest games and know how to manage the build-up.\nWe saw it on the opening night when they beat New Zealand at the Stade de France and we saw it when they closed out the Grand Slam last year against England on the same stage.\nWe also saw it in Marseille last year when they beat South Africa 30-26 in a superb game. France lost Antoine Dupont that day to a red card and still won.\nDupont is still coming back from a facial fracture sustained against Namibia and may not be quite ready for this game. Any team is going to miss the world's best player, but Maxime Lucu, who has stood in at nine, has been an excellent understudy.\nSouth Africa have the tools to beat France. Their defence comes up so fast and they tackle so hard that they can defend the gain-line and slow down France's supply of ball.\nBut France have threats across their team and the intelligence and composure to find them and depose the defending champions.\nMatt Dawson was speaking with BBC Sport's Mike Henson\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe extraordinary worlds of six tiny animals embarking on the biggest journeys of their lives\nAhead of series two, relive the drama of Time, starring Sean Bean and Stephen Graham\nCould a hearing unlock the mystery of what actually happened to Linda Razzell?\nNeneh Cherry pays tribute to the trailblazing women of hip-hop, from the Bronx to Britain\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}

She was previously assistant chief constable at Northumbria Police.\nShe was appointed to her new role by the Scottish Police Authority and approved by Justice Secretary Angela Constance.\nMs Constance previously said Ms Farrell \"has shown she has the skills needed to lead the service\".\nThe appointment means Ms Farrell moves from running one of the smallest police forces in the UK, to the second-largest.\nShe faces a number of challenges in the new role.\nThe force is struggling with a projected £19m budget overspend and has announced plans to sell off buildings and cancel the recruitment of 200 new officers. \nIt is also redeploying staff from the Scottish Police College at Tulliallan, Fife, to back up front-line officers during the busy Christmas and New Year period.\nAnd the conduct of Police Scotland officers is at the centre of the inquiry into the death of Sheku Bayoh, who died while in police custody in Kirkcaldy in 2015. \nLast month, the retired senior officer who was in charge of the police response after Mr Bayoh's death apologised to the dead man's family for the way they had been treated by officers.\nIn May, the outgoing chief constable Sir Iain Livingstone said the force was \"institutionally racist and discriminatory\".\nHis verdict came after a review uncovered first-hand accounts of racism, sexism and homophobia by serving officers.\nSir Iain said prejudice and bad behaviour within Police Scotland was \"rightly of great concern\" but he stressed that his admission did not mean individual officers and staff were racist or sexist and he also expressed pride and confidence in their work.\nJo Farrell arrives from one of England's smallest forces to lead the UK's second biggest and will immediately face major challenges. \nPolice Scotland's finances are under real pressure.  A smaller number of officers is dealing with a bigger workload, and detection rates for some crimes are going down. \nThe arrival of 200 new recruits in January has been postponed and the force predicts officer numbers could fall to 16,200, the lowest since the SNP took office in 2007.\nThere's a freeze on recruitment of civilian staff and a projected £19m budget overspend.\nThat's this year's financial headache.  Ms Farrell will have to fight Police Scotland's corner in negotiations with the Scottish government over next year's settlement. \nAs if all that wasn't enough, there's Operation Branchform, the force's ongoing investigation into the SNP's finances.  Whichever way that goes, the new chief will have to navigate tricky political waters.\nIn another ongoing controversy, the force is currently more than two years into an investigation into the SNP's finances.\nOfficers are looking into what happened to more than £600,000 of donations given to the SNP by supporters since 2021.\nThe investigation has seen former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon arrested before being released without charge.\nThe same thing has happened to her husband, the SNP's former chief executive Peter Murrell, and the party's former treasurer, Colin Beattie.\nMs Farrell joined the police aged 22 in 1991.\nShe is no stranger to controversy, having dealt with a number of high-profile and difficult policing decision in her four years in charge of the Durham force.\nShe was in charge during the \"beergate\" investigation into Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who was cleared of any wrongdoing following allegations he had breached coronavirus rules.\nAnd she led the force during Dominic Cummings' infamous trip to Barnard Castle, County Durham, during the height of the Covid pandemic. \nPolice building sell-off after £19m budget warning\nPolice Scotland scrap plan to recruit 200 officers\nPolice Scotland appoints first female chief\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

Mr Holmes used monies obtained by the loan agreements to fund a property development venture in or around Vancouver, Canada,\" the band alleged in the papers, arguing that he had used his position as their manager as leverage.\nThey added that the debt could have affected Holmes' ability to negotiate favourable terms for the band's ongoing Music of The Spheres tour.\nThe court documents further allege that Holmes failed to \"adequately to supervise and control the tour budget\", with expensive equipment ordered or bought that was not fit for purpose.\nThis included a $9.7 million (£8 million) video screen that was so big it could not be brought on tour, and was only used for 10 performances in Buenos Aires. \nSixteen bespoke stage pylons were also ordered at a cost of €10.6 million (£9 million) before it transpired they were unusable, the court documents allege.\n\"Had Mr Holmes exercised reasonable care and skill in the performance of his obligations\", the counter-claim continues, the band would not have incurred costs of at least £17.5 million.\nAsked about the counter-claim this weekend, a spokesperson for Holmes told The Times: \"Coldplay know they are in trouble with their defence. \n\"Accusing Dave Holmes of non-existent ethical lapses and other made-up misconduct will not deflect from the real issue at hand - Coldplay had a contract with Dave, they are refusing to honour it and they need to pay Dave what they owe him\".\nThe former manager will now respond to the counter-claim as the case continues.\nMindboggling to join Coldplay on stage, choir says\nChris Martin performs couple's wedding song in pub\nColdplay to stop making music as a band in 2025\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Afghanistan earthquake: More than 1,000 dead as villagers dig for survivors", "date": "2023-10-09 11:44:49", "text": "Rescuers are digging for survivors of a powerful earthquake that flattened whole villages in Afghanistan, killing more than 1,000 people.\nThe 6.3-magnitude quake struck Saturday morning in Herat province, a barren landscape dotted with mud brick homes. \nVillagers are still using shovels and bare hands to search for the missing - more than 500 people, the UN says.  \nAid, delayed by blocked routes and communication lines being down, only started to trickle in on Monday. \nThe quake hit Zindajan, a rural district some 40km (25 miles) from Herat city, where \"100% of homes are estimated to have been completely destroyed,\" according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). \nImages from the villages show entire houses, which were too fragile to withstand such a quake, reduced to rubble. \n\"We came home and saw there was nothing left. Everything had turned to mud,\" one resident Nek Mohammad told AFP news agency. \"We started to dig with shovels and whatever we had to rescue women and children from the rubble.\"\nThe Taliban government and aid agencies initially struggled to estimate the death toll, or how many remained missing. It's unlikely officials had population records for such remote villages. \nThe area is also home to communities displaced by war and drought, making it difficult for the local administration to know exactly how many people have been living there. \nIll-equipped hospitals have been struggling to accommodate the injured, who now number more than 1,600. Many of them were sent to the Herat Regional Hospital, where teams from the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) have been since Saturday.\n\"Fortunately, most of the patients arriving are non-emergency cases,\" says Prue Coakley, the acting country representative for MSF in Afghanistan. \"However, many of them do not have homes to return to, that is why many of them are remaining in the hospital while authorities look for alternative places for them to stay.\"\nShe added that a team focused on paediatric patients had been sent to the hospital in Herat. The UN says a majority of the quake survivors who are being treated are women and children, while doctors tell the BBC women and children also account for many of the dead.\nThe Taliban government has said quake survivors are in urgent need of food, drinking water, medicine, clothes and tents for shelter. Several aid agencies have dispatched help, including the Afghan Red Cross Society, MSF, World Food Programme and Unicef. But the agencies say the cash-strapped country needs more aid. \nAfghanistan has been reeling from an economic crisis since the Taliban takeover in 2021, when aid given directly to the government was stopped.\nFew countries have pledged money since Saturday's quake. China's Red Cross Society has offered $200,000 (£164,220) in emergency cash aid, Chinese media reported. \nNeighbouring Pakistan has said it is in contact with Afghan officials and will \"extend all possible support to the recovery effort.\"\nAfghanistan is frequently hit by earthquakes - especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range as it lies near the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates.\nIn June last year, the province of Paktika was hit by a 5.9 magnitude quake which killed more than 1,000 people and left tens of thousands homeless.\nHundreds dead in powerful Afghan earthquake\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Hamas hostages: 'My wife and children have been taken to Gaza'", "date": "2023-10-09 12:04:43", "text": "Families have spoken of the sheer panic of learning their loved ones may have been taken hostage by Hamas, after the militant group attacked Israel.\nThe Israeli military suggests dozens of people, including foreign nationals, have been taken as captives into Gaza. Here are some of their stories.\nThe first inkling Yoni Asher had that his family were inside Gaza was by tracking his wife's mobile phone.\nHis wife Doron and their two children Raz, 5, and Aviv, 3, were staying with relatives close to the border with Gaza when the militants struck.\nYoni told the BBC: \"Saturday, around 10:30 in the morning, was the last call when I spoke with my wife. She told me that terrorists from Hamas had entered the house. \n\"They were in the safe, secure room then the call got disconnected. Later on, I managed to locate her mobile and it was inside Gaza\".\nLater that day, his worst fears were seemingly confirmed when he recognised his family being briefly shown in a video of people being loaded onto the back of a truck.\n\"In the video I recognised my wife and my two daughters, my two little babies,\" he said. \n\"I don't know in what terms or what conditions they are held but you know, the situation is getting much worse. \"\nFor now, like other families, all Yoni can do is hope. \"I'm trying to stay calm. I want to believe there is some contact between the diplomats negotiating or something but we don't know anything - that is the hardest thing\".\nNoam Sagi said his heart sank when Palestinian media began broadcasting from in front of his 74-year-old mother's home, around 400m from the border with Gaza. \nOn Saturday afternoon, the Israeli Army entered grandmother-of-six Ada Sagi's property and found blood stains - but no sign of the elderly woman, he explained.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4, Mr Sagi - who lives in London - said his assumption was that his mother, who teaches Arabic, was among those kidnapped. \n\"We are talking about someone, 74 years old, who went into a safe room and [now] she is not there\", he said. \n\"She is not on the dead list, she is not on the injured list, and it's a small community… 350 people max and they know each other, so they have gone through the process of identifying everyone.\" \nThe community are reporting that the elderly and the young have been abducted, according to Mr Sagi, who said there was not any formal or official confirmation of his mother's whereabouts. He pointed out that she could not run far following a recent hip replacement.\n\"It's somehow completely surreal, sounds like a horror movie, it's hard to compute\", Mr Sagi continued. \n\"Just imagine a lovely, rural village here in the UK and people just going through their lives… and then you are just being snatched out of your house. \n\"It feels unreal… it feels inhumane… it is very upsetting to think that this is even possible. Even in war there are rules, and we are talking about men in their 20s and 30s that come into an old woman's house and snatch her and her neighbours.\"\nHe added that he was scared for his mother, who needs medication.\nHis wife Michal, who also spoke to the BBC, said Ada had allergies.\n\"Without her medicines, we don't know how long she will keep on,\" she said. \"I'm trying not to get into the negative scenarios, they're difficult to imagine.\"\nMr Sagi, who believes he will see his mother again, said he had been expecting her in London next week for her 75th birthday. \nHe described her as a very strong, inspiring and phenomenal woman, adding that he trusted her to \"deal with the situation\".\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\n260 bodies recovered from 'horror movie' festival scene\n'Nobody could help us' - Shock and anger in Israel's Ashkelon\nHow Hamas staged lightning assault no-one thought possible\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "What is Hamas, what is happening in Israel and Gaza Strip, and other questions", "date": "2023-10-09 12:38:58", "text": "This video can not be played\nWatch: A day of violence and fear\nThe Palestinian militant group Hamas has launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, with its fighters entering communities near the Gaza Strip, killing hundreds of residents and taking dozens of hostages.\nHere's what you need to know about the people and places involved - and the essential context to understand this story.\nHamas is a Palestinian militant group which rules the Gaza Strip. It is sworn to Israel's destruction and wants to replace it with an Islamic state. Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power in Gaza in 2007. \nIn between those wars, it has fired or allowed other groups to fire thousands of rockets at Israel, and carried out other deadly attacks. Israel has also repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes, and, together with Egypt, has blockaded the Gaza Strip since 2007, for what it says is its security. \nHamas as a whole, or in some cases its military wing, is designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, the European Union and the UK, as well as other powers. Hamas is backed by Iran, which funds it and provides weapons and training.\nThe Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. It is home to about 2.3 million people and has one of the highest population densities in the world. \nIsrael controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline and restricts who and what goods are allowed in and out through its border crossings. Similarly, Egypt controls who passes in and out through its border with Gaza. \nAbout 80% of the population of Gaza depends on international aid, according to the UN, and about one million people rely on daily food aid.\nThe West Bank and Gaza, which are known as the Palestinian territories, as well as East Jerusalem and Israel all formed part of land known as Palestine since Roman times. \nThese were also the lands of Jewish kingdoms in the Bible, and are seen by Jews as their ancient homeland. \nIsrael was declared a state in 1948, though the land is still referred to as Palestine by those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist. Palestinians also use the name Palestine as an umbrella term for the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.  \nAlthough the attack by the militants on 7 October came without warning, it happened at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions. \nThis year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which could have motivated Hamas to strike Israel with a spectacular attack. Hamas might also have been seeking to score a major propaganda victory against Israel to boost its popularity among ordinary Palestinians. \nThe fact that it has taken so many Israelis captive is likely to be aimed at pressuring Israel to free some of the about 4,500 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons - a highly emotive issue for all Palestinians. \nThere is also speculation that the attack was orchestrated by Iran - Israel's arch-foe - which has been trading a growing number of attacks with Israel in recent years. Israel has blamed Iran, though Iran's ambassador the UN has denied his country's involvement.\nIran and Hamas also staunchly oppose the growing prospect of a historic peace deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia - something which might be thwarted if Israel's military response to the attacks provokes widespread anger in the Arab world.\nAs our International Editor Jeremy Bowen writes, this is the most ambitious operation Hamas has ever launched from Gaza and the most serious cross-border attack Israel has faced in more than a generation.\nMilitants breached the wire that separates Gaza from Israel in multiple places.\nThe unprecedented attack came a day after the 50th anniversary of the surprise attack by Egypt and Syria in 1973 that started a major Middle East war. The significance of the date will not have been lost on the Hamas leadership.\nYes, says our security correspondent Frank Gardner. With the combined efforts of Shin Bet, Israeli domestic intelligence, Mossad, its external spy agency and all the assets of the Israel Defense Forces, he says it is frankly astounding that nobody saw this coming or failed to act on it if they did have a warning.\nIsrael has arguably the most extensive and well-funded intelligence services in the Middle East, with informants and agents inside Palestinian militant groups, as well as in Lebanon, Syria and elsewhere.\nOn the ground, along the tense border fence between Gaza and Israel there are cameras, ground-motion sensors and regular army patrols.\nThe barbed-wire topped fence is supposed to have been a \"smart barrier\" to prevent exactly the sort of infiltration that has taken place in this attack. Yet the militants of Hamas simply bulldozed their way through it, cut holes in the wire or entered Israel from the sea and by paraglider.\nHamas militant commander Mohammed Deif has called on Palestinians and other Arabs to join the militants' operation to \"sweep away the [Israeli] occupation\".\nA big question now is whether Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem or elsewhere in the region will heed his call, says our Jerusalem correspondent Yolande Knell.\nIsrael undoubtedly sees the potential for a war that could open up on multiple fronts. A worst-case scenario is that it could draw in the powerful Lebanese militant group, Hezbollah. On Sunday morning, Hezbollah launched a number of missiles and shells at northern Israel, without causing casualties.\nThe Israeli military has ordered a massive reinforcement of troops. As well as its intense air raids on Gaza, it has indicated that it is planning a ground operation there.\nIsrael 'at war' after 250 die in attack from Gaza\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

There would also be further independent monitoring of what happened to each migrant. \nThese arrangements, alongside the detailed written commitments given to the UK under the £140m scheme, meant there was no legal reason to interfere with the plan. \nSir James said that while critics of the Rwanda plan had warned about the country's human rights record, past incidents were not legally relevant.\nHe said the scheme ensured that both the UK government and Rwanda's treatment of the migrants would comply with legal safeguards under the Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights. \n\"At the heart of all of this lies compliance with the assurances and the judgments that have to be made about that,\" he said.\n\"There is no challenge at all to the good faith or the intent of Rwanda to comply with the commitments that they have given to the United Kingdom.\"\nLawyers for 10 migrants resisting the plan will begin their submissions later on Monday.\nOn Tuesday, the United Nations' refugee agency is expected to reiterate its criticisms of the scheme which have been a crucial element of the case so far. \nRwanda Supreme Court showdown: What do we know?\n£63,000 more to remove a migrant than keep in UK\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

The UN's humanitarian agency, OCHA, has also warned of fuel supplies lasting a matter of days. \nEven before the latest restrictions, residents of Gaza already faced widespread food insecurity, restrictions on movement and water shortages.\nOn Monday, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said it would impose a \"complete siege\" on the territory. \n\"No electricity, no food, no water, no gas - it's all closed,\" he said, adding that \"we are fighting animals and are acting accordingly.\"\nThe Israeli infrastructure minister later ordered the immediate cut-off of water supplies to Gaza, saying: \"What was in the past will no longer be in the future.\"\nIn a statement released before those announcements, the Palestinian health ministry said hospitals were facing a shortage of medicines, medical supplies and fuel due to Israel's actions. \nIt called on international actors to urge Israel to \"restart power lines\" and to supply emergency needs in the form of medicine, fuel and power generators. \nIsrael has launched massive retaliatory air strikes into Gaza since Saturday, killing at least 511 people and injuring 2,750, according to the Palestinian health ministry. \nSunday night saw a particularly heavy barrage of strikes, potentially the biggest Gaza has experienced in years - throughout the night several loud bangs could be heard in quick succession across the Gaza Strip. \nAs the strikes continued after dawn, black smoke filled the sky, and the dust from collapsed buildings could be tasted in the air.\nSome of the strikes targeted the border area in the east of Gaza, from where Hamas launched their attacks on Saturday morning.

{"title": "Nobel economics prize awarded to Claudia Goldin for work on women's pay", "date": "2023-10-09 13:02:13", "text": "This year's Nobel economics prize has been awarded to Claudia Goldin, an American economic historian, for her work on women's employment and pay.\nProf Goldin's research uncovered key drivers behind the gender pay gap, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.\nShe is only the third woman to receive the prize, and the first to not share the award with male colleagues.\nThe 77-year-old academic currently teaches labour market history at Harvard University in the US.\nShe had \"advanced our understanding of women's labour market outcomes\", the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said, pointing to her work examining 200 years of data on the US workforce, showing how and why gender differences in earnings and employment rates changed over time.\n\"This year's Laureate in the Economic Sciences, Claudia Goldin, provided the first comprehensive account of women's earnings and labour market participation through the centuries,\" the prize-giving body said in a statement.\n\"Her research reveals the causes of change, as well as the main sources of the remaining gender gap.\"\nHer research found that married women started to work less after the arrival of industrialisation in the 1800s, but their employment picked up again in the 1900s as the service economy grew.\nHigher educational levels for women and the contraceptive pill accelerated change, but the gender pay gap remained.\nWhile historically that earnings difference between men and women could be blamed on educational choices made at a young age and career choices, Prof Goldin found that the current earnings gap was now largely due to the impact of having children.\n\"Claudia Goldin's discoveries have vast societal implications,\" said Randi Hjalmarsson, a member of the committee awarding the prize.\n\"She has shown us that the nature of this problem or the source of this underlying gender gap changes throughout history and with the course of development,\" she said.\nDescribing her as \"a detective\", Prof Hjalmarsson said her work had provided a foundation for policymakers in this area around the world.\nGlobally, about 50% of women participate in the labour market compared to 80% of men, but women earn less and are less likely to reach the top of the career ladder, the prize committee noted.\nProf Goldin was the first woman to receive tenure in Harvard's economics department in 1989. Economics still had an image problem with women, she told the BBC in 2018.\n\"Even before students enter university they believe economics is a field more oriented to finance and management and women are less interested in those than are men,\" she said. If we explained economics was about \"inequality, health, household behaviour, society, then there'd be a much greater balance,\" she said.\nOn her website she also publishes a blog about her dog, Pika, a golden retriever.\nThe economics prize is different to the original prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace, which were established by Alfred Nobel and first awarded in 1901. \nThe Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Scienceswas established in 1968 and funded by Sweden's central bank.\nElinor Ostrom was the first woman to win the economics prize in 2009, which she was awarded jointly with Oliver E Williamson for research on economic governance.\nIn 2019 Esther Duflo shared the award with her husband Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer, for work that focused on poor communities in India and Kenya.\nEsther Duflo: 'Nobel Prize will be a megaphone'\nThe tiny pill which gave birth to an economic revolution\nThe spectacular failures and successes of massive dams\nNobel prize for economics awarded\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

scrapped by the prime minister last week.\nMs Reeves made no commitments to rebuild the high-speed line but said a Labour government would commission an independent inquiry into the project.\nThere was also a pledge to increase the national minimum wage \"taking into account the real cost of living,\" without specifying the amount. \nLabour has made a concerted effort over recent months to raise Ms Reeves's profile, given she would be not only at the heart of a Labour government, but their election campaign too.\nInternally, Labour figures say that taking the fight to the Conservatives on the economy rather than, say, the NHS, is a measure of their political confidence. \nOne senior source said that elections are \"won and lost on the economy\", adding: \"We're not in our safe zones any more, we're on their turf.\"\nMs Reeves speech was bookended by glossy videos and a lavish introduction by Cameron-era government advisor Mary Portas.\nMs Portas declared Ms Reeves would be the best-qualified chancellor ever.\nMs Reeves was also labelled \"a serious economist\" who \"understands the big picture\" by former Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, in a video played after the speech.\nAnd the shadow chancellor's fiery rhetoric repeatedly brought the audience in the conference hall to its feet. \nHer vow to levy VAT on private school fees prompted a prolonged bout of whooping in the hall, as did her refrain - used more than once in the speech - that Labour is \"ready to serve\" and \"ready to lead.\"\nMuch of the speech was focused on how Labour would achieve growth in office, with Ms Reeves saying Labour would overhaul planning rules to speed up green energy, battery factories and 5G projects.\nUnder plans announced on Monday, 300 new planners across the public sector would be hired and planning guidance to speed up the process re-written.\nDecision times for major projects have increased by two-thirds since 2012, to four years according to Ms Reeves, and economic growth and net zero considerations need to be factored in.\nEarlier, Shevaun Haviland, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, welcomed the proposals, saying long-term investment in infrastructure was a \"key ingredient to get our economy back to growth\". \n\"We are pleased to see a future Labour government would support the building of large-scale factories and improve our digital infrastructure, such as 5G connectivity,\" she said.\nUnions broadly welcomed the speech, with Unison general secretary Christina McAnea praising Ms Reeves' \"compelling vision\". \nMomentum, the left-wing pressure group set up to support former leader Jeremy Corbyn, said the speech Labour's plans were \"disappointing\" and failed to \"rise to the huge crises facing Britain\".\nMs Reeves also proposed establishing an anti-corruption commissioner aimed at recovering money lost as a result of fraud and waste during the pandemic.\nOn Monday, the Labour leadership was for a showdown with Unite - historically the party's biggest financial backer - over the union's call to nationalise critical infrastructure, starting with privatised electricity and gas networks.\nDelegates will vote later on whether the party should adopt the policy, which is opposed by Ms Reeves and Labour's leader Sir Keir Starmer.\nThe union's motion calls for UK energy to be brought into public ownership, and also to commit to deliver infrastructure projects, including HS2.\nUnite leader Sharon Graham accused the Labour party of being \"timid\".\n\"Labour need to act more like a 1945 transformative government,\" she told the Today programme.\nMs Graham said she thought the shadow chancellor was \"doing a good job, but I don't think we're going to get the type of growth they're talking about quickly\". \nIt is time \"to look at the economy differently\", she said.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\nLabour unveils Biden-inspired economic strategy\nLabour urges ministers to 'clean up' Covid contracts\nLabour pledges watchdog power after Truss mini-budget\nLabour rules out wealth tax if party wins power\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

It will be available Monday to Friday from 9.00-18.30 BST, and from 10.00-16:00 on Saturday and Sunday.\nThis video can not be played\nA woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer has learned that she had three abnormal smear tests that were missed.\nA woman who had to undergo a radical hysterectomy in the Southern Trust in 2019 because of screeners missing abnormal cells in three different smear tests said the latest development was \"shocking and worrying\".\nLast February, the woman told her story as part of a BBC News NI investigation into cervical screening at the Southern Trust. \nWhile the Southern Trust has insisted only a few women may be impacted, they should not have been placed in this position in the first place, said the woman.\nWhile last February she had been hesitant about speaking out, she was glad she did as lives may now be saved.  \nCervical screening can not detect cancer, but detecting and treating abnormal cells may help prevent cancer. No screening process is 100% accurate.\nThe screening looks for the human papillomavirus (HPV) which can cause abnormal cells on the cervix. If HPV is detected a cytology test is used to check for any abnormal cells.  \nUnlike the rest of the UK and Ireland, Northern Ireland does not have the primary HPV screening system in full operation.   \nIn Northern Ireland, the cervical screening process involves two people - a screener and checker analysing slides under a microscope.\nTests taken in the Southern Trust between 1 January 2008 and October 2021 will be re-checked if they also meet the following criteria:\nAs screening is offered to women every three or five years, depending on their age, many women will have had more than one screening test during this timeframe and had subsequent smears which have provided assurance. \nThe trust says it also has to contact women who have moved out of Northern Ireland or are no longer registered with GPs.\nDr Austin says the trust was confident it had not missed anyone in the review.\nThroughout the report, the screeners involved are identified by a number which has been redacted by the health trust. \nThe report highlights that the screener involved in the woman who spoke to the BBC's first test in 2011 was not meeting the required performance standards at that time. \nIt added that person \"failed to achieve the 95% standard for high-grade sensitivity for four consecutive years between 2008 and 2012 and again during 2013-14 to 2014-15\".\nThe Southern Trust has confirmed to BBC News NI that the same screener went on to work in another health trust but is currently no longer working in healthcare.  \nThe report also found that another screener failed to achieve the standards required for five consecutive years from 2014 to 2019 and again from 2020 to 2021; another failed to meet standards for several years between 2014 and 2021.\nThe report, was undertaken by our separate consulting arm RCPath Consulting, which offers a service to commissioners and managers of pathology services. \nThe Public Health Agency (PHA) said laboratories are all performing within required standards and \"there are no similar concerns regarding other labs carrying out this work\".\nIt said processes are in place to monitor this and quality assurance processes are kept under review.\nThe PHA added that while no screening programme could detect all abnormalities, Northern Ireland's screening programme was \"very effective\".\nBBC News NI understands the review of slides is expected to start within the next couple of weeks but will take months, even longer, to complete if women are recalled for a repeat smear. \nThe Department of Health said that the findings of the report \"are clearly unacceptable\".\n\"The department is closely monitoring the actions being taken at trust and regional level in response to the RCPath recommendations,\" it added, in a statement.\nIt added that it was on course for full introduction of primary HPV testing by December 2023 which will mark the start of \"a new era for cervical screening\" and help to clear the current backlog for reporting smear test results.\nSigns of cancer missed in woman's smear tests\nSix month smear wait 'worrying and frustrating'\nNI bowel and cervical screening lags behind UK\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

Eyewitnesses said the rockets were quickly followed by gunshots. \n\"They turned off the electricity and suddenly out of nowhere they [militants] come inside with gunfire, opening fire in every direction,\" she told Israel's Channel 12.\n\"Fifty terrorists arrived in vans, dressed in military uniforms,\" she said.\n\"They fired bursts, and we reached a point where everyone stopped their vehicles and started running. I went into a tree, a bush like this, and they just started spraying people. I saw masses of wounded people thrown around.\"\nGilad Karplus, who was working as a masseuse at the festival, told the BBC he also saw people being hit by bullets and managed to escape into the fields in a vehicle with his friends. \n\"Then they [the militants] started firing sniper rifles on us from different places and also heavy artillery.\"\nMr Karplus, who used to work for the Israel Defense Forces, was injured after being fired at from motorcycles but said he and his friends managed to escape and hid in a building. \n\"We heard them [the gunmen] going from door to door, and in a few hours they could have found us, but they didn't know we were there.\"\nEventually, Israeli soldiers and police arrived and Mr Karplus was taken to hospital for treatment. \nThe festival site - with three stages, a camping area and bar and food area - was in the Negev desert, near Kibbutz Re'im. It was not far from the Gaza Strip, from where Hamas fighters crossed over at dawn to launch their attack. They infiltrated towns and villages, taking dozens of people hostage.\nThis video can not be played\nDestroyed cars line road near festival site in chilling video\nEsther Borochov told Reuters she was driving away when her vehicle was rammed into. She saw a young man driving another car, who told her to get in. She did - but the man was then shot at point blank. Esther said she played dead until she was finally rescued by Israeli military.\n\"I couldn't move my legs,\" she told Reuters from the hospital. \"Soldiers came and took us away to the bushes.\"\nMany festivalgoers - like Ortel - hid in nearby bushes and fruit orchards for hours, hoping for the military to arrive and rescue them.\n\"I put the phone on mute mode, and then I started crawling through an orange grove,\" Ortel said. \"Live fire was whistling above me.\"\nGili Yoskovich told the BBC how she hid in a pomelo orchard. \"They were going tree by tree and shooting.

He told public broadcaster Kan News: \"I've never seen anything like it in my life. It was a planned ambush. As people came out of the emergency exits, squads of terrorists were waiting for them there and just started picking them off.\n\"There were 3,000 people at the event, so they probably knew it. They had intelligence information.\"\nFriends and family members of missing loved ones are now desperately hoping to find them.\nAmong those missing is German tourist, Shani Louk, whose mother believes she was kidnapped. Another woman, 25-year-old Noa Argamani is believed to have been taken hostage at the festival, her family and friends say.\nNoa's friend, Amit Parpara, told the BBC he was messaging her as she hid.\n\"Around 8:30 was the last message that I got from her,\" he said. Amit later saw a video on social media appearing to show her being taken captive. \"[It shows] her on a motorcycle, being taken away from her boyfriend. You can see clearly her terror going into the Gaza Strip.\"\nThe parents of 23-year-old American-Israeli Hersh Golberg-Polin are also looking for their son, who was there after celebrating his birthday. They told the Jerusalem Post they received two short messages from him on Saturday morning reading: \"I love you\" and \"I'm sorry.\"\nAt least 700 Israelis have been killed since the attack began, according to the latest figures in local media. \nFighting between the Israeli military and Palestinian militants is continuing, and Israel has launched a wave of air strikes on Gaza.

The family are running out of baby milk, and only have about two-days of supplies for the rest of the family, he said. \nMany are currently without electricity and internet, and could soon be out of essential food and water supplies.\nEven before the latest restrictions, residents of Gaza faced widespread food insecurity, restrictions on movement and water shortages.\n\"My family have nothing to do with Hamas,\" he said. \n\"My mother-in-law is a retired nurse from Ninewells [Hospital]; my brother-in-law who lives in Gaza is a doctor, nothing to do with Hamas, but they are along with a lot of other Gazans potentially going collective punishment, and that cannot be justified.\"\nMore than 10 Britons feared dead or missing in Israel\nGaza 'soon without fuel, medicine and food'\nIsrael orders 'complete siege' of Gaza as rocket attacks continue\nAt least nine Americans killed in attack on Israel\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nHow India's first deaf lawyer made history in top court\nFive female MCs who changed hip-hop\nThe scandalous life of a 'dashing and unreliable' king\n'I feel hopeless': Living in a country on the brink\nThe 'white gold' rush dividing communities\nBiden cannot escape Trump's shadow in border crisis\nThe inspiring youth orchestra that built itself from nothing\nWhy Europe is watching Poland's election\nCities under siege as Mali slides towards chaos\nWhy do people love living in Canada?\nThe return of a divisive lingerie brand\nNew maps of Earth's lost continent\n© 2023 BBC.

{"title": "Frasier: Kelsey Grammer and Nicholas Lyndhurst reboot gets mixed response", "date": "2023-10-09 15:37:14", "text": "TV critics have broadly welcomed the reboot of sitcom Frasier, although some suggested it feels somewhat dated.\nKelsey Grammer returns in the new version, which also stars Only Fools and Horses actor Nicholas Lyndhurst. \nThe Guardian said it was a \"joy to watch\" and praised Grammer's \"faultless performance\".\nBut the Financial Times said it had \"none of the old charm\" and Rolling Stone called it an \"unfunny, uninspired dud\".\nThe original Frasier, itself a spin-off from sitcom Cheers, ran for 11 seasons from 1993 to 2004.\nThe first two episodes of the rebooted series will launch on streaming service Paramount+ on Friday.\nVariety's Aramide Tinubu said: \"It turns out that watching Frasier's third chapter is a charming and delightful experience. \n\"Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel of a legendary character, Frasier 2.0 leans toward everything that made the '90s sitcom such a staple - not only of the era, but of the fabric of television as a whole. \n\"If fans are looking for something new, they won't find it here, but there is something so charming about dusting off and polishing up a past relic that makes it as refreshing as you remembered it.\"\nIn a four-star review, the Guardian's Lucy Mangan noted: \"At first, this reboot struggles. But after a few episodes, the chemistry and the magic are back, all helmed by its lead's faultless performance - and it is a joy to watch.\n\"Unlike the wretched reboot of Sex and the City, Frasier's team has managed to update the comedy's situation, incorporate Frasier's greater age and its different challenges and diversify its casting without apparent strain. \n\"It feels like an organic progression rather than something flung together by a frightened committee.\"\nThe original series was set in Seattle, but as it concluded in 2004, viewers saw Frasier Crane leave to be with Laura Linney's character Charlotte in Chicago.\nThe reboot sees Frasier back in Boston, where Cheers was set, after returning from Chicago, where he explains he has spent the last 15 years working as a TV shrink.\nHe has moved back to Boston to be closer to his now grown-up son Frederick, who dropped out of Harvard to become a firefighter.\nThe new episodes see Frasier being flattered into staying on to lecture at his old university.\nDeadline's Dominic Patten wrote: \"From the too loud studio audience laughs, the staging, the set-ups and timing, the lighting, the improbabilities, the in-jokes... and most of the conundrums and tropes the 2023 narrative employs, Frasier the revival's strength is being exactly what you would expect if Frasier had never ended in the first place in 2004...\n\"A bona fide celebrity now, Grammer's vainglorious Frasier moves with a stiffness he never had before. Yet, for a man of 68, he can still fumble the most straightforward of emotional interactions with disdain for a good laugh.\n\"Grammer's Frasier can also still block a kitchen door for comic effect with the best of them - which is kind of all you need to make the gig work again.\"\nNot everyone was as enthusiastic, with the Independent's Nick Hilton noting the absence of some of the show's previous supporting cast in his three-star review.\n\"Without the crutches of Jane Leeves and David Hyde Pierce, both of whom opted not to return, as Daphne and Niles respectively, not to mention Martin Crane (played by the late John Mahoney) or Eddie the Dog (played by the late Moose and Enzo), 2023's Frasier feels like a different beast.\n\"There is little that is new to this series that genuinely works,\" he added. \"The result is an unsettling collision of nineties sitcom tropes and present-day sensibilities.\"\nRolling Stone's Alan Sepinwall was not keen on the reboot, writing: \"The whole endeavor feels like a very superficial read of what makes the character, and what made the nineties version of Frasier, work. \n\"There are a lot of wacky misunderstandings, particularly involving Eve (Jess Salgueiro), the woman living with Freddy at the start of the series. And my lord, there are a lot of puns.\"\nThere was also some scepticism from the Times' Dominic Maxwell, who also gave three stars to the reboot.\n\"All first episodes have a heavy workload, but this one babbles information at us like an over-caffeinated home worker who hasn't spoken to anyone all day telling their returning spouse what they've been up to,\" he wrote.\n\"The plot convolutions are forced, the gags can feel generic, yet the playing is always energised but focused, and the exchanges sometimes fizz.\"\nThe Financial Times' Dan Einav gave one of the least positive reviews, awarding two stars.\n\"A star-vehicle though it may be, the revival runs like a sputtering jalopy given a new lick of paint. From the sound of the first unearned laugh from the live studio audience, the series feels less like a renewal than a relic of the past,\" he suggested.\n\"Any cast would struggle to sell a script laden with punchlines you could have seen coming from 2004. Which, as far as I'm concerned, is still when Frasier ended.\"\nThere was praise, though, for British actor Lyndhurst from the Evening Standard's Nick Curtis, who awarded the series four stars.\n\"Lyndhurst is one of sitcom's great straight men and is terrifically deadpan as Alan, sleeping through his lectures and forgetting the existence of his own children, let alone his students,\" he wrote.\n\"[The series] is not breaking any new ground, but this reboot stays true to what made Frasier popular and funny, and manages to age the character and his concerns without jumping the shark. \n\"To have played Frasier so well and so consistently in different scenarios for 40 years is a remarkable feat for Grammer, and he has the Emmy awards to prove it.\"\nThere was a five-star review from the Telegraph's Jasper Rees. \"Does it work? On the strength of the first five episodes, very much so,\" he said. \nReferring to the character's fans in the series, he added: \"It turns out that Frasier's many devotees are known, hilariously, as Craniacs. Their ranks are now certain to swell.\"\nGrammer praises Frasier reboot co-star Lyndhurst\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Why did it take Israel so long to deal with Hamas's attack from Gaza?", "date": "2023-10-09 16:44:04", "text": "Where were the Israeli Defense Forces, in those long hours as Hamas militants roamed at will around communities near Gaza, some are asking.\n\"The army completely failed as a quick-reaction force,\" one Israeli said, pointing to how some of the communities that came under attack had to rely on their own civilian protection forces while they waited for the military to arrive.\nThe full answer of why this happened will take some time to emerge. But it seems as if surprise, scale and speed overwhelmed defences which were patchy and unprepared for what they faced.\nSurprise was crucial in Hamas's assault.\nIsraeli intelligence failed to get inside the planning by Hamas for the attack. The group seems to have undertaken a long-term programme of deception to give the impression it was incapable or unwilling to launch an ambitious attack. \nIt also practised good operational security, probably keeping off electronic communications.\nHamas then relied on the unprecedented scale and speed of what came next.\nThousands of rockets were launched as cover. But there were also drone strikes on the monitoring equipment that Israel uses on the border fence to watch what is happening. Heavy explosives and vehicles then created as many as 80 breaches in the security fence.\nMotorised hang-gliders and motorbikes were also involved, as between 800 and 1,000 armed men flooded out of Gaza to attack multiple sites. \nThese swarming tactics seem to have succeeded in overwhelming Israel's defences - at least for a while.\nSuch a range of activity would have led to chaos within Israel's command and control centres, already quiet on a Saturday morning which was also a religious holiday.\nSome of the Hamas fighters targeted civilian communities while others targeted military outposts. There has been shock that these outposts were so lightly-defended that they could be overrun, with images posted of Israeli tanks in Hamas hands. \nAnd the holes in the border remained open for long enough to allow hostages to be taken into Gaza before tanks were eventually used to close them up.\nDefences seem to have been patchy - Israeli security and defence forces had in recent months been more focused on the West Bank rather than Gaza, potentially leaving gaps. And Hamas may have counted on the divisions in Israeli society over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies to further distract the security establishment.\nIsrael's military and intelligence capability has long been rated as the best in the Middle East and one of the best in the world. But they may also have underestimated the abilities of their opponents.\nThe attacks have been compared to those of 9/11 in the US, when no-one had predicted that planes could be used as weapons. That was often called a \"failure of imagination\". \nAnd a similar failure of imagination may also be one of the issues for Israel, leaving it unprepared for something so ambitious from its enemy.\nThose concerns will certainly be part of the long-term inquiries that will likely take place. In the short term though, the focus will be on working out what to do next rather than looking back.\nWhat is happening in Israel, and why now?\nThe international victims of Hamas' assault on Israel\n'Nobody could help us' - Shock and anger in Israel's Ashkelon\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Did Iran support plan for attack on Israel?", "date": "2023-10-09 17:21:22", "text": "Questions about the involvement of Israel's arch-enemy Iran are already being asked in the wake of the deadly assault by Hamas on Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip.\nA report in the Wall Street Journal quotes unnamed members of Hamas and the Lebanese guerrilla movement Hezbollah as saying that Iran gave the go-ahead for the attack a week ago.\nBut a senior defence official in Washington later said that the US had \"no information at this time\" to corroborate specific allegations of an Iranian role in the attacks.\nRegardless, the stakes on the truth of this are high. If it emerged that Iran was behind the attacks, it could widen the conflict into a regional confrontation.\nSo while Iran's leaders have celebrated and praised the attacks, they have been quick to deny involvement.\n\"The accusations linked to an Iranian role… are based on political reasons,\" Iran's Foreign Ministry said.\nIran did not intervene \"in the decision-making of other countries\", a spokesman added.\nBut none of this means Iran wasn't involved. \nThe US says it had \"not yet\" seen evidence Iran was behind the attacks. However, Secretary of State Antony Blinken noted that \"there is certainly a long relationship\".\nTehran has been one of Hamas' main sponsors for many years, providing it with financial assistance and vast quantities of weaponry, including rockets.\nIsrael has spent years trying to disrupt Iran's supply routes to Gaza, which involve Sudan, Yemen, ships in the Red Sea and Bedouin smugglers in the lawless Sinai Peninsula.\nAs one of Israel's most implacable foes, Iran clearly has a vested interest in seeing the Jewish state suffer.\n\"I would say that it's not too much to assume that Iran is involved,\" Haim Tomer, a former senior officer with Israel's foreign intelligence agency, Mossad, told the BBC.\n\"This is the response of Iran to reports that a peace treaty is going to happen between Israel and Saudi Arabia.\"\nBut Mr Tomer said he found the suggestion that Iran actually ordered Saturday's attack \"a little bit cumbersome\".\n\"Yes, it's true that Iran is the number one provider of equipment to Hamas,\" he said, \"and that they were training them in Syria and even, reportedly, in Iran.\"\nIsrael, he said, had been watching the movement of Hamas officials in recent months.\n\"We have seen people like Saleh al-Arouri (head of the organisation's military wing) and other Hamas leaders flying back and forth between Lebanon and Iran, holding meetings, including with [Supreme Leader Ayatollah] Khamenei himself.\"\nBut this \"intimate relationship\" was not enough, Mr Tomer said, to explain the timing of the attack.\n\"Hamas was very much tuned to the inner conflict in Israel,\" he said.\n\"Iran sustains and supports every logistic and military aspect, but I think the decision was at least 75% an independent decision by the Hamas leadership.\"\nRaz Zimmt, an Iran expert at Tel Aviv University, agrees.\n\"This is a Palestinian story,\" he posted on social media today.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Iran gave the green light for the attack at a meeting in Beirut last Monday.\nUnnamed Hamas and Hezbollah sources told the newspaper that officers from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had worked alongside Hamas since August to put together Saturday's complex air, land and sea operation.\nVideos of the Hamas attack pointed to a level of sophistication far beyond the organisation's mostly crude attempts in the past to breach Israel's security fence surrounding the Gaza Strip.\nThe simultaneous use of rockets, drones, vehicles and powered hang-gliders suggested that the operation's planners had studied other recent examples of hybrid warfare, perhaps including Ukraine.\nBut the decision to attack, Mr Raz said, was taken \"by Hamas, based on its own interests, arising from the Palestinian reality\".\n\"Did Hamas use Iranian aid? Definitely, yes. Did Iran have an interest in this action? Yes. Does Hamas need Iranian permission to operate? No.\"\nHamas has been developing its elite units for several years, says Haim Tomer, the former Mossad official.\n\"But still they performed above their former level,\" he said.\nIsraeli officials are now looking north and south as they figure out what happens next and whether Iran's involvement could become more overt.\nIran's Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, has already launched two small-scale attacks into the Israel-occupied Golan Heights. The Israeli military says it has used helicopters to hit targets inside Lebanon.\n\"The Hamas operation is a reality-changing event in the Middle East that may oblige Iran to move from the phase of ongoing support and co-ordination to a more direct involvement, especially if the Israeli response poses a significant challenge to Hamas,\" Mr Raz said.\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\nUS moves warships closer to Israel after Hamas attack\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

How they must have laughed.\"\nThe motion passed with only a handful of votes against it, and was backed by three major Labour backing unions - Unite, ASLEF and TSSA.\nMomentum, the left-wing pressure group set up to support former leader Jeremy Corbyn, called the vote \"a huge victory - and a clear message to the leadership\". \"Trade unions and Labour members, like the public, overwhelmingly want our public services in public hands, not being run for profit.\"\nBefore the vote, Unite published a survey which found voters in seats known as the Red Wall - traditionally Labour areas where the Conservatives won in 2019 - were overwhelmingly in favour of putting energy utilities back into public ownership.\nMore than two-thirds of the 2,000 potential voters surveyed in those constituencies across the North, Midlands and Wales agreed that the UK's domestic energy industry should be in public ownership.\nThe motion also reaffirmed Labour's commitment to build HS2 in full and to retain or reopen fully-staffed rail ticket offices.\nOn Thursday, Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said he could not commit to building HS2's northern leg after the government \"took a wrecking ball\" to the project's finances.\nPolicy voted on by conference feeds into Labour's National Policy Forum, which debates and finalises Labour's policy. \nThe party's current policy include a commitment to public ownership of different industries - including renationalising the railways when contracts with existing operators expire or fail.\nLabour have also promised to create GB Energy, a publicly owned national energy company that will compete with private industry and promote clean energy.\nBe bolder, Unite union leader urges Starmer\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Libya floods: The flawed response that increased Derna death toll", "date": "2023-10-10 00:45:44", "text": "The devastating floods which killed thousands in eastern Libya a month ago were the result of a destructive force of nature, but BBC Arabic has uncovered evidence that mismanagement by the local authorities led to many deaths that could have been prevented.\nThere are three main accusations:\nFirstly, residents of Derna, the hardest-hit town, say they were told to stay at home rather than being evacuated even though it was known that Storm Daniel was coming. \nSecondly, local and regional authorities are accused of failing to address the danger posed by the dams on the Derna riverbed, which runs through the town. Two dams spanning the Derna valley inland from the city burst on 11 September, causing the catastrophic flooding.\nFinally, the authorities are accused of hindering the aid effort in the days immediately after the tragedy.\nAnger in Derna escalated into protests on 18 September and the home of the mayor - who later resigned - was subsequently burned down.\nThe death toll remains unknown, with many bodies believed to have been washed out to sea. At least 4,000 people have been confirmed dead and another 10,000 reported missing in a town with a population of about 90,000.\nSince the fall of long-time Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, the country has been divided between a UN-backed government in the capital, Tripoli, and a rival authority backed by military strongman General Khalifa Haftar, whose forces control eastern Libya, including Derna.\nAhead of the arrival of Storm Daniel, various bodies in the east held emergency meetings and subsequently issued instructions to the region's residents. \nThese generally focused on the evacuation of coastal and low-lying areas in Derna, and stay-at-home orders for other parts of the city and wider region.\nBut residents have told BBC Arabic that evacuation efforts were inadequate in a number of respects: \nResidents of the town were generally instructed to stay indoors. \nPeople living in specific areas on the seafront or close to the riverbed were ordered to leave their homes but there was no comprehensive or consistent list of areas to be evacuated.\nLocal residents told the BBC that some people who were evacuated from the seafront because of fears of rising sea levels were moved to more dangerous areas that were later flooded.\n\"There were no warnings of possible flooding, just that the sea levels might rise,\" a local engineer told the BBC. \"Only those by the beach were asked to evacuate, but the rest of the city was asked to stay indoors.\"\nThe man, who has chosen to remain anonymous In fear of reprisal, lost his wife and two of his sons in the tragedy. He added that just a few hours before the flooding, a force from the interior ministry was going around asking people to stay indoors.  \n\"Many of those that evacuated from the beaches went into central Derna, where they were killed by the later flooding,\" he said.\nPreparations actually began well in advance of the disaster.\nOn 9 September - two days before the devastating flood - the eastern government convened an emergency committee meeting and declared the following two days national holidays to encourage people to stay at home.\nA curfew was declared in the region from 20:00 that evening and orders were given for the evacuation of \"areas near the sea and low-lying areas located in the valleys of Benghazi and the entire eastern region\".\nThe announcements generally called for people to move to \"safe places\", without specifying where they should go.\nOn the same day, the mayor of Derna made a similar call to evacuate various seafront and low-lying neighbourhoods.\nBut by 10 September, online announcements and video statements posted by the Derna police had dropped any mention of evacuation, and were focusing on the curfew and making sure people stayed at home.\nPhotos geolocated by the BBC show police patrols out on the roads following another official announcement which imposed a curfew \"inside the city as a precaution to prevent emergency, especially areas near the beach\". \nThis proclamation came via a Facebook post, and many residents of Derna have complained that television and social media were insufficient means to alert people, especially given the disruption in the aftermath of Storm Daniel.\nRed Crescent staff were also active in coastal areas in the days ahead of the flood - videos show them calling on people via megaphone to clear their homes to stay safe from Storm Daniel.\nSo notable efforts were made to move residents in some areas of the city, but all of these evacuations anticipated that the threat would come from rising sea levels, rather than the failure of infrastructure far inland and the Derna valley flooding. \nDerna residents reported hearing a loud blast before the city was engulfed - the failure of one or both of the two dams which had until then been holding back the floodwaters in the valley.\nThe upper dam had a storage capacity of 1.5 million cubic metres of water, while the lower dam could hold 22.5 million cubic metres.\nEach cubic metre of water weighs about one tonne (1,000kg), so the water held back by the dams weighed a total of 24 million tonnes.\nAs that weight moved downhill, it produced enormous power. Witnesses have said the water was nearly three metres high in places.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Floods tear through Libyan city of Derna\nPublic pronouncements by officials in Derna or the eastern government made no reference to the potential overflow or collapse of the two dams serving the city, focusing instead on the dangers of strong winds and potentially rising water levels.  \nDr Abdulwanis Ashour, a hydrologist and lecturer at Omar Al-Mukhtar University, told the BBC he had collected data on the condition of the Derna dams for a study published last year, which showed they were not prepared to withstand a storm like Daniel.\nHe said he had spent years studying the Derna dams and had discovered the presence of numerous cracks and fissures. In his research, he asserted that they would not be able to handle a large amount of rainfall and were at risk of collapse.\nDr Ashour pointed out that studies and reports had been conducted by local and international entities over the years, all of which warned about the condition of the Derna dams and their danger to nearby areas. He affirmed that successive governments were aware of these reports.\nOn Monday 25 September, Libya's Public Prosecutor's Office, part of the western government, ordered the arrest of 16 officials responsible for managing Libya's dams as part of investigations into negligence regarding dam maintenance and other flood-related work. But it is not clear if any of them have actually been arrested.\nThe emergency response of the Derna authorities has also been widely criticised.\nIn a rare sign of unity in the divided country, pleas for help from the stricken town were answered as a multitude of aid workers immediately set about delivering supplies from cities under the control of the rival government in the west. But these convoys were stopped and denied access into Derna.\nBBC Arabic has been told that this was due to tight security measures invoked immediately after the disaster by the eastern authorities, which led to delays in aid for thousands of survivors for days afterwards.\n\"Nothing and no-one gets in without their permission,\" one Libyan aid worker told the BBC. This aid worker - originally from Derna - lost several friends and relatives to the floods.\nThey work for the Libyan Red Crescent - the only aid agency allowed to work in Derna in the early days of the crisis - and so were one of few aid workers granted access to the city from day one.\n\"Haftar and his troops only trust the Red Crescent, but we couldn't do much as the crisis was so big. We needed all the help we could get,\" said the aid worker, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, for fear of being targeted by Gen Haftar's troops.\n\"Haftar put security before rescue, and political differences before helping devastated Derna residents,\" the aid worker said, adding that Gen Haftar's forces denied immediate access to volunteers coming from western Libyaand halted delivery of aid supplies for days.\nThey say that security forces spent hours scrutinising much-needed aid supplies looking for \"weapons that could be smuggled into the city\".\nGen Haftar has been in control of Derna since 2018, but he only took it after Islamists linked to Islamic State had held out against his forces for three years. One local resident told the BBC he thought the city \"was still getting punished\" for this resistance. \nWhatever the motivation, Derna's residents were left for days with no food, clean water or medical supplies, while vital aid supplies were withheld and stored for inspection. It is impossible to know how many lives were lost as a result.\nThe BBC also spoke to the leader of an aid convoy sent from the west of the country, who recounted a similar story.\nAbdel Monem Kheresha from Tripoli said his convoy was prevented from entering Derna.\n\"We were stopped before Derna's entrances and we were ordered by the 'Libyan National Army' [LNA, Gen Haftar's militia] to hand over our supplies,\" said Mr Kheresha.\nThe BBC has found that aid supplies gathered from such convoys were stored in two main warehouses supervised by the LNA, one in Benghazi and the other in al-Marj.\nThey were carefully inspected and then distributed by the LNA, an operation that took hours and even days.\nIt wasn't until Thursday 14 September, when the size of the catastrophe was apparent to the whole world, that a long queue of trucks carrying aid from around the country was allowed into the city. \nDerna resident Al-No'man Ali told the BBC that they finally received food and aid supplies on the Friday after the disaster, after days of waiting.\nAfter the protests began on 18 September, many local and international journalists in the city were forced to leave after coming under pressure from the authorities.\nAt the same time, communications in the city went down - many protesters believe they were deliberately cut to stop the demonstrations from escalating.\nThe lack of mobile phone signal and internet hindered the rescue and aid work in the city as the different international and local teams that were eventually allowed to operate there couldn't coordinate their work.  \nThe BBC has approached the east Libyan authorities for comment on those allegations, but has not received a response.\nAdditional reporting by Ali Al Gomati, Mark Shea and Florence Dixon.\n'An unimaginable scene': Survivors describe Libya floods\nWhy the Libyan port floods were so catastrophic\nBodies left unrecognisable by Libya's floods\nDrone footage shows extent of Derna destruction\nLibyan official rejects blame for flood disaster\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Keith Richards: Arthritis changed my guitar-playing", "date": "2023-10-10 00:55:17", "text": "If there's one constant in the story of the Rolling Stones, it's Keith Richards' love affair with the guitar.\nHe owns more than a thousand of them - although he only plays a select few on stage - and, even as he approaches 80, the star is still bewitched by the instrument.\n\"The fascinating thing is that the more you play it, the less you know it,\" he says. \"It provides you with endless questions. You can never know the whole thing. It's impossible.\"\nHe's back on fiery form on the Rolling Stones' new album, Hackney Diamonds. There are hard-rocking riffs (Angry, Depending On You), sinewy country blues (Dreamy Skies) and semi-improvised gospel stomps (Sweet Sounds Of Heaven).\nBut while the Stones sound ageless as ever, Richards' hands are gnarled with arthritis. Has it affected his playing?\n\"Funnily enough, I've no doubt it has, but I don't have any pain, it's a sort of benign version,\" he says. \"I think if I've slowed down a little bit it's probably due more to age. \n\"And also, I found that interesting, when I'm like, 'I can't quite do that any more,' the guitar will show me there's another way of doing it. Some finger will go one space different and a whole new door opens. \n\"And so you're always learning. You never finish school, man.\"\nHackney Diamonds is the Rolling Stones' first album of new material in 18 years. Not that they'd been resting on their laurels. Sessions had come and gone, tours had been staged, a covers album released. But, for whatever reason, the band weren't happy with the material.\n\"There's a lot of stuff in the can which is pretty damn good,\" says Keith, \"but it's not an album. It's just a lot of tracks.\"\nThe turning point came at the end of the band's 60th anniversary tour last year. Rather than retreat to their individual bunkers, Mick Jagger wanted to go straight to the studio. \n\"He hit me in the right spot,\" says Richards. \"I've always wanted to record the band as soon after we get off of the road, because the band is lubricated.\"\nWhere previous sessions had been exploratory and unfocused, these recordings came with a deadline: Jagger wanted the basic tracks finished by the end of the year. \nHe was helped by producer Andrew Watt, a 32-year-old who has made pop hits for Post Malone and Miley Cyrus, and overseen grizzled rock rebirths for Iggy Pop and Ozzy Osbourne.\nA massive Rolling Stones fan (he wore a different band t-shirt every day), he was nonetheless determined not to defer to his heroes.\n\"We had a referee, which is something we lacked since the Jimmy Miller days,\" says Ronnie Wood, referring to the producer of 1970s classics like Sticky Fingers and Exile On Main Street (both of which pre-date his time in the band). \n\"We needed someone tightening up and kicking us. He disciplined us and said, 'Come on, you're not going to do that tomorrow, you're going to do it today'.\"\n\"I can understand Ronnie seeing it that way but the real referees are Mick and me,\" argues Richards.\n\"Andrew just had the right amount of energy and the right amount of know-how to pull it off.\"\nJagger and Richards have always been the lifeblood of the Rolling Stones. Or, more accurately, its Id and its Ego. Jagger is watchful, analytical, strategic. Richards runs on instinct.\nThey first met at primary school in Kent in the 1950s, then bumped into each other years later on a railway platform. Jagger was carrying a bundle of records, Richards was holding his guitar, and the two struck up a conversation about rock and blues on the train.\nWithin a year they'd joined a band with guitarist Brian Jones, and Richards wrote excitedly to his aunt: \"Mick is the greatest R&B singer this side of the Atlantic and I don't mean maybe.\"\nIn their original incarnation, the Rolling Stones were a cover band, scoring hits with scuffed-up versions of Buddy Holly's Not Fade Away and Howlin' Wolf's Little Red Rooster. \nBut their manager, Andrew Loog Oldham, realised everyone would make more money if they wrote their own songs, so he locked Jagger and Richards in a kitchen and told them not to come out until they'd got a hit.\nThe result was As Tears Go By, which was taken into the charts by Marianne Faithfull.\n\"Before that, I thought of songwriting as a totally separate job - like there's the blacksmith, and there's the stonemason,\" Richards later recalled.\n\"It was a shock, this fresh world of writing our own material, this discovery that I had a gift that I had no idea existed. It was Blake-like, a revelation, an epiphany.\"\nJagger disputes the kitchen story but, either way, one of rock's greatest songwriting partnerships had been born. \nBy the end of the decade, the duo had written dozens of classics, including Paint It Black, Sympathy For The Devil and (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction, the riff for which came to Richards in his sleep.\n\"It was a lucky find, I must admit,\" he told me the last time we spoke.\nThe sessions for Hackney Diamonds captured the hit-and-run sessions of the 1960s. The band cut two or three songs a day, often playing next to each other as they do on stage.\nThe whole process was finished in two months - eight times longer than they spent on their 1964 debut, but still phenomenally fast by modern standards.\nThe album's title is London slang (Hackney Diamonds are the beads of shattered glass strewn across the street after a smash-and-grab) and while it doesn't appear in the lyrics, the phrase pinpoints the album's untamed ferocity.\n\"If I was a dog, I'd spend all night howling round your house,\" growls Jagger over the saw-tooth riff of Bite My Head Off.\nEven the song titles suggest a deep well of antagonism and resentment: Angry, Driving Me Too Hard, Live By The Sword. \nRichards can't or won't explain the inspiration, arguing that \"Mick writes the lyrics\".\n\"But he's got some angst in him and I said, 'Well, let's use it',\" he adds. \n\"From my point of view, the essential thing about making a record is that the singer has to want to sing the material. \n\"Mick, given a song that he's not interested in, can really make it bad. And that's maybe one of the reasons it took 18 years, because Mick's waves of enthusiasm come and go.\"\nIf that's a dig at his bandmate, its meant jovially. \nThe bitterness that characterised their relationship in the 80s has evaporated. For this album, they even went back to basics, writing Driving Me Too Hard together in the same room.\nJagger says they still disagree occasionally, but have \"a good understanding\" of what the Stones' represent. For Richards, it's all a state of mind.\n\"We're very real guys, so when we start playing we all know, 'Yep, that's it', or 'No, that isn't it'.\n\"And if it feels phoney, then we have to watch ourselves.\"\nThat's why he resisted Jagger's attempts to steer the band towards punk and disco in the 1970s; and presumably why they've steered clear of more reflective material on this album.\nBut the record did present an unwelcome challenge: Recording for the first time without Charlie Watts, their stoic and dependable drummer, who died in 2021.\nHis playing features on just two Hackney Diamonds tracks, Mess It Up and Live By The Sword, initially recorded in 2019. For the rest, the rhythm section is provided by Steve Jordan, who Watts had anointed as his successor. \n\"I was with Charlie before he passed and he said, 'Make sure Steve Jordan covers for me. He has my blessing',\" says Wood. \"So that was a real comforting thing.\"\n\"Feeling like I'm carrying on Charlie's wishes makes it a little bit easier,\" agrees Richards. \n\"I will always miss the man dearly, but I know that if he was here today, he would be very happy to know that the band was continuing.\"\nElsewhere, the album has a glut of superstar guests, including Paul McCartney, Elton John and erstwhile Stones bassist Bill Wyman.\nBut the star attraction is Lady Gaga, who trades vocal hooks with Jagger on the soaring blues-gospel of Sweet Sounds Of Heaven.\n\"Lady Gaga is a piece of work,\" says Richards. \"I love working with her because she has a great attitude and a great voice, and I always wanted to see her play off against Mick.\"\n\"Stevie Wonder is on there as well, which is sort of thing only happens when you record in LA,\" he laughs, noting that the song was \"very ad-libbed... it even finishes and starts up again\".\nThat was their approach throughout. The whole album is deliberately hand-crafted, recorded in real-time and non-computerised. \n\"I like real,\" says Richards.\"We actually cut this record primarily for vinyl. It's by far the best sound, if you want to listen to a record properly. \n\"Digital is toy town. It's synthesizers. And now you have AI, which is even even more superficial and artificial. Vinyl gives you what's real and I prefer to hear it that way.\"\nThe last track is the perfect example - just Mick and Keith standing around a microphone, riffing on the Muddy Waters song that gave the band its name, Rolling Stone Blues.\nIt could be the closing of a book, an epilogue to a 60-year career, but Richards is having none of it.\n\"It's a fitting statement, but it's not a coda,\" he protests. \"It's more a tip of the hat to Muddy Waters, Chicago and all the blues men we learned our stuff from.\"\nIn fact, rather than waving goodbye, the band are plotting to take their new music on the road next year, \"if everybody is still standing\".\n\"We're all in good fettle,\" says Richards. \"We're not looking at each other and saying, 'time's up'. \nIs that a phrase he could ever imagine uttering?\n\"My answer is I'm not Nostradamus,\" he chuckles. \"Of course it's going to end some time, but there's no particular rush. \n\"We're having great fun doing this.\"\nRolling Stones announce new album in Hackney\n'I'll celebrate the Stones' 60th in a wheelchair'\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "President Biden interviewed over handling of classified files", "date": "2023-10-10 01:30:10", "text": "US President Joe Biden has been interviewed as part of a probe into his handling of classified documents after he left the vice-presidency in 2017.\nMr Biden met voluntarily with Special Counsel Robert Hur at the White House over two days, officials said.\nMr Hur was appointed after a separate investigation was launched into secret documents found at Donald Trump's home. \nMr Biden has not been charged with any crime. It is not unusual for presidents to be interviewed by investigators.  \nIan Sams, a spokesman for Mr Biden, said in a statement that the interview was conducted over the course of Sunday and Monday. \nIt was personally carried out by Mr Hur, who was chosen by US Attorney General Merrick Garland to lead the investigation. He added that the interview had \"concluded\" by the end of Monday. \n\"As we have said from the beginning, the President and the White House are cooperating with this investigation, and as it has been appropriate, we have provided relevant updates publicly, being as transparent as we can consistent with protecting and preserving the integrity of the investigation,\" Mr Sams told reporters. \n\"We would refer other questions to the Justice Department at this time.\"\nThe documents were discovered by aides to Mr Biden in an office he used after departing the vice-presidency, and before he launched his bid for the White House.  \nThis video can not be played\nWatch: How much do you know about classified documents?\nThe first batch of classified documents had been found on 2 November at the Penn Biden Center, a think-tank the president founded in Washington DC.\nA second batch of records was found on 20 December in the garage at his Wilmington home, while another document was found in a storage space at the house on 12 January, his lawyers said at the time.\nAfter finding the documents, the president said his team immediately turned them over to the National Archives and the Justice Department. It is not clear why Mr Biden had kept them.\nUnder the Presidential Records Act, White House records are supposed to go to the National Archives once an administration ends, where they can be stored securely.\nMr Biden has previously said that he did not know the documents were there. \nAuthorities have not said what the files relate to. Classified documents can cover a range of issues, from the relatively mundane to the extremely secretive. \nBut sources have previously told CNN and the New York Times that the first set of 10 classified documents included briefing materials on foreign countries - including Ukraine, Iran and the United Kingdom - from Mr Biden's time as vice-president.\nAnd according to CNN, these documents were mixed in with other non-classified papers, including details about the funeral of Beau Biden, the president's son, who died in 2015.\nIt also reported that some of the documents were labelled as top secret, the highest level of classification.\nThe interview took place amid dramatic tensions in the Middle East and had been scheduled months earlier, the New York Times reported, citing an unnamed White House official. \nThe conclusion of the interview could be a sign that the investigation may be nearing its end. Mr Hur's team has yet to decide whether to bring charges against Mr Biden. \nIn a separate and wider-range investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith is bringing charges against Mr Trump for allegedly retaining highly-sensitive government documents at his Florida home and golf resort after leaving office. \nMr Trump is facing seven charges related to the documents, including wilfully retaining national defence secrets in violation of the Espionage Act and attempting to obstruct the official investigation.\nHe has repeatedly claimed it was his right to keep the documents, and is set to go on trial in Miami in May. \nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Biden cooperating with classified document review\nHow Trump, Biden and Clinton cases compare\nFour unanswered questions about the Biden documents\nDonald Trump took US nuclear secrets, charges say\nBiden 'surprised' about classified files discovery\nCould Donald Trump go to prison over secret files?\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Pressure on nature threatens many flowering plants with extinction", "date": "2023-10-10 03:37:53", "text": "Forty-five per cent of the world's known flowering plants could be threatened by extinction, scientists have warned.\nThose under threat include orchids, varieties of pineapple, and many important crop species.\nOf the nearly 19,000 new plants and fungi species discovered since 2020, 77% are thought to be endangered.\nThe study by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, examined research by 200 scientists in 30 countries.\nPlants underpin every aspect of humanity, said Dr Matilda Brown, conservation specialist at RBG Kew.\nBut they are increasingly threatened by climate change and biodiversity loss.\n\"When we consider that nine out of ten of our medicines come from our plants, what we are potentially staring down the barrel at is losing half of all of our future medicines,\" Dr Brown said. \n\"Every species we lose is a species that we don't know what opportunities we're losing … It could be a cancer fighting drug, it could be the solution to hunger … And so to lose that, before we get a chance to study it would be a tragedy.\"\nResearchers cross-referenced large data samples from the World Checklist of Vascular Plants, the most comprehensive database of plants currently available, with the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. They drew up a series of extrapolated predictions about the risk of extinction.\nAnalysis of the data also suggests there may be 2.5m species of fungi in the world - with 90% yet to be discovered.\nThere is a backlog of around 100,000 new species of plants found by botanists that are still to be formally classified. The Kew team says these should be automatically described as threatened unless proven otherwise.\nAmong recent discoveries are the world's largest giant waterlily (Victoriana boliviana) and the Queen's hedgehog mushroom (Hydnum reginae).\nThe report also identified more than 30 global \"darkspots\" in countries rich in wildlife that botanists haven't yet explored and mapped. Many of these data sinkholes are in tropical Asia, including New Guinea and Vietnam. \nDr Samuel Pironon, from RBG Kew and the UN's Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre in Cambridge said: \"Knowing where there are most species remaining unnamed and unmapped, of which many are likely to be threatened, is crucial. It could help us refine our estimates of priority areas for conservation.\"\nThe report calls the fungal kingdom the \"next frontier in biodiversity science.\" \nScientists analysed environmental DNA from soil samples around the world and studied collections using genomics and machine learning. Only 155,000 species of fungi have so far been named. \nFungi's potential is only starting to be understood, for example its ability to consume plastic and its \"language\" decoded by its electrical signals. \nFungi can do anything, said Kew mycologist Ester Gaya. \n\"They have amazing compounds, chemicals that can be used for industry, for drug discovery. But we know very little because we only know less than 10% of them. So what happens with the other 90%? There may be amazing resources there that we haven't discovered yet,\" she said.\nThe report draws on the realisation of what it calls \"Darwin's dream\".\nKew scientists say the World Checklist of Vascular Plants is the most comprehensive plant database ever produced.\nIt was the result of 35 years of meticulous research by senior Kew botanist Rafael Govaerts.\n\"More than 160 years ago, Charles Darwin dreamt of a complete list of plant species from every corner of the globe. This has been my dream too, prompted by the rampant destruction of the rainforests and biodiversity in general that I witnessed as a student in the 1980s, and it's exhilarating to see it finally come together,\" he said.\nThe list will now constantly evolve, with around 2,500 plants named each year.\nOne in six UK species at risk of extinction - report\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

Or the handful of Labour activists milling about in the Revolution Bar, waiting for the start of what had been billed as a general election rally.\nIt did not take us long to realise our mistake and we were soon joining the much larger crowd at an upstairs bar in Revolution de Cuba, where organisers LabourList, a news website for Labour folk, had laid on a free bar and a packed programme of speakers.\nThere was a nervous buzz in the air - a sense that victory was within their grasp but that they could still mess it all up.\nMP Stella Creasey compared it to being 2-0 up after 70 minutes. Others spoke about the need to avoid complacency. Labour's West of England mayor Dan Norris warned that although the Tories were \"hated\", it was \"not correct to say Labour is loved - we have work to do\".\nThere was some call and response (\"are we going to win? Yes!\") and much jubilation about last week's Rutherglen by-election victory and anticipation of more by-election success to come.\nLabour MP Barry Gardiner got the crowd going with some old school Tory-bashing and a few risque jokes.\nFellow MP and shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock laid into the \"clown show that is currently governing our country\" who he said had \"debased our politics\" at their conference last week in Manchester.\nThere was talk about how this year's conference was \"buzzing\", with up to 17,000 attendees - in stark contrast the Tories' \"car crash\" gathering.  \nBut several speakers began by saying it was wrong to say Labour had no policies  - just look at their National Policy Forum programme - and then stressed that a Labour government would be different to the Tories, and would truly transform lives.\nLabour conference rallies during the Jeremy Corbyn years tended be wilder affairs - but the majority of Corbyn supporters have now drifted off to their own parallel event, the World Transformed. \nThe ones that remain must feel they have also turned up at the wrong revolution.\n\"It's quite a different crowd this year,\" said Bert Jones, a Labour councillor from Redbridge in London, as he was leaving the LabourList event. \"I find it business-like.\"\nHe said he had \"stuck his neck out for Corbyn\" at his local Labour branch - but was now a Keir Starmer supporter.\nHe liked the \"non partisan\" atmosphere at the LabourList election rally, which made a change from the drama and divisions of the Corbyn years, although he sounded slightly wistful.\n\"You have to compromise to get into power,\" he said.  \n\"We are feeling really optimistic, there is definitely a change in the air.\"\nUzma Rasool, a Labour councillor from Waltham Forest, said: \"It feels much more driven, organised and on message.\"\nBut there was still passion - supplied by deputy leader Angela Rayner - and Ms Rasool and her friend Frankie Romer, from Harrogate were quick to point out.\nMs Rayner had been due to be star attraction at the LabourList rally, but she couldn't make it in the end. \nAs the crowd in Revolution de Cuba dwindled, the speakers kept on coming - dozens of Prospective Parliamentary Candidates urging other activists to join them on the general election campaign trail. \nFor this party, it can't come soon enough.\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Marshall Islands: The last country on Earth without a national football team", "date": "2023-10-10 08:02:52", "text": "\nLast updated on 10 October 202310 October 2023.From the section Football\nIt is the last country on Earth without a national football team. But for how much longer?\nThe chain of volcanic islands and coral-based atolls in the middle of the Pacific Ocean that form the Marshall Islands have long been associated, from afar, with a role as the host of US nuclear testing.\nNow it hopes to become an independent force in world football.\nThere is some way to go before such dreams can become a reality. \nAt the forefront of those aspirations - not only to create a Marshall Islands national team, but one which can be competitive globally - is Englishman Lloyd Owers. \nFrom Oxfordshire, with a coaching background that has taken him to countries including Canada, the USA and Sweden, Owers has been tasked with building the foundations that will deliver international football to the game's final frontier.\nIt all started in \"random conversations\" with the president of the country's football association, Shem Livai, following online coaching blog posts written by Owers.\n\"It started via emails, then it became easier to speak via WhatsApp because of the time difference,\" Owers told BBC Sport.\n\"Then it got to the stage where I was asked to put together a proposal alongside my own philosophy on how I saw the game growing.\"\nOwers, technical director for the Marshall Islands, made the 13,000km journey to the country for the first time this summer.\nThere, he oversaw the first football session for children led by the Marshall Islands Soccer Federation (MISF), founded by Livai in 2020.\nThe target, however long it may take, is for the nation of 60,000 to achieve Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) membership - before ultimately contesting global fixtures.\nFor the 33-year-old Owers, the opportunity to lead the ambitious project from its infancy was one he could not turn down.\n\"On a personal level it was the opportunity to be part of something that was as big as this; the only nation in the world without a defined national team,\" added Owers.\n\"But it was also the ambition of it. The federation wants to be part of the OFC, but also wants to eventually become a Fifa member.\n\"They don't just want to be playing against local countries, they want to be part of a bigger programme.\n\"We know we want to be part of World Cup qualifiers. We want be part of the OFC Championship, we want be part of mainstream football. \n\"I think in 10 years, if we keep going the way the federation wants to push their aims and ambitions, there's no reason that wouldn't happen.\"\nThe Marshall Islands were occupied by the US following World War Two and used as a base for nuclear weapons testing, but eventually became a sovereign nation in 1986.\nAnd while that association is one the nation is keen to move on from, Owers believes the American cultural influence is in part responsible for the increasing popularity of soccer on the islands.\n\"There's obviously nothing to hide from that because it's part of their culture, it's part of the history,\" he said.\n\"There's a fully functioning US military base in Kwajalein. It's part of their identity and, because it's very heavily US cultured, there is a lot of interest in sports such as baseball and basketball.\n\"But now with football, or soccer, because that has grown in the States, it has also grown on the Marshall Islands.\"\nWhile the fallout from US nuclear testing still impacts life in the Marshall Islands, climate change provides an immediate environmental threat - with rising sea levels an ever-present concern. \nIn the capital, Majuro, a national stadium surrounded by sea defences is under construction. There, the World Bank predicts a one metre rise would flood 40% of buildings.\n\"Over recent years there there has been a massive eye-opening realisation that the Marshall Islands will unfortunately lose a lot of islands - and by 2050 will lose most of the land,\" said Owers.\nIt is hoped, through football, the nation can draw greater attention to the impact climate change is having.\nWhen the MISF first announced its dream on social media, few involved - Owers included, could have imagined the positive reaction it would receive.\nThe nation has since revealed its first football shirt, which it is hoped the Marshallese players will wear during their inaugural match by July or August 2024.\nThe federation said it had been \"absolutely overwhelmed by the wonderful positive responses we have received from people all over the world\" to the shirt - the profits from which are to be reinvested into grassroots programs, infrastructure and training facilities.\n\"We were hoping but we weren't expecting,\" Owers said of the reaction. \"We had like 1,500 followers on Twitter alone within two or three days, unbelievable. We really didn't expect that at all.\n\"The initial process of getting involved was to help create an awareness for the country, which we've managed to achieve. The whole buy-in to the country's football has been amazing.\n\"For us, it was first about putting the country on to the map. We've done that - people didn't know where it was. \n\"If you look on Google Maps, it's a tiny little dot. When I went over a month ago it took over 40 hours to get there and, when you do get there, you realise how small the country is.\"\nThe kit design was produced by a competition winner from Argentina, whose idea was chosen from more than 200 applicants.\nThe vibrant blue and orange is representative of the national flag colours, while the patterns and stripes have cultural connotations and reflect the island's connection to the ocean. \nAccording to Owers, it has already been sold in more than 30 countries since going on sale in late September.\nThe next - and rather crucial - challenge for Owers is to establish a competitive squad of players to represent the first Marshall Islands team once the nation is ready to contest an international football fixture.\nTo achieve that, he plans to begin recruiting close to home, including from those currently playing on surrounding islands in nations with established club and national sides.\nBeyond that, progress towards building a sustainable infrastructure has already begun, with a league structure now in place and regular organised sessions available to children and adults each week.\n\"There's a lot of players in the surrounding islands,\" added Owers. \"We've got the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea - all of those nations who do actually play. Those guys are living on the Marshall Islands and they're helping to grow the game.\n\"First we will be competing against local nations who have similar aims - but our objectives long-term are a lot bigger than that.\n\"We want to be recognised by Fifa and we want to be part of the Confederation Games and Olympic qualifiers.\"\nNaomi Grimley travels to Austria to see the treatment in action\nA man who loved his country almost as much as he loved women\nBrian Cox and Robin Ince ponder the point when living things die\nIn 1978, the Amoco Cadiz tanker ran aground off the coast of France\n \n \n \n \n \nOnly three points separate the Premier League top four which gives all of them hope, says MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEverything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.\nThe latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.\nAnalysis and opinion from our chief football writer.\nHow to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK."}
{"title": "Chris Mason: Cautious Labour dares to believe it can win", "date": "2023-10-10 08:09:20", "text": "\"We need to be the smallest possible moving target.\"\nIt is a phrase I keep hearing here.\nAnd it is an insight into Labour's mentality at this conference.\nDon't create hostages to fortune. Don't score own goals. Don't create easy opportunities for the Conservatives.\nIt is a mentality that bears the collective weight, from the party's perspective, of a doom-laden history.\nWhichever way you look at it, Labour lose a lot of elections.\nIt is almost 50 years since Labour won an election without a leader called Tony Blair.\nThere are only four occasions since the Second World War where Labour have taken power from the Conservatives.\n\"Opportunities don't come along like this very often for the Labour Party,\" says one senior figure, with a splash of understatement, about the party finding itself - potentially - in a position to win.\n\"It is like walking a tightrope in a straitjacket. And trying not to fall off,\" says another senior figure.\nThis corner of Liverpool is a sea of cautious smiles. A party daring to believe it can win, but so aware it has thought that before - in 1992, in 2015, to pick just two - only to go on to lose.\n\"It is beaten-dog syndrome,\" as one shadow cabinet minister puts it. The party hears the word \"election\" and instantly fears history repeating itself.\nBut hang on, there is an understated confidence around too. \nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer is talking about wanting a \"decade of national renewal\". A decade. That implies winning two general elections, not just one.\nOne of the architects of New Labour, Lord Mandelson, is touring the conference telling anyone who will listen how much Labour has changed.\nHe claims the party has switched back \"from weird to normal\", a line that got a laugh in front of a room full of business leaders.\nThe description, which former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would no doubt regard as gratuitous and personal, came at a dinner of the City of London Corporation, which represents the finance sector.\nHe joked with his hosts that the Corporation was now \"almost to the left of Labour\".\nThe former powerhouses of the party under Mr Corbyn - those on the Left - are banished, vanquished, have even disappeared. Those still around the place say they are \"trying to remain relevant\".\nSir Keir's approach was described to me recently as being \"pragmatically radical\".\nIt is tempting to dismiss this kind of label as typically meaningless Westminster guff. Maybe it is.\nWhat it sought to articulate was a sense of moving cautiously - \"painting in the detail\" of policy ideas, as one shadow minister put it to me - while also sketching out a longer-term vision, which could amount to significant change.\nThe plans on housebuilding - and in particular new towns in England - could amount to this if they ever happened.\nThis video can not be played\nRachel Reeves: Biggest risk to economy is five more Tory years\nSir Keir's challenge this autumn looks like this:\nOpinion polls suggest the Conservatives are unpopular, even deeply unpopular.\nBut they also suggest plenty are not convinced by Labour.\n\"He needs to tell the country more about who he is,\" says a shadow cabinet minister. \"His is a story of aspiration. And we need more policies. Not the vague stuff, stuff we can sell.\"\nThis Labour figure, and plenty like them, will hope they leave Liverpool with this.\nThey know the election draws nearer.\nBut they also know it is entirely possible they gather again here in a year's time, and polling day has still not happened.\nThunderbolt by-election changes political weather\nStarmer unveils Labour's five missions for the UK\nKeir Starmer: Labour leader hoping for keys to No 10\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

Some days I don't have anything in the house whatsoever, it's getting really, really tough.\"\nMrs Adams described pawnbrokers as her \"lifeline\". She said they provided a quick and easy way to get the money she needed. \"If I got a loan out I'd be further and further in debt and I'd be back to square one again,\" she said.\nNathan Finch, managing director of the pawnbroker we visited, said he had seen an uplift in business due to the cost-of-living crisis and inflation. \"It's interesting that it's something that's not affecting one class - we are seeing it from people who are very rich to less so,\" he said.\nNew figures from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) showed £440m was loaned out to customers pawning goods in the year to June, compared with £351m the previous year. \nA spokesperson said: \"As people continue to face financial challenges due to the ongoing cost of living squeeze, pawnbroking may be a useful product for some to turn to.\"\nBut they added that the FCA was working to \"raise standards in the high-cost credit industry, including in pawnbroking, and we're holding firms to account for meeting them.\"\nMore information is available from the National Pawnbrokers Association. Consumer advice on pawnbroking is available from Citizens Advice and the Money and Pensions Service.\nA 2022 report suggested more than 350,000 people turned to pawnbrokers for money each year.\nThe National Pawnbrokers Association (NPA) said it was the only option for some people who could not get a bank loan - other than using loan sharks.\nBut critics have said the high interest rates and low prices offered for goods mean they are not the best option.\nThe MoneyHelper website, which gives free and impartial money guidance, said that although pawning goods can be a quick, cash-in-hand alternative, people usually only borrow a percentage of their items' value. \nUp to 85% of customers buy their merchandise back while 15% or more don't have the cash to do so, it said.\nGeoffrey Simmons began pawning his items six years ago \"just to fill the freezer\".\nSince then he has turned in around 40 items, ranging from £12 to £900. He said he has had to pawn \"nearly everything\" to remain financially stable. \nMr Simmons, who is on state pension, says after paying his bills he is left with just £20 to last him four weeks and describes pawnbrokers as a \"godsend\" for people his age. \nDespite consistently retrieving his items before the cancellation date, he is hesitant to pursue another credit card application after previously being denied.\n\"I know full well I've got jewellery indoors that if I need to pawn, these people will help me out.\"\nAdditional reporting by Jemma Dempsey.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\n'My tears over pawned jewellery'\n'We use pawnbrokers to be able to pay for food'\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

It has said it is assisting families but no evacuation is planned.\nThe latest official death toll from Israel is 900. Palestinian authorities say 260 have died in air strikes.\nHere is what we know about British victims so far.\nThe 20-year-old attended North London's JFS Jewish School before moving to Israel to serve in the military.\nIts headteacher said the school's community is \"devastated\" and \"heartbroken\" at the news of his death.\nHe added: \"Nathanel is fondly remembered within the school and we think of him with nothing but love.\"\nMr Young's funeral, held at Israel's national cemetery Mount Herzl, was interrupted after loud bangs were heard over Jerusalem.\nThe authorities had asked that no more than 50 people attend the open-air service so that it did not become a target for militants.\nIn the end more than 1,000 turned out and listened as Mr Young's younger brother Elliot pay tribute to him. \nBut when his sister started to remember him, an emergency siren pierced the tranquillity and prompted mourners to throw themselves to the ground, taking cover under trees and between gravestones. \nRepeated explosions could be heard. Some began reciting prayers, others began to video-call loved ones. \nAfter a few minutes, the alarm fell silent, and the funeral continued. \nBernard Cowan, who grew up in Glasgow before settling in Israel with his wife and three children, was killed in the attack, his family confirmed.\nThey said in a statement: \"We are grieving the loss of our son and brother, Bernard Cowan, who was horrifically murdered on Saturday during the surprise terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas. \n\"We ask for privacy at this time while we process this huge loss to our family, both at home and in Israel, and to the Jewish community in Glasgow where he will be sorely missed.\"\nSammy Stein, chairman of Glasgow Friends of Israel, said Mr Cowan - who was a grandfather - returned to the city often and regularly visited his peace advocacy stall in the city centre.\nHe told BBC Scotland that Mr Cowan lived \"metres\" from the Gaza barrier, adding: \"\"It was quiet, it was peaceful and it was in the country. He loved it.\"\nMr Marlowe was working as a security guard at the Supernova music festival, where 260 people were killed when it was stormed by militants.\nThe 26-year-old was reported missing from the event, which took place at the Re'im kibbutz around 3.7 miles (6km) from the Gaza barrier.\nHe also attended North London's JFS Jewish School.\nHead teacher David Moody said \"we have seen reports that Jake Marlowe is missing and we all pray that he is found soon\".\nThe family of Daniel Darlington have said they believe he is among those killed.  \nIn a statement posted on Instagram, his sister referred to him as Danny and \"baby brother\". She said he was killed at the Nir Oz kibbutz alongside a friend.\nShe wrote: \"Only days before he was riding his bike, laughing, taking photos of sunsets and enjoying life's simple pleasures.\"\nDaniel had intended to leave for Tel Aviv the day before the militants struck, she wrote, but had decided to stay an extra day to show his friend around the kibbutz.\nAre you personally affected by the issues raised in this story?

{"title": "Israel-Gaza violence: The conflict explained", "date": "2023-10-10 12:41:02", "text": "The Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel on Saturday, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip.\nAt least 900 Israelis are reported to have been killed, while dozens of soldiers and civilians, including women and children, are being held in Gaza as hostages.\nMore than 700 Palestinians have also been killed in the hundreds of air strikes on Gaza that Israel's military is carrying out in response. \nIt is also massing its forces along the Gaza border and Palestinians are bracing themselves for a ground operation.\nBritain took control of the area known as Palestine after the ruler of that part of the Middle East, the Ottoman Empire, was defeated in World War One. \nThe land was inhabited by a Jewish minority and Arab majority. \nTensions between the two peoples grew when the international community gave Britain the task of establishing a \"national home\" in Palestine for Jewish people. \nFor Jews it was their ancestral home, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the land and opposed the move.\nBetween the 1920s and 1940s, the number of Jews arriving there grew, with many fleeing from persecution in Europe and seeking a homeland after the Holocaust of World War Two.\nViolence between Jews and Arabs, and against British rule, also grew.\nIn 1947, the UN voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem becoming an international city. \nThat plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by the Arab side and never implemented.\nIn 1948, unable to solve the problem, British rulers left and Jewish leaders declared the creation of the State of Israel.\nMany Palestinians objected and a war followed. Troops from neighbouring Arab countries invaded.\nHundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out of their homes in what they call Al Nakba, or the \"Catastrophe\"\nBy the time the fighting ended in a ceasefire the following year, Israel controlled most of the territory. \nJordan occupied land which became known as the West Bank, and Egypt occupied Gaza. \nJerusalem was divided between Israeli forces in the West, and Jordanian forces in the East.\nBecause there was never a peace agreement - with each side blaming the other - there were more wars and fighting in the following decades.\nIn another war in 1967, Israel occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank, as well as most of the Syrian Golan Heights, Gaza and the Egyptian Sinai peninsula.\nMost Palestinian refugees and their descendants live in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.\nNeither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return to their homes - Israel says this would overwhelm the country and threaten its existence as a Jewish state.\nIsrael still occupies the West Bank, and although it pulled out of Gaza in 2005 the UN still regards that piece of land as occupied territory. \nIsrael claims the whole of Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The US is one of only a handful of countries to recognise the city as Israel's capital.\nIn the past 50 years Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where more than 600,000 Jews now live.\nSettlements are held to be illegal under international law - that is the position of the UN Security Council and the UK government, among others - although Israel rejects this.\nGaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist militant group that is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other powers.\nHamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas.\nSince then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and to pressure it to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. \nPalestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.\nThis year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis.\nThere are a number of issues which Israel and the Palestinians cannot agree on. \nThese include: \nIsrael-Palestinian peace talks were held on and off since the 1990s, but broke down in 2014.\nIn short, the situation isn't going to be sorted out any time soon.\nExperts have warned something like this could happen unless a resolution was reached but attempts to resolve the conflict have so far been unsuccessful. \nThe most recent peace plan, prepared by the United States when Donald Trump was president, was called \"the deal of the century\" by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \nBut it was been dismissed by the Palestinians as one-sided and never got off the ground.\nCorrection 21st June 2021: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the US as recognising Israel's claim to the whole of Jerusalem and this has been amended to instead explain that the US recognises the city as Israel's capital.\nFollow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.\nIsrael faces 'long, difficult war' with Hamas\nBowen: Israel blindsided by most serious attack in a generation\nIsraeli military launches major operation in Jenin\nGaza ceasefire holds after days of violence\nIsrael-Gaza ceasefire holds despite Jerusalem clash\nThe child victims of the Israel-Gaza conflict\nWhat is Hamas?\nIsrael country profile\nPalestinian territories profile\nWhy Jerusalem matters\n'We want peace between Israel & Palestine'\nGaza's only power plant runs out of fuel during Israeli siege\nOlympic gold medallist Retton 'fighting for life'\nAustralian Cheng Lei freed from China detention\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

They have six legs and can be dark yellow, red or brown.\nThey feed on blood by biting people, creating wounds that can be itchy but do not usually cause other health problems.\nThe insects often live on furniture or bedding and can spread by being on clothes or luggage.\nCross-Channel train operator Eurostar said it had not seen an \"upsurge in bedbugs\" on-board its trains. \n\"The textile surfaces on all of our trains are cleaned thoroughly on a regular basis and this involves hot water injection and extraction cleaning, which is highly effective in eliminating bedbugs,\" its statement added.\n\"Any reports on hygiene matters are taken very seriously and our cleaning teams, in addition to the usual cleaning, will also disinfect a train on request or as soon as there is the slightest doubt.\"\nIt said it had created a \"preventive detection campaign\" which was being \"stepped up in the coming weeks\".\nIn Paris, BBC correspondent Hugh Schofield described the infestation as being seen as a plague \"provoking a wave of insectophobia and raising questions about health and safety during next year's Olympic Games\".\nHowever, he points out that bedbugs increase over the summer every year.\n\"There are several factors, of which globalisation - container trade, tourism and immigration - is the most important. The bedbug - cimex lectularius to give its Latin name - is a domesticated creature.

Mr Sneider tried to make contact but \"we didn't hear from them\", he says.\nMargit's health is one of his main concerns. \"Margit is a very, very sick person. She has very bad Parkinson's, a lot of blood issues, and is diabetic.\"\nWhile Mr Sneider is certain his cousin and her two children have been taken as hostages, he says he is not \"100% sure\" about what has happened to Margit, Yossi and Yarden.\nHe described his cousin Shiri, a kindergarten teacher, as gentle and kind. \"She doesn't deserve this experience; nobody does,\" he said.\n\"I have no words to describe this.\"\nIsrael's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, has said \"between 100 and 150\" people are being held hostage in Gaza after being kidnapped from Israel. \nOn Tuesday, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said the families of 50 hostages had been notified by the military.\nThe armed wing of Hamas, the Qassam brigades, has threatened to execute one captive for each new Israeli airstrike on civilian homes without warning.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has compared Hamas to the Islamic State group and said his country is planning to deploy \"unprecedented force\". \nAsked about what he believes should happen next, Mr Sneider said he would support the decisions made by Israel's government and military. \n\"We are not dealing with people,\" he claimed. \"It's worse than animals; animals would not do things they're [Hamas militants] doing.\"\nWhat is happening in Israel, and why now?\n260 bodies recovered from 'horror movie' festival scene\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Myanmar: 29 killed in artillery strike on camp for displaced people", "date": "2023-10-10 14:03:37", "text": "At least 29 people, including children, have been killed in an artillery strike on a displaced persons' camp in north-east Myanmar, near the Chinese border.\nThe camp is in an area controlled by the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO), one of several ethnic insurgent groups which have been fighting for self-rule for many decades. \nAll the victims were civilians, a KIO spokesman told the BBC.\nIt is one the deadliest attacks in the 63-year-long conflict in Kachin State.\nKachin officials say the armed forces have scaled up attacks on KIO-run areas over the past year because of growing Kachin support for other insurgent groups fighting the military government. \nMuch of Myanmar has been embroiled in a wider civil war since a 2021 military coup displaced the country's elected government. The military has increasingly used air strikes against opposition-controlled towns and villages since seizing power.\nThe exiled National Unity Government (NUG) has blamed the junta for the attack on the camp, describing it as a \"war crime and crime against humanity\". \nJunta spokesman Maj Gen Zaw Min Tun denied that the military was behind the attack. \nHe claimed the army did not have any operations in the area and said the destruction was \"probably\" caused by stockpiled explosives.\nImages shared by local media showed bodies being pulled from the rubble and dozens of body bags lying side by side.\nThe attack late on Monday night happened in the Mong Lai Khet camp for displaced persons - on the outskirts of Laiza, the town on the Chinese border where the KIO has its headquarters.\nParts of the camp were destroyed by powerful explosions at about midnight, KIO officials told the BBC.\nFootage of the aftermath shows many houses obliterated and large numbers of casualties. \nKachin officials believe at least 11 children are among those killed. Fifty-six more people were also injured in the latest attack, 44 of whom had been taken to hospital for treatment.\nThe United Nations in Myanmar said it was \"deeply concerned\" about reports of deaths in the camp.\n\"IDP camps are places of refuge, and civilians, no matter where they are, should never be a target,\" it said in a statement on Facebook.\nThe British embassy in the capital, Yangon, said it was \"appalled by reports of a Myanmar military strike\" that killed civilians. \nThe area around the camp has experienced conflict for many years, as it is not far from the front lines, where Kachin troops in trenches face off against government forces.\nHowever, locals say that no fighting has taken place near the camp in recent times. \nIt is possible the attack was carried out from the air, but Col Naw Bu of the Kachin Independence Army said the group \"did not hear any aircraft\". \nAlmost exactly one year ago, the Myanmar air force used precision-guided bombs to attack an open-air concert at another Kachin base in the night, killing more than 80 people. \nThe Kachin Independence Army (KIA) - the KIO's armed wing - is one of the largest and most powerful insurgent groups in Myanmar. It has been fighting the central government sporadically since 1960 and consistently since a ceasefire broke down in 2011. \nSince the coup, the military government has viewed the KIA as a significant threat, as it has been giving weapons and training to some of the new insurgent groups which have formed across the country to resist military rule. \nKIA also has a long-standing alliance with the Arakan Army, an insurgent group formed initially in Kachin State. But since 2016, it has been operating in Rakhine State, on the other side of the country, where it has successfully challenged the military for control of much of the territory.\nThe UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said in its latest report on the country that it had found a \"seemingly endless spiral of military violence\".\nAung San Suu Kyi ill but denied urgent care - son\nDevastation from the air in Myanmar's brutal civil war\nGlobal firms fuelling Myanmar's killer weapons\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

Nike has confirmed they are Alphafly 3 shoes.\nKiptum completed the race in 2:00:35, beating the record set by compatriot Eliud Kipchoge in 2022 by 34 seconds.\nIt was an incredible achievement for someone competing in just their third marathon, and he now boasts three of the six fastest times in history.\nHe recorded a personal best of 2:01:53 on his debut in Valencia in December 2022 - the sixth-fastest time in history - and improved on that by 28 seconds when he won this year's London Marathon in the third-fastest time ever.\nThe women's Chicago Marathon was won by Sifan Hassan, who set a course record, also wearing Alphafly 3s.\nSo, what are these 'super-shoes' and how much of an advantage, if any, are athletes like Kiptum and Assefa gaining by wearing them?\nGoverning bodies have been trying to keep pace with advances in footwear technology over recent years and World Athletics updated their regulations in January 2022.\nIt released an 18-page documentexternal-link which stated shoes could not be used unless they were available to \"any athletes participating in applicable competitions\", while it also had technical requirements for the thickness of the sole.\nWorld Athletics has said the Alphafly 3s are on their \"approved shoe list - meaning it is compliant with our technical requirements\".\nNike's Alphafly 3 shoes, which are the upgrade on their Air Zoom Alphafly NEXT%2 trainers, have been ratified for developmental use by World Athletics until 3 December - Nike say they \"will be released for consumers in 2024\".\nThe weight of the Alphafly 3s is yet to be confirmed by Nike, but they feature stiff plates or rods embedded in the midsole, usually made of carbon, to help the shoe hold its shape and it has a curved midsole geometry designed to propel runners forward.\nThe Adizero Pro Evo 1s, meanwhile, weigh in at just 138g and are \"40% lighter than any other racing super-shoe Adidas has ever created\".\nAdidas say they feature \"a revamped geometry with a first-of-its-kind forefoot rocker, placed at 60% of the length of the shoe, to trigger forward momentum and improve running economy\".\nKipchoge is a name synonymous with long-distance running.\nHe won marathon Olympic gold in 2016 and repeated the feat in 2020, while he set a world record in 2018 - one minute 18 seconds quicker than the previous best set four years earlier.\nKipchoge made history in 2019 when he became the first person to complete a marathon in under two hours - finishing the Ineos 1:59 Challenge in 1:59:40, in Vienna, Austria.\nThat time, however, was not recognised as the official marathon world record because it was not in open competition, Kipchoge used a team of 41 pacemakers and had a bike delivering hydration throughout.\nNow aged 38, Kipchoge's record-breaking days might be behind him but he was the trailblazer, especially when it comes to the introduction of high-tech trainers.\nKipchoge was wearing the first version of Nike's Alphafly prototype shoes when he clocked under two hours in Austria, and World Athletics subsequently banned athletes from wearing them in January 2020, claiming they were \"distorting the record books\".\nHe also wore Alphafly 3s when he won the Berlin Marathon for the fifth time two weeks ago.\nAs the past fortnight has demonstrated, marathons are becoming as much about brands as they are the runners.\nTwo of the biggest hitters in sportswear, Adidas and Nike, are battling to be involved with the first athlete to break the magic two-hour mark in a marathon.\nDr Thomas Allen, senior lecturer in sports engineering at Manchester Metropolitan University Institute of Sport, told BBC Sport: \"It's important to not take it away from the athletes. \n\"They are improving with training techniques, nutrition and support from sponsors. All of this contributes. \n\"The shoes are helping but it's just a small improvement. Athletes have to be very good but there is evidence to say the shoes are helping. Many athletes are wearing these advanced shoes.\"\nAdidas boasted about their athlete Assefa making history in Germany, and Nike were quick to post on social media after Kiptum's success on Sunday.\nThe women's Chicago Marathon was won by Hassan, who set a course record wearing Alphafly 3s.\nFormer Great Britain long-distance runner Richard Nerurkar told BBC Sport: \"The shoe technology that has come in in the last five years has made a huge difference in terms of how fast people are running. So we can't deny that. \n\"But marathon running is a very, very tough sport, so to run fast or to run very fast or to break world records you've got to train incredibly hard.\n\"Kiptum who broke the world record in Chicago and Assefa who broke the world record two weeks ago in Berlin, they have to be applauded for their hard work in training. Some people would say it's the shoes and the shoes alone, but I would say it's a combination of a lot of hard work and obviously shoe technology.\"\nThe pursuit of becoming the first person to complete an officially ratified marathon in under two hours will continue to gain pace, especially with the 2024 Paris Olympics on the horizon.\n\"We're at a point where it might come soon,\" Dr Allen said.\n\"As soon as it gets this close, everyone is talking about it and everyone wants to be that person to do it, so it puts that extra little push behind everyone.\"\nKipchoge was 34 when he first broke the marathon world record, winning the 2018 race in Berlin, which suggests 23-year-old Kiptum has time on his side.\nWorld Athletics told the BBC: \"It is also important to note that beyond shoe technology, world records are simply evolving with the times. \n\"Throughout the history of our sport, world records were always set with the best technology available at the time, it is no different today. \n\"In addition to shoes, there are many factors which contribute to the constant improvement of athletic performances in our sport, including enhanced coaching techniques, more competitions and opportunities for our athletes to challenge their limits, refined courses which optimise running conditions, multiple pace makers and food integrators.\"\nNaomi Grimley travels to Austria to see the treatment in action\nA man who loved his country almost as much as he loved women\nBrian Cox and Robin Ince ponder the point when living things die\nIn 1978, the Amoco Cadiz tanker ran aground off the coast of France\n \n \n \n \n \nOnly three points separate the Premier League top four which gives all of them hope, says MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}
{"title": "Spain's Hermoso says image tarnished by Rubiales World Cup kiss", "date": "2023-10-10 14:55:44", "text": "Spanish TV has broadcast World Cup winner Jenni Hermoso's statement to prosecutors, where she says Spain's ex-football chief kissed her on the lips after the final without her consent.\nThis is the first time that Ms Hermoso's account has been heard in her own words, and she tells the prosecutors that \"clearly I felt disrespected\" as a player and a person.\nLuis Rubiales has denied sexually assaulting and coercing the footballer.\nHe eventually resigned over the outcry.\nAn investigating judge is now carrying out a preliminary investigation to decide whether the accusations should go to trial. The National Court has since increased the scope of its inquiry to include other officials in the Spanish football federation (RFEF).\nIn her statement, recorded in the prosecutors' office early in September and broadcast by commercial channel Telecinco, Ms Hermoso complains that her image has been tarnished by the Spanish Football Federation. \"As an employee of that federation, no-one protected me,\" she said.\nShe recounts what happened as Spain's players celebrated winning the Women's World Cup in Sydney, Australia, last August, when their victory became overshadowed by the federation president's kiss.\nShe describes hugging Luis Rubiales and telling him: \"We've done it.\" She then says he told her the victory was \"thanks to her\", put his hands on her head and kissed her on the lips, and that she remembers nothing else.\n\"I didn't expect it,\" she is heard saying. \"I didn't do anything to land myself in that situation... how could I expect it in that scenario of a medal ceremony at a World Cup final?\"\nAt one point in her testimony, Ms Hermoso breaks down when she explains the pressure she has since come under, to the extent of \"having to leave Madrid so as to avoid that pressure\".\nMs Hermoso, 33, recalls immediately telling team-mates Alexia Putellas and Irene Paredes what had happened in the stadium, but that she had been careful to avoid doing anything to steal the limelight.\nHowever, even before the team left the stadium, she says football federation officials approached her and then asked her to get off the team bus during the journey to sign a press statement for the world's media indicating the kiss was mutual. \n\"I didn't say a single word of that text,\" she said. \"I felt coerced again.\"\nAsked about a video that appeared showing her team-mates joking about the kiss on the bus, she said only a few of them had seen the images and there was no way she could have gone to \"start crying in the corner\" to break the mood of celebration.\nMs Hermoso is also heard explaining how Luis Rubiales approached her on the plane home, asking her to appear in a video with him, for the sake of his two daughters who were crying.\nWhen the former federation president resigned last month, he maintained the kiss was mutual and consensual and had faith that the truth would prevail.\nMonday night's broadcast came hours before former team coach Jorge Vilda appeared on Tuesday before a judge investigating whether he was part of an attempt to exert pressure on the Spain forward to say the kiss was consensual.\nMr Vilda has denied seeking to coerce Ms Hermoso and argues that he did not witness the kiss, because he was at the back of the group receiving their winners' medals. \nHowever, he has admitted speaking to her brother on the flight from Sydney to Madrid when he realised she was unhappy, Spanish media report.\nThe pressure from federation figures appears to have continued after the team returned to Spain. When they went on a celebratory trip to Ibiza, she says that two more officials became involved and sought to use her family and a friend to talk to her.\nThe RFEF's marketing director, Rubén Rivera, was also due to appear before the judge on Tuesday. He too has denied trying to persuade the footballer or her brother to absolve Luis Rubiales from any blame, reports say.\nLast month, Ms Hermoso, who is a native of Madrid, returned to Mexican club Pachuca, where she has become an important figure in Mexico's Liga MX.\nRubiales given restraining order over World Cup kiss\nThe kiss that shook Spanish & global football\nSpanish FA president Rubiales resigns over Hermoso kiss\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Warning AI industry could use as much energy as the Netherlands", "date": "2023-10-10 15:00:25", "text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) industry could consume as much energy as a country the size of the Netherlands by 2027, a new study warns.\nBig tech firms have scrambled to add AI-powered services since ChatGPT burst onto the scene last year.\nThey use far more power than conventional applications, making going online much more energy-intensive.\nHowever, the study also said AI's environmental impact could be less than feared if its current growth slowed.\nMany experts, including the report author, say such research is speculative as tech firms do not disclose enough data for an accurate prediction to be made.\nThere is no question, though, that AI requires more powerful hardware than traditional computing tasks. \nThe study, by Alex De Vries, PhD candidate at the VU Amsterdam School of Business and Economics, is based on some parameters remaining unchanged - such as the rate at which AI is growing, the availability of AI chips, and servers continuing to work at full pelt all the time.\nMr De Vries considered that the chip designer Nvidia is estimated to supply about 95% of the AI processing kit required by the sector.\nBy looking at the amount of these computers it is expected to deliver by 2027, he was able to approximate a range for the energy consumption of AI of 85-134 terrawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity each year. \nAt the top end that is roughly the amount of power used annually by a small country.\n\"You would be talking about the size of a country like the Netherlands in terms of electricity consumption. You're talking about half a per cent of our total global electricity consumption,\" he told BBC News.\nNvidia declined to comment.\nMr De Vries said his findings showed that AI should be used only where it is really needed.\nHis peer-reviewed study has been published in the journal Joule.\nAI systems such as the large language models that power popular chatbots, like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, require warehouses full of specialist computers - called data centres - to work.\nThat means the equipment is more power-hungry and, like traditional kit, it also needs to be kept cool, using water-intensive systems.\nThe research did not include the energy required for cooling. Many of the big tech firms don't quantify this specific energy consumption or water use. Mr de Vries is among those calling for the sector to be more transparent about it.\nBut there is no doubt demand for the computers that power AI is mushrooming - and with it the amount of energy needed to keep those servers cool.\nDanny Quinn, boss of the Scottish data centre firm DataVita, said his company has gone from receiving \"one or two enquiries a week\" at the start of 2023 about using his facility to house AI kit, to receiving hundreds. \nHe also described the difference in energy use between a rack containing standard servers, and one containing AI processors. \n\"A standard rack full of normal kit is about 4kWh of power, which is equivalent to a family house. Whereas an AI kit rack would be about 20 times that, so about 8kWh of power. And you could have hundreds, if not thousands, of these within a single data centre.\"\nHe added that Scotland's colder and wetter climate provided a natural advantage in helping the data centres with keeping equipment cool, but it is still a huge task.\nIn its latest sustainability report, Microsoft, which is investing heavily in AI development, revealed that its water consumption had jumped by 34% between 2021 and 2022, to 6.4 million cubic metres, around the size of 2,500 Olympic swimming pools. \nProf Kate Crawford, who wrote a book about AI and its impact on the environment, said the issue kept her awake at night.\nSpeaking to the BBC in July, she said: \"These energy-intensive systems take enormous amounts of electricity and energy, but also enormous amounts of water to cool these gigantic AI supercomputers. So we are really looking at an enormous extractive industry for the 21st Century.\"\nBut there are also hopes that AI could help solve some of the environmental challenges facing the planet.\nGoogle and American Airlines recently found pilots could halve the amount of contrails (vapour trails) created by aircraft by using an experimental AI tool to select altitude. Contrails are known to contribute to global warming.\nAnd the US government is among those spending millions of dollars on trying to recreate nuclear fusion - the way the Sun gets its energy. \nSuccess here would be a real game changer, in the form of a limitless, green power supply. AI could speed up the research, which has been going on since the 1960s with very slow progress.\nIn February this year, university academic Brian Spears said he had used AI to predict an outcome in an experiment which resulted in a breakthrough.\n\"For 100 trillionths of a second, we produced ten petawatts of power. It was the brightest thing in the solar system,\" he wrote.\n'Brain-like' chip makes AI greener, says tech giant\nTiny data centre used to heat public swimming pool\nCan we make the internet less power-thirsty?\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Bird flu: Scientists see gene editing hope for immune chickens", "date": "2023-10-10 15:00:42", "text": "Researchers have developed gene-edited chickens that are partially resistant to bird flu.\nAlthough the birds are not completely immune, the scientists say their work shows it might be possible to block the virus in three years.\nThe latest results suggest that making further changes to the birds' DNA could produce fully immune chickens.\nCritics say gene editing tackles the symptoms of high-density farming rather than the root cause of animal diseases.\nProfessor Helen Sang, of the the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, said the team had made significant progress.\n\"We have got to the point where the results are very encouraging and we want to take this approach further.\"\nThe researchers identified three genes they believed were important for the bird flu (formally known as avian influenza) virus to reproduce in the chickens. They made two small changes to one of the genes using a technique known as gene editing.\nThe resulting chickens had no side effects after two years. They also had increased resistance to bird flu, but were not fully immune: half the chickens infected with a high dose of the virus developed an infection.\nAlthough any increase in resistance to bird flu should be welcome, only a solution that provides complete immunity can be used in practice. \nAny intervention that develops partial resistance would also encourage the virus to change in order to fight back and so, if the intervention were widely used, it would slightly increase the risk of another human global pandemic if a mutation made the virus deadly to humans.\nBut Prof Mike McGrew, also of the Roslin Institute, told BBC News that experiments in test tubes showed if changes are made to all three genes, then a fully resistant bird might be possible.\n\"When we did these edits in the cells there was no growth of the virus at all. The changes stopped all replication of the flu.\n''I am extremely confident that editing the three genes will give full immunity.\"\nThis video can not be played\nGene-edited pigs immune to lung disease were produced in Scotland\nGene editing involves making precise changes to DNA to change the function of a gene. In this instance  the three genes were altered to stop them helping bird flu reproduce, but in a way that did not harm the bird.\nThe researchers are trying to identify the further genetic changes required, before producing gene-edited chickens for the next phase of their research.\nBird flu is a major global threat, with a devastating impact in both farmed and wild bird populations. In the UK alone, the current outbreak of H5N1 bird flu has decimated seabird populations and cost the poultry industry more than £100 million in losses.\nWhat is bird flu and where did it come from?\nIt is thought to have emerged in intensive poultry farming in China in the 1990s.\nIn rare instances, mutations in the bird flu virus allow it to infect people and cause serious illness. \nPeter Stevenson, of Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) said the use of gene editing to tackle diseases in farms risked making it easier for animals to be kept in poor conditions. \n\"Highly pathogenic bird flu has not been caused by wild birds; it has been generated by the crowded, stressful conditions of industrial poultry production. The proper approach to bird flu necessitates a radical restructuring of the poultry sector to reduce stocking densities and flock sizes as well as to reduce the number of farms clustered together\".\nCIWF has supported the use of gene editing to prevent the slaughter of billions of male chicks at birth who are unwanted by the egg producing industry. The campaign group believes that the technology should be used only to reduce animal suffering.\nWork is under way across the world to develop gene edited animals that are resistant to disease and are more productive.\nParliament passed legislation earlier this year that permits the commercial development and sale of gene edited food. It opens the door for the use farm animals created by the technology, but a further vote in Parliament will be required, once MPs are satisfied that the animals will not suffer.\nThe study has been published in the journal Nature Communications.\nFollow Pallab on X, formally known as Twitter\nWhat is bird flu and what's behind the outbreak?\nGene-edited food now legal to be sold in England\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Eden Hazard retires: How former Real Madrid & Chelsea forward got stuck in 'miserable loop'", "date": "2023-10-10 15:32:53", "text": "\nLast updated on 10 October 202310 October 2023.From the section European Football\nFour years ago, Eden Hazard was flying high. \nSeven superb seasons with Chelsea, yielding two Premier League titles and the 2014-15 player of the season award, had established Hazard as one of the best players in the world and earned a dream £89m move to Real Madrid.\nExpectations in Spain were high, especially as Hazard arrived one year after Cristiano Ronaldo's departure to Juventus and at a time when Gareth Bale was out of favour with Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane. \nThey were very big shoes to fill, but 110 goals and 75 assists for Chelsea had demonstrated Hazard's ability to consistently excite and exhilarate at the highest level. Aged 28, he was theoretically in his prime, and the move to Madrid was supposed to signal a glorious conclusion to his career, filled with goals, assists and trophies. \nInstead, the opposite transpired.\nThe first alarm bells were sounded when Hazard reported for duty in Madrid looking out of shape, prompting speculation that he had used a rare summer off to celebrate his transfer a tad too enthusiastically. \nAfter missing the start of the season with a hamstring injury, he gradually started to find form. Hazard scored his first goal for Real in October 2019 in his first home start against Granada, and there were promising hints of a blossoming understanding with forward Karim Benzema. \nJust as Hazard was starting to approach top form, though, he was derailed by injury. A nasty tackle by Paris St-Germain defender Thomas Meunier during a Champions League game in November 2019 damaged his right ankle, keeping him on the sidelines for nearly three months. \nThen, shortly after he returned to fitness, the Covid pandemic struck. Hazard was again consigned to inaction, further frustrating his efforts to gain sharpness and rhythm in his new environment. \nAfter the Covid-enforced hiatus, Hazard did stay fit for the remainder of the 2019-20 campaign and played a bit-part role as Real secured the La Liga title. But his form was indifferent, and the rapid emergence of gifted young Brazilian wingers Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo meant his status as a guaranteed starter was lost.\nFor the next three years, Hazard found himself stuck in an increasingly miserable loop. He would give glimpses of his undoubted class, suffer injury, slowly return to fitness amid allegations over his levels of physical commitment, give more brief glimpses, suffer another injury... and repeat.\nBy the 2021-22 season, when Real triumphantly claimed a La Liga and Champions League double, he had become an afterthought. \nA forgotten man, Hazard was largely overlooked by boss Carlo Ancelotti as he started just eight games in those two competitions, scoring no goals and recording just one assist. \nThe final season was even more anonymous as Hazard tasted just 395 minutes of action, making his last appearance in a Real shirt on 13 May with a suitably uneventful hour during a 1-0 win against Getafe - no shots, no chances created, and the only goal coming after he had been substituted. \nWhen he subsequently left Real at the end of the season there was no fanfare, no recriminations, not really much of anything other than a sad acknowledgment that things just had not worked out. \nThe stats of Hazard's four seasons in Spain paint a sorry picture: 76 appearances (32 of them as a substitute), seven goals and nine assists. Perhaps even more damningly, he only started two games in the Champions League knockout stages and never played a single minute of a Clasico against Barcelona. \nNevertheless, none of this means that we should dismiss Hazard as a failure, because his career offers a perfect example of why nuanced analysis is generally more accurate than simple black-and-white condemnation or celebration. \nYes, Hazard's time in Spain was a let-down. But there are good reasons for that - he was never the same player after that tackle from Meunier, he had to cope with Covid confinement a few months after moving to a new country, and it is easy to understand how goals being outnumbered by injuries started to erode his confidence and motivation. \nWe also cannot forget that his time at Chelsea was truly spectacular. Aside from the omnipresent duo of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who cast everyone else in their unavoidable shadows throughout the 2010s, there were times when Hazard had a fair claim of being the best player in the world.  \nAfter joining from Lille in 2012, he quickly became a key player and helped the Blues win the Europa League in his first season.\nBetter was to follow, as he was named in the PFA Premier League team of the season on four occasions, scoring at least 13 goals every season except a disappointing 2015-16 campaign, and creating dozens more with his electric dribbling and astute eye for a pass. He was a thrilling player who Chelsea fans adored, and neutrals loved to watch. \nPerhaps, though, Hazard's career is best summed up by his exploits on the international stage. \nHe ranks fourth in Belgium's all-time appearance list and second in goalscoring - 126 and 33 respectively - and captained his country during a period of unprecedented success.  \nWith the likes of Kevin de Bruyne, Vincent Kompany, Thibaut Courtois and Romelu Lukaku for company, Hazard was the most important member of Belgium's golden generation which, for a while, was regularly considered a realistic candidate for major trophies and knocked out Brazil on the way to finishing third at the 2018 World Cup. \nYet Belgium never won anything, or reached a final.

{"title": "Ireland v New Zealand: Aaron Smith tells Irish to expect a 'totally different' All Blacks side", "date": "2023-10-10 15:51:28", "text": "\nLast updated on 10 October 202310 October 2023.From the section Rugby Union\nSaturday's World Cup quarter-final between familiar foes Ireland and New Zealand is rich in sub-plots, one of which is the quest for revenge on both sides of the fence. \nWhile Ireland are out to avenge 2019's quarter-final hammering by the All Blacks, the southern hemisphere giants are driven by the desire to banish the stinging memories of last summer's home Test series against Andy Farrell's side. \nIn that series, Ireland bounced back from losing the opener to win the remaining two Tests and triumph on a tour of New Zealand for the first time. It was a landmark achievement for Ireland and a dark time for the All Blacks. \nThe Irish did not stop there. With a 17-match winning run (which began with last year's 23-12 win in the second Test in Dunedin) and a Grand Slam in the bag, they are considered by many as marginal favourites to win the hugely anticipated knockout match in Paris and reach the semi-finals for the first time. \nAll Blacks scrum-half Aaron Smith started all three Tests against Ireland last summer. He would not go as far as to say he is thirsty for revenge, but he did warn Ireland to expect a \"totally different\" New Zealand in the French capital this weekend. \nHe also said New Zealand are treating Saturday like a World Cup final in a telling insight into how seriously they are taking this challenge. \n\"Last year matters in the sense of taking the learnings,\" Smith told reporters in Paris.\n\"But I believe we're a totally different team to July last year. We've got new coaches and as a group that series really galvanised us, and yeah, I can't wait for Saturday to see what happens.\"\nIreland went 111 years without beating New Zealand. They finally broke through in Chicago in November 2016 and have gone on to win four of the past seven meetings, including three of four under Farrell to signal a shift at the top of the game. \nThe Irish, however, have never won a knockout match at the World Cup, whereas the All Blacks have lifted the Webb Ellis Cup on three occasions and have only exited at the quarter-final stage once, in 2007.\nA second last-eight elimination certainly seems possible, especially given New Zealand's recent defeats by South Africa and France, both of whom are below Ireland in the world rankings. \nBut Smith, who scored two of New Zealand's tries in the 2019 quarter-final win over Ireland in Tokyo, insisted he is driven not by the fear of failure, but the chance to write a new chapter in his team's illustrious history. \n\"My energy is pushed towards more the opportunity that's in front of us,\" said the 34-year-old, who was part of New Zealand's 2015 World Cup triumph. \n\"The excitement of what we can control as a group.\n\"If you're held down by the weight of the past, you won't be able to do anything, you won't be able to play well, you'll be too scared to do anything, to try things, to trust your instincts.\"\nSmith, who made his All Blacks debut in a 42-10 win over Ireland in 2012, added: \"Being free, being energised with intent - and there's plenty of intent and want this weekend.\n\"I don't think there's the burden or the statistics or the weight on us like that. It's a final at a World Cup for us and we're ready to go.\"\nIreland's first two wins over the All Blacks were masterminded by Joe Schmidt. Now, as New Zealand's attack coach, the 58-year-old is tasked with getting one over on his former side, a sub-plot which has generated much interest this week. \nWhile Schmidt's six-year tenure with Ireland ended ignominiously with that 2019 quarter-final defeat, he laid the foundations for Ireland's success under Farrell, winning the Grand Slam in 2018 before claiming a series win in Australia. \nWhen asked how Schmidt has improved the All Blacks, centre Rieko Ioane said: \"Joe just sees the game in a very detailed view.\n\"Especially with us backs, his work in noticing trends in other teams' attack and defence is what separates him, and just the detail he goes into.\n\"For us, trying to find those one per cents can be quite hard, but with Joe he makes the view of the game a lot easier by the way he understands it.\n\"He's definitely helped us quite a bit.\"\nOn working with Schmidt, Smith said: \"He always has clips to show you if you ask, so you've got to be careful what you ask because it could cost you 20 minutes.\n\"But the last 18 months, I've really enjoyed connecting with him.\n\"He sees the positives in your own skillsets, so doubles down on that, and a lot of the stuff is around just effort.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNaomi Grimley travels to Austria to see the treatment in action\nA man who loved his country almost as much as he loved women\nBrian Cox and Robin Ince ponder the point when living things die\nIn 1978, the Amoco Cadiz tanker ran aground off the coast of France\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnly three points separate the Premier League top four which gives all of them hope, says MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}
{"title": "Supernova festival: How massacre unfolded from verified video and social media", "date": "2023-10-10 16:02:40", "text": "Warning: This article contains details that some may find distressing\nThe last videos taken before the horror began, show it was a festival like any other - young people, dancing at dawn.\nAccording to some accounts, there were up to 4,000 people in attendance. From the footage, they appear to be mostly under 30.\nThey had gathered in a remote area of southern Israel for the Supernova festival - an event that had promised dance, music, art and drinks at a secret location.\nTicket holders were told, nearer the time, to head to a site north of the Re'im kibbutz, about 6km (3.7 miles) east of Gaza. The party's organisers promised a \"journey of unity and love\".\nAnd indeed, there are many happy faces to be seen in a video uploaded at 07:22 local time, showing festival-goers laughing and dancing in the weak morning light. \nBut above their heads, small black clouds of smoke signal the start of the terror that is approaching. \nThey appear to be the plumes left behind by the defensive missiles used by Israeli military to intercept rockets fired from Gaza.\nIn the hours that followed, Hamas would fire thousands of rockets into Israel.\nBBC Verify has pieced together the events of the weekend's festival bloodbath using video and social media posts that we have verified, and facial recognition technology.  \nSome of the festival-goers can be seen in the same footage looking up at the dark wisps above their heads. Others are oblivious and keep dancing.\nIn another video posted shortly afterwards, the music has stopped. \nPeople are starting to evacuate the festival site - some look panicked, others duck for cover, and a few are nonchalantly heading for the exit.\nA short drive away at the Gaza barrier, the next phase of the assault is under way. \nIt's unclear how many minutes passed between the rockets starting and the gunmen arriving, but eyewitness accounts suggest it all happened very quickly.\n\"There were rockets, then they started firing. It was coming from different directions, and getting louder and louder,\" Gilad Karplus, 31, and working as a massage therapist at the festival, told the BBC.\n\"I saw people going down. As we saw that, we just jumped into the jeep and drove into the fields.\"\nAn Instagram story posted by one woman showed the rockets in the sky and people leaving the site. \n\"We went through a main road but after a minute someone started screaming that terrorists are shooting,\" she wrote to her followers.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Panic and fear as Israeli festival-goers run from Hamas gunmen\n\"But after two minutes, to the other direction [we] realised that there are more terrorists there as well.\"\nIt's impossible to know if the militants knew the festival was taking place at that location - but they would surely have heard the music reverberating across the quiet countryside.\nWe also know that, whether they found the site by accident or not, they came prepared to kill.\nGili Yoskovich told BBC News at the weekend how the militants \"were everywhere with automatic weapons\" and how she heard more weapons being unloaded from a van.\nAll the accounts suggest the camp was effectively surrounded and the roads in and out of the site were blocked.\nFestival-goers were running in all directions, but some were still within range of the gunmen.\nGilad, who served in the Israeli army, said: \"We pretty much knew they would probably block the road. I'm pretty sure a lot of people got killed on those roads.\n\"We drove into the field and tried to hide from them… afterwards we got a bit deeper into the fields and then they started firing sniper rifles on us from different places and also heavy artillery.\"\nAs he made his way towards what he hoped was safety, Gilad says he saw an Israeli military vehicle.\n\"We drove very slowly and once we got to it we saw it had been hit by an anti-tank missile or something like that.\"\nThere was no sign of the soldiers who had been in it.\nWhile some were fleeing into the fields and desert, the militants were methodically prowling through the festival killing on sight.\nDashcam footage time-stamped at 09:23, taken from a parked car, shows three of the gunmen who took part in the massacre. \nIn the opening frame of the footage a motionless body is seen lying curled up next to a car.\nA militant armed with an automatic weapon is then seen ordering a bloodied man out of shot to get to the ground, before grabbing him by the back of his T-shirt and leading him away past the camera's gaze. It's unknown whether he survived. \nAnd then the body by the car moves. The man, who appears to have been playing dead, stirs. He raises his head to see if the coast is clear.\nIt's a fatal error.\nSeconds later, another militant jogs into frame and shoots him in the head at point blank range and walks away.\nIn a later section from the same footage, a group of men appear. Only one is armed - they appear to be there to loot. They are seen rifling through the pockets of the dead man by the car, and going through a suitcase in another parked vehicle. But they find more than luggage. Two people, a man and a woman, who were hiding in a car are discovered and led away.\nThe woman who was taken suddenly reappears two minutes later. She jumps and waves her arms in the air. She must think help is at hand - by this time, the Israeli Defence Forces had began their efforts to repel the incursion. But seconds later she slumps to the floor as bullets bounce around her. We don't know if she survived.\nThe BBC has analysed the footage and ran still images of the gunmen who were visible through a facial recognition tool.\nIt matched one of the faces with images of a man in police uniform which were available on the website of Gaza's Nuseirat municipality.\nWe compared these through Amazon Rekognition software and got a similarity score of between 94-97% (some campaigners, however, have raised concerns that non-white faces can be falsely identified on facial recognition tools).\nThe BBC has verified footage taken from another car dashcam.\nWe can't know how many people were in the car or whether they had been to the festival. But we do know from the video that this car was on Route 232, 2.5kms [1.5 miles] from the festival site, and heading south away from it. It is time stamped at 07.39 local time - about an hour after the assault began.\nIt depicts the ruthless violence that festival goers fleeing by road could have encountered. \nAt the beginning of the video, there are already abandoned vehicles by the side of the road but it appears quiet. The car travels around a blind bend. Two fighters emerge from trees on the left hand side. One raises his rifles and begins firing at the windscreen.\nThe car keeps moving and more militants come into frame - at least four of them. They open fire too. By now the windscreen is shattered and the car is slowly drifting and veering, as if there is no longer anyone in control at the wheel. The shooting continues.\nThe car eventually comes to a stop when it crashes into the back of another stationary vehicle.\nIn the 33 seconds between the first gunman emerging, and the bullet-ridden car coming to a halt, at least 15 militants can be seen along the road. The ones who are fully visible are wearing combat gear and are heavily armed.\nThe road was a death trap.\nIf running wasn't an option, neither was hiding.\nAnother piece of dashcam footage shows a group of militants beating a man next to a roadside bomb shelter. At least seven gunmen are visible.\nAgain, we can't know if the man in the footage was at the festival, but the video is time stamped at 07.56, and we have verified the location was also on route 232, 1.5km [0.9 miles] south of the site at a junction in Re'im kibbutz.\nOne of the gunmen throws a hand grenade inside the shelter. They then move away to avoid the blast. The man who threw the explosive aims his gun for anyone inside who tries to make a run for it.\nOne man does. \nHe appears to be in his 30s and is dressed in shorts, a T-shirt and has a crossbody bag strapped to him.\nThe waiting militant can't fire in time. The fleeing man keeps running, out into the road and towards the fields that lie on the other side. Just before he disappears from the frame, he glances back. Over his shoulder, the gunmen are taking aim. There is a hail of bullets. One runs to the other side of the road for a better shot.\nWe do not know if the fleeing man survived.\nBoth of these pieces of footage show that for those who survived the initial onslaught at Supernova, the danger had far from passed. They were being hunted as they fled.\nAcross the festival site, these savage scenes were being repeated over and over again.\nMore than 260 bodies have reportedly been recovered from the site, according to rescue agency Zaka.\nMobile and drone footage lays bare the scale of the Hamas assault, with the roads leading to the sites strewn with cars which had failed to make it through the frenzy of bullets.\nThis video can not be played\nDestroyed cars line road near festival site in chilling video\nThe festival had become a warzone - and for some, the nightmare continues.\nHamas claim to have taken several hostages from the site, and the Israelis say about 100 people from across the country are being held inside Gaza. \nOne of the most harrowing videos to emerge from the festival is of a woman named on social media as Noa Argamani. In footage posted on social media by Hamas, she is seen being bundled on to the back of a motorcycle by militants crying and screaming, reaching out to a man who is being restrained. He watches on as she is driven away into the distance.\nThis video can not be played\nFestival-goer Noa Argamani was kidnapped while attempting to flee\nFootage purporting to show her alive in Gaza has circulated online but it's unclear if it is genuine.\nHer family, and the families of others abducted from the festival, await news of their loved ones - and it remains unclear how the Israeli government intends to get them back.\nAdditional reporting by: Shereen Sherief, Shayan Sardarizadeh, Alex Murray, Jemimah Herd and Alice Cuddy.\n260 bodies recovered from 'horror movie' festival scene\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\nBowen: Israelis, united in shock, rally behind war on Hamas\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

At one stage, \"everyone started running\" in the airport over a false alarm of an attack.\n\"People are very nervous, people are very defensive,\" he said.\nBA's website shows that its earliest flight to the UK from Ben Gurion Airport is on Monday 16 October and a one-way ticket costing more than £1,300. For the following Monday, a ticket is about £226.\nVirgin Atlantic and Israel's national carrier El Al - which is still operating two flights daily to London Heathrow and two to Luton Airport - have no availability on their UK-bound services until next week.\nSeveral airlines have introduced flexible booking policies and allowed customers to change travel dates for free.\nFlightradar24, a website which tracks flights, told the BBC many airlines had cancelled journeys due to safety concerns. But it pointed out that the airspace over Israel isn't closed, so the number of flights flying to or from Tel Aviv \"is currently down to individual operators\".\nDespite a dwindling number of direct flights leaving Israel, Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, urged UK nationals wishing to leave to use commercial transport, with no UK government evacuation currently planned.\nThe Foreign Office is advising against all but essential travel to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and against all travel to certain parts of the region.\n\"There are air flights, and of course there are land borders with friendly nations - with Egypt, with Jordan,\" Mr Cleverly said. \"If you seek to leave Israel we are working with the air industry and with Israeli air traffic control to maintain those flights.\"\nOne woman from London, who asked the BBC to withhold her name, remains in Tel Aviv along with her husband, another adult couple and 12 children.\nShe said the group was \"going through a lot of trauma\" and had been forced to search for places to hide when air-raid sirens had sounded. The children especially were \"shaking from fear\".\n\"I can't tell you about the fear we are living through,\" she said. \"We have been trying to contact anyone to get us home.\"\nShe said she had tried to called the British Embassy in Israel but had received no reply. \n\"We are very disappointed as we live in England and no one is willing to help us get back safely,\" she said. \"What are we supposed to do in this time of war?\"\nAsked if the government's policy on not currently facilitating an evacuation from Israel for UK citizens could change, Mr Cleverly said the situation in Israel was \"very fast moving\".\n\"I'm not able to speculate as to what might happen in the future.\"\nAdditional reporting from Rozina Sini.\nHave your travel plans been affected by events in the Middle East?

Retaliatory strikes on Gaza have killed 830.\nPupils at the Jewish Free School in Kenton, north London, have been told there will be no after-school detentions and wearing a blazer with the school's logo is optional.\n\"The most important thing is to ensure the safe passage of students between home and school and to make sure that this school is set up to care for our children during the school day,\" headteacher David Moody said in an email to parents.\nSuzi, whose 14-year-old son attends the school, said: \"The waves that are rippling through go beyond the school to the community.\n\"As a parent it's very hard because you want to protect your children, both emotionally and physically.\"\nHer elder daughter, aged 18, was a former pupil at the school and two years below Nathanel Young who was killed in the attack by Hamas on Saturday.\n\"He was walking the same corridors as her,\" said Suzi, whose full name we are not using.\nShe said that \"sadly\", as a Jewish community, they were used to strict security in communal places. \n\"This is just stepping up on another level because of what has happened.

{"title": "Cricket World Cup 2023: Dawid Malan delivers with century when England need it", "date": "2023-10-10 16:38:42", "text": "\nLast updated on 10 October 202310 October 2023.From the section Cricket\nIt does not take much bending of the imagination to picture a situation where Dawid Malan is not playing at this World Cup.\nHad Jason Roy's back not let him down, Malan may well have been on the sidelines - with England opting to stick with the opening partnership of Roy and Jonny Bairstow which took them to glory four years ago.\nEven with two one-day international hundreds this year - three by the time last month's home series against New Zealand was out - Malan may have been on the outside.\nInstead, he stood up when England needed him most.\nLast week's nine-wicket defeat by New Zealand in the defending champions' tournament opener was not definitive given the length of this group stage, but it worried England fans, who feared a World Cup defence was in jeopardy.\nWith 140 to set up a commanding 137-run win against Bangladesh, England's unfussy, unglamorous, run machine delivered. \nMalan does not have the chest pumping aggression of Roy or Bairstow, the once-in-a-generation elegance of Joe Root or the destructive power of Jos Buttler.\nStill, he proved the perfect man for the crisis. \nTeam-mates say Malan is the calmest man in the room.\nTo the media, he is different - never afraid to fight his corner, whether when speaking out in criticismexternal-link of England's system for awarding central contracts or in response to a gentle question post-match in Dharamsala about his ability to play spin.\n\"I think sometimes, people create a narrative of something that isn't there to support their writing or views,\" he said.\n\"It has always been there, sometimes you play good shots, sometimes you play bad shots.\"\nIt comes from a man whose career has had its world-beating moments and its misfortune too.\n\"I feel like every series I'm under pressure,\" he said. \"For me to keep silencing people is all I can do.\"\nMalan was dropped by the Test side after the 2021-22 Ashes defeat, despite only his captain Root scoring more runs.\nHaving fought to secure his place, he missed England's T20 World Cup final victory in Melbourne later that year with a groin injury.\n\"To miss out on that World Cup last year was one of the worst things ever,\" he said. \"Hopefully this one I can stay fit and we can play some good cricket and get into the business end.\"\nBut 50-over cricket has always seemed his best format - his ability to dig in, go through the gears or attack suggesting a man ideal for the job.\nStanding in his way, though, were Roy and Bairstow - statistically England's greatest one-day opening partnership - and, in Malan's original position at number three, Root.\nHe was not part of the victory four years ago, but now, the age of 36, has finally secured that place in the XI.\n\"I've wanted to be part of this team for so long,\" he said.\n\"It's been impossible to break into with the players that have been so good. \n\"So to get your opportunity and try and take it and enjoy it as long as it lasts, it's all I try and do.\"\nLast week against New Zealand, he played and missed at his first two balls from seamer Matt Henry.\nAgainst Bangladesh he did the same, this time against left-armer Mustafizur Rahman. \nWhat ended in a stodgy 24-ball 14 against the Black Caps turned into a first World Cup century five days on.\nThere's that calmness again.\nHe continued to flick Mustafizur for the first of three boundaries - his innings packed with flowing strokes down the ground.\nThe only point Malan showed obvious emotion was when he reached three figures. \nHe was punching the air before moving three steps down the pitch to complete a single. \nAfter doing so, he was embraced by Root - the man who had previously kept him out of the side.\nRoot himself batted supremely for his 82 as the pair shared a second-wicket stand of 151 in less than 20 overs.\nIt was his second fifty in as many games at the World Cup and took him beyond Graham Gooch as England's leading run-scorer in the tournament.\n\"He just never stops doing it, does he?\" Malan said.\n\"He's just so consistent. He's got such a good method of doing it. \n\"Even today he came and he changed the gears at certain times. \n\"And when I wasn't hitting the ball as well for a little period, he took the initiative on and changed the momentum of the game as well.\"\nThe form of Root and Malan will be crucial in determining whether England can defend their title.\nOne has seen it all before while the other has had to fight for his chance.\nBut the latter now has a T20 international hundred, an Ashes ton and a World Cup century to his name.\nNot bad for a man always under pressure...\nNaomi Grimley travels to Austria to see the treatment in action\nA man who loved his country almost as much as he loved women\nBrian Cox and Robin Ince ponder the point when living things die\nIn 1978, the Amoco Cadiz tanker ran aground off the coast of France\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnly three points separate the Premier League top four which gives all of them hope, says MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "}
{"title": "Holly Willoughby quits This Morning after 14 years 'for me and my family'", "date": "2023-10-10 17:31:42", "text": "Holly Willoughby has said she is quitting ITV show This Morning after 14 years \"for me and my family\".\nShe had been absent from the daytime programme since last week, when a man was charged with soliciting to commit murder over an alleged plot to kidnap the TV presenter.\n\"I have let ITV know today that after 14 years, I will not be returning to This Morning,\" she posted on Tuesday.\nHer statement didn't refer directly to last week's alleged plot.\nShe added: \"It's been an honour to just be part of its story and I know this story has many chapters left to go. Sadly, however, I now feel I have to make this decision for me and my family.\n\"I will miss you all so much.\"\nThe news also comes five months after the show was engulfed in scandal when her former co-host Phillip Schofield left after admitting lying about an affair with a younger colleague.\nWilloughby, 42, thanked everybody who has worked on the programme, writing: \"This is such a difficult goodbye, you are incredible and I forever will be proud of what we've done together.\"\nShe added: \"Thank you to everyone at ITV for being supportive. To every guest who has sat on our sofa, thank you.\n\"Most of all, thank you to the wonderful viewers. You've been so loyal, so supportive and the very best company every day.\"\nITV's managing director of media and entertainment Kevin Lygo said: \"We are sad that Holly is leaving This Morning, but respect her decision which we know will have been extremely difficult for her to make.\n\"Holly is one of the best loved, respected and most accomplished broadcasters in the UK.\n\"She has been at the heart of This Morning for the past 14 years, and she is adored by our viewers.\n\"Holly has brought her unique brand of warmth, energy, humour and fun to one of the country's most popular daytime shows, and everyone on the programme will miss her enormously.\n\"She remains a much loved member of the ITV family and we look forward to continuing to work with her in the future.\"\nThis Morning co-host Alison Hammond replied to Willoughby on Instagram: \"This is a very sad day! Love you.\"\nDermot O'Leary added: \"Nothing but love and respect for you and yours. X\"\nRegular contributor Vanessa Feltz wrote: \"We will miss you so very much my darling.\"\nWilloughby, who has three children with husband Daniel Baldwin, presented her final episode of the show last Wednesday.\nOn Thursday, she was reported to be under police protection at her home.\nGavin Plumb, of Potters Field, in Harlow, Essex, appeared in court on Friday accused of \"soliciting, encouraging, persuading, endeavouring to persuade or proposing to a third party\" to murder Willoughby last week.\nHe was remanded in custody to appear for a plea hearing at Chelmsford Crown Court on 3 November.\nWilloughby started out presenting children's programmes before being paired with Schofield to host Dancing on Ice in 2006, and then the long-running This Morning in 2009.\nThe pair's success led This Morning to win National Television Awards in the daytime, live magazine and topical magazine programme categories for 12 years in a row.\nBut this year it missed out, and she and the programme have endured a turbulent spell.\nThe hosts faced criticism after they were accused of jumping a queue to view the coffin of the late Queen Elizabeth last September, and then Schofield's affair put the show in crisis in May.\nWilloughby said it was \"very hurtful\" to discover her co-host had lied to her about his relationship with a younger male ITV employee.\nThe fallout led to Schofield's departure from ITV and wider accusations of a toxic workplace on the programme.\nWhen Willoughby returned to This Morning after the furore, she addressed viewers directly, asking them: \"Are you OK? I hope so.\"\nThis Morning has been presented by Josie Gibson and Craig Doyle this week, with Dermot O'Leary and Alison Hammond among the show's other hosts.\nITV has not yet announced who will replace Schofield or Willoughby on This Morning, or who will front the new series of Dancing on Ice.\nThis Morning is now at a crossroads. The format could certainly survive with new presenters - but ITV could just as easily take the opportunity to do something new with their mid-morning slot.\nIt's unlikely the daytime show would be cancelled, at least immediately. That would leave a three-hour gap in the schedule which would not be easily filled. \nThe show is relatively cheap to make and the core format - recipes, agony aunts and celebrity interviews - is something that isn't dependent on the consistency of the personalities presenting it. \nIt's worth noting that ITV never replaced Piers Morgan after his exit from Good Morning Britain in March 2021. The programme has survived perfectly well for two-and-a-half years with a rotating roster of guest presenters, because ultimately it's the format of news and entertainment that people tune in for. \nHaving said that, if ITV were thinking of doing something different from This Morning, this would be an opportune moment to do it. The show has, after all, been on air since 1988. \nNow that both Schofield and Willoughby have exited, ITV could be tempted to shake up the brand, and launch a new programme - with a new title, new studio, new branding and new presenters - but with a similar format.\nWhat next for This Morning after Holly's exit?\nMan in court over 'plot to kidnap Holly Willoughby'\nHolly says she's shaken on return to This Morning\nWhat next for ITV, Holly and This Morning?\nWilloughby 'hurt' over Schofield's lies on affair\nWhat went wrong for Phillip Schofield?\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

We couldn't ask for more really, we're all really excited and really grateful.\n\"The donations have come in from all kinds of people but the most heartening to see has been people in the student community, members of our audience who just want to see us keep printing.\"\nJoe said the bulk of the donations will go towards printing costs and the rest will be used to invest in better equipment to help produce the newspaper.\nFormer reporters for the Student include Laura Kuenssberg, Helen Pidd, Gordon Brown, Robin Cook and James Kirkup.\nThe paper is currently run by a team of 25 volunteers and before the fundraiser the editors had looked at the possibility of seeking university funding.\nHowever, it was agreed that editorial independence was more important. \n\"Some of our most impactful reporting has been reporting on both the university and the students' association, not always in a positive light,\" Joe said.\n\"Being editorially and financially independent of both allows us to really give our audience honest coverage of what is happening at the university.\" \nStudent fears having to quit UK over marking boycott\nCrime prevention team will be out and about in communities - Sam Ainslie\nBusinesses in the running for Scottish Italian Awards\nIt's 'A Kind of Magic' as live music returns to town centre venue\nPaul Nolan: Tributes as former Craigmillar councillor dies - 'a legendary fighter and lifelong campaigner'\nFA chief Mark Bullingham: Critical the whole country feels involved in Euro 2028\nLabour plans next wave of new towns in pledge to build 1.5 million homes\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Labour conference: Six takeaways from Keir Starmer's speech", "date": "2023-10-10 18:02:24", "text": "This video can not be played\nWatch: Sir Keir Starmer pledges to “get Britain building again”\nHere is what we learned from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's speech to his party conference - which could be the last before a general election.\n1. He can handle a stage invasion\nSir Keir's speech got off to the worst possible start as a protester stormed the stage and doused him in glitter.\nHe recovered his composure fairly quickly, as the man was bundled from the hall by security shouting slogans about a people's democracy.\n\"If he thinks that bothers me he doesn't know me,\" said Sir Keir to loud applause.\n\"That's why we changed our party conference. That's why we changed our party.\"\nHe removed his jacket and rolled up his sleeves, which lent him a getting-down-to-business air, but it meant he had to deliver his entire speech in a glitter-flecked white shirt. \nHe reappeared on stage after the speech ended to pose for the cameras with wife Victoria, after being hastily brushed down by aides.\n2. 'Getting Britain building again'\nThe Labour leader has made economic growth his top priority - but to really get his point over, he spoke at length about building.\nThe phrase \"getting Britain building again\" was repeated throughout his speech. He declared \"we are the builders\", to cheers in the hall.\nHe also coined a new term for building homes on the green belt - Labour will build on the \"grey belt\", he said, meaning unloved patches of dirt and scrubland (or \"disused petrol stations\" as one of his aides described them). \nHe repeated his pledge to build 1.5m new homes. Labour claim they can get going with this quickly if they win the next election, through tweaks to the existing planning system. \nSir Keir's big policy announcement - building a \"generation of Labour new towns\" - could prove more tricky.\n3. This was a pre-election speech\nSir Keir was introduced to the stage as the leader of the Labour Party - not as tradition dictates \"our next prime minister\". \nLabour clearly wants to avoid triumphalism - and there were some tough messages on rejecting easy answers and choosing the \"hard road\". Not to mention a message to his critics on the left about reforming the NHS.\nBut he still wanted to send Labour election candidates home with a tune to whistle.\nAnd that meant his five \"national missions\", which we are told will be at the core of Labour's campaigning until next May's local - and possibly national - elections.\nIn case these \"missions\" have passed you by, they are: Getting Britain building again, \"switching on\" Great British Energy, getting the NHS \"back on its feet\", recruiting more police officers and \"tearing down the barriers to opportunity\" (this week's policy on further education colleges and making private schools pay VAT fund specialist teachers falls under this category).\n4. Labour is ready to fight rough\nLabour think they are on to a winner by linking Rishi Sunak to Liz Truss. In a speech short on gags, he got a laugh for this line: \"I never thought I'd say this but I'm beginning to see why Liz Truss won. Although I still think we'd be better off with that lettuce.\"\nBut there was a serious edge - and a clear hint that Labour is ready to fight rough when the general election is called.\n\"Trust me. Wherever you think the line is, they've already got plans to cross it,\" Sir Keir told delegates. \n\"They will be up for the fight. They're always up for the fight to save their own skin. And this isn't over. In fact, it's barely begun. So we have to be disciplined. Focused. Ready to fight back.\"\n5. Class is making a comeback\nOne key difference between Tony Blair and Keir Starmer is that the current Labour leader has never been afraid to talk about class. \nHe spoke about breaking the \"class ceiling\" and his own \"working class\" background, the \"pebble-dash semi\" he grew up in, and how his toolmaker Dad \"felt the disrespect of vocational skills all his life\".\nThis came as part of an attack on Rishi Sunak for \"levelling-down the working class aspiration to go to university\".\n6.  Labour sees Scotland as the route back to Downing Street\nLabour are still riding high on their resounding defeat of the SNP in the Rutherglen by-election, which the party leadership believes heralds a comeback in Scotland and a clear path to Downing Street.\nSir Keir re-announced Labour's plan to base Great British Energy - the publicly-owned clean energy firm he's planning - in Scotland. \nScottish Labour leader Anas Sawar and winning candidate Michael Shanks were the only Labour politicians to be mentioned by name in his speech.\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Holly Willoughby: What next for This Morning after presenter's exit?", "date": "2023-10-10 18:17:00", "text": "The last line of Holly Willoughby's statement on Tuesday announcing her exit from This Morning offers perhaps the best indication of the ITV daytime show's future.\nAs Willoughby informed viewers via Instagram that she would step down after 14 years, she recalled something the original hosts famously said about presenting the long-running programme.\n\"Richard and Judy said 'We only look after this show, it will always belong to the viewers',\" Willoughby noted. \"It's been an honour to just be part of its story and I know this story has many chapters left to go.\"\nThat very sentiment is the reason This Morning could easily survive despite losing both of its long-standing presenters in the space of six months.\nHowever, following the exits of both Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, the show now finds itself at a crossroads.\nSchofield left in May after reports that his relationship with Willoughby had come under strain. A week after his exit, he admitted having an affair with a younger male colleague and lying to cover it up.\nWilloughby's exit, meanwhile, follows last week's arrest of a man from Essex who was accused of plotting to kidnap and murder her - although the presenter did not directly refer to this in her leaving statement.\nHer departure marks the end of an era. Much like the programme itself, Willoughby has been a fixture in ITV's daytime schedule.\nDespite their fallout earlier this year, there's no escaping the fact that Willoughby and Schofield had fantastic chemistry, the kind which isn't easily replicated.\nSo what next for This Morning?\nThe format could certainly survive in its current form with new presenters - but ITV could just as easily take the opportunity to do something new with their mid-morning slot.\nIt's unlikely the daytime show will be cancelled, at least immediately. That would leave a three-hour gap in the schedule that would not be easily filled. \nThe show is relatively cheap to make and the core format - recipes, agony aunts and celebrity interviews - is something that isn't dependent on the consistency of the personalities presenting it. \nPiers Morgan is perhaps a relevant comparison. It's worth noting that ITV never formally replaced him after his exit from Good Morning Britain in March 2021. \nThe breakfast programme has survived perfectly well for two-and-a-half years with a rotating roster of guest presenters next to Susanna Reid, because ultimately it's the format of news and entertainment that people tune in for. \nThis Morning is in a similar position. Although Phil and Holly were great together on screen, a string of other presenters who have hosted the show in the recent tumultuous months have proved just as capable and popular.\nAlison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary have gone down well on Fridays, while Josie Gibson, Craig Doyle and Steve Jones have kept the show on the road since Schofield's exit and during Willoughby's summer holiday.\nAccording to recent tabloid reports, Ben Shephard - an agreeable host who goes down well with a cup of tea and a slice of cake - was on the verge of being signed to sit on the sofa with Willoughby as Schofield's permanent replacement. \nA new partnership would have brought some stability to the show as well as some continuity for viewers. Rescuing This Morning is still perfectly possible, but the network will have to rethink its strategy.\nHaving said that, if ITV had been wondering about doing something different with its mid-morning slot, this would be an opportune moment to do it. The show has, after all, been on air since 1988 and you could argue a refresh is due.\nAt last month's National Television Awards - which are voted for by the public - it failed to win a prize for the first time in 12 years. A reflection of the recent turmoil, certainly, but also perhaps that viewers were beginning to feel less loyal to it and its hosts.\nEven before this year's upheaval, Schofield and Willoughby became the targets of public ire when they were accused of jumping the queue to view the late Queen Elizabeth lying in state last September.\nWith their departures, ITV could be tempted to shake up the brand or even launch a new programme - with a new title, new studio, new branding and new presenters - but a similar format.\nSome critics may say the show isn't particularly important, that the news coverage of Schofield and Willoughby this year is disproportionate to the number of viewers who actually tune in. \nBut the ratings - roughly 700,000 viewers per day - are a bit misleading. That is an average for a programme that's on every weekday. \nSure, not many people sit down and watch every episode for a full three hours - but most of the British public catch a glimpse of it every now and again. The brand and name recognition for This Morning - and Willoughby - is extremely high.\nIt is, ultimately, a flagship programme for ITV, and bosses won't announce their next move without careful consideration.\nHolly Willoughby quits This Morning after 14 years\nMan in court over 'plot to kidnap Holly Willoughby'\nHolly says she's shaken on return to This Morning\nWhat next for ITV, Holly and This Morning?\nWilloughby 'hurt' over Schofield's lies on affair\nWhat went wrong for Phillip Schofield?\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "'A lot of adrenaline, a lot of unknowns': Reservists flock to join Israel's fight", "date": "2023-10-10 18:24:51", "text": "As Israel rushed onto a war footing on Saturday morning, young army reservists around the country were already moving faster than the military machine.\n\"From 6.30am, we were itching to know why we weren't being called up already,\" said Michael Goldberg, a 24-year-old reservist in Jerusalem.\nMr Goldberg had woken up early to a flood of videos of Hamas's devastating attack. He had only recently returned to Jerusalem, to visit family after moving to the US six months earlier. Watching the attack unfold, he knew instantly that he would not be returning to the US.\nInstead, Mr Goldberg began to pack underwear and socks, and make whatever other preparations he could to serve his country.\n\"I guess in most places, you wait for the call,\" he said. \"In Israel you start to get ready before it comes.\"\nIsrael is still reeling from Saturday's surprise attack by Hamas militants, who killed at least 1,000 people and wounded many more. In the few days since, the nation of more than nine million has called up a record 360,000 reservists to help respond.\nIsrael's army relies on an enormous reserve contingent, made up of civilians who have completed their compulsory national service but can be mobilised again for duty until the age of 40.\nOn Saturday afternoon, Mr Goldberg finally got the call he was waiting for. But he wasn't mobilised immediately. Sitting in his family home early on Monday morning, he was impatient to go. \n\"There is a tremendous amount of fear,\" he said. \"But you are also inspired in ways you have never been before. I realised that this is the defining moment of my life.\"\nMr Goldberg's eagerness has been mirrored across the nation and beyond. So many reservists have felt compelled to return to duty that Israel's El Al airline announced it would run extra flights to bring home those abroad. \nSome who have already joined up have complained that there is not enough kit to go around. And at some muster points in Jerusalem at the weekend, volunteers were turned back because their units were already over capacity, or still catching up.\n\"I drove one of my sons to the base today and they said we are not organised enough yet, come back in two days,\" said Alan Sacks, a Jerusalem lawyer and father of six.\nOf Mr Sacks' five sons, three had already been mobilised over the weekend. One was still trying to find a place. His youngest, aged 25, was \"very much in the hotspot at the moment,\" Mr Sacks said - working with a special forces unit near Gaza.\n\"Two weeks ago, Israel was torn apart, left against right,\" he said, referring to recent large-scale protests over controversial judicial reforms. \"And now you have all these reservists lining up together to go. It's an extraordinary transformation.\"\nMr Sacks was receiving updates via WhatsApp on Monday from his mobilised sons. He smiled with pride when his phone buzzed with a selfie from the 25-year-old, who had been able to communicate the least.\nThe nation's civilian military was \"fundamental to the existence of Israel,\" he said. \"This is not an anonymous army, everyone has a child or a cousin or a father who is involved.\"\nCalls have now gone out to reservists from their early twenties all the way up to those aged 40 - the cut-off age at which you become exempt from duty.\nShay, 40, a taxi driver in Jerusalem, who did not want to give his full name, was on holiday in Greece when he got the call. It had been 20 years since his national service, he said, but he had done refresher training over the years to avoid becoming rusty with a gun.\n\"Even if I was exempt I would still go,\" he said. \"I want to go for me, and for my country, but I have two young children and I am scared.\"\nElkana Bar Etan, a 38-year-old reservist, didn't wait for the call. \"I just texted my commander to say I'm here, and he texted right away and said come,\" Mr Bar Etan said.\nHe was immediately deployed to the border with Lebanon, from where he spoke to the BBC. As he spoke, mortar strikes could be heard in the background. \n\"I never in my worst nightmares imagined that this would be the circumstances for being called up again,\" he said.\n\"I'm here on the border, in full uniform, and I'm thinking about my children. But my decision was simple, really, you feel the obligation.\"\nEven the cut off age did not stop the volunteers. At Jerusalem's main bus station on Monday, Nissim Baranes, 45, was sitting in uniform waiting for a public bus south that, so far, didn't seem to be coming.\n\"I think the public transport is also operating on emergency terms,\" he said.\nMr Baranes was doubly exempt from duty, because not only was he over 40 but he also had six children - the number that excuses a parent from being called up. \nAnd yet there he was, alone at the bus station, with a modest rucksack, trying to get himself closer to somewhere he could be useful.\n\"It is a good feeling to put on the uniform again,\" he said. \"These are hard days for Israel.\"\nFor some parents, this is not the first time they have watched their sons and daughters go to take part in this conflict.\nOne of Mr Sacks' sons served in the 2014 Gaza war. During that time, he and his wife Judith would sit on the front balcony of their house, dreading the appearance of a uniformed soldier walking up the driveway, Judith said.\nThat feeling was now rushing back, she said, with tears in her eyes. \"Then there was one child serving, now there are two serving and two more waiting to go in.\"\nThe reservists already in position and those still waiting to go said they had no idea how long this new mobilisation would last. Israel has launched waves of retaliatory air strikes against the Gaza Strip which have killed at least 900 people.

{"title": "'Where do we go?' - Nowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify", "date": "2023-10-10 20:08:39", "text": "\"Where do we go? Is there a safe place left in this neighbourhood, which was so quiet and beautiful?\" residents of an apartment block in Rimal asked me, with heavy sarcasm. \nI had just spent the most difficult seven hours of my life inside there, as Israeli warplanes carried another wave of air strikes in retaliation for the Palestinian militant group's unprecedented assault on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip on Saturday.\nThe Israeli strikes also caused significant damage to dozens of residential buildings, the offices of telecommunications companies, and faculty buildings of the Islamic University of Gaza.\nTerrifying explosions shook the area throughout Monday night. Children were screaming and nobody had a moment's sleep.\nIt was a night that the residents of Rimal - Gaza City's wealthiest neighbourhood and usually its quietest - will not forget for a long time. \nAs dawn broke on Tuesday, the intensity of the strikes decreased and people discovered the extent of the destruction. The south-western neighbourhood's infrastructure was severely damaged and most roads leading to it were cut off. \nAs I drove around it felt as if there had been an earthquake. There was rubble, shattered glass and severed wiring everywhere. Such was the devastation that I did not recognise some of the buildings that I passed.\nThis video can not be played\nDrone footage shows Gaza neighbourhoods flattened\n\"I lost everything. My apartment, where my five children lived, was here in this building. My grocery shop below the building was destroyed,\" Mohammed Abu al-Kass told me while carrying his daughter Shahd in the street.\n\"Where do we go? We have become homeless. There is no shelter for us anymore or work.\"\n\"Are my house and my grocery shop a military target, Israel?\" he added, accusing the Israeli military of lying when it says it does not target civilians.\nThe Palestinian health ministry said that about 300 people, two thirds of them civilians, were killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza on Monday. It was the deadliest day there for many years.\nAt least 15 people were killed in the densely populated Jabalia refugee camp, north-east of Gaza City, in the afternoon. The Israeli military said it targeted the home of a Hamas commander. But many people at a nearby market or in neighbouring houses were killed.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Footage from BBC Arabic inside the Jabalia refugee camp after an Israeli airstrike\nThe overall death toll in Gaza since Saturday now stands at 900, including 260 children, according to the health ministry. Another 4,500 people have been injured.\nThe already dire humanitarian crisis in this tiny, overcrowded territory also deepens. \nIts 2.2 million residents are running out of food, fuel, electricity and water, after Israel's government ordered a \"complete siege\" and cut off all of Gaza's supplies in response to Hamas's attack.\nSaturday's unexpected assault has killed 1,000 people on the Israeli side, and between 100 and 150 hostages have been taken across the border into Gaza by the militants.\n\"Can you imagine that we are living without power or water in the 21st Century? My baby has run out of nappies and there is only half a bottle of milk left,\" said Waad al-Mughrabi as she looked at the destroyed building next to her home in Rimal. \n\"Was it my child who attacked Israel?\"\nOutside Gaza's largest supermarket, which had opened for the first time since Saturday, dozens of people were queuing in front of a small back door. They were hoping to buy whatever provisions they could, fearful that the fighting will last a long time.\nMost of Gaza's fresh vegetables and fruits are grown in the south of the territory, and the severe fuel shortage means that transporting them to the north will become increasingly difficult.\nSo far, there have been no deliveries of food or other essential goods from Egypt, which has maintained a tight blockade of Gaza, along with Israel, since Hamas took over the territory in 2007 for security reasons.\nPeople have also been unable to flee Gaza via the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. Only 400 a day are usually allowed in or out, but Israeli air strikes on Monday and Tuesday hit an entry gate on the Palestinian side, stopping any crossings, the Palestinian interior ministry in Gaza said.\nThat has forced most of the 200,000 people who have fled their homes to take shelter in UN-run schools. Some have fled in fear, while others have seen their homes destroyed by air strikes.\nSome Gazans are choosing to shelter in basements, but they risk being trapped inside if the building above collapses. About 30 families were trapped in one basement alone on Monday night.\n\"In previous wars, this part of the city was a safe haven for residents of areas on the border [with Israel],\" said Rimal resident Mohammed al-Mughrabi.\nThe Israeli strikes on Monday night showed that nowhere is safe anymore.\nGaza hospital deluged as Israel retaliates with strikes\nBowen: Israel blindsided by most serious attack in a generation\nWhat we know about Israeli hostages taken by Hamas\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

But they recognised that the laws of the game as set by Fifa and the International Football Advisory Board doesn't allow that,\" Webb said.\n\"That's a process in place that sits in the laws of the game about how we use VAR to make sure it's delivered consistently throughout every league on the world, and it doesn't allow you to go back in those circumstances and as such they decided not to intervene.\"\n\"We took the unusual step of releasing the audio from this situation not long after it happened,\" Webb said.\n\"We wanted to show everybody what was quickly apparent to us was a pretty significant human error - loss of concentration. \n\"One of the things that we have to do is put things in place to ensure that should we have human error, it doesn't have the damaging impact that we saw on this occasion.\n\"We want the on-field referee to communicate to the VAR what the on-field decision is, very clearly. Then the VAR to go back to the on-field referee and acknowledge that they've heard that properly.\n\"The VAR goes through the process then of checking the situation giving clear direction to the replay operator to get the right angles, speaking to that assistant VAR as they go through that as well, so the assistant VAR can be another check and balance, before communicating to the field, speaking to the AVAR [assistant VAR] to say what their intended direction of travel is going to be. \n\"Then, at that moment, not just saying 'check complete, check complete' because what are you check completing?\"\nWebb also looked at a challenge by Manchester City midfielder Mateo Kovacic in Sunday's Premier League match at Arsenal.\nThe Croatian - already on a booking - fouled Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard, but was not shown a second yellow card by referee Michael Oliver.\n\"Obviously the VAR can't get involved, second yellows are something that the VAR is not able to get involved in,\" Webb said.\n\"But I think he was an extremely fortunate player to stay on the field of play.\n\"The referee - one of our best referees, one of the best referees in the world - Michael Oliver, will no doubt review that.\"\nA clip of a penalty being awarded to Luton against Wolves - and subsequently upheld by VAR - was also discussed.\nWolves midfielder Joao Gomes handled in the box when the ball caught his arm which was above his head, but only after it had deflected off his boot.\nThe decision was upheld by the VAR team and Webb explained the \"unnatural position\" of the player's arm had \"trumped\" the fact it came off his boot, as far as the officials were concerned.\n\"I have some sympathy with the player,\" Webb said. \"But don't forget the onfield decision was penalty.\"\nNaomi Grimley travels to Austria to see the treatment in action\nA man who loved his country almost as much as he loved women\nBrian Cox and Robin Ince ponder the point when living things die\nIn 1978, the Amoco Cadiz tanker ran aground off the coast of France\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnly three points separate the Premier League top four which gives all of them hope, says MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEverything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.\nThe latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.\nAnalysis and opinion from our chief football writer.\nHow to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK."}

Mississippi's perspective on abortion or trans laws\".\nThis is not the first time that Healy has addressed online criticism during a 1975 concert. \nLast week, the singer apologised for \"actions that have hurt some people\" while onstage in Los Angeles. \nEarlier this year, Healy mocked American rapper Ice Spice on a podcast, mimicking Asian and Hawaiian accents and asking the show's hosts to do impressions of Japanese people labouring in concentration camps. \nDuring his performance at the Hollywood Bowl, Healy said he had \"performed exaggerated versions\" of himself \"on other stages be it in print or on podcasts… in an often misguided attempt at fulfilling the kind of character role of the 21st-century rock star\".\nLGBT Malaysians angry at 1975 'white saviour' act\nThe 1975 axes more shows after Malaysia LGBT row\nThe 1975 sent legal letter over Malaysia festival\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

The second half showed that to the players. I said 'just believe in yourselves, we are a team at this level'. \n\"We have to earn it now. We have great shoulders to stand on from our men's team and that breeds into all of our club. We need to take that belief into the second leg - that we're Manchester United and we can beat anybody.\n\"I felt we could always exploit them and we will learn from this to find a gameplan for the second leg.\"\nUnited were on the backfoot from the first minute in Leigh as PSG's physicality and intensity took the hosts by surprise. \nBut Skinner's side adapted in the second half and began to dominate - substitutes Geyse and Melvine Malard having a particularly impressive impact off the bench.\n\"I felt there was a little bit of trepidation in the first half, but in the second half we felt we believed,\" added Skinner. \n\"We were adapting and evolving to defend against a new system. We had to pay respect. In the second half, when we knew how they would play, we unleashed the players to do the business. \n\"They were very physical. The reality is the first half is the fastest we've played against in terms of intensity - even more so than against Arsenal on Friday. It took our players [time] to see it and feel it. We stayed in the game.\"\nBrazilian forward Geyse, who won the Champions League with Barcelona last season, came on for United in the second half and created numerous chances, before on-loan Lyon forward Malard's header made it 1-1.\nThey are among the summer signings with valuable Champions League experience in United's squad, adding to previous winner Nikita Parris during her time at Lyon. \nSkinner is therefore confident United can get a result in Paris and does not think it would be a shock if they did despite their opponents having reached the final twice. \n\"[It would not be a shock] for us. For others, it may be. I want to clarify that we go into every game thinking we can win,\" said Skinner.\n\"If you don't, there's no point jumping on the plane. We need to be as physical as we were tonight. We need to match that and play our football.

{"title": "US congressman charged with defrauding donors", "date": "2023-10-10 22:49:01", "text": "US prosecutors have filed an array of criminal counts against embattled Rep George Santos, accusing him of running up multiple charges on the credit cards of campaign donors.\nThe justice department filed 23 charges against the Republican - including wire fraud and identity theft.\nThe move, which builds on an earlier indictment, also accused him of lying to the Federal Election Commission.\nMr Santos has yet to comment on the developments announced on Tuesday. \n\"Santos allegedly led multiple additional fraudulent criminal schemes, lying to the American public in the process,\" FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge James Smith said in a statement. \n\"Anyone who attempts to violate the law as part of a political campaign will face punishment in the criminal justice system,\" he added. \nThe charges build on 13 counts the New York congressman pleaded not guilty to in May. He was accused of laundering campaign funds to pay for his personal expenses and illegally claiming unemployment benefits while he was employed.\nSpeaking at the time, Mr Santos accused prosecutors of mounting a political \"witch hunt\" against him. \nThe new indictment alleges that he charged more than $44,000 (£35,000) to his campaign over a period of months using credit cards belonging to contributors who were unaware they were being defrauded.\nOn one occasion he charged $12,000 (£9,700) to a contributor's credit card, ultimately transferring the vast majority of that money into his personal bank account, the charging document says.\nProsecutors also said he reported a series of fictions loans to qualify for support from the Republican party.\n\"Santos falsely inflated the campaign's reported receipts with non-existent loans and contributions that were either fabricated or stolen,\" Breon Peace, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement. \n\"This Office will relentlessly pursue criminal charges against anyone who uses the electoral process as an opportunity to defraud the public and our government institutions.\" \nThe 35-year-old will appear in court again on 27 October. \nMr Santos was elected in 2022 after scoring an upset victory in a Democrat-leaning congressional district, touting himself as the first LGBT Republican to serve in Congress.\nBut he has been embroiled in several serious scandals since he took office in January. \nHe has been accused of lying about his college degrees and his work experience; violating campaign finance and conflict of interest laws; falsely claiming his grandparents survived the Holocaust; and creating a fake animal charity that he used to siphon away cash meant for a veteran's dying dog.\nIn February, House Democrats filed a resolution to expel Mr Santos, a mostly symbolic action in the Republican-controlled chamber.\nHe has also previously faced calls to resign from within his own party, and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters recently that he would not support Mr Santos' bid for re-election.\nThe latest charges come just days after a top election aide to Mr Santos admitted she falsified some of the campaign's financial records.\nNancy Marks reported a fake $500,000 (£410,000) loan that Mr Santos claimed to have given the campaign, prosecutors said.\nThe false reports meant the campaign qualified for the fundraising benchmarks needed to receive financial support from the national Republican Party committee.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: George Santos: Five things to know about the beleaguered Congressman\nSantos campaign knew of red flags before election\nWho is George Santos and why is he in trouble?\nGeorge Santos campaign aide pleads guilty to fraud\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Birkenstock: Once-uncool sandal maker now worth billions", "date": "2023-10-10 23:15:46", "text": "German sandal maker Birkenstock has spent decades convincing shoppers that what might appear, at first glance, unattractive is actually desirable. \nThe extent of that power will now be put to the test on Wall Street, as its shares are set to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe initial public offering priced the shares at $46 per share, valuing the company at roughly $8.6bn (£7.08bn). \nThat is double what it was worth less than three years ago.\nBut is there more room to grow?\nThe company, which traces its roots to an 18th Century cobbler, found its first fans among hippie types in the 1960s, who were won over by the company's emphasis on flexible, but sturdy support. \n\"For decades Birkenstock was not a fashionable shoe,\" New York Times fashion reporter Elizabeth Paton told the BBC. \"This was something that your dorky aunty or a science teacher would wear with socks.\"\nBut eventually it started converting the fashion world, scoring the seal of approval from supermodel Kate Moss in the 1990s. \nOver the last decade, the company has won a mass following, as a pandemic-era emphasis on comfort, collaborations with fashion designers, and sightings on celebrities from Gwyneth Paltrow to Kaia Gerber stoked growth.\nLast year the company sold some 30 million pairs of shoes.\nThe brand's capture of the cultural zeitgeist seemed confirmed by its appearance in this year's Barbie movie, in which the main character's journey of liberation was winkingly summed up by her adoption of a pink pair of the company's classic two-strap sandals. The moment reportedly sent demand surging threefold.\nWith shares due to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange, investors are facing the question of whether the company can maintain that momentum - and whether opening the firm up to the pressure of public markets for the first time in its long history will hurt or help.\n\"Some say: 'Birkenstock is having a moment'. I always reply then 'this moment has lasted for 250 years, and it will continue to last,'\" chief executive Oliver Reichert said in the letter announcing the firm's plans to list. \nThe share sale allowed L Catterton, the private equity firm owned by French luxury giant LVMH that took a majority stake in the firm in 2021, to bring in nearly $1.5bn.\nBut the company plans to retain an 80% stake in Birkenstock, a sign that it does not believe the retailer's best days are behind it - despite a market flirting with exhaustion. \nStill, some customers said they also feared the listing would put new financial pressures on the firm - forcing trade-offs that would hurt the brand in the long run.\n\"I'm afraid of the IPO because I think the quality will definitely disintegrate,\" said New Yorker Bella Sheth, 55, a project manager who has been buying Birkenstocks for more than three decades and now has six pairs. \"Hopefully they won't get ruined.\"\nConcerns about listing are warranted, given how often investors push for growth, despite the risk - especially acute in luxury fashion - that expansion will backfire and dilute the brand, said Thomai Serdari, professor of marketing at New York University's Stern School of Business. \nBut she said that for now, Birkenstock has done a good job building a sense of desire with its fashion collaborations and introductions of new colours and materials. \n\"Just because you get the IPO doesn't mean that you're going to be a Gap who exploded,\" she added, referring to the clothing brand that seemed to be everywhere in the 1990s but is now a shadow of its former self.\nMorten Bennedsen is a professor at the University of Cophenhagen and INSEAD who studies family firms. He said the company had already transformed from a family-owned firm into a modern company, subject to investor pressures, when it shed its family leadership in 2013 and later won backing from L Catterton.\n\"That changed everything,\" he said. Compared to that decision, he added: \"This is a completely natural step.\"\nIn choosing to list, Birkenstock is following a path well-trodden by footwear and fashion companies. \nSome, such as sneaker brand Allbirds and boot company Dr Martens, which both went public in 2021 when markets were hot, have seen their fortunes tumble.\nOthers have proven to have staying power, like Crocs, which listed in 2006. The company, which sells more than 100 million pairs of shoes a year, is worth about $5.2bn, more than six times what it was at the start. \nThe New York Times' Elizabeth Paton said that, when it comes to high-profile footwear IPOs, people are often wary of the valuations, of which Birkenstock has \"a hefty one\".\n\"But I do also think this company has quite a few things going in its favour, namely this idea that looking good and feeling good are one and the same,\" she said.\nLacey Crocker, who bought her first pair of Birkenstocks in high school, said she thinks Birkenstock's appeal will endure even if the current fad fades - as long as the shoes keep the comfortable features that got them started.\n\"It's all about the arch support,\" the 39-year-old physician's assistant said. \"Even if they do go out of style, I'd still wear them.\"\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

Owning them can give fans access to certain perks, such as being able to vote in fan polls or getting access to ticket ballots.\nSome of them can be traded, like an NFT - but that means their value can vary widely too, with the potential to gain or lose a lot of money.\nNFTs enjoyed a period of considerable popularity - and soaring prices - during and after the pandemic, with people and businesses encouraged to create them, but MPs say their fluctuating prices are troubling.\n\"Clubs are promoting volatile crypto-asset schemes to extract additional money from loyal supporters, often with promises of privileges and perks that fails to materialise,\" said Dame Caroline Dinenage, chair of the CMS committee.\nThe Conservative MP continued: \"Fan token schemes must not be used as a substitute for meaningful engagement with supporters.\"\nThe committee report added that \"the unique relationship between clubs and fans means that fan speculation on sport-based crypto-assets carries a real risk of financial harm to fans and reputational harm to clubs.\"\nIt also voiced concerns over the rise of crypto assets in the arts, with Dame Caroline saying that \"artists are at risk of seeing the fruits of their hard work pinched and promoted without permission\".\nA fake Banksy NFT was sold to a British collector through the artist's website for £244k in August 2021.\nNFTs have been popularised as a way to create and sell digital art on blockchains - the digital ledgers underpinning crypto transactions - but do not give the buyer the actual artwork or the copyright attached.\nFan tokens are digital membership collectibles which can used to access rewards such as voting in polls or ballots for exclusive tickets. \nSome fan tokens can be bought and sold on a market - but the value of these has fallen dramatically since their peak a few years ago.\nA recent announcement of a Socios partnership with Tottenham Hotspur sparked backlash from fan groups, who said that fan engagement with the club should not cost money and pointed out the risks of losing money through buying cryptocurrency.\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire told the BBC that large football clubs likely saw crypto-assets as an \"easy cash grab\" and a chance for more revenue streams after the pandemic.\nBut he said the hype around assets like fan tokens and NFTs has since dwindled, along with their value.\n\"A wave of optimism was created which underpinned and created speculative values for [them]. Then when people actually worked out exactly what the benefits were, they were pretty insignificant, and people started to look for an exit route,\" Mr Maguire said.\nThe \"stampede\" that followed, he added, led to both negative prices and \"very few transactions taking place\".\nFan tokens can usually be exchanged with each other as like-for-like, \"fungible\" assets, whereas NFTs carrying unique digital identifiers and intended to be one-of-a-kind collectibles cannot.\nFormula 1 teams have turned to NFTs as a way to engage fans or offer membership perks in recent years. \nThe Mercedes F1 team announced a series of NFTs in April 2022 with then-partner FTX - several months before several months before the exchange collapsed and its owner Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested.\nMore recently the Williams F1 team, partnered with crypto exchange Kraken, held a contest letting NFT owners vote for tokens to be displayed on its cars at the upcoming US Grand Prix. \nOracle Red Bull Racing also offers an NFT range through its partnership with exchange and sponsor, Bybit.\nWhat are NFTs and why are some worth millions?\nBitcoin to blockchain: What key crypto words mean\nFootball fans spending millions on crypto-tokens\nOwen NFT tweet deleted after contact by authorities\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Pakistan's 'shameful' first Miss Universe contestant", "date": "2023-10-11 00:10:27", "text": "Senator Mushtaq Ahmed of the Jamaat-e-Islami party called it \"shameful\". Caretaker Prime Minister Anwar ul-Haq Kakar even ordered an investigation. Online chatter amongst Pakistani men in particular has been scathing.\nBut what is sparking such outrage?\nA 24-year-old woman. \nErica Robin, a Christian from the city of Karachi, is going to represent deeply conservative Pakistan at the Miss Universe beauty pageant.\nMs Robin was chosen as Miss Universe Pakistan from among five finalists at a competition held in the Maldives. \nIt was organised by Dubai-based Yugen Group, which also owns the franchise rights to Miss Universe Bahrain and Miss Universe Egypt. It said the Miss Universe Pakistan competition had received an \"overwhelming\" number of applications. \nThe Miss Universe finals will be held in El Salvador in November. \n \"It feels great to represent Pakistan. But I don't understand where the backlash is coming from. I think it is this idea that I would be parading in a swimsuit in a room full of men,\" Ms Robin told the BBC. \nThose criticising her nomination say she is representing a country that does not want to be represented, especially as beauty pageants are rare in Muslim-majority Pakistan. \nMiss Pakistan World, a pageant for women of Pakistani descent from around the world, is probably the most well-known. It was first held in Toronto in 2002 but moved to Lahore in 2020. The competition has also seen various spin offs such as Miss Pakistan Universal, Mrs Pakistan Universal and even Miss Trans Pakistan. \nIn the competition's 72-year history, Pakistan has never nominated a representative for Miss Universe.\nMs Robin recalled that during the second selection round of the pageant which was held over Zoom, she was asked to name one thing she wanted to do for her country. \"And I replied, I would want to change this mindset that Pakistan is a backward country.\"\nThis may be difficult, given some of the hostile responses to her nomination. \nNevertheless, models, writers and journalists alike congratulated Ms Robin, with journalist Mariana Babar hailing her \"beauty and brains\" on X, formerly known as Twitter.\nBut as Pakistani model Vaneeza Ahmed, who first encouraged Ms Robin to get into modelling, told Voice of America Urdu: \"When these men are fine with international competitions called 'Mister Pakistan', why do they have a problem with a woman's achievement?\"\n\"We are a nation of many contradictions and women and the marginalised trigger us the most,\" Karachi-based writer and commentator Rafay Mehmood told the BBC.\n\"Pakistan is at large an authoritarian state and that reflects in the harsh patriarchal values it enables both institutionally and socially. Erica Robin and the policing she has faced is an extension of that,\" he added. \nBut there exists an archive of a Pakistan that was once far more liberal. \nCopies of the Dawn newspaper from the 1950s to the late 1970s have advertisements of cabaret and foreign belly dancers performing at a club near the former Elphinstone Street in downtown Karachi. These nightclubs were frequented by activists, diplomats, politicians, air hostesses and young people.\nThe historic Metropole Hotel in Karachi was also a favoured spot for singing and jazz performances. \nBut in 1973, Pakistan's parliament created a constitution that declared the country an Islamic Republic and Islam as the state religion. \nFour years later, military leader General Zia ul-Haq overthrew the government of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. What followed in the decade after has been called  a \"draconian phase\" by activists and lawyers as Islamic law was enforced and Pakistani society was drastically altered. \nBy the mid-1980s, General Zia had even resurrected public flogging to show his commitment to Islamic law.  \nToday, the nightclubs and bars are long gone, and the Metropole Hotel looks more like it is in danger of collapsing. Just down the road, a skeletal structure of what was initially supposed to be a casino stands abandoned. \nBut the yearning for a freer, more tolerant Pakistan has not gone away, and Ms Robin is just one of those pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable and what is not. The graduate of St Patrick's High School and Government College of Commerce and Economics, is adamant that she has done nothing wrong. \n\"I'm not breaking any law by representing Pakistan on a global platform. I am doing my bit to quell any stereotypes about it,\" she said. \nThe fury in Pakistan sparked by a misogynist minister\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

He was out meeting another child, who was also due to start at the same Durham school, when the government announced that school buildings constructed with a particular type of concrete had to close immediately.\nElliott has not had much chance to speak to his new friend since then, nor to any of his other classmates - because his school was one of those impacted by the announcement.\nSt Leonard's Catholic School was told it could not fully open at the start of term, due to the presence of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) on the school site.\nInstead of going to school, Elliott has spent most of this term doing six hours a day of online lessons, from home, on his mother's laptop. There are more than 150 other children logged on to the online lesson on his screen - but no-one turns their cameras on, and only the teacher speaks.\n\"I feel quite isolated,\" Elliott says. \"When it's breaktime, I normally just watch YouTube in bed.\"\nElliott's mother, Amanda, says her son had been really looking forward to making new friends. \"Not being able to do that in the normal way has really had an impact on him,\" she says.\nElliot is due to start in-person learning full-time next week, at an alternative location.\nSome year groups have been in the building for a number of weeks, but school life has been far from normal for them too. The children have been learning in a sports hall rather than in classrooms, and using clipboards because there are not enough desks. \nNick Hurn, the chief executive of the school's trust, hopes all the children will be \"back to some face-to-face learning\" after half term.\nSpeaking on a local radio station, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that planning for rebuilding work at St Leonard's will start before the end of the year.  \nIt is now almost six weeks since the scale of the Raac crisis first emerged.\nAnd despite saying it expected to publish fortnightly updates on the number of affected schools, the government has not released up-to-date figures since last month.\nAccording to the last figures, which were released on 14 September, 174 schools in England were confirmed to have Raac - the material now deemed to be a safety risk, and which has led to the closures.\nAt 23 of those schools, at least some of the pupils were learning remotely; 29 schools required temporary classrooms -11 already had them in place.\nOne school - Stepney All Saints Church of England secondary school, in east London, closed completely - meaning all its 1,400 pupils were learning remotely - but has since re-opened to most year groups.\nAs the impact became apparent, orders were given for 180 single and 68 double classrooms, plus toilet blocks. The DfE has not said how many have been delivered so far.\n\"The majority of settings where Raac has been confirmed have opened and pupils continue to learn as normal,\" a government spokeswoman said.\n\"We will continue to support all impacted settings in whatever way we can - whether that's through our team of dedicated caseworkers, or through capital funding to put mitigations in place to minimise the disruption to pupils' education.\" \nBut it is not just Raac that is leading to problems in school infrastructure.\nIn England, an estimated 700,000 children are being taught in unsafe or ageing school buildings that need major repairs, according to a National Audit Office report from June.\nThe report said more than 93% of schools had responded to DfE surveys about asbestos. Of those, 80% had identified it.\nAsbestos is the reason most of Aylesford School, in Warwick, is closed. It could have Raac - its buildings are the relevant age - but head teacher Tim Hodgson cannot find out for certain until the asbestos is removed.\nMore than 30 of the school's classrooms are currently out of use. Classes are using the two remaining science labs on rotation - there are normally eight. Coffee cups and teaching materials are still on desks in padlocked classrooms, left behind by teachers who had to evacuate just days before the start of term. \n\"We're educators - we're not project managers, we're not builders. So we have to have that help, and we need it quickly,\" says Tim.\nAylesford School is on the DfE's \"complex case\" list. Around 18 temporary classrooms have been ordered for installation on the netball courts, and are due to arrive in early November. \nSiobhan McKenna says her daughter, an Aylesford pupil, feels \"overwhelmed\" with teaching herself GSCE coursework at home.\n\"I'm a single parent, trying to do a full-time job and keep her on an even keel, and it's really, really hard not to be able to help,\" she says. \nMs McKenna wants Aylesford's GCSE students to be able to use other schools' practical teaching facilities, such as science labs.\n\"What kind of practical lessons can they do in those [temporary buildings]?\" she says. \n\"We just feel completely abandoned.\"\nJoolz Phillips' daughter, Scarlett, has been going into Aylesford for a few weeks, but her son, Jacob - in Year 8 - has been at home. \nJoolz has been helping other parents who are unable to work from home, by looking after their children too during the day. But that arrangement is now affecting her spray-tan business, which she runs from the family home.\n\"I had a lovely couple come in for their wedding tans,\" Joolz says. \"It was a day where it was absolutely chucking it down.\n\"After I'd done the spray tan, I walked out to trainers and coats all over the floor, soaking wet...

{"title": "The 1975 at the London O2: Will carbon-removed shows change gigs?", "date": "2023-10-11 01:33:46", "text": "The 1975 are due to play at the O2 Arena next year, and the gigs are billed as the venue's first \"carbon-removed\" shows.\nThe four dates are part of Matty Healy and friends' sold-out run across Europe next February and March.\nIt's not the first time the four-piece have shown an interest in the climate - activist Greta Thunberg appeared on the opening track of their 2020 album Notes on a Conditional Form. \nAnd organisers AEG Europe claim the pilot scheme at the O2 will be a world-first for a music event.\nThey say they've calculated how much carbon will be produced as a result of staging and catering each show and the band's travel.\nAnd they've also factored in an estimate of the emissions created by fans travelling to the gigs, which research suggests is a big contributor.\nThe plan is to remove an equivalent amount from the atmosphere - AEG says that will equal 100 tonnes of carbon per show.\nCarbon removal refers to taking carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere.\nThis can be done directly using technology, or influenced through natural systems such as forests.\nDespite the label, the carbon won't actually be removed at the gig, but by a start-up company called CUR8.\nThey say they use six methods, including tree-planting and direct air capture, to take an equivalent amount out of the atmosphere. \nSome people are critical of carbon removal, saying it provides a false sense of security and takes focus off reducing emissions in the first place.\nBut some scientific organisations, including one that provides advice to the United Nations, have said the technique might be helpful in industries such as agriculture and long-distance transportation, where it's tougher to bring down emissions. \nAEG's sustainability boss Sam Booth admits \"there is always more work to be done\" but says The 1975 gigs are \"a chance to start a conversation\".\nHe tells Newsbeat The O2 is looking to reduce emissions created by \"big ticket\" items like heating and powering the venue.\nIt's currently run on renewable energy and has banned beef from its concession stands due to its high carbon footprint.\nBut in Sam's view that's only one part of the answer.\n\"I think we've got to the point now in the climate debate where we can't just do one of these things,\" he says.\n\"You can't just lower your carbon emissions, you have to start doing both.\"\nYou've probably heard the term net zero before - and while carbon removal sounds similar, AEG is keen to stress that it's not the same thing.\n\"Net zero involves reducing your carbon footprint by 90% and then removing the last 10%,\" says Sam.\n\"So we wouldn't call these that because these aren't a perfect net zero event - I think those don't really exist on a large scale yet.\" \nChristopher Johnson, a sustainability consultant who advises the UK event, festival and music industries - thinks the O2 pilot is a good thing.\nHe tells Newsbeat that measures such as carbon removals are a \"second step\" after you've reduced emissions.\nBut he points out that the O2 has already been \"quite pioneering\" in its efforts to bring down the carbon from its events.\n\"It's quite a good example, really - and in a way, hats off to anyone that makes carbon emissions sexy or interesting.\"\nAnd Christopher, who is also a founder of the Shambala festival, thinks choosing a high-profile act for the pilot gigs is key. \n\"The most important thing here might not be actually the act of the carbon removals,\" he says.\n\"What they're effectively doing is showing that carbon emissions are important, and making an interesting and credible story to inspire audiences and the industry.\" \nPolicy analyst Leo Mercer, says AEG might have chosen to push carbon removals for \"marketing\" reasons, because they're less controversial than carbon offsets.\nCarbon offsetting schemes try to balance emissions by finding other ways to reduce carbon in the atmosphere by an equivalent amount, but carbon offsetting doesn't necessarily mean the carbon is removed from the atmosphere. \nLeo, from the Grantham Institute at the London School of Economics, says \"we have more confidence that those [carbon removal] processes will lead to durable carbon dioxide removals\".\nHe says it's easier for the live music industry to employ carbon removal methods than others, such as heavy industry and agriculture.\nBut he says the O2 investing in carbon removal is a \"positive\" thing as businesses race to meet national and international emissions targets.\n\"The carbon removal industry is in its infancy at the moment,\" he says.\n\"So having organisations such as the O2 being public about their procurement is a positive thing.\"\nAEG tells Newsbeat if the O2 pilot is viewed as a success it plans to introduce carbon removal at its venues and on its tours worldwide to \"inspire the reduction of carbon emissions in the live entertainment industry\".\nThat might mean an extra cost for fans, but a modest one. At the O2 shows 90p of the ticket price has gone towards the initiative. \nCUR8 also says it's been talking to other bands about carbon removal.\nWhether it will catch on more widely at venues without the financial power of AEG remains to be seen, but consultant Christopher thinks it's an encouraging step.\n\"We need festivals, venues, artists to be innovative. And this is an example of innovation,\" he says.\n\"I think what we need to do is not lose focus on the immediate actions we need to take to reduce emissions. \n\"And I think that many festivals and venues might consider removals or offsets in the future - but I wouldn't want removals to distract from the immediate action that's needed.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.\nFour ways climate change affects extreme weather\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "South Africa egg shortage: How poultry products became a hot commodity", "date": "2023-10-11 01:37:10", "text": "Eggs are currently South Africa's hottest commodity.\nThe country has been grappling with one of its worst outbreaks of bird flu - millions of chickens have been killed over the past few weeks, supplies of poultry meat have been threatened and supermarkets across the nation have run out of eggs.\nExperts predict the egg shortage will cause the popular ingredient to jump in price - far from ideal considering it is one of the most affordable sources of protein for the millions living in poverty. \nRetailers, farms and industry giants have also been hit, with the nation's largest chicken producer stating the flu had \"ravaged\" a sector already burdened by rising costs and an electricity crisis.\nIn an effort to stop the spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza - a deadly, extremely infectious type of bird flu - farmers have culled more than seven million egg-laying chickens. That amounts to 20-30% of the country's entire chicken stock, according to South African Poultry Association.\nAs a result, social media sites have been inundated with pictures of bare supermarket shelves, while many shoppers found that shops still selling eggs have set limits on how many can be bought. \nOnline shopping sites are no better - several consumers hoping to buy eggs on the web have been met with \"unavailable\" or \"low in stock\" messages.\nDomestic worker Nomalanga Moyo buys eggs every week in order to make muffins for her children's lunchboxes. \nHer store of choice is a spaza shop - the term for a small informal outlet - in her township of Diepsloot. Here, she can buy any quantity of eggs - when funds are low, she is able to get just two eggs for about 2.50 rand (13 cents; 11p). However, this week, the store was totally out.  \n\"I am now going to wait until I go to work during the week to see if I can find eggs at the normal shops. However, it will cost me more,\" a worried Ms Moyo said.\nMore than half of South Africans live below the poverty line. They already spend about 35% of their income on food and according to the Pietermaritzburg Economic Justice and Dignity research group, this share will likely increase as a result of the egg shortage.\n\"Not only will consumers spend more for eggs but the rising price of eggs will affect all other food products where producers use eggs and other poultry products,\" it said.\nBusinesses have also been impacted by the flu. \nIn a trading update at the end of last month, leading South African poultry producer Astral Foods said the outbreak had so far cost it $11.5m.\nAstral said the flu has \"spread at an alarming pace\" and ravaged the poultry industry. The company also joined other producers in warning that South Africa could experience a shortage of chicken meat over the next few months.\nSmall businesses, which are less able to weather market shocks, have also voiced concerns.\n\"After baking scones for a client yesterday I was left with three eggs. I went shopping after to find more eggs but the price was too much for me,\" Zamapholoba Ngcobo, a bakery owner in the city of Pietermaritzburg said.\nThe shortage could not have come at a worse time, Ms Ngcobo said, as wedding and graduation season means cake orders are at an \"all-time high\".\nBut where there are losers, it seems there are always winners. \nUkulinga, a poultry farm in KwaZulu-Natal province, saw news of flu outbreaks in Brazil and Argentina earlier this year and implemented strict biosecurity measures as a precaution.\nNkululeko Ngidi, a manager at the farm, said: \"When we started the farm we had to go out looking for business. Now that our farm is among the few that are free from bird flu, customers are looking for us. \n\"We have seen increased demand... we at the moment supply 130,000 eggs to businesses in the area on a weekly basis.\"\nFarmers and industry experts estimate it will take six months for the poultry sector to replace the chickens it culled - meaning any shortage of poultry products could last through the festive season and into 2024.\nPaul Makube, an agriculture economist at First National Bank, told the BBC: \"The outbreak has moved at a rapid pace, it is worse than what we saw during the outbreak in 2017. A further complication comes from the fact that we are dealing with a strain we have not previously dealt with.\"\nConcern has spread beyond the border - Namibia, which imports most of its poultry from South Africa, banned poultry products from its neighbour amid the outbreak.  \nIn an effort to reassure its consumers and businesses, South Africa's government announced that it is considering purchasing bird flu vaccines. \nAnd for the lucky South Africans that can actually find eggs in the shops, officials have stressed chicken products on shelves are safe for consumption.\nWhat is bird flu and what's behind the outbreak?\nSouth Africa country profile\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Wildlife Photographer of the Year: Horseshoe crab wins gold", "date": "2023-10-11 01:40:26", "text": "A picture of a mysterious and other-worldly horseshoe crab has earned Laurent Ballesta the title of Wildlife Photographer of the Year (WPY) 2023.\nThe golden marine arthropod is seen hugging the bottom muds in waters off Pangatalan Island, in the Philippines.\nIt is tracked by three small fishes, hoping the crab's movements will expose an opportunistic meal in the sediment.\nBallesta becomes only the second photographer in WPY's 59-year history to win the competition twice.\nIn 2021, he was awarded the grand prize for capturing a trio of groupers in the act of spawning.\nThe photographer and marine biologist was crowned during a gala dinner at London's Natural History Museum.\nKathy Moran, who chaired the judging panel, said a winning image required four characteristics: \"aesthetics\", \"moment\", \"narrative\", and increasingly \"something that has a conservation edge to it\". And Ballesta's work had that \"secret sauce\".\n\"There's a luminosity to Laurent's picture,\" Ms Moran told BBC News. \n\"It really does feel like an alien floating across the seafloor - but when you step back and realise just how important these creatures are to ocean health and human health, we just felt the image brought it all together and we couldn't pass it up.\"\nThe tri-spine horseshoe crab has survived for more than 100 million years but now faces habitat destruction and overfishing for food and for its blood, used in the development of vaccines. But in a young marine reserve around Pangatalan Island, it is getting the protection it needs.\n\"The photo's technical challenge was to find the right speed and aperture because my wish was to freeze the calm horseshoe crab but let the little fish not be frozen, to show how excited they are,\" Ballesta said. \n\"I wanted to show this contrast between them - one that was powerful and slow, and the others speedy and fragile.\"\nCarmel Bechler, 17, from Israel, won the Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year title.\nHis picture, of two barn owls perched in the window of a graffiti-scrawled derelict building was shot through the window of his father's car. \nThe streaks of light from a moving vehicle in the foreground contrast with the birds' rock-steady gaze.\n\"It took a few tries,\" Bechler said. \"The lights were the most difficult thing in the image to get right, because you want them to go across the entire scene but you also don't want them to be too bright and burnt out. I used a timer to not get any blur and then I took photo after photo until I got that moment.\"\nHere are some of the other category winners in this year's WPY competition.\nThe tadpole banquet, by Juan Jesús Gonzalez Ahumada, Spain\nJuan Jesús Gonzalez Ahumada watched toad tadpoles feasting on a dead fledgling sparrow. His photograph won the Behaviour: Amphibians and Reptiles category. \nCommon toad tadpoles have varied diets of algae, vegetation, and tiny swimming invertebrates. As they grow larger, they become more carnivorous - so when a banquet such as this arrives, they take full advantage. \nWhales making waves, by Bertie Gregory, UK\nBertie Gregory filmed orcas \"wave washing\" Weddell seals in the Antarctic, to dislodge them from the safety of sea-ice, for BBC One series Frozen Planet II. A still image from his later work won the Behaviour: Mammals category.\n\"The behaviour is choreographed - and every single seal they find, they'll use a different set of tactics to make a particular type of wave. It's spine-tingling to watch,\" Gregory told BBC News. \nLife on the edge, by Amit Eshel, Israel\nAmit Eshel witnessed this tussle between two male Nubian ibexes in Israel's Zin Desert. The battle lasted about 15 minutes before one  surrendered and the pair parted without serious injury. Eshel's photograph won the Animals in their Environment category.\nLast gasp, by Lennart Verheuvel, Netherlands\nLennart Verheuvel won the Oceans: The Bigger Picture category. The distressing picture shows a beached orca at Cadzan, on the Dutch-Belgian border. A necropsy revealed the animal was not only severely malnourished but also extremely sick. \nLights fantastic, by Sriram Murali, India\nThis remarkable image was produced in the forests of India's Anamalai Tiger Reserve. Sriram Murali stacked 50 19-second exposures, to show the firefly flashes produced over 16 minutes. It won the Behaviour: Invertebrates category.\nAlpine exposure, by Luca Melcarne, France\nLuca Melcarne, a mountain guide in France's Vercors Regional Natural Park, photographed this ibex after spending a bitterly cold night in a temporary shelter. He first had to thaw the camera with his breath. His effort and skill earned him the Rising Star Portfolio Award. \nThe annual exhibition dedicated to the WPY competition opens at the Natural History Museum on Friday. As in past years, it will also tour the UK. Entries for the 60th WPY will be accepted from Monday. \nFrenzied bee ball wins top wildlife photo award\n'Explosive sex' wins top wildlife photo award\n© 2023 BBC.

The Guardian says the bodies of victims are still being recovered, four days after the attacks. Reports of children being killed in the village of Kfar Aza are reflected in the i, which carries the headline \"massacre of innocents\".\n\"This was a holocaust pure and simple,\" says the Daily Mail. The Express talks of \"barbaric terrorists\" from Hamas. The Times reporter Anshel Pfeffer, who visited the village, says the killings there are likely to be the greatest loss of civilian life in a terrorist attack in Israeli history. \n\"Israel prepares for ground invasion\" is the headline in the Financial Times with news of a further 60,000 reservists mobilised. The paper reports on a warning from the UN of a \"severe shortage\" of water in Gaza which is under a tightened Israeli blockade. The Sun features a photo of devastated buildings in Rimal, Gaza, after Israeli air strikes with the headline \"reduced to rubble\".\nA former chief of the General Staff, General Lord Dannatt, urges caution in Israel's response. Writing in the Telegraph, he says an Israeli ground assault could result in the death of large numbers of Palestinian civilians and the destruction of much of the already impoverished infrastructure of Gaza.\nThis, he adds, would play into the hands of Iran. But, elsewhere in the paper, the former army colonel Richard Kemp argues for the deployment of \"overwhelming force\" against Hamas, saying Israel must focus on \"crushing its will to exist, something which is only attainable by eliminating fighters in large numbers and destroying combat capability through devastating military force\".\nSir Keir Starmer's interrupted speech at the Labour party conference makes many of the front pages.

{"title": "Inside Kfar Aza where Hamas militants killed families in their homes", "date": "2023-10-11 04:37:02", "text": "This video can not be played\nBBC's Jeremy Bowen reports from Kfar Aza, where Hamas militants killed whole families\nWarning: This article contains details that some readers may find disturbing\nKibbutz Kfar Aza is a microcosm of the first few days of this war, and also a glimpse of what might come next.\nUntil Tuesday morning, fighting was still going on in the kibbutz, which is one of the Israeli communities along the border with Gaza. That's why only now are they collecting the bodies of its Israeli residents who were killed when Hamas broke through the border wire from Gaza early on Saturday morning.\nSoldiers who spent much of the day in the ruins recovering bodies of civilians said that there had been a massacre. It seems likely that much of the killing happened in the first hours of the assault on Saturday.\nThe Israeli army, caught off guard, took 12 hours to get to the kibbutz, said Davidi Ben Zion, the deputy commander of Unit 71, an experienced team of paratroopers who led the assault. \n\"Thank God we saved many lives of many parents and children,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, some were burned by Molotov [cocktails]. They are very aggressive, like animals.\"\nMr Ben Zion said Hamas gunmen who killed families, including babies, were \"just a jihad machine to kill everybody, [people] without weapons, without nothing, just normal citizens that want to take their breakfast and that's all.\" \nSome of the victims, he said, were decapitated. \n\"They killed them and cut some of their heads, it's a dreadful thing to see… and we must remember who is the enemy, and what our mission is, [for] justice where there is a right side and all the world needs to be behind us.\" \nAnother officer pointed to a bloodied purple sleeping bag. A swollen toe poked out. He said the woman underneath had been killed and decapitated in her front garden. I did not ask the officer to move the sleeping bag to inspect her body. A few yards away was the blackened, swollen corpse of a dead Hamas gunman.\nKibbutz Kfar Aza adds to the considerable evidence that is accumulating of war crimes by Hamas gunmen. Like their Israeli neighbours, the community was taken by surprise. \nIts first line of defence was the kibbutz guard, residents with military experience who patrolled the perimeter. They were killed fighting the attackers. \nTheir bodies were removed this morning from their positions in the centre of the kibbutz, and like the other Israeli dead, wrapped in black plastic, carried in stretchers to a parking area and laid in a line waiting to be recovered. \nThe residents of the Israeli border communities expected periodic rocket attacks after Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. They accepted the danger as the price of country life in a tight knit community which still had traces of the pioneer spirit of early Zionist settlements. \nResidents of Kfar Aza, and the other Israeli communities along the Gaza wire, enjoyed a good quality of life, despite the threat from Hamas rockets. In the houses, lawns and open areas of the kibbutz, a concrete shelter was never more than a dash away. \nAll the houses had reinforced safe rooms. They also had outside terraces, barbeques, swings for the children and fresh air.\nBut no-one - here in Kfar Aza or elsewhere in Israel - imagined Hamas would be able to breach Israel's defences and kill so many people.\nThe horror and rage of Israelis has been mixed with incredulity that the state and the military failed in its fundamental duty to protect its citizens.\nThe bodies of dead Hamas gunmen who killed so many of them have been left rotting in the sun, lying uncovered where they were killed in bushes and ditches and the broad lawns of the kibbutz.\nNear their bodies are the motorcycles they used to storm into the kibbutz after they broke through the border wire. The wreckage of a paraglider, used to fly over Israel's defences, is there too, pushed off a path on to a flower bed.\nThe next common experience with other border settlements was that it took a fierce fight for the Israelis to recapture Kfar Aza. \nAs we approached the kibbutz entrance this morning, hundreds of Israeli combat soldiers were still deployed along its perimeter. We could hear their radio traffic.\nA commander was giving the order to open fire at a building on the Gaza side. Almost immediately bursts of fire from automatic weapons started, directed across the border into Gaza.\nThe deep thud of airstrikes echoed continually out of Gaza while we were in Kfar Aza.\nIsrael is suffering a collective trauma after the killing of so many of their fellow citizens on Saturday. \nBut in Gaza, hundreds of civilians are also being killed. International humanitarian law states clearly that all combatants must protect the lives of civilians. \nIt is clear that the killing of hundreds of civilians by the Hamas attackers is grave violation of the laws of war. Israelis reject any comparison between the way Hamas kills civilians and the way Palestinian civilians die in their air strikes.\nMajor General Itai Veruv, who was about to retire when he led the fight to take back the kibbutz, insisted that Israel was respecting its obligations under the laws of war.\n\"I'm sure we fight for our values and culture… we will be very aggressive and very strong but we keep our moral values. We are Israeli, we are Jewish.\"\nHe denied strongly that they had suspended their obligations under the laws of war. It is certain though that as more Palestinian civilians die, Israel will face stronger and stronger criticism.\nThat is part of the glimpse of the future afforded by Kfar Aza. So is the attitude of a soldier I spoke to, who didn't want to give his name. Like so many other Israelis, the experience of the first few days of this war, and what he has seen, hardened his resolve to fight.\nWhen they arrived, he said it was \"chaos, terrorists everywhere.\"\nHow difficult, I asked, was the fighting?\n\"You cannot imagine.\"\nHave you ever had to do anything like this before as a soldier?\n\"Not like this.\"\nWhat happens next?\n\"I don't know, I do what they tell me to do. I hope we will go inside.\"\nInto Gaza? That would be tough fighting.\n\"Yes. We're ready for it.\"\nThe soldiers were mostly from reserve units. Historically, military service was considered a vital part of nation-building, uniting a country that can be fractious.\nDavidi Ben Zion, the officer who led the first wave into the fight for the kibbutz and saw the carnage left by Hamas, acknowledged Israelis had deep political divisions - but insisted they were united now that they were under attack.\nA strong smell of decomposing flesh hung in the hot autumn sun of the Mediterranean. Soldiers removing the bodies walked carefully through the ruins of houses, wary of unexploded ordnance, that might also be boobytrapped. A grenade lay on a garden path.\nAs they worked to recover the bodies, from time to time alerts for Hamas rocket fire made them take cover.\nAfter we left Kfar Aza there were more alerts.\nBowen: Israelis, united in shock, rally behind war on Hamas\nWhat is happening in Israel, and why now?\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nGaza hospital deluged as Israel retaliates with strikes\nInside Israeli border village where Hamas killed families in their homes\nNowhere safe in Gaza as Israeli strikes intensify\nIsrael has 'duty' to respond to Hamas, says Biden\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Rugby World Cup: The quirky ways Wales fans are travelling to France", "date": "2023-10-11 05:09:19", "text": "Flying out to France in an aeroplane that weighs less than Wales' scrum may sound like the stuff of nightmares.\nBut for Dave Pitman and Gavin Johns, the proximity of Wales' final Rugby World Cup group game in Brittany meant it was an opportunity they had to take.\nThe two friends touched down in Rennes on Friday, before soaking up the tournament atmosphere in Nantes.\nThe private pilots said the \"sense of relief\" when they landed was \"fantastic\".\nDave, from Rumney in Cardiff, and Gavin, from Miskin in Rhondda Cynon Taf, had already travelled out to Lyon to watch Wales earlier in the pool stage - via the more traditional method of a travel agency.\n\"Because we had such an amazing result against Australia, it was decided that we would try [to fly] if the weather was perfect, and it was,\" said Dave.\nThe two have previous experience of flying to France in their light aircraft, including for the famous Le Mans motor race earlier this year.\n\"Crossing the Channel can be a little nerve wracking because we're in a single-engine plane, so you have to take a lot of safety measures, but other than that it's a bit of an adventure,\" said Gavin.\n\"Once we get here, the sense of relief and achievement is fantastic.\n\"But in all seriousness, we wouldn't do anything reckless - if the weather was poor we'd turn back, if the aircraft's not right we turn back.\"\nThe two departed from St Athan in the Vale of Glamorgan on Friday, before making the journey home on Sunday.\nBut Dave admitted it was not for the faint-hearted, with turbulence felt all the more strongly in a light aircraft.\n\"Our aircraft weighs 880kg (1,900lb) fully-fuelled, fully-loaded, so it's very susceptible to weather - we were bouncing around,\" he said.\n\"In fact I think the Welsh rugby pack is 912kg (2010lb), so we're incredibly light [in comparison]. But the experience is quite amazing.\"\nGavin said he was \"quietly confident\" that the two would take the plane for another spin to France before the tournament is over.\n\"If we get past Argentina, there's a very nice airfield in Paris that Dave wants to land into, so we'll be at the semi finals,\" he said, smiling.\nThey are not the only fans who have found novel ways of travelling to the tournament.\nMike Kelly, from Pembrokeshire, has spent five weeks cycling more than 1,600 miles (2,574km) to attend the four group matches.\n\"Last year I got diagnosed with epilepsy, so I had to give up my driving licence,\" Mike explained.\n\"And so I decided, why not do it on the bike instead? It was a better idea last October than it was by the time I started, but it's been really good fun.\"\nApart from one bout of food poisoning which cut short his journey to Bordeaux, Mike has managed to make it all the way from city to city.\nDescribing himself as a typical \"weekend warrior\" cyclist, Mike said he was motivated to push on by thinking of the charity Tŷ Hafan, which he is raising money for.\n\"We went down to the hospice on the first day of the trip and it just hit you like a brick. So I just felt I wanted to do some more for them,\" he said.\n\"That's what kept me pedalling when I thought I might want to take the train, it made me carry on.\"\nMike said he was spurred on by the \"fantastic\" locals and picturesque countryside.\n\"I can't really speak French, but we make do, and everybody's been lovely, shown lots of kindness to me along the way,\" he said.\n\"I also took some mountain paths, and had about two days where I saw nobody, and the wildlife was amazing.\n\"I was seeing otters, beavers - one surreal morning I came out by the canal and there was a crayfish on the path, just waving his claws at me.\n\"Ten metres along, another crayfish, and for about a mile there were just crayfish all along the way, really angry, some with their claws in the air giving it some.\"\nMike added: \"That was a bit bizarre. But it's been lovely, and the countryside is so beautiful.\"\nHis trip will end this week as he returns to Wales, and Mike said he doesn't plan on returning - despite it being the \"best five weeks\" of his life.\n\"My son Sam did ask if I was going to - but to be honest, I think my wife Kate might not be there if I go back out again,\" he laughed.\n\"I risk scurvy as well - I haven't eaten anything but croissants and kebabs for five weeks.

{"title": "Harry Maguire praises David Beckham over career advice", "date": "2023-10-11 05:09:32", "text": "\nLast updated on 30 minutes ago30 minutes ago.From the section England\nHarry Maguire says a call from David Beckham \"meant everything\" after being jeered by Scotland fans.\nThe England centre-back scored an own goal as a substitute in last month's 3-1 friendly win in Glasgow, while every touch he took was cheered ironically. \n\"I actually spoke with David about three weeks ago, after the game,\" Maguire, 30, said.\n\"He got in touch with me so it was really nice of him and I really appreciated that.\"\nThe Manchester United defender added: \"It meant everything. I've spoken throughout my career about David Beckham being someone I looked up to and watched when I was a young boy. \n\"It shows how classy he is to reach out to me and to message me. It was something I really appreciate. It was touching really.\"\nBeckham, England's third-most capped men's player with 115 international appearances, captained his country for six years from 2000, leading them at two World Cups.\nMaguire added: \"He reminded me of the career I've had to date and the big moments I've had in my career.\n\"I think when you're going through tough moments you've got to go through past experiences and past memories and where you've gone in your career and what you've been through.\n\"Every career is so up and down, especially when you reach what I've reached, in terms of being the captain of the biggest club in the world for three and a half years. He's been in that position and knows what it's like.\" \nMaguire, who was the world's most expensive defender when he joined Manchester United from Leicester for £80m in 2019, has won 59 England caps and scored seven international goals.\nBut he has struggled for game time at Old Trafford since the appointment in 2022 of Erik ten Hag as manager - even having the captaincy taken from him.\nThe defender's game time has increased lately because of injuries in the United squad; he started last Saturday, assisting the winning goal for Scott McTominay as Brentford were beaten 2-1 in the Premier League.\nMaguire says he knows that even the best players in the world get criticised. \n\"I have had some huge plaudits over the years playing for my country,\" he said.\n\"Probably the last year or so hasn't been like that but the previous five I was getting loads and loads of credit.\n\"That's football, that's the way it works. You don't just keep playing at the top and not get no criticism. That doesn't happen unless you are the best in the world and that's probably Messi and Ronaldo, and even they still get criticised as well. \n\"There has been a lot of talk about me over the last year. For that talk to happen, you have got to have built your way up to be a top performer like I've done over the previous five years to that. \n\"Things haven't gone to plan over the last year or so but I am sure it will get back on track.\n\"A career is a long path. Many ups, many downs, it probably has been a little blip and I am trying to be back to where I was.\"\nThe defender also said the \"faith\" shown in him by England manager Gareth Southgate and his team-mates makes him feel important. \nHowever he said the criticism he had received \"probably affects my family and friends more than it affects myself, especially when I am playing in a game\".\nMaguire's mother posted a statement after his treatment in the Scotland game in support of her son.\n\"Obviously, the last year has been a little bit difficult for them to enjoy the games as they did in the previous eight or nine years of my career,\" he said.\n\"I'm sure that will change.

{"title": "Maguire: Beckham called to offer advice after criticism", "date": "2023-10-11 07:12:46", "text": "\nLast updated on 7 hours ago7 hours ago.From the section England\nHarry Maguire says a call from David Beckham \"meant everything\" after being jeered by Scotland fans.\nThe England centre-back scored an own goal as a substitute in last month's 3-1 friendly win in Glasgow, while every touch he took was cheered ironically. \n\"I actually spoke with David about three weeks ago, after the game,\" Maguire, 30, said.\n\"He got in touch with me so it was really nice of him and I really appreciated that.\"\nThe Manchester United defender added: \"It meant everything. I've spoken throughout my career about David Beckham being someone I looked up to and watched when I was a young boy. \n\"It shows how classy he is to reach out to me and to message me. It was something I really appreciate. It was touching really.\"\nBeckham, England's third-most capped men's player with 115 international appearances, captained his country for six years from 2000, leading them at two World Cups.\nHe was sent off at the 1998 World Cup after kicking out at Argentina's Diego Simeone. The team went on to lose the last-16 match on penalties and Beckham became a target for abuse from fans who blamed him for England's exit.\n\"The whole country hated me,\" he said in his recent Netflix documentary. \"Wherever I went, I got abuse every single day. I was a mess.\"\nMaguire added: \"He reminded me of the career I've had to date and the big moments I've had in my career.\n\"I think when you're going through tough moments you've got to go through past experiences and past memories and where you've gone in your career and what you've been through.\n\"Every career is so up and down, especially when you reach what I've reached, in terms of being the captain of the biggest club in the world for three and a half years. He's been in that position and knows what it's like.\" \nMaguire, who was the world's most expensive defender when he joined Manchester United from Leicester for £80m in 2019, has won 59 England caps and scored seven international goals.\nBut he has struggled for game time at Old Trafford since the appointment in 2022 of Erik ten Hag as manager - even having the captaincy taken from him.\nMaguire looked set to join West Ham this summer after a £30m fee was agreed between the clubs, but chose to stay and fight for his place in the first team.\n\"Regular game time is important to me and has been throughout all of my career,\" Maguire said when later asked about the move.\n\"The opportunity to go to West Ham wasn't agreed between both clubs and myself. The actual opportunity wasn't there as we didn't get far enough down the line. West Ham are a massive club. I want to fight for my place but game time is important for me.\"\nThe defender's game time has increased lately because of injuries in the United squad; he started last Saturday, assisting the winning goal for Scott McTominay as Brentford were beaten 2-1 in the Premier League.\nMaguire says he knows that even the best players in the world get criticised. \n\"I have had some huge plaudits over the years playing for my country,\" he said.\n\"Probably the last year or so hasn't been like that but the previous five I was getting loads and loads of credit.\n\"That's football, that's the way it works. You don't just keep playing at the top and not get criticism. That doesn't happen unless you are the best in the world and that's probably Messi and Ronaldo, and even they still get criticised as well. \n\"There has been a lot of talk about me over the last year. For that talk to happen, you have got to have built your way up to be a top performer like I've done over the previous five years to that. \n\"Things haven't gone to plan over the last year or so but I am sure it will get back on track.\n\"A career is a long path. Many ups, many downs, it probably has been a little blip and I am trying to be back to where I was.\"\nThe defender also said the \"faith\" shown in him by England manager Gareth Southgate and his team-mates makes him feel important. \nHowever he said the criticism he had received \"probably affects my family and friends more than it affects myself, especially when I am playing in a game\".\nMaguire's mother posted a statement in support of her son after his treatment in the Scotland game.\n\"The last year has been a little bit difficult for them to enjoy the games as they did in the previous eight or nine years of my career,\" he said.\n\"I'm sure that will change. I'll keep working hard and keep fighting for my place and keep trying to put things right.\"\nEngland face Australia in a friendly on Friday, before taking on Italy in a European Championship qualifier four days later.\nStephen Graham and Vinette Robinson star in a heart-racing drama set in London\nGo inside the cordon with Gwent Police's dedicated forensic collision investigators\nTen new queens show their charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent\nBody worn cameras were supposed to increase transparency in policing\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnly three points separate the Premier League top four which gives all of them hope, says MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer.\n \n \n \n \nGet latest scores and headlines sent straight to your phone, sign-up to our newsletter and learn where to find us on online.\nThe latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.\nAnalysis and opinion from our chief football writer.\nHow to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK."}
{"title": "Australian Cheng Lei freed from China detention", "date": "2023-10-11 07:54:20", "text": "Journalist Cheng Lei has returned home to Australia after more than three years of detention in China. \n\"She was met at the airport by the Foreign Minister Penny Wong,\" Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, announcing her release. \nCheng Lei, 48, was working as a business reporter for China's state-run English language TV station CGTN when she was arrested on 13 August 2020.\nShe was later accused of \"illegally supplying state secrets overseas\".\nHer charges were never made public. \nMs Cheng was freed as frosty relations between Canberra and Beijing appear to be thawing. Tensions between the two countries deepened during the pandemic, which led to a Chinese ban on Australian exports like barley, coal, and timber. Those blocks were lifted earlier this year, the first signs of a gradual easing of the diplomatic impasse.\nOn Wednesday, following Ms Cheng's release, Mr Albanese said it would facilitate his trip to China at a \"mutually agreed time\" this year. \nHe added that Ms Cheng has been reunited with her two children in Melbourne. \n\"Her return brings an end to a very difficult few years for her family. The government has been seeking this for a long period of time and her return will be warmly welcomed not just by her family and friends but by all Australians,\" Mr Albanese said, adding that he spoke to Ms Cheng over the phone earlier on Wednesday.\nHe noted that her case \"was concluded through the legal processes in China\". \nAfter her arrest in China,Ms Cheng spent the first six months of her detention in solitary confinement without charge. \nLast March, she was tried in secret in a Chinese court. Australia's ambassador to China Graham Fletcher, tried unsuccessfully to gain entry to the court to witness proceedings. Her family also did not know the charges she faced.\nChina's Ministry of State Security said on Wednesday that Ms Cheng was deported after serving a sentence of two years and 11 months. She had pleaded guilty to her charges, it added. Beijing has not said when she was sentenced. But it's likely that the time Ms Cheng spent in detention before she was tried early last year is being counted towards her sentence.\nBorn in China, Ms Cheng migrated with her family to Melbourne, Australia, when she was 10 for her father to pursue a PhD programme. She later returned to China and joined CGTN in 2012. \nIn August, she spoke publicly for the first time about her imprisonment in an open letter to the people of Australia, which had been dictated to a group of diplomats who were able to speak with her each month. \n\"I miss the sun. In my cell, the sunlight shines through the window, but I can stand in it for only 10 hours a year. I can't believe I used to avoid the sun when I was living back in Australia… It'll probably rain the first two weeks I'm back in Melbourne.\"\n\"I haven't seen a tree in three years,\" she said. \nSome critics have long accused China of using prisoners as political bargaining chips. \nCanadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were also detained in China between 2018 and 2021, accused of espionage.  \nThey were released hours after the US extradition request against Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou was dropped, although Beijing denied any connection between the two matters. \nOne other Australian, Yang Hengjun, remains imprisoned in China under national security charges. \nHe was charged in August 2019 with espionage, and tried in May 2021. He has not been formally sentenced. \nAustralian journalist held in China: I miss sunshine\n1,000 days imprisoned in China for an unknown reason\nGaza's only power plant runs out of fuel during Israeli siege\nOlympic gold medallist Retton 'fighting for life'\nAustralian Cheng Lei freed from China detention\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Kenyan publisher recalls book after uproar over Prophet Muhammad image", "date": "2023-10-11 09:13:29", "text": "A Kenyan publisher has withdrawn a school book that included a drawing depicting Prophet Muhammad following an outcry by Muslim leaders and parents.\nThey complained that it was blasphemous to draw the prophet and to ask pupils to colour in the illustration. \nMentor Publishing Company said it regretted the \"grave\" mistake in the book on Islamic studies for pupils in the second year of primary school.\nAbout 11% of Kenyans are Muslims, the second largest religious group.  \nDepictions of the Prophet Muhammad can cause serious offence to Muslims, with most of Islamic religious leaders saying that tradition explicitly forbids images of Prophet Muhammad and Allah (God).\nA Muslim scholar from the coastal city of Mombasa, Sheikh Rishard Rajab Ramadhan, told the BBC that the book \"dangerously\" misled young children. \n\"No-one should imagine, leave alone attempt, to draw Prophet Muhammad. This can even cause war,\" Mr Ramadhan said.   \nIn a letter to the Muslim community, the publisher said it had come to its attention that the content in one of its books, Mentor Encyclopaedia Grade 2, was \"sacrilegious to the Islamic faith\". \nThe drawing had been \"inadvertently inserted\" in the book, and \"mistakenly identified it as the image of Prophet Muhammad\", said Mentor director Josephine Wanjuki.\n\"We sincerely and wholeheartedly apologise for the error and we commit to ensure that such an error will never be repeated,\" she added. \nThe publisher said it would immediately remove the offensive drawing from all subsequent editions and has committed to work with the Muslim Education Council to review all its books.\nAll teachers, students and school administrators holding copies of the book have been advised to return them to the publisher. \nMr Ramadhan welcomed the move to recall copies of the book, but urged publishers to consult Muslim leaders before publishing Islamic books. \nReligious studies are part of the curriculum in Kenyan schools.  \nThe issue of depicting Prophet Muhammad has been a long-running controversy and has inflamed tensions, especially in Europe. \nIn 2020, a school teacher in France's capital, Paris, Samuel Patywas was beheaded after using cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a lesson about freedom of speech.\nIn 2021, a teacher at a school in the British town of Batley was suspended after protests from Muslim parents for showing an \"inappropriate\" cartoon of  Prophet Muhammad. \nThe teacher was later reinstated. An investigation found the teacher did not intend to cause offence by showing the image. \nThere is no specific or explicit ban in the Quran, the holy book of Islam, on images Prophet Muhammad. \nBut there is a reference to not depicting Allah and many Muslims believe the same applies to Prophet Muhammad.\nBlasphemy row in France over teen's post on Islam\nProphet Muhammad cartoon sparks protest at school\nGaza's only power plant runs out of fuel during Israeli siege\nOlympic gold medallist Retton 'fighting for life'\nAustralian Cheng Lei freed from China detention\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "I'll get tough on MPs blocking housing, says Keir Starmer", "date": "2023-10-11 10:43:34", "text": "This video can not be played\nWatch: the Labour leader outlines Labour's plans on housebuilding\nLabour will need to override local opposition to deliver its plans for more housing, Sir Keir Starmer has warned.\nThe Labour leader told the BBC he would \"bulldoze away\" restrictive planning rules, and take on MPs and councils to build more homes.\nHe added that previous governments had been too fearful of local opposition to deliver the homes the country needs.  \nBuilding more housing is a question of \"social justice,\" he said.\nHe added that it was understandable that individual MPs would want to \"stand up\" for residents in their local areas. \nBut he added: \"The role of government is obviously different. The role of government is to deliver on big projects.\"\nIn his speech to the party's annual conference on Tuesday, Sir Keir promised that, if elected, Labour would deliver more homes to \"build a new Britain\".\nThe hour-long address, which was interrupted by a protester showering the Labour leader with glitter, came on the penultimate day of the four-day gathering in Liverpool.\nThe party has tried to use the event to showcase its offer to voters ahead a general election expected next year. \nSir Keir said a victory for Labour, which has a commanding lead in opinion polls, could herald a \"decade of national renewal\" after 13 years of Tory-led government.\nAt the heart of the speech was a plan to use dedicated state-backed companies to build a wave of new towns near English cities, echoing those built by Labour after the World War Two.\nHe also said he would restrict the ability of councils to stop developments on under-used urban land, where developers can meet the criteria in a new planning rulebook encouraging Georgian-style townhouse blocks.\nSpeaking on to the BBC, he said the \"very localised\" nature of England's planning system was \"one of the problems we have\".\n\"There isn't the ability to look across a wider area and say: 'Where would the best place be for this development?',\" he added.\nDelivering more homes, he conceded, would sometimes require taking on MPs and local councils opposed to new developments.\nAsked if he would be prepared to tell local opponents of projects: \"We hear you, but I'm afraid we're ignoring you,\" the Labour leader replied: \"Yes. We're going to have to do that.\"\nHe added, however, this would not be a \"crude exercise\", insisting the government would have to get the \"balance right\" when it came to factoring in opposition to plans.\n\"We are going to have to do things that previous governments haven't done,\" he said, including \"bulldozing away\" restrictive planning rules.\n\"Otherwise we'll end up where we are now, which is talking about housing - this is the story of the last 13 years - but not actually getting very much done.\"\nThe Labour leader has not said where or how many \"new towns\" it would build, saying it would run a six-month consultation inviting bids from councils.\nLocal authorities taking part would be able to put the affordable housing built towards meeting their housing quotas, under the party's plans.\nLabour has set a target to build 1.5m homes in England in five years if elected, broadly matching the government's current ambition of delivering 300,000 new units a year from the mid-2020s.\nAsked how Labour's plan was different, Sir Keir said it had accompanied its proposals with a \"plan for delivery\".\nAdding that his commitments had been \"robustly tested,\" he said he was only prepared to put \"bombproofed\" proposals before voters at an election. \nHe added he was confident a future Labour government would get \"more bids than we think\" from councils to take part in its new homes programme. \nStarmer promises to build new towns and 1.5m homes\nGaza's only power plant runs out of fuel during Israeli siege\nOlympic gold medallist Retton 'fighting for life'\nAustralian Cheng Lei freed from China detention\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "1999 Cricket World Cup semi-final: Allan Donald on one of cricket's 'greatest games'", "date": "2023-10-11 10:47:49", "text": "\nLast updated on 3 hours ago3 hours ago.From the section Cricketcomments24\n\"Even now, after all this time, I can still picture her face.\"\nAllan Donald is talking about a moment that refuses to leave him.\nIt took place 24 years ago under blue Birmingham skies. And despite taking 602 wickets for South Africa across a 12-year career, this one act has come to define him.\n\"I remember so much from that day but it's that little girl's face that stands out,\" recalls Donald.\n\"Her head in her hands, she was weeping. I remember being dragged off the field by security guards. My legs were like jelly, I could barely walk. All I kept thinking was, 'I let this little girl down'.\"\nEvery cricket fan knows the score. Not just the numbers - Australia's 213 all out against South Africa's 213 all out - but what it meant to the game. What it still means.\nAt the time it was the 15th tied ODI and the first ever in a World Cup. By virtue of Australia's superior run-rate in the competition they advanced to the final where they beat Pakistan.\nThe fate of South African cricket would take a different route, one that is littered with near-misses and heartache. There were disappointments in 1992 and 1996, but 1999 was the start of something insidious. The Proteas still haven't advanced past the semi-final of a major tournament.\n\"I suppose it hurts more because it was tied,\" Donald says. \"It adds to the drama. After the 2019 World Cup final, which was just unbelievable, it's probably the greatest game of cricket of all time. It will live on forever and to be a part of that is really special. It feels like I played a leading role in this epic movie.\"\nDonald had two major parts. The first saw him take 4-32 from 10 overs. At the other end, Donald's great strike partner, Shaun Pollock, returned 5-36 to set an experienced but misfiring batting unit a gettable target.\nWhen Herschelle Gibbs and Gary Kirsten knocked 48 off the target in no time, the game looked as good as won.\n\"We were a brilliant side,\" Donald says of a team that had been shaped by captain Hansie Cronje and coach Bob Woolmer. \"Sometimes it just doesn't work out.\"\nSometimes the opposition has Shane Warne. The legendary leg-spinner bowled Gibbs from a different postcode, beat Kirsten in the flight to squeeze under a slog-sweep and had Cronje caught at first slip. \nThe match seesawed one way and then the other until Lance Klusener crashed two consecutive fours in the final over to take the scores level with just a wicket remaining.\n\"I can still remember how hard he hit it,\" said Donald, the last man in, who was standing 22 yards away when Klusener smoked it through the covers a second time.\nThis made the number 11's job easier. He wouldn't have to use his bat. All he had to do was hold onto it and complete a single run.\nThe next ball, Donald set off like a startled deer after a Klusener mishit. Darren Lehmann's underarm lob at the non-striker's end failed to find its target.\nIt wasn't long ago that Donald found it impossible to talk about what came next.\nA full ball from over the wicket. A bunt down the ground. This time Klusener ran. Donald didn't. Not until it was too late. As he turned to face his destiny, he dropped his bat.\nAnd as he set off with all the enthusiasm of a man facing the gallows, he watched as Adam Gilchrist completed the run-out before a swarm of canary yellow shirts enveloped the frame. \nSomewhere in the crowd a little girl cupped her head in her hands and began to weep.\n\"I needed therapy to get over it,\" Donald explains, going quiet. \"I couldn't watch it. I couldn't talk about it. But I got over it. It's become part of me.\"\nHe used a behavioural therapy technique called 'flooding' whereby traumatic or anxiety-provoking images are played on repeat until they are no longer debilitating. It's a well-worn practice for patients with advanced phobias or post-traumatic stress.\n\"The more I saw it, it helped,\" Donald says. \"It will never leave YouTube so I had to learn to live with it. I think it was a good thing that I was playing for Warwickshire at the time. It meant I could create a little distance. I know a lot of people back in South Africa were hurting and they blamed me.\"\nNot that he could avoid it forever. When he did return home to resume his duties as the leader of South Africa's attack, he found that years of dedicated service couldn't shield him from abuse.\n\"I remember standing on the fine-leg boundary in Pretoria and copping it from South Africa fans,\" he says. \"Hey Allan, will you run this time?' 'Hey Allan, where's your bat?' 'It got a lot worse than that.\"\nWhatever happened to that bat? Did he burn it? Throw it in the Indian Ocean? It turns out its intact somewhere in the UK.\n\"That year, 1999, was my benefit year at Warwickshire and I put it up for auction at a golf day in London,\" Donald reveals. \"I had it signed by the South African team. For no particular reason. It's not because I dropped my bat. It went for £4,000.\"\nStill, the emotions his failure elicited were impacting. He speaks about the \"brutality of sport\" as if the course of an athlete's career is partially shaped by forces beyond their control.\nHe partially accepted the vitriol from passionate fans despite the \"sickening feelings\" those responses gave. \n\"You have to block it out,\" says Donald. \"You can't react. I actually got goosebumps watching the David Beckham documentary on Netflix. What he went through in 1998 after he got that red card against Argentina - which obviously was never a red card - was so similar to what I went through.\n\"I'm not saying I was anywhere near as big as Beckham but it reminded me of how I felt. You feel alone and vulnerable. It's horrible. I have so much admiration for Beckham after watching that. I'd love to meet him one day and talk about what we both experienced.\"\nDonald credits Cronje and the cohesion in the side for helping him work through his suffering. \n\"Eventually it fades but the memories stay,\" he continues. \"I'm reminded of it constantly. Even here at the current World Cup [Donald is with Bangladesh as a bowling coach] I get a few quips. The Aussie fans never let me forget it.\n\"I was speaking at an event a while ago and they took questions from the audience. All anyone wanted to talk about was that moment. I asked the crowd, 'Does anyone know how many wickets I took in that match?' Not one person could tell me. \n\"But I'm not angry. I'm proud of my career and that moment has, in a way, shaped my life. I talk about it with the young players I coach and I talk about it with my daughter. She's a top runner - marathons and long distance. And when we talk about hardship or working through difficult moments I refer to that day.\n\"Obviously I'd have wanted it to go differently but to be involved in that game is something I'll always be grateful for. But until South Africa win a World Cup, dropping my bat will be part of the Proteas story. They've got a chance this time. They've got an outstanding batting unit. Maybe they can finally do it.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnly three points separate the Premier League top four which gives all of them hope, says MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer.\n \n \n \n \nWant to get into cricket?

{"title": "Covid: Boris Johnson refused talks with Drakeford and Sturgeon", "date": "2023-10-11 11:05:36", "text": "Boris Johnson thought it was \"wrong\" for the prime minister to hold regular meetings with Mark Drakeford and Nicola Sturgeon during the pandemic. \nThe comments have been revealed in his evidence to the Covid inquiry.\nWales' first minister had been frustrated at the number of meetings he had with the Westminster government.\nBut Mr Johnson feared working closely with first ministers could make the UK look like a \"mini-EU of four nations\".\n\"That is not, in my view, how devolution is supposed to work,\" he said.\nWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own governments which have different levels of control over their own affairs.\nSometimes known as the devolved administrations (DAs), all three had their own lockdown rules which differed more from the UK government's in England as the pandemic went on.\nAfter initially chairing emergency COBR meetings with the heads of three nations at the beginning of the pandemic, Boris Johnson passed the responsibility on to Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. \nIn written evidence to the inquiry Mr Johnson said: \"I did chair some of the four nation COBRs, but I was content to let Michael lead.\"\nApart from the workload, he said there were \"two good reasons\" for this, \"one of principle and one practical.\"\n\"It is optically wrong, in the first place, for the UK prime minister to hold regular meetings with other DA first ministers, as though the UK were a kind of mini-EU of four nations and we were meeting as a 'council' in a federal structure.\n\"That is not, in my view, how devolution is meant to work.\"\nFederalism is where power is more equally divided between central and regional governments. \nThat is not the case in the UK, where ultimate power still lies with the central government in Westminster despite the three devolved nations being permitted to make their own decisions.\nMr Drakeford wrote to the UK government in April 2020 asking for a \"regular rhythm\" to meetings between the devolved nations and the Westminster government.\nBut it is clear there was a difference of opinion within government about how to deal with the devolved authorities.\nMinisters were concerned that regular meetings would not necessarily mean that the devolved administrations would agree with their approach to Covid.\nThere was a warning in one meeting of UK government ministers, where Mr Drakeford's request was discussed, that regular meetings with Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland could be a \"potential federalist trojan horse\".\nIn minutes of the meeting, the then-Secretary of State for Wales, Simon Hart, was \"nervous\" about excluding the three countries from decisions, and thought they as a government \"could possibly engage more than we are at the moment\".\nBut it noted that he did think that Mr Drakeford was \"positioning himself for next year's assembly elections\".\nThis video can not be played\nMark Drakeford called Boris Johnson 'awful' after a virtual meeting with the PM, which featured in an S4C documentary.\nThe Scottish Secretary, Alistair Jack, thought that \"working at official level would be better\" than with the heads of government as it \"would avoid Scottish FM grandstanding\". \nIn WhatsApp messages, Boris Johnson's former adviser, Dominic Cummings, advised the prime minister to chair daily meetings from Downing Street's Cabinet Room and not \"with the DAs [devolved administrations] on the [expletive] phone all the time either so people can't tell you the truth\".\nSpeaking to the Covid inquiry on Monday, politics expert Professor Ailsa Henderson of Edinburgh University said there was a \"fear of federalism, there is a fear of leaks\", that the UK government perceived a \"self-serving nature to the motives of the devolved administrations\".\nShe said the minutes of  the meeting of UK government ministers was \"the most remarkable document I have read in a number of years\"\nThere was no suggestion, she said, \"that it might improve decision-making if more voices from more parts of the UK were included\".\nBoris Johnson's believed that the divergence in policies between the four nations became \"a growing presentational problem\".\nIn his written testimony, he said he regrets not using civil contingencies legislation rather than public health legislation for Covid laws. \nThis would mean that only the UK government could have decided on the rules around Covid, preventing the devolved governments from pursuing their own policies. \nHe says there was \"always a risk\" that the devolved governments \"would diverge and choose a more restrictive measure, or one that was perhaps different for the sake of being different\". \nIn his written testimony, the former Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething said that the meetings between governments were not an \"open discussion that treated other governments as equals\".\nJohnson accused of chaotic flip-flopping in Covid\nCovid Inquiry focuses on government as stakes

Together I hope we can hold the government to account.\"\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"Delivering accommodation sites such as the Bibby Stockholm will be more affordable for taxpayers, helping to reduce the £8m daily cost of hotels as well as being more manageable for local communities.\n\"We're confident that the project, which will house asylum seekers in safe and secure accommodation, meets the planning requirements\"\nThe 222-room barge, chartered by the government for 18 months, arrived at the port in July.\nIt was previously used to accommodate homeless people and asylum seekers in Germany and the Netherlands.\nResidents in Portland have objected to the barge, voicing concerns that the local community was not consulted.\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Derby were relegated to League One and Rooney left in June 2022 with the club still in administration.\nHe returns to England after just over a year with Washington-based DC United.\n\"I am absolutely delighted to be joining Birmingham City at such an exciting time,\" Rooney said.\n\"It is very clear that they have a plan and are committed to realising their ambition for the club.\"\nRooney added that he and Blues are \"fully aligned\" on what is expected of him and says the \"challenging environments\" he has put himself in has \"got me ready for this opportunity\".\n\"It's a project that gives me a sense of purpose and I can't wait to get started,\" he said.\n\"I have a clear way that I want the team to play, and my coaching staff and I will work hard to implement it. We will create a winning culture here with an identity that gets Blues fans on their feet.\n\"My job is to elevate the club to the next level. I know what the expectations are and our job is to deliver.\"\nBirmingham chief executive Garry Cook called Rooney's appointment a \"defining moment\" for the club before adding the new boss will work straight away with technical director Craig Gardner in evaluating the squad and identifying potential transfer targets in January.\nBirmingham are the longest serving occupants of the Championship, having completed the third of their short stays in the Premier League in 2011.\nThat was the same year they beat Arsenal at Wembley to win the League Cup, making them the last West Midlands side to lift a trophy.\nThis is their 13th successive attempt at getting back to the top flight but they have only once gone close to a return, their first season back in the second tier under Chris Hughton in 2011-12, when they were beaten by Ian Holloway's Blackpool in the play-offs.\nSince then, despite the efforts of 10 different bosses, they have come closer to relegation than promotion - twice staying up on the final day, under Lee Clark in 2014 and Harry Redknapp in 2017.\nBut they are handily placed this season and sixth in the table having won three of their first four league games and then twice last week, to edge within two points of third-placed Preston.\nAnalysis - BBC Radio WM's Birmingham City reporter Richard Wilford\nFor Wayne Rooney this will be a different challenge - the timing of the managerial change points to high expectations at St Andrew's and the sort of pressure he was more accustomed to during his playing career.\nBlues have afforded him a large backroom staff, and the presence of former Wolves midfielder Carl Robinson and Rooney's Derby and DC United colleague Pete Shuttleworth is every bit as important as the bigger names Cole and O'Shea. They add some coaching and analytical experience to the mix.\nHe inherits a good squad, arguably the best the club has fielded since Chris Hughton was at the helm more than a decade ago. \nNow Rooney must show that he can continue pushing the club forward towards a future in the Premier League.\nEverything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.\nThe latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.\nAnalysis and opinion from our chief football writer.\nHow to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK.\nStephen Graham and Vinette Robinson star in a heart-racing drama set in London\nGo inside the cordon with Gwent Police's dedicated forensic collision investigators\nTen new queens show their charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent\nBody worn cameras were supposed to increase transparency in policing\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnly three points separate the Premier League top four which gives all of them hope, says MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer.\n \n \n \n "}
{"title": "Teach primary pupils real-world maths - Labour", "date": "2023-10-11 11:31:54", "text": "Labour has set out plans to teach \"real world\" maths skills in primary schools.\nIt wants children to start learning financial literacy - including budgeting - from the age of four. \nShadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson told the party's conference in Liverpool there was a \"chronic cultural problem with maths\".\nReferencing Rishi Sunak's desire to make the subject compulsory until 18, she said Labour would make sure it was \"better taught at six, never mind 16\".\n\"If young people hate maths at 16, it's just too late,\" she told the final day of the conference in Liverpool. \nUnder her plans, which cover England, teachers would get extra training funded by ending some tax breaks for private schools.\nMs Phillipson said she was determined to \"bring maths to life for the next generation\", saying young people needed numeracy for life and for work. \n\"Be it budgeting or cooking, exchange rates or payslips, maths matters for success.\n\"Maths is the language of the universe, the underpinning of our collective understanding. It cannot be left till the last years of school.\"\nLabour says poor maths skills in childhood can embed problems that last into adulthood, such as the inability to analyse basic graphs or to calculate the value of supermarket offers. \nAn OECD estimate in 2016 found that nine million working-age adults in England had low basic literacy or numeracy skills - costing the economy an estimated £25bn a year. \nMs Phillipson said Labour would be \"the party of high and rising standards\" for children from all backgrounds, because background should be \"no barrier to opportunity\".\nAs part of a pre-planned review of the school curriculum, Labour said it would direct teachers to show children how numeracy was used in the world around them.\nPupils would be taught maths through concepts like household budgeting, currency exchange rates when going on holiday, sports league tables and cookery recipes.\nInstead of hiring specialist maths teachers, primary school staff would be retrained and supported by \"maths champions\", the party said.\nA study by education charity the Education Endowment Foundation found children in nurseries employing a \"maths champion\" made three extra months of progress in maths, on average.\nLatest numbers show about 25% of pupils do not meet the expected maths level by the end of primary school.\nLatest figures also show maths teacher numbers are 9% higher than in 2012, but shortages have been reported across the country.\nMs Phillipson also told the conference she was determined to carry out \"ambitious reform to ensure early education is available in every corner of our country for every family and every child\".\nSir David Bell, a former permanent secretary at the Department for Education and former chief inspector of schools, would develop a new early years plan, she announced.  \nLabour's plans were broadly welcomed by a number of teachers' unions.\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"We welcome the ambition expressed by the shadow education secretary and her acknowledgement of some of serious issues facing schools.\"\nBut he added it was \"vital that Labour engages with the profession in fleshing out its proposals\".\nNational Education Union general secretary Daniel Kebede said: \"Labour politicians are recognising that a reset between the teaching profession and government is required - and that very little of national government ambitions can be achieved without working with, and in partnership, with teachers.\"\nIn her conference speech, Ms Phillipson hit back at critics of Labour's plans to strip private schools of some of their tax exemptions.\nResponding to reports in the Guardian in June which suggested that officials at the Independent Schools Council (ISC) had described her as \"very chippy\" in private messages, she said: \"Chippy people make the change that matters.\"\nLast month, Labour backed down on its pledge to strip private schools of their charitable status.\nBut the party remains committed to its policy for England of charging 20% VAT on fees and ending the business rates relief from which private schools benefit.\nAn ISC spokeswoman said: \"We share Labour's goal of wanting the best outcomes for every child and we have been consistent in our offer to work together towards achieving this.\"\nSunak wants all pupils to study maths to 18\nStarmer promises to build new towns and 1.5m homes\nLabour backtracks on private school charity status\nGaza's only power plant runs out of fuel during Israeli siege\nOlympic gold medallist Retton 'fighting for life'\nAustralian Cheng Lei freed from China detention\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

Prosecutors decided it was not in the public interest to seek a retrial.\nJudge Lady Dorrian said Mr Hogg should not have been convicted due to a \"insufficiency of evidence\".\nHe had been found guilty of raping the girl, who is now 19 years old, after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow.\nIt was alleged that Mr Hogg, from Hamilton in South Lanarkshire, attacked her twice between March and June 2018. \nDonald Findlay KC earlier told the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh that Lord Lake did not follow correct legal procedures during the trial.\nMr Findlay said the judge had given jurors legal directions that the girl's evidence could be corroborated by the account of a man, who said she appeared to be \"distressed\" following the incident.\nThe lawyer said this had supported the girl's \"credibility\" and said it was wrong for Lord Lake to have told jurors this.\nMr Findlay added: \"It pains me to say this, but there has been a very significant miscarriage of justice at the hands of the judge.\"\nThe hearing was also told that the prosecution did not ask detailed questions about why the girl was distressed. \nMr Findlay said this resulted in the Crown being unable to corroborate her account of rape.\nHe told appeal judges Lady Dorrian, Lord Matthews and Lord Pentland that the judge's actions led to his client being wrongly convicted. \nThe Crown Office accepted that the judge misdirected the jury and said part of the verdict should be quashed.\nBut prosecutors argued that the jury still had enough evidence for Mr Hogg to be convicted of raping the girl on one occasion.\nHowever, the appeal judges agreed with the submissions made to them by Mr Findlay and the conviction was quashed.\nLady Dorrian said: \"The inevitable result of the appeal must be acquittal.\"\nMr Hogg had avoided jail after being found guilty by the jury at the trial in April.\nThe community sentence given by Lord Lake attracted widespread criticism from rape charities and other groups at the time.\nThe judge said that if Mr Hogg had committed the crime when he was over 25, he would have been jailed for four or five years.\nMr Hogg was also put under supervision and added to the sex offenders register following his conviction.\nFollowing his acquittal, the girl's lawyer Aamer Anwar said it had turned her life \"back six years to when she was 13\". \nIn a statement, he said: \"When the jury returned a verdict of guilty, she thought finally she could move on with her life. \n\"It is always the responsibility of the trial judge to formulate the appropriate legal directions to give a jury. \n\"In this case, the procedure adopted was manifestly unfair and prejudicial to the defence and, on this basis the appeal had to succeed.\"\nMr Anwar said it was \"important for his client\" that the Crown had not renounced its right to prosecute again if any new evidence became available.\nRapist who attacked girl, 13, appeals conviction\n'Unduly lenient' sentence of rapist to be appealed\nMan who raped girl, 13, given community sentence\nFife Labour and SNP at loggerheads over question time for leader’s report\nEdinburgh court: Violent thug jailed for shocking campaign of domestic abuse of girlfriend including Edinburgh attack\nMidlothian Councillors pause building homes to the Passivhaus standard\nEdinburgh police hunt man whothreatened members of the public anddemanded cash during attempted robberies\nConcert to take place at county church this month\nNeighbours heard screams as council worker was shot in her home\nGaza's only power plant runs out of fuel during Israeli siege\nOlympic gold medallist Retton 'fighting for life'\nAustralian Cheng Lei freed from China detention\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

Stories on the Sky News and ITV News websites mainly refer to Hamas militants or fighters, although ITV has also described them as terrorists.\nThe Israel-Gaza war has dominated the news since the weekend, when Hamas entered communities in Israel, killing at least 1,200 people and taking dozens of hostages.\nIsrael has responded by bombing Gaza, killing more than 1,000 people in air strikes, and cutting its supplies of electricity, fuel and water.\nThe corporation's editorial guidelines say the word \"terrorist\" can be \"a barrier rather than an aid to understanding\".\nThey say: \"We should convey to our audience the full consequences of the act by describing what happened.\n\"We should use words which specifically describe the perpetrator such as 'bomber', 'attacker', 'gunman', 'kidnapper', 'insurgent' and 'militant'.\n\"We should not adopt other people's language as our own; our responsibility is to remain objective and report in ways that enable our audiences to make their own assessments about who is doing what to whom.\"\nWhat is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?\nGaza's only power plant runs out of fuel during Israeli siege\nGaza's only power plant runs out of fuel during Israeli siege\nOlympic gold medallist Retton 'fighting for life'\nAustralian Cheng Lei freed from China detention\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

But there is no way to import fuel for generators either.\nThere is now little hope of leaving the territory, after Israeli crossings were shut and Egypt was forced to close its only crossing point with Gaza due to nearby air strikes. \nI tried to get my family out, because it is unclear what might happen here in the future - but that was impossible. \nIn the early hours of Tuesday morning, I woke up my three children, we grabbed our emergency kit and headed to the hospital. \nBut when we got there, hundreds of people were blocking the entrance - they too were looking for a place to shelter overnight. \nHalf-asleep children screamed as they stumbled through the streets with rockets flying overhead. \nOn Wednesday morning, Hamas said 30 people were killed in overnight strikes. In total, more than 1,000 Gazans have died in the retaliatory air strikes. \nIsrael's military said they had hit 450 targets in the Gaza strip in the past 24 hours. \nThe air strikes began after Hamas militants crossed into Israel and launched a wave of attacks on communities across the south of the country, killing at least 1,200 Israelis. An estimated 150 people have been taken hostage by Hamas. \nIsrael declared a \"complete siege\" on Gaza on Monday, declaring electricity, food, fuel and water would be cut off. The impacts of that siege can now be seen.\nOn Tuesday, I met a woman in a supermarket scouring the shelves looking for milk for her baby. She only had half a bottle left, but the supermarket was bare.\nAbout 80% of people in Gaza relied on humanitarian aid even before the latest war began - and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said at least a million people had not been able to get their food rations since Saturday.\nThe World Health Organisation has called for a humanitarian corridor to be opened into the territory. But here, civilians don't hold out hope that will happen. \nA leading British-Palestinian doctor, Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah, told the BBC the health system in Gaza would collapse within a week unless aid was allowed. \n\"All of the beds are full. Patients who need surgery are unable to go into surgery because the operating rooms are operating at maximum capacity,\" he said, adding that this was the bloodiest assault he had seen since he started working in Gaza over 40 years ago.\n\"Because people are being injured in their homes, around 30-40% of the injuries are children. Whole families are being brought in wounded... In war you try to discharge cases early so you can free up beds, but these patients are all coming from houses that have been destroyed and so you cannot send them back to the street,\" he said. \nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Driving through Gaza's streets\nHamas's leader said he would not negotiate prisoner swaps for food and medicine, and he would not negotiate with Israel while the territory was under fire.\nThe UN human rights chief has said sieges are illegal under international law. UN agencies have also condemned the mass killings by Hamas and called on them to release the hostages they have taken.\nAnd while Israel insists it is not targeting the civilian population in Gaza, the people here feel a decision to cut water, food, medical and electrical supplies to 2.3 million people is a collective punishment.\nPeople in Gaza know what war looks like, but this one feels different.\nGaza hospital deluged as Israel retaliates with strikes\nWhat is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?\nHiding at home, blinded and choked by dust - life in Gaza.

They are added during the boiling process to add bitterness and alcohol content, but can also be added afterwards to change the overall flavour. \nThe boom in the craft beer industry, increasing demand for beers with distinctive strong flavours, has pushed up the use of high-quality hops.\nBut this study, which looked at how the average yield of aroma hops changed between 1971 and 1994 and between 1995 and 2018, found that in some key hop-growing areas, there was a drop of nearly 20% in output. \nThe scientists, from the Czech Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Cambridge University, put the reduction in crop down to drier conditions - probably due to climate change - in recent years.\nMartin Mozny, co-author of the paper and research scientist at CAS, said: \"Failure to adapt will jeopardise the profitability of hop growing in some areas. The consequence will be lower production and a higher price for brewers.\" \nThe price of beer has already increased by 13% since the pandemic in 2020, due to an increase in energy costs driven by inflation, and the gas crisis following the invasion of Ukraine. \nThe scientists also found the alpha bitter acids of the hops - which influence the beer flavour - had reduced, due to higher and more extreme temperatures.\nDespite global efforts, greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have continued to increase temperatures. It is expected in the next five-to-seven years, that the crucial 1.5C barrier will be crossed. \nThe study predicts that the bitter acids will reduce by up to 31% by 2050. \nFarmers have been working to adapt their growing practices to improve yields, such as moving farms higher up valleys where there is more rainfall, and installing irrigation systems. But the study authors warn that further investment is needed, and say it will be necessary to expand the area used to grow aroma hops by 20%, to compensate for future decline.\nThe research has been published in the journal Nature Communications.\nKey crops face major shifts as world warms\nFive ways farmers are tackling climate change\nGaza's only power plant runs out of fuel during Israeli siege\nOlympic gold medallist Retton 'fighting for life'\nAustralian Cheng Lei freed from China detention\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

{"title": "Premier League: What impact has longer added time had on matches?", "date": "2023-10-11 13:55:27", "text": "\nLast updated on 59 minutes ago59 minutes ago.From the section Premier Leaguecomments82\nOver the opening eight weeks of the Premier League's 2023-24 season one of the main talking points has been the amount of added time in matches. \nEngland's refereeing body the PGMOL have opted to use longer amounts of stoppage time this season in a move aimed at tackling time-wasting.\nThat has resulted in top-flight matches, on average, running beyond 100 minutes.\nBut the new rules have been described by some as \"absurd\" and they have not been adopted in European competitions, with some players criticising the move on welfare grounds.\nSo, with eight gameweeks completed, what effect have they had on the Premier League?\nLong periods of extra time were first seen at the men's World Cup in Qatar last year.\nThat led to previously unheard of amounts of added time and some of the longest games in the tournament's history - with more than 27 minutes added on to England's match against Iran in the most extreme case.\nIn the eight matchdays, or 80 matches, since that policy was implemented in the Premier League at the start of this season, the average amount of added time in games stands at 11 minutes 33 seconds.\nAs you would expect, that is an increase on the 2022-23 average, which was eight minutes 27 seconds.\nThe longest game so far was Fulham's 3-1 victory over Sheffield United. That match finished after 113 minutes 54 seconds - although it was overshadowed by a serious injury to Blades defender Chris Basham.\nOne of the main driving forces of the clampdown on time wasting was the aim of ensuring the ball remains in play for longer.\nLast year, former referee Mark Clattenburg even suggested introducing 60-minute matches with a stop-clock to eradicate gamesmanship.\nThe figures, certainly as far as the Premier League is concerned, supported the idea. \nIn last season's competition, the average 'ball in play' time was 54 minutes 52 seconds - the lowest in more than a decade.\nHas the stricter approach had the desired affect?\nWell, so far, the evidence suggests it has, with Premier League matches seeing an average ball-in-play time of 58 minutes 48 seconds - an increase of almost four minutes.\nMore added time means more opportunity for late drama - and we have witnessed exactly that so far in the 2023-24 Premier League.\nThere have been a total of 32 injury time goals scored already this season - that is across both the first and second halves of matches - which accounts for 13.3% of the total number.\nFor comparison, there had been just 11 injury time goals scored after eight matchdays last season.\nThere were 84 injury time goals scored across the entire 2022-23 campaign - with that figure representing 7.7% of the total goals scored.\nWe have seen three of the five latest goals in Premier League history, with Arsenal's Gabriel Jesus (100:15), Aston Villa's Leon Bailey (100:09) and Tottenham's Dejan Kulusevski (99:53) all scoring deep into added time since August.\nThe introduction of the five substitute rule last season was one which Everton manager Sean Dyche said he believed would benefit bigger clubs, because of their ability to assemble stronger squads.\nBut, combined with the increased added time this campaign, does the data support that view?\nThe number of injury time goals in the second half of matches stands at 24 this season - which, with 30 matchdays remaining, is already almost half the total scored in the whole of last season (49). \nThis is a significant increase on this stage last season, when only five goals had been scored in second-half injury time.\nBut an overall trend is yet to emerge.\nJoint league leaders Arsenal and Tottenham, along with Aston Villa, lead the way for second half added time goals this term, with three each.\nThey are followed by Manchester United, Newcastle United and Liverpool - who like Arsenal all finished in last season's top five - and Brentford, each on two. A total of 14 of the 20 clubs have at least one.\nOnly eight matchdays in, there is time for different patterns to emerge. But, with an average of more than three minutes extra stoppage time per fixture, leading to a total amount of added time per matchday of close to two hours, it is clear the new rules have had a significant impact. \nStephen Graham and Vinette Robinson star in a heart-racing drama set in London\nGo inside the cordon with Gwent Police's dedicated forensic collision investigators\nTen new queens show their charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent\nBody worn cameras were supposed to increase transparency in policing\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnly three points separate the Premier League top four which gives all of them hope, says MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer.\n \n \n \n \nEverything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.\nThe latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.\nAnalysis and opinion from our chief football writer.\nHow to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK."}

The prime minister has promised his MPs a free vote on the issue, so it may need Labour backing if it is to pass through Parliament.\nMr Streeting said Labour aimed to create the \"healthiest generation that ever lived\".\nOn social care, he said a Labour government would create a national care service - at the moment, access to support such as places in care homes and help at home is means-tested so only the poorest receive state funding.\nThe first step towards this would be a workforce plan for social care and a review of pay.\nMr Streeting also urged the current government to return to the negotiating table to solve the pay dispute with doctors.\nWith no new strikes announced following last week's joint walkout last week by junior doctors and consultants, there was now a \"window of opportunity\", he said.\nBut he accused the prime minister of being more interested in exploiting the dispute than trying to solve it - Mr Sunak has blamed it for the failure to reduce the hospital waiting list.\nMr Streeting did not set out how a Labour government would resolve the dispute, however.\nThe government has given junior doctors an average rise of nearly 9%, and consultants 6%, in line with the independent pay review body's recommendations. \nBut the British Medical Association wants much more - as much as 35% for junior doctors.\nNHS waiting-list backlog will take years to clear\nIs this NHS crisis really worse than ones before?\nGaza's only power plant runs out of fuel during Israeli siege\nOlympic gold medallist Retton 'fighting for life'\nAustralian Cheng Lei freed from China detention\nHow festival massacre unfolded - from verified video and social media\nWho are the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel?\n'The terrorists have her and her babies'\nWatch: Driving through Gaza streets hit by Israeli strikes.

The public has also been reassured that the tree's stump has been protected.\nThe 50ft tree (15m), which was made famous in the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, will be taken to an unnamed National Trust property where it will be \"safely stored\".\nThe charity said seeds had been collected by specialist propagators at its Plant Conservation Centre, which could be used for new saplings.\nPart of Hadrian's Wall was also damaged when the tree came down, sometime between the evening of 27 September and morning of 28 September.\n\"It's currently in a precarious position resting on the wall, so it's necessary we move it now, both to preserve the world-famous monument that is Hadrian's Wall, and to make the site safe again for visitors,\" said Andrew Poad, general manager of the site.\n\"We've explored every option for moving the tree and while it isn't possible to lift it in one go, as the tree is multi-stemmed with a large crown, we have aimed to keep the trunk in as large sections as possible, to give us flexibility on what the tree becomes in future.\n\"We're encouraging people to stay away from the site while these complex and difficult operations take place.\"\nThe tree, which was seen as a symbol of Northumberland and a popular site for photographers and walkers due to its location inside a dramatic dip in the land, was planted by a previous landowner in the late 1800s.\nA Northumbria Police investigation continues and a 16-year-old boy and a man aged in his 60s arrested on suspicion of criminal damage remain on bail.\nThe National Trust has received thousands of tributes, messages and suggestions for the site and the felled tree.\n\"It's clear that this tree captured the imaginations of so many people who visited, and that it held a special - and often poignant - place in many people's hearts,\" Mr Poad said.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: The Sycamore Gap... then, and now\nIt hopes to involve the public over the coming weeks \"to find the best way\" of paying tribute to it. \n\"The nature of the site, which is designated by Unesco and is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, means our plans must be carefully thought through. We kindly ask people to please bear with us while we consider what might be possible,\" Mr Poad added.\nA temporary fence has been installed to protect the tree's stump, which the charity said may \"begin to sprout new shoots in time\". \nTony Gates, chief executive officer at the Northumberland National Park Authority, said there had been \"some challenging scenarios\" for the National Trust to consider due to the historic environment and the safety of the site.\n\"The intention is to ensure that the tree is stored safely so that full consideration can be given to how best to use the tree in future,\" he said.\n\"We would like to thank everyone for their patience, and we will continue to work with the National Trust to ensure that in time, Sycamore Gap's legacy lives on through a thriving landscape.\" \nFollow BBC North East & Cumbria on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.
