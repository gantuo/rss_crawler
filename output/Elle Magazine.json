{"title": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s Complete Relationship Timeline", "date": "2023-10-02 21:57:00", "text": "It’s a love story that could actually be a Hollywood rom-com: The top American pop singer and the top American football player meet up, sparks fly, and they end up dating with the world watching. Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce have dominated headlines since their romance was first rumored to be a thing, with Swift’s first appearance at Kelce’s game in Kansas City becoming one of the year’s most buzzed-about moments. \nWhile the two may not be official just yet, things are escalating quickly, and anything is possible in the future, sources have made clear.\nHere, the full history of their relationship that is known so far.\nKelce plays “Kiss, Marry, Kill” in an interview, with the choices being Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, and Taylor Swift. “Damn, that’s messed up. I don’t want to kill any of them,” he prefaced. He then answered, “Ariana is kill, unfortunately. I love you, but you’re gone. And then Taylor Swift would be the kiss, and then Katy Perry would be the—what’s the last one? Katy Perry would be the marry.” The interview resurfaced in 2023 as the dating rumors with Swift began to gain traction.\nKelce discusses shooting his shot and missing while attending Swift’s Eras Tour show in Kansas City, Missouri on his New Heights podcast with his brother Jason, an NFL player for the Philadelphia Eagles. Kelce’s remarks get media pickup.\n“I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings. So I was a little butthurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her,” Kelce said. “If you’re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are a friendship bracelets and I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it. All right now.”\nJason asked if his brother meant his jersey number or phone number. \n“You know which one,” Kelce answered. “She doesn’t meet anybody and at least she didn’t want to meet me so I, um, I took that personal. But it was an unbelievable show and I’ve only seen Arrowhead filled like that for Chiefs games with that much excitement, and yeah, everybody was dressed in pink and purple going crazy. It was a wild show.”\nSwift and Kelce’s romance takes off this month. Here’s the play-by-play (pun very much intended).\nSwift goes out in New York City, wearing Foundrae’s Forever & Always a Pair Pendant, which has an opal teardrop stone on it. Fans note later that opal is Kelce’s birth stone (he is a Libra), and the necklace may have been an easter egg.\nThe Messenger reports that Swift and Kelce have been spending time together. “Taylor and Travis have been quietly hanging out,” a source told the outlet. “She saw him when she was in NYC a few weeks ago.”\nThat same day, another source told Entertainment Tonight that Kelce isn’t Swift’s secret new boyfriend: They are “not officially dating.” Sources will continue to stress this in the coming weeks.\nKelce’s brother Jason adds fuel to dating rumors during his appearance on the TNF Nightcap’s post-game interview.\n“I’ve seen these rumors…I cannot comment,” he said, noting that “ever since Catching Kelce [Kelce’s 2016 E! dating series], everyone’s been infatuated with Travis’ love life, so, I don’t really know what’s going on there. I know Trav is having fun, we’ll see what happens with whoever he ends up with.”\nTony asked Jason about the Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift dating rumors 😂@TonyGonzalez88 | #TNFonPrime pic.twitter.com/iHHqDvWC9B\nThat same day, Kelce dodges questions about Swift during an interview with Andrew Siciliano. \n“I’m not gonna talk about my personal life,” Kelce said. “I know what you writers wanna hear, and you wanna hear more about that, and I’m not gonna give you anything.”\nJason jokingly confirms the Taylor-Travis dating rumors on Audacy’s SportsRadio 94 WIP. When asked about the gossip surrounding his brother and Swift, Jason said that “it’s hard to answer because I don’t really know a lot about Travis’ love life. I try to keep his business kind of his business, stay out of that world. But having said that, I think he’s doing great, and I think it’s all 100 percent true, and I hope this thing goes a mile.” Then he made it clear he was just kidding: “No, I’m joking, I don’t know what's happening.”\nThe Messenger also gets more intel on the relationship from Swift’s side that day.\n“She and Travis have hung out twice, and it’s nothing serious,” the source said. “She thinks he is very charming, and they have been texting this last week. He is a little embarrassed at how much attention they are getting, but he has told her he would love to continue seeing her.”\n“They are seeing where things go,” the source added, noting that Swift’s “friends are always playfully suggesting people to set her up with. [She’s] in her fun girl era and strictly having fun right now.”\nKelce says he invited Swift to his game during an interview with The Pat McAfee Show. She later does attend it.\n “It’s hilarious how much traction this has actually gotten, right now it’s like a game of telephone,” Kelce said of the dating rumors. “No one actually knows what’s going on, especially when you got [my brother] Jason Kelce on live television telling people both sides—he doesn’t know, it’s true, this and that.” \nRegarding his status with Swift, Travis gave a frank answer: “I threw it out there, I threw the ball in her court. I told her, you know, I’ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead [Stadium], you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one’s a little more lit. So, we’ll see what happens in the near future.”\nA source close to the situation tells E! that Swift and Kelce have no plans to see each other imminently, downplaying their closeness. \n“[They] met up once in New York,” the source said. “They’ve been texting and talking here and there but [have] no set plans to see each other again. It’s been very low-key as he’s been in season.” Obviously, that changes two days later.\nSwift takes up Kelce’s invitation and attends his game in Kansas City. She is photographed in the stands with his mom. Sources reveal later that it was her first time meeting his family, and it went well.\nSwift and Kelce are filmed leaving the game, marking the first video of them together.\nDaily Mail later reveals that Swift met Kelce’s friends and family at his home before going to the game. The outlet wrote that she spent an hour with them before boarding a party bus with them to the stadium. \nA source told Daily Mail, “Travis wasn’t at his house, but it was filled with his friends and family. He has a personal chef and several friends from high school and college who use his place as a crash pad whenever they are in town.”\nA source told People that day that, once again, Swift and Travis aren’t serious, but she was happy to see him play. \n“Taylor is very focused on work right now and hanging out with her girlfriends. Travis invited her to the game, and of course she said ‘yes,’” the source said. “She just thought it was a fantastic way to spend Sunday.”\nA source later added to People that “they’re having fun. This was Taylor’s first time meeting his mom and dad, and everyone was enjoying themselves. She was super chill and low-key hanging out with his friends and family.”\nKelce and Swift end their day celebrating with his teammates and family at Prime Social Rooftop. They get affectionate there.\nOutlets get more information on the post-game date. \nInitial reports claim that Swift and Kelce paid to rent out Prime Social Rooftop. In reality, they had a reservation.\nAn eyewitness told Entertainment Tonight, “Travis bought out the restaurant for his family and team. Taylor arrived, wearing a denim dress, and was seen snacking, having some cocktails and dancing alongside Travis. The two were very affectionate with one another but kept things fun and lighthearted. Travis’ teammates also showed up to the after-party, as well as his mom, Donna Kelce. The party lasted until 2 A.M.”\nTMZ was also told that Swift and Kelce were affectionate at the game’s after-party. “Sources say they were holding hands at the restaurant he rented out for his family, friends, and teammates after the game. At one point Taylor was sitting on Travis’ lap,” TMZ wrote.\nIn addition, multiple sources discuss Swift and Kelce’s current relationship status.\nTMZ was told by sources that Swift and Kelce’s relationship is not a publicity stunt, first of all. The sources shared that Swift and Kelce have seen each other “several times” over the last few months, but are not officially dating yet. Previous in-person meetings have been in a “very private setting,” per the sources.\nEntertainment Tonight’s insiders said that things between Swift and Kelce remain casual, but he has potential to be a good match for her. Swift specifically liked that he pursued her.\n“Travis has never shied away from his desire to give dating with Taylor a try, which he even said during a press conference a few months ago after seeing Swift in concert,” one source said. “Travis and Taylor are taking things slowly and not rushing into anything serious. Both are very career-focused, so the focus is on that for now, but that’s not going to stop them from enjoying life when it’s the right moment.”\nA second source added that “Travis and Taylor have a lot in common and they are having a great time getting to know each other. They have similar values. She likes that he pursued her and it has been easy and exciting for both of them.”\n“Taylor is enjoying some time off from touring and it’s been fun hanging out with Travis during this break,” the source continued. “Taylor wants a guy that’s into his career, does his own thing, but is also supportive and understands her, and Travis fits those qualities.” \nLast of all, a source told People that Swift and Kelce’s romance is in the “super, super early days.” That source added of their future, “They’re just hanging out, and there’s no pressure.”\nSwift is seen arriving at the airport in Kansas City around 10:30 A.M. to fly back home. Daily Mail reported that security vehicles were seen parked on Kelce’s street on Sunday and Monday nights in a clear sign that the two stars spent some private time together post-game.\nMultiple sources speak to Us Weekly that day about Swift and Kelce’s relationship. Once again, they say it’s not serious.\nOne Us Weekly source said that Swift met Kelce through a mutual friend: “They have been on a few dates, and Taylor is smitten with him. It is not serious, and Taylor is having fun right now.”\n“[She’s] working hard right now and not looking for anything serious,” the source continued, citing her tour schedule and his NFL schedule as reasons why a more committed romance would be more difficult. “But anything is possible. They’re getting closer and closer every day.”\nKelce speaks on his podcast New Heights for the first and maybe last time about his relationship with Swift.\n“I know I brought all this attention to me, right?” Kelce started. “I did the whole friendship bracelet thing and told everyone how butt-hurt I was that I didn’t get to meet Taylor.”\nAt the same time, he has no any regrets. “You miss 100 percent of [the shots] you don’t take, baby, so yeah,” he said, then adding, “What’s real is it is my personal life, and I want to respect both of our lives. She’s not in the media as much as I am doing this show every single week and you know, having fun during the NFL season and on other guys’ shows like the McAfee Show, and any other show that I go on from here on out.”\n“I’m enjoying life, and I sure as hell enjoyed this weekend so everything moving forward, I think me talking about sports…will kind of have to be where I keep it,” he said.\n“I’m on the roller coaster, the roller coaster of life,” Kelce added of the experience dating Swift. “Yeah, I notice a few things [are different], like paparazzi outside my house.”\nKelce gave Swift two shout-outs on the program: “Shout-out to Taylor for pulling up [to the Chiefs game],” he said first. “That was pretty ballsy, that was pretty ballsy, yeah. I just thought it was awesome how everyone in the suite had nothing but great things about her, you know the friends and family. She looked amazing. Everybody was talking about her in a great light, and on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans, of course. We script it all, ladies and gentlemen. It was just impressive.”\nOf the game generally, he said, “It was definitely a game I’ll remember. That’s for damn sure. And then we just slid off in the getaway car at the end.”\nHis second shout-out to Swift was simple: “Shout-out to Taylor for coming through and seeing me rock the stage.” \nLater that day, TMZ runs the first photo of Swift and Kelce showing PDA from the post-game party.\nAfter rumors emerge that Swift could be attending Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs game against the New York Jets at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium, a source confirms it to Entertainment Tonight. “Taylor Swift is planning on attending the Jets game this Sunday,” the source said.\nA second source added, “The Jets haven’t been notified specifically about Taylor coming to Sunday’s game, but are prepared to welcome her if she decides to come. Patrick Mahomes booked a suite for his family and friends and Taylor could be joining that suite.”\nIn a separate report, a different source told Entertainment Tonight that Swift wasn’t initially expecting much from her and Kelce’s time together, but things are changing. “When Taylor and Travis first connected, Taylor was looking to have fun while enjoying some downtime,” the source said. “So far, it’s been a nice change of pace for her.

They were first spotted on Thursday, May 25, then again that Saturday. The pair were spotted that night getting out of a black SUV before enjoying their evening together.\nThey also had dinner at Sushi by Bou, with photos of them at the restaurant posted on Facebook by the sushi spot's founder, Michael Sinensky.\nIn the months since, they’ve continued to spark dating rumors. Here’s everything to know about Steinfeld's rumored romantic interest Josh Allen so far.\nThe football star once played for University of Wyoming, and was selected seventh overall by the Buffalo Bills in the 2018 NFL Draft after his stellar performance as an MVP. The 27-year-old took a couple years to warm up to NFL life, then lived up to his reputation with an incredible 202o season, leading the team to their first division title and playoff victory since 1995.\nAllen's personal life has been a big part of his story, as he had been dating longtime girlfriend Brittany Williams for eight years. \nThey first met as children, and even went to the Sadie Hawkins dance together in high school, but didn't start dating until college. However, they have seemingly split. Fans of the player noted in May that he'd stopped following Williams on social media, though he still has some snapshots of his former girlfriend up on the timeline. Williams has unfollowed and deleted all of her photos with Allen.\nBased on the very recent social media clues and very recent sightings, it likely hasn't been long. Steinfeld was most recently dating Irish musician Niall Horan, starting in early 2018. They broke up less than a year later.\n“They split months ago,” a source told Us Weekly in December of that year. “Niall wrapped up his tour and had more free time, but Hailee’s work schedule really ramped up, so they didn’t have time for a relationship. They still have a lot of love for each other.” \nIn July, over Independence Day weekend, the pair were seen in Los Cabos and photographed smooching in the water. Steinfeld was wearing a bucket hat and sunglasses, and had her arms wrapped around Allen's neck as they kissed. He was also wearing sunglasses and had wet hair from their pool time.\nSteinfeld was photographed shopping with Allen’s mom Lavonne on September 30. The women bought Bills merchandise to support Allen at Leveled Up Buffalo in East Aurora, New York. The shop shared a photo of Lavonne and Steinfeld posing with owner Lindsey Vega on its Instagram.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny’s Complete Relationship Timeline", "date": "2023-10-02 21:14:00", "text": "Earlier this year, it was rumored that model Kendall Jenner and musical artist Bad Bunny were starting a romantic relationship, and a few months later things seem to still be going strong. Jenner split with her on-again-off-again ex-boyfriend Devin Booker in 2022, and was reportedly spending time enjoying the single life.\nThen Bad Bunny, or Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, swept her off her feet. Here's their relationship timeline so far.\nThe pair were first seen together out for a date in Beverly Hills. Jenner and Ocasio were spotted leaving Wally's, a popular eatery amongst the rich and famous. E! News said that Hailey and Justin Bieber were also at the restaurant, which could mean they were on a double date — or everyone wanted brunch at the same time.\nThe new couple were out in West Hollywood in early March having dinner with friends. They shared a hug and possibly a kiss before parting. By he end of the month, the rapper seemed to be mentioning his new gal friend on Eladio Carrión's track “Coco Chanel.” \nIn the lyrics, he sings, “I’m not bad, baby that’s a gimmick / But the sun in Puerto Rico is hotter than in Phoenix / She knows it.”\nBooker, Jenner's ex, plays for the Phoenix Suns. Elsewhere on the song, he shouts out “Scorpio women,” which is Jenner's birth sign. A source told US Weekly that month that Jenner wasn’t “really looking to date anybody.”\n“Things are not official between Kendall and Bad Bunny, but they’re seeing each other on a regular basis and getting to know each other better,” the insider said, but Jenner's feelings were “starting to grow” after “spending more time” with him.\n“It’s not super serious, but she likes him and is open to seeing where things go with him. Kendall appreciates how he treats her with respect and he makes her laugh,” the insider added. “He’s very charming and she thinks he’s a great guy. Although things are still fairly new, she definitely sees potential.” \nIn late March, they were seen out at dinner again and an eyewitness said they were “openly kissing” and “being very affectionate.” \nIn April, TMZ reported the couple had gone horseback riding together, so things have definitely heated up. On April 15, Jenner watched Bad Bunny's performance at Coachella in Indio, California, and was captured dancing on the crowd on a TikTok. Later that weekend she was also photographed by his side as he whispered to her in the crowd. \nThey were then seen together at Tyler the Creator's concert in Los Angeles on Wednesday, April 26, dressed casually and laughing as they walked through the street.\nOn Saturday, April 29, they were seen in NYC heading to Carbone, a celebrity favorite. They later headed to Pergola for after-dinner drinks, leaving together in a blue Mercedes. For the night out, Jenner stunned in a sleeveless semi-sheer asymmetrical crop top that matched her dark brown miniskirt trimmed in tan fuzz. She completed the look with knee high leather boots covered in belt details.\nThe rapper wore black slacks with a black and yellow leather jacket and a pair of black sunglasses. He had one square-toed black boots and a gold chain around his neck.\nJenner and Bunny didn't walk the Met Gala red carpet, but they attended an after-party together.\nA source told People that same day that the couple was becoming “more serious.”\n“They are very cute together. Kendall is happy,” the source said. “He is a fun guy. Very much a gentleman and charming. She likes his vibe. He is very chill.”\n“It was a slow start, but they spend almost every day together now,” the source continued. “He hangs out with her friends and she hangs out with his. It's more of a relationship now. Kendall is not seeing anyone else. She really likes him.”\nOn May 11, E! reported that Bunny and Jenner went on vacation together with friends. A TikTok revealed this, with Bunny and Jenner appearing alongside each other in a video taken by photographer Renell Medrano and posted to his page. He ultimately took it down. A screenshot from the video of Bunny and Jenner remains online here.\nAnother source told UsWeekly that day, “Things are going really well for Kendall and Bad Bunny and she definitely sees long-term potential with him. She feels like he’s the complete package and he treats her like a total gentleman.”\nThey added that she is “really attracted” to the artist’s confidence. \n“They are having a great time together, and she appreciates that he gets along with all of her friends,” the source said. “They complement each other on so many levels and she’s enjoying getting to know him better every day.”\nOn May 12, they were seen sitting court side at the Lakers playoff game in Los Angeles.\nOn May 24, a source gave more detail to Entertainment Tonight about how Jenner and Bunny's more serious relationship was progressing. “He is not only spending more time with Kendall, but with the rest of the family as well,” the source said.\nThere's “potential” for the pair's romance to be more “long term,” the source added. “They’re both always laughing and smiling together and have similar family values.” Jenner herself is “enjoying their low-key relationship and is excited about where they're headed.”\nOn June 21, interviews with both Jenner and Bunny came out where they discussed their intention to keep their relationship private.\nBunny told Rolling Stone of keeping his personal life under the wraps, “I know something is going to come out. I know [people are] going to say something. People know everything about me, so what’s left for me to protect? My private life, my personal life.” \nWhen asked if he wanted to clear up any rumors about his relationship with Jenner, he repeated that line: “That’s the only answer. In the end, the only thing I have is my privacy.”\nJenner told WSJ magazine, meanwhile, that she had  “no comment” on Bunny.\n“I try [to] find the balance of keeping things private and keeping things sacred, [and] also not letting the unfortunate frustration and stress of everyone trying to get in on it stop me from enjoying my side,” she explained. “Does that make sense? I’ll go out of my way to do things as privately as possible because I just think that that’s the healthier way of dealing with relationships anyway.” \nA source told People that Jenner and Bunny went on vacation together to Gozzer Ranch Golf & Lake Club in Harrison, Idaho.\nThe source described them as “really cute” and “so happy together,” adding, “They definitely seem in love, and super serious. They're really friendly. Kendall is so low key that plenty of guests don't even know who she was.”\nJenner and Bad Bunny were also seen back in West Hollywood on July 27, enjoying a dinner date together at Sushi Park. It's one of their favorite spots, and they were also seen there with friends in late June.\nThat same day, on an episode of The Kardashians, Jenner shared that her mom Kris has gifted custom dollhouses to all her siblings for Christmas and decorated her to manifest a marriage.\n“She put an engagement ring in mine, because she thought it was manifesting an engagement for me,” she said in a confessional. “So if that tells you anything about where my mom wants me to be in life.”\nVideos and photos of Jenner and Bunny kissing and showing PDA came out when the couple attended Drake's Los Angeles concert together. The date night marked one of their most affectionate public outings yet since they started seeing each other.\nLater in August, Bunny appeared to soft launch their relationship on his Instagram Stories. He shared a video featuring a woman he called “mami” whose voice resembled Jenner’s. He also wore a “K” initial necklace in one photo and had a photo of her 818 tequila line in another.\nKendall on Benito’s insta story 🥰 pic.twitter.com/21odRhMWnm\nThroughout the month, Jenner and Bunny had a string of public dates, including at the Met Opera in New York City and at Gucci’s fashion show in Milan.\nBunny also addressed why he is so against discussing his romance with Jenner in a Vanity Fair profile published in mid-September.\nRegarding fans who disapprove of him dating Jenner, he said, “they don’t know how you feel, they don’t know how you live, they don’t know anything, and I really don’t want them to know. I’m not really interested in clarifying anything because I have no commitment to clarify anything to anyone. I am clear and my friend Jomar [Dávila] is clear and my mother is clear. They are the only ones to whom I have to clarify anything. As for Juliana Dominguez from Mississippi [a random fan name], I have nothing I need to clarify to her. Never. About anything.”\n“There are people who say that artists have to put up with it,” he continued. “I don’t have to accept anything and everything because I wanted to be an artist. At the end of the day, you listen to me because you want to. I don’t force you to.”\nHe also revealed that he isn’t about to get engaged to anyone. When asked if he wanted traditional milestones like a wedding and kids, he said, “no, I don’t think so,” adding at least “not now.”  \nAfter shortly after their appearance at Gucci’s show, Jenner and Bunny appeared in the fashion house’s newest campaign together, released on September 30.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nAfter Coldplay's Chris Martin consciously uncoupled back in 2014 with his partner of a decade Gwyneth Paltrow, his dating life became decidedly more private. Martin seems to have finally  found lasting love with Dakota Johnson after previously being linked to actresses including Jennifer Lawrence and Annabelle Wallis. \nAlthough they've kept their relationship low-key, they celebrated three years together this past October. Here, a rundown of the romance.\nRumors of a relationship first arose when Johnson and Martin were spotted grabbing dinner at Sushi Park in Los Angeles. According to a People onlooker, the pair appeared \"cozy, laughing and affectionate\" during the outing.\nBy mid-November fans clocked Johnson at Coldplay's Buenos Aires, Argentina concert. Lainey Gossip noted that it was the last show of the band's Head Full Of Dreams tour—and that Johnson was viewing the show from a VIP-level vantage point.\nThe following month, multiple sources confirmed to Us Weekly that the potential couple was together. \"Dakota and Chris are definitely dating,\" one source said. \"They've gotten to know each other really well and are very comfortable from one another. Chris sends Dakota his music to get her opinion. It's more than just a fling.\"\nA sighting at Nick Cave's concert in Israel solidified this news. Afterwards, they had dinner at Yam Sheva restaurant in Herzliya. \"They came in and they were really, really nice, like extremely nice. It was a surprise,\" an eyewitness told the outlet. \"They sat with Nick Cave too. I didn't see them kiss or hold hands or anything like that. They ordered some starters and not a lot of food.\"\nPeople obtained photos of Johnson and Martin at Soho House in Malibu, California. An eyewitness said, \"Chris and Dakota arrived together in Chris' car. They met up with friends and had a fun night. They both seemed very happy. They were flirty, and also left the restaurant together.\"\nA week later, People spotted the couple walking the beach in Malibu, with a source noting that they had spent \"m0st of the weekend together.\" The insider offered that, \"They seem to be getting more serious. On Friday, they had dinner with friends. They also hung out at Chris' house and went for a beach walk. They didn't see each other over the holidays and seem excited to be catching up now.\"  \nPeople was reportedly on their date night scene again at Stella McCartney's autumn collection unveiling. They skipped the red carpet, but an onlooker said the couple stayed close once inside the event. \"They walked in holding hands and Dakota was not letting go—she was super into the PDA,\" the eyewitness remembered. \"When Chris let go of her hand, she slipped her arm through his.\" \nLater that month, Dakota's father, Don Johnson seemingly confirmed her relationship to Digital Spy. When asked about his daughter's romance he said, \"Yeah, that's... uh troubling, isn't it? No, she's a big girl, she can handle herself!\"\nIn mid-February, the couple appeared at Ellen  DeGeneres' 60th birthday party, an event also attended by Paltrow and her fiancé Brad Falchuk. People obtained photos of the pair holding hands outside of the festivities while talking to Drew Barrymore.\nA few months later, the pair was spotted walking Johnson's dog, Zeppelin around Malibu. People spoke to a source who gave insight into Johnson and Martin's relationship. \"For the past two weeks, they have spent a lot of time together,\" the insider said. \"Chris lives in Malibu and Dakota seems to love hanging out there. They occasionally go for dinner with friends, but mostly have friends over at home. They go to the beach together, and walks around the neighborhood. They seem to enjoy sharing a quiet life. It does seem they are getting more serious.\"\nThe following month, a Twitter user caught the couple at a Radiohead concert in Boston. They were seemingly on a double date with Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul and his wife, Lauren. \"They stood up for a couple of the ovations,\" a concertgoer told People, noting that they sat for most of the show. Earlier, Martin and Johnson were seen strolling into the venue hand in hand.\nHI IM SAT BEHIND CHRIS MARTIN AND DOKOTA JOHNSON pic.twitter.com/YcDGFRpvqP\nThe weekend of Paltrow's wedding to Falchuk, Martin supported Johnson at the Global Citizen Festival in New York City. E! noted Martin's presence in the audience while Johnson spoke onstage about the power of sharing stories of sexual assault.\nAs further proof of the pair's bond, they seemingly got matching tattoos. E! spotted the similar ink when Johnson was photographed at the Venice Film Festival. On her left elbow, there was an infinity sign tattoo with two Xs. Days prior, Martin was seen at an event in Los Angeles with the same tattoo in a similar location.\nA week later, TMZ reported that Martin and Johnson were throwing a gender reveal party at his home. Photos of blue and pink balloon arches raised speculation that the couple could be expecting a baby. Both of Johnson's parents, including mother Melanie Griffith, and celebrities such as Sean Penn and Julia Roberts were spotted at the event.\nShortly after, Johnson's rep denied the rumors to Us Weekly, clarifying that the celebrations were for a birthday party and not a gender reveal of any kind. On Ellen the following month Johnson confirmed that sentiment herself, saying, \"Well, the only thing I'm pregnant with is a lot of really good ideas. But not any babies.\"\nAround a year after Martin and Johnson were first spotted at Sushi Park, the couple returned for a casual dinner out. A source told Us Weekly around this time that the couple will \"be engaged soon. Chris is head over heels.\" The insider also claimed that Martin was holding off on an engagement after Paltrow wed Falchuk in September. \"He wanted to make sure the kids didn't have too much change all at once,\" the source said. \"He's a great dad.\" \nMartin spent Thanksgiving with Paltrow and their two children, Apple, 15 and Moses, 13. A source told E!, \"Gwyneth thinks (Johnson) is lovely. She gets on very well with her and is happy for Chris. They've spent a good amount of time together and have a very nice friendship.\" \nJohnson and Martin were photographed walking her dog barefoot around Malibu in their last public sighting for months.\nThe Sun reported that the couple split the month prior, to the surprise of close friends. \"Chris and Dakota were very easygoing and always seemed really happy together,\" a source told the outlet. Meanwhile, The Express claimed that Johnson and Martin \"could not have been further apart\" when it came to starting a family. A source said, \"Chris made it clear he wants more kids as soon as possible but Dakota's career has really taken off and that's the last thing she wanted to think about right away. It got to the point, last month, where a light seemed to flick on in both their heads and they realized they were pulling in completely opposite directions - so they decided to call it a day.\"\nRumors of reconciliation begin when a Twitter user spotted Johnson and Martin at a wrap party for the actress's upcoming movie, Covers.\nAnother New Picture of Dakota and Chris Martin at the wrap-party of #Covers last night ♥ #DakotaJohnson; via tyraoneal_ on Instagram. pic.twitter.com/qMH7fghtfI\nSoon after the sighting, Us Weekly confirmed that the pair had reunited. The day after their initial spotting, Martin attended the Los Angeles premiere of Johnson's new movie, The Peanut Butter Falcon. E! also shared that the couple was back together and \"planning to spend more time together later this summer,\" per a source\nUs Weekly reported that the couple's reconciliation came courtesy of Martin's ex, Paltrow. \"Gwyneth is the one who pushed them to do it,\" a source said, noting that the two had bonded at an April event.\nThere could be some truth to that claim, as Martin, Paltrow, and their respective partners were all spotted in the Hamptons together in photos from TMZ. Shortly after, Johnson and Martin had date night at East Village's Double Zero in NYC. \nGriffith, Johnson's mother, definitively commented on her daughter's relationship with Martin. \"I love my daughter’s boyfriend. I think that they're an awesome couple,\" she told People. A source told an outlet at the time that privacy is paramount for the couple. \"Dakota has been filming out of state, but most weekends she comes back to Malibu to spend time with Chris,\" the insider said. \"They are very low-key together. They usually have friends over and rarely go out.\" \nOn October 4, it wasn't Martin wishing Johnson a happy birthday on social media. It was his ex Paltrow, who shared a black-and-white photo of Johnson and her pet dog. \"Happy 30th birthday to this absolute gem 💙,\" she captioned the celebratory IG post.\nA few days later, E! reported on Johnson's 30th birthday bash in Malibu. Guests included Martin, Paltrow, and celebs such as Miley Cyrus and Robert Downey Jr. The report said Johnson and Martin arrived at the event together and spent most of the evening by each other's side. \"Dakota and Chris sat side by side watching different musical acts,\" the source told E!. \"Dakota and Chris spent a lot of time together. They walked around holding hands or with his hand on her back. They seemed very happy.\" \nJust before Christmas, Page Six spotted Johnson on a trip to Aspen with Martin, Paltrow, and the former couple's two children Apple and Moses. In photos, Johnson locked arms with Apple while on a coffee run alongside Martin. On Christmas day, Paltrow shared an Instagram of herself and husband Falchuk in ski gear, indicating he was also on the family trip.\nPaltrow's support of her ex-husband's relationship continued into the new year. In a cover story interview with Harper's Bazaar, she had nothing but kind words for Johnson. \"I love her,\" Paltrow said. \"I can see how it would seem weird because it’s sort of unconventional. But I think, in this case, just having passed through it iteratively, I just adore her. I always start to think of the ampersand sign—what else can you bring in, instead of being resistant to or being made insecure by? There’s so much juice in leaning in to something like that.”\nShe also spoke about the evolving nature of her dynamic with Martin. \"It’s not like there’s a finish line: ‘Oh, we consciously uncoupled; we’re done,'\" she explained. \"It’s a lifelong commitment to constantly reinvent your relationship with your ex, which you do presumably because you have children together. I don’t see a reason to do it if you don’t have children together. Some people do. But I think we put all the hard work in at the beginning. I would say very rarely is it difficult now. We’ve learned how to communicate with each other. We love each other. We laugh. We have the best of each other. It’s really nice. It makes you feel like you don’t have to lose.”\nMartin was involved in a major career milestone for Johnson. On Valentine's Day, Coldplay released its music video f0r the song, “Cry Cry Cry.” The romantic video's director was none other than Johnson, who made her directorial debut with the collaboration.\nEarly this month, the couple had a rare public outing with Martin's two children. The foursome was spotted by the Daily Mail strolling through Disneyland for his 43rd birthday. \nA few weeks later, Martin and Johnson enjoyed dinner at Crossroads Kitchen in Los Angeles, per E!. Johnson wore dark wide leg jeans, a hoodie, and black loafers for the outing. Meanwhile, Martin sported a long sleeve shirt, dark gray pants, and a blue baseball cap. During an interview with Architectural Digest a few days prior, Johnson had joked that \"the key to a healthy relationship\" with Martin is having \"double sinks\" in the bathroom. \nQuarantine hasn't stopped the couple from sharing some adorable moments together. On March 26, Johnson's friend Olivia Wilde posted a video made by the pair with the caption, “Dakota Johnson: Hand wash CHAMPION.” In the clip, Johnson stands in front of a kitchen sink as she demonstrates her hand washing technique. It's soon clear that the actress's \"hands\" in the video were Martin's. The \"M\" and \"A\" tattoos on each of the wrists gave it away. Martin scrubbed his hands while Johnson spoke to the camera.   \nA few days later, Martin and Johnson made a rare public appearance together while on a break from quarantine. Photographers snapped the couple walking arm-in-arm through Malibu with Johnson's dog on March 31. \nPeople reported that Johnson and Martin are still going strong and are still spending time with Martin's kids his ex-wife, Gwyneth Paltrow, and her husband, Brad Flachuck. The two are living in the $12.5 million Malibu mansion Martin bought last October. \n\"Chris was always a big fan of Malibu,\" a source told People. \"He loves the beach and often goes surfing and running. The source added: \"She seems to enjoy it as much as Chris does. They both love the outdoors and often take beach strolls. They also support local restaurants.\"\nPer The Daily Mail, Johnson has been fueling rumors of her engagement to Martin—with an Emerald ring on her left finger. Neither Johnson nor Martin have confirmed the rumor. \nOn Saturday the 24th, Martin and Johnson were seen out in Malibu for a lunch and coffee date, while fans still wonder if the two are planning to tie the knot. Johnson wore ripped jeans, a black spaghetti-strap top, black Adidas sneakers, and a green knit hat as Martin, who was barefoot, in gray sweats, and a black shirt, followed. \nMartin and Johnson were spotted enjoying a vacation in Palma De Mallorca, Spain, where they took a boat ride and were seen taking a leisurely stroll together. They each wore black baseball caps as they joined arms. \nEarlier in the month, Martin and Johnson were photographed together in New York City. They walked arm in arm, wearing matching pink and black outfits. A few weeks later, the couple was seen in London, where they grabbed dinner in the chic neighborhood of Mayfair. Johnson wore a coat over a white button down and black pants, along with a pair of Converses and a Gucci purse. Martin opted for a low-key black sweater, gray sweatpants, and knit beanie.\nColdplay announced it would be postponing several shows in Brazil due to Martin coming down with a serious lung infection. Later that month, he and Johnson were spotted on a beachside stroll in their home city of Malibu. Johnson wore a white sweatshirt and gray sweatpants, while Martin paired a graphic tee with a baseball cap and baggy pants.\nJohnson put on her own show in the audience at Martin's November 8 concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Johnson told Vanity Fair in July 2022 that she loves to tour with Coldplay when she's not working, and she apparently also loves dancing up a storm to her man's tunes.\nAmo como disfrutó el concierto 😍❤️ #dakotajhonson #DakotaJohnson pic.twitter.com/ZzqtvnQiLi\nWhen Johnson can't travel with him, Martin makes a point of visiting her. He stopped by Boston, Massachusetts, to see his girlfriend as she was filming the superhero movie Madame Web that summer.\nOn the March 19 episode of the Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend podcast, Martin shared how Johnson made Coldplay reconsider accessibility at their shows by introducing him to new tactile technology.\n“They are called SubPacs,” he explained. “Dakota, my partner, gave me one as a gift because she saw someone online experiencing whatever they are experiencing with this—it's kind of like body armor —you put it on and plug it in and it connects to the base.”\nJohnson had seen the technology being used online and told Martin that he “should use this somehow.”\n“So, we started using it and it's been so amazing and it should get better and better,” Martin continued. “We have ten or twenty now—every night—of those packs and so if you're hearing impaired we have an area where you sign up and you put on the pack and you can feel the show.”\nHe added that the SubPacs are expensive, but well-worth it because “they are amazing and the things that people do to consider other people are just wonderful.”\nOn Saturday of Easter weekend, Johnson and Martin were seen in Malibu, California, going on a coffee run together. During the rare public outing, Johnson wore large sunglasses, a black hat, a pair of floral tapestry loose pants by Bode, Converse sneakers, and a Bruce Springsteen t-shirt. \nMartin wore a light grey t-shirt, matching sweatpants, and sneakers with a grey beanie. Johnson had her arm looped through Martin's as they walked together. \nOn June 21, Chris Martin and his band Coldplay were performing in Naples, Italy, and his girlfriend Dakota Johnson was in the audience. In a video shared by the Daily Mail, the singer covered the stage, then stopped to serenade her where she was sitting to watch the show in the sound deck. Johnson smiled and blew him a kiss.\nJohnson kicked off the month by being a supportive girlfriend. The actress attended Martin’s Coldplay concert on Sunday, October 1, in Pasadena, California, with her mother. Photos came out of Johnson there in a long leather jacket with a black top and light pants.\nHilary Weaver is a freelance writer based in New York who writes about politics, queer issues, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, and every woman the Queen has ever made a dame.

{"title": "A Hot Girl’s Guide to the Best Amazon Halloween Costumes", "date": "2023-10-02 20:18:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nBuying something I’ll never wear again? Now that’s scary.  \nThe best time of year is upon us. It’s the season for candy corn, slasher flicks, and letting cobwebs pass as decor (when really, you just need to dust). If you haven’t sorted out your Halloweekend outfits yet, don’t fret. We have lots of cute costume ideas here at ELLE, but I’m here to break down a few easy Halloween costumes from Amazon. Conveniently, the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days savings event is coming up on October 10 and 11, so you can score these items at an even better price.  \nThese are mostly made of things you A) already own, or B) need to purchase but could totally re-wear. As much as I love costume stores, I’m not interested in buying a sexy Bob Ross getup because when could I possibly wear that other than this one day a year? If you’re looking for an affordable and simple look that’s still chic and Instagrammable, look no further. Here, find 10 easy Halloween costumes you can get on Amazon. \nIconic characters like Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz tend to make for fantastic Halloween costumes that can be worn again. Judy Garland and this character will always be timeless, and thus a trusty option for that costume party. I personally have this gingham dress for my own dress-up purposes and can attest that it’s just as cute on October 31 as it is paired with white sneakers during the summer months. But as Dorothy, try these sweet ballet flats that are very much aligned with our favorite fall 2023 shoe trends. \nAs the song goes, “Miracles happen once in a while, if you believe.” The miracle I’m personally willing into existence is that I might do as good of a job as Hailey Bieber did when she dressed up as the girl next door-turned-princess Mia Thermopolis. It’s an all-time look for an all-time movie. And if you’re looking to make a group costume out of this, there are plenty of other endearing characters to rope your friends into (including Anne Hathaway’s pre-makeover look from Paolo).  \nThis might be a hot take, but here’s where I stand. Black cat ears: Basic. Witch: Failsafe. I can’t quite spell out the reasoning behind this, but I stand by it. A witch is a nod to the holiday’s very essence, as well as an homage to a long history of fierce women. Plus, this might be the easiest to throw together last minute. If you’re like me, you have ample black garments in your wardrobe to choose from. Make this the year you buy a pointy black hat and keep it on hand for all the Octobers to come. If you do actively practice witchcraft, even better (but it’s not a prerequisite). \nShe’s the blueprint for all the baddies. And she’s just plain cool as hell. If I had darker hair or could pull off a wig, this costume would be at the top of my list. Not only are her look and vibe totally sexy and chic, but Betty Boop is also not a very common costume. In the realm of cool girl costume dressing, uniqueness is a virtue. You aren’t likely to see a slew of fellow Betties, and if you did, that would actually be pretty rad. \nFor the gals who aren’t sold on the idea of dressing up at all, might I suggest this uber-cozy option? It requires minimal effort and will keep you warm and comfortable while your pals shiver in their Little Red Riding Hood frocks. Personally, half the time I ditch a party it’s because I don’t want to change out of my sweats. As the Pink Panther, you don’t have to. And you get to pretend to be a jewel thief—how fun! \nLet me address the elephant in the nerd-filled room. A lightsaber wasn’t really part of Leia’s get-up—she was more of the blaster type—but I still think you can get away with this if for no reason other than recognizability. The dress and belt could easily be worn time and time again, and space buns are a simple enough hairdo. If you’re raiding your brother’s room to borrow the lightsaber he already owns, make sure it’s blue. This is your only hope of successfully clapping back at anyone who tries to mansplain that Leia didn’t carry a lightsaber. If someone gives you a hard time about this detail, just tell them to check their facts, because Leia technically does use a blue lightsaber to train with Luke in an episode IX flashback. (And thank you, to my boyfriend for all this information.) \nYou could lean into the Tinkerbell of it all if you’re so inclined, but you can also decide to be your own kind of pixie, whatever that looks like for you. Honestly, almost any cottagecore-adjacent outfit will do for this one. Floral dress? Sure. Just pop on those wings and call it a day. But I do draw the line at those pointy elf ear accessories; The best I can do is pointed-toe shoes. Final offer. \nEverybody dresses up as the Scooby-Doo gang. Skip Daphne or Velma, and instead go for the less overdone option of Nancy Drew, the original woman in STEM. Pretty much any solid-colored top or sweater will do the trick. Pair it with a pencil skirt or pedal pushers in true Nancy Drew form.\n\nElizabeth James is one of the top 10 onscreen mothers, according to no one other than myself. This low-lift idea comes from ELLE’s senior video producer Laura Hacker, and it requires hardly anything at all. The primary components are a button-down shirt, sunglasses, and a hair roller. You can decide whether you want to talk in a posh British accent and quote this Natasha Richardson character all evening, but I strongly recommend it. \n Okay...I have a confession. I have not seen The White Lotus. I know, I know; I’m terribly out of touch. But not so out of touch that I would overlook such a glaringly obvious costume idea. Pop culture or current zeitgeist costumes can be a total trap because you risk looking like a bandwagoner. But I do believe that Tanya makes an excellent costume inspiration. For that matter, any Jennifer Coolidge character is an excellent idea. \nMeg is the Associate Fashion Commerce Editor at ELLE.com where she researches trends, tests products, and looks for answers to all your burning questions.

{"title": "What Happened Between Uche, Aaliyah, and Lydia on <i>Love Is Blind</i> Season 5?", "date": "2023-10-02 20:14:00", "text": "The trio caused quite a stir in the pods.\nSpoilers below.\nThe fifth season of Love Is Blind has finally arrived, and new episodes are juicier than ever. As usual, some couples find love in the pods, but a prior relationship also threatens to wreck one of the new romances.\nICU travel nurse Aaliyah seemingly finds love with lawyer Uche in the pods. However, an emotional revelation from Uche completely throws Aaliyah off, making her question the burgeoning romance. Here’s what you need to know about the surprising love triangle between Aaliyah, Uche, and Lydia on Love Is Blind season 5.\nAt the end of season 5, episode 3, Uche emotionally opened up to Aaliyah with a secret he hadn’t revealed before. “There’s something I have to tell you,” he explained. “I haven’t been completely honest with you. One of my dates on the first day, I walked into the pod, and it is a girl that I have dated in the past. And, um, it’s Lydia.” The episode ended on this mic drop, with Aaliyah clearly shocked that Lydia, with whom she’d developed a close friendship, had previously dated Uche.\nEpisode 4 delved deeper into the love triangle, showing us Lydia and Uche’s first pod dates, in which they quickly realized that they knew one another. Lydia excitedly asked Uche, “Do you want to start at zero?” However, Uche responded, “I don’t think we can do that, because I kind of, it ruins the experiment.” He also admitted, “This really caught me off guard.” While Lydia seemed keen to continue talking to Uche, he essentially shut down any possibility of a second chance.\nCutting back to Aaliyah and Uche’s date, Uche said of his relationship with Lydia, “We dated for a few months. I just didn’t think that we were that compatible so I ended things. It hurt me so much because she deserves an amazing person who is completely sure about her, and I really hope she finds that.” Aaliyah started crying, clearly shell-shocked that her close friend Lydia had previously dated the man she was now falling in love with. \nAs for whether or not he was still considering Lydia as an option, Uche reassured Aaliyah, saying, “That’s over with ... I went back and forth about it for a long time, because I do see a lot of qualities that would make her a good wife. She seemed 100 percent into me, and I thought if I can’t give her 100 percent back, then I don’t want to hurt her.” \nAfter stepping outside the pod for a moment, Aaliyah returned and revealed to Uche, “[Lydia]’s been making comments. She’s been saying things and I’m like, ‘How do you know this?’” Aaliyah continued, “She’s been telling me multiple times, like, ‘I just see myself in you. We are almost the same woman, you know? It’s just weird.”\nBack in the women’s quarters, Aaliyah revealed to Lydia that she’d found out about her prior relationship with Uche. The pair embraced and cried, telling one another how much they loved each other.  However, the conversation became uncomfortable when Lydia started revealing personal details about Uche, telling Aaliyah, “I know everything about him because I know him.” Even though Aaliyah firmly said that she didn’t want to know anything about Uche because she wanted to discover it for herself, Lydia couldn’t help but spill the details.  \nLydia started talking about Uche’s dog, Kobe, telling Aaliyah that Kobe “pees every time he sees me.” Lydia also revealed that she’d met Uche's friends, saying, “I’m sure you’re going to get along.” She also called Uche a “workaholic,” said that he was “OCD,” that he drove a Tesla, and revealed that his three-level “house was dope.” She even revealed Uche’s favorite color. With each new revelation, Aaliyah looked more and more uncomfortable. \nFinally, Lydia dropped the bombshell that she’d last slept with Uche in January of that year, only months before they’d entered the pods. In a confessional, Aaliyah said, “You had sex three months ago, and I’m supposed to feel like that’s no big deal?” She also revealed, “I'm struggling with the fact he left out a lot of details. I get Lydia’s story and it includes a lot more detail than I would have liked.”\nAfter hearing Lydia’s side of the story, Aaliyah joined Uche in the pods, and she was clearly distressed about what she’d learned. “On the outside world, I would never date a friend’s ex. I would never befriend your ex,” she told him. Uche’s response did nothing to calm Aaliyah fears, with him asking, “You don’t think this is hard for me? I mean it’s happening to me just as much, or even more, than it’s happening to you.” Aaliyah responded, “No it’s not, because I’m over here sitting with your ex that you fucked three months ago. She’s telling me things that I didn’t want to know from her.” \nUche tried to persuade Aaliyah that they could make it work, in spite of the Lydia curve ball. They ended the date choosing each other, with Uche revealing that he had every intention of proposing. However, when he returned to the pod to propose, Aaliyah wasn’t there. Production intervened, telling Uche, “Unfortunately, Aaliyah’s decided not to continue with the experiment.” \nIn an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Aaliyah opened up about her decision to leave the pods before Uche proposed, saying, “I had this gut feeling after really analyzing my interactions with Uche, Lydia, getting all the facts and things, or at least hearing both sides of that situation.” She continued, “Being engaged, it’s a sacred thing to experience and you’re sharing that with family, friends, people I love dearly and that love me dearly. It was something I felt was best for me moving forward.”\nAfter finding out that Aaliyah had left the experiment, Uche spoke to her on the phone during a confessional in episode 5. She explained that she had “an exchange of words” with Lydia, which resulted in Aaliyah saying Lydia could have Uche back if he didn't propose. Aaliyah then went on to reveal that she felt as though Lydia smothered her, and wouldn't stop speaking about Uche in conversation. Tearfully, Aaliyah apologized to Uche for leaving.\nUche then asked her, “Why didn’t you stay here and talk to me?” She revealed that she still loved him. However, he was angry that she left, and cast doubt on their relationship, telling her, “If you can’t get through something like this, we would never get to that point.” He continued, “I can’t believe some girl said something to you and you let that come in between us.” \nAaliyah then suggested that Lydia knew that Uche was going to be on the show and applied as a result. Uche was angry about this suggestion, and called Aaliyah selfish for leaving. “You didn’t even write me a letter,” he told her. “I’ve got nothing.” Uche then said he “let himself get close to the wrong person,” then told production, “I don’t wanna talk to her” and hung up. \nOutside of the pods, Uche and Aaliyah met in a restaurant to talk, shown in episodes 6 and 7. “I do regret, I regret leaving you like that,” Aaliyah told Uche. “I do love you. Like, never felt the connection that you and I have with any other man.” She also revealed that she still wanted to be in a relationship with Uche. “I would marry you,” she told him. \nUnfortunately, Uche was not receptive to Aaliyah's declaration. “When I found out that you had left, it’s like I broke,” he told her. “... You didn’t communicate any kind of doubt to me.” Aaliyah revealed that the doubts started when she discovered Uche’s past relationship with Lydia. She also felt awkward that Lydia revealed too much information about her past with Uche.  \nUche then started to explain the problems in his past relationship with Lydia, revealing that she'd invaded his privacy while they were dating. However, after she apologized, he decided to give her a second chance. Soon after, some of Uche’s friends reached out claiming that Lydia had been watching their Instagram Stories for weeks, despite not knowing them. He continued, “The worst thing was, she drives over to my house, she takes a picture of my driveway and she texts it to me with a message that says, ‘I see you.’ And I panicked.” Uche initially cut Lydia off, but started talking to her again as she had experienced a loss, before breaking up with her once more.\nUche admitted he should have told Aaliyah about his experiences with Lydia while in the pods. He explained, “Maybe Lydia still likes this guy, she’s still obsessed with him, maybe she doesn’t have the best intentions when it comes to me, and maybe you would’ve been able to have your guard up a little bit more.” Aaliyah said that Uche’s seeming concern for Lydia and Milton’s relationship made her uneasy, and made her wonder if Uche still had feelings for Lydia. Aaliyah also revealed that Lydia had told some fellow contestants that she thought someone she’d previously dated was also on Love Is Blind, suggesting she had planned to reconnect with Uche.\nWhile Aaliyah wanted to continue her relationship with Uche, he said that he had doubts about whether they could make it work, and walked away.\nAt a party for the contestants, shown in episode 7, Uche pulled Lydia aside and confronted her about their romance. The conversation quickly descended into an argument, with Uche suggesting that Lydia had been going through his possessions in his house. He later brought up Lydia's alleged Instagram behavior, suggesting that she’d been following his friends. She denied it, and accused Uche of sleeping with someone else while they were together. Lydia stormed off, and Uche found Milton to have a conversation.\nAmy Mackelden is a freelance writer, editor, and disability activist.

Starfish are naturally intriguing to children, but it was their ability to regrow arms that really fascinated young Jennifer. These days, Levine—she grew up to become a leading New York City plastic surgeon—can do just about any aesthetic procedure. But it is dermatology’s newest hot topic, exosome therapy, that reminds her of the starfish she grew up watching, with their magically regenerative bodies. \nExosomes are nano-size vesicles (sort of like little care packages) that cells excrete to communicate with each other. They are packed with lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, like messenger RNA. In aesthetics, they are generally sourced from stem cells, specialized cells that have the ability to develop into many other types of cells. Exosomes have been explored in regenerative medicine to repair cartilage and joints, and many doctors now believe exosomes hold promise for regenerating and repairing skin, and even restoring hair growth.\nThe idea is that when injected or used topically, exosomes might help skin not only look better, but also behave like younger skin on a deep cellular level. As we grow older, our body’s ability to heal, including its power to produce collagen, decreases. “We’ve seen that [exosomes] have anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties and signal cells to do things they’re supposed to do—like make more collagen. It leads to an improvement in skin texture, thickness, and quality,” says Catherine Chang, MD, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon and founder of Privé Beverly Hills. Exosomes are not yet FDA approved (in July 2020, the agency issued a consumer alert on them and other stem-cell-derived products), and some experts feel that we’re years out from FDA approval, but that hasn’t stopped doctors from dreaming big.\n“It could be bigger than Botox, and the Holy Grail in anti aging,” says Steven H. Williams, MD, president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Compared to bio-stimulatory tools such as Sculptra and radio frequency, which also encourage collagen production, exosome therapy can stimulate growth without creating an injury, or swelling, that requires healing. And in contrast to platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy, its most commonly compared-to cousin, exosomes can contain more growth factors and are somewhat more widely available. The platelets for PRP need to be spun from an individual patient’s own blood and will contain fewer growth factors as patients age, but exosomes can be derived from plants, animals, or humans, and even from donated blood or fat, and are, in that sense, ageless. \nAnecdotally, Chang and Levine, who both offer exosome therapy topically in their practices, tell me that they and their patients have been blown away by the results. Chang used it herself following a CO2 laser treatment and found that it decreased her redness from seven days to one. One of her patients, who’d  been trying to regrow her hair for a couple of years, excitedly came in following one exosome session and showed Chang her new hair. Levine has used it on patients to help heal things like stitching wounds, deep skin gashes from running falls in Central Park, and a large bruise from an airport luggage accident. \nIt’s precisely because exosomes can be so powerful that Williams says we need more research on them. Among many other recent studies on exosomes, a review of early preclinical research in the August 2022 Journal of Dermatologic Surgery found that they have promising skin rejuvenation and hair growth effects, but that inconsistency in the ways they are purified, and practical issues with how they are sourced, stored, scaled, and reproduced, are hindering their adoption in the clinical sphere. Jason Diamond, MD, a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon, cautions, “The biggest factor is making sure that they come from a reputable lab, because there can be contamination and infection risks, and they’re frankly hard to produce consistently.” Outside of beauty, there’s the potential that exosomes could one day be used for delivery of antibiotics or even anticancer agents, he notes. Still, Williams adds that because exosomes affect communication between cells, we need more studies to better understand the likelihood of scenarios in which they could trigger cell signaling problems and result in outcomes like undesired cell replication, cell death, or cancer.\n“It also seems that some people are taking advantage of some of the excitement about it to try to get some economic gain, and that’s not always in the patient’s best interest,” he cautions. It’s easy to find clinics and wellness centers offering exosome therapy at prices varying from $60 to $6,000. But if you don’t know the right questions to ask, you could be wasting your money (at the very least). For example, Williams explains, fat-derived exosomes are generally the easiest to obtain. But “if you’re trying to use a fat-derived exosome for hair growth, you’re probably not going to see results, because it’s a different signaling mechanism: You’re trying to communicate with a different part of the cell to influence it.” There are also new skincare serums, purported to contain exosomes. Barbara Sturm has a line of Exoso-metic skincare, with \"exosome and growth factor activated ingredients.\" Celebrity esthetician Angelia Caglia's new Cell Forté Serum uses a mix of real human-derived exosomes mixed with synthetic exosomes, cytokines, and epidermal growth factors. Caglia tells me that since developing the serum, her hyperpigmentation has cleared much faster, and her skin has been brighter than she's ever seen it. \nMany dermatologists have heard of exosome therapy from conferences and studies— and like many skin innovations, it’s been available in South Korea for a few years. Young Woo Ro, MD, founder of the renowned Oracle dermatology clinic in Seoul, tells me he first heard of it in aesthetics about five years ago. In South Korea, exosomes are a common add-on to Fraxel or microneedling, where the microchannels help them get into deeper layers of the skin. Exosome skin boosters are another popular treatment, containing a cocktail of ingredients like hyaluronic acid, amino acids, collagen peptides, and glutathione, for additional “brightening, firming effects,” says David Kim, MD, of Idriss Dermatology in New York City. He tells me that ASCE+ is a popular exosome product; the subtype SRLV is for skin and HRLV is for hair, and both contain exosomes derived from roses.\nWhen I visited Seoul for the first time this spring, I was surprised by the number of dermatology and plastic surgery clinics and saw signs touting the ability to “bank” your stem cells for future use at certain luxury clinics. This could be common in the future, according to Chang. “I suspect we’re going to get to a place where you can harvest stem cells, whether it’s from bone marrow or fat, and then you can send it to get processed and banked for you down the road.” Think of it sort of like beauty wealth management. \nTo get continued results, this wouldn’t be a one-time treatment. The recommended frequency varies: Kim and Ro both say that it’s recommended in Korea to get an incredible five injection sessions of exosome skin boosters over two weeks.  But Levine suggests that since exosomes can stimulate your body to produce its own collagen, the effect could last longer. For hair, she recommends treatment roughly once a year. If you want a combination of immediate and long-term results, exosomes can be combined with filler or microneedling. \n“We’re just at the tip of the iceberg,” Levine says. “This is certainly the direction that the field of aesthetics is going into.” Williams agrees, but worries about that iceberg. “Science shows that there’s something there, but we’re not sure what it is. That doesn’t mean that physicians can’t use non-FDA-approved treatments. But they need to be a little bit more careful. Patients should always be cautious about being the first one ever to try something. Sometimes it doesn’t work out as well.”\nEditor’s Note: This article does not constitute individual medical advice, and you should consult with your doctor before deciding if certain cosmetic or medical treatments are right for you.\nA version of this story appears in the November 2023 issue of ELLE.\nKathleen Hou is ELLE\"s Beauty Director.

{"title": "All About Malcolm McRae, Anya Taylor-Joy’s Husband", "date": "2023-10-02 19:26:00", "text": "Anya Taylor-Joy has kept her personal life as private as she can manage as her Hollywood profile grows. But ahead of The Queen’s Gambit actress’s Saturday Night Live hosting gig in May 2021, Taylor-Joy was photographed making out with musician Malcolm McRae in New York City. The photos sparked dating rumors—and come after Taylor-Joy spoke about having a partner in her ELLE May 2021 interview.\nTaylor-Joy didn’t initially explicitly confirm that she and McRae are dating, but they didn’t exactly hide their romantic connection in the city. According to Page Six, the two were seen holding hands and kissing multiple times while walking around the Big Apple.\nIn September 2021, the two were photographed kissing again, this time in Venice. And in March 2022, Taylor-Joy spoke about her romance with McRae in an interview and made her red carpet debut with him at the Vanity Fair Oscars after party. In July 2022, the two went further, secretly tying the knot, a source told Page Six. The two ultimately made their first award show debut as a couple at the Golden Globes in January 2023.\nIn September 2023, the Daily Mail reported they would be having their wedding in Italy. Photos came out on Monday, October 2 of the Venice festivities.\nHere, all about McRae’s career and what's known about his relationship with Taylor-Joy.\nPer McRae’s IMDB bio, McRae “was ‘discovered’ at the AMTC (talent competition) among 1,100 hopeful actors at age 12, where he won Over All Young Actor, 2006.” McRae starred in a short film, Brotherly, in 2008 and played Gene Grady in 2020’s How'dy!.\nMusic is McRae’s real focus though. His IMDB bio cites him as playing “guitar and piano” and singing “pop, folk, rockabilly, rock and musical theatre.” On his Instagram, McRae plugs his rock band More’s music, most recently posting footage of himself playing his song “Settled In” in April.\nMore is a two-member group that McRae and Kane Ritchotte (formerly of Portugal The Man) created and that is signed with Warner Records. The band is verified on Spotify and has been together for over three years now. They released the first half of their two-part EP, 1/2, last summer.\nIn a July 2020 interview with Rain magazine, McRae spoke about his history with Ritchotte and the creation process for 1/2. “The writing process was a span over three or so years,” he said. “Kane and I were doing solo projects individually and had a few songs we had written and recorded separately. We met up and decided it was fun to write together and bring our songs together. So we finished 10 songs over about three years.”\nAccording to More’s Spotify bio, McRae came to Los Angeles from the South a few years ago. As the band wrote, “Malcolm had only recently fallen in love with a young woman and followed his foolish heart, dropping everything to move to Los Angeles. Well, his heart was mistaken. The relationship was a disaster. But the music that followed wasn’t. Within a week of meeting, the two [McRae and Ritchotte] realized that the music they made together transcended what either was doing alone.”\nMcRae spoke to American Songwriter 10 months ago about how he worked as a paralegal in Pasadena, California, and wrote song lyrics for “Elaborate Attraction” while at his desk job.\nIn his Rain interview, McRae spoke more about the inspiration behind “Elaborate Attraction” and how his late father influenced its lyrics. “My dad was an investment banker,” McRae said. “He passed away when I was eighteen, but that song revolves around and is based on some of his life. He studied classics at an Ivy League school and so the reference to Joseph Campbell, that’s what we took the video from. We wanted it to be an antihero’s journey. All 17 points of Campbell’s hero journey… we wanted to make them super menial tasks with an incredibly small reward for each task. It symbolizes what the song is about which is nature versus nurture.” McRae’s brother Keene McRae directed the music video for the single, and its YouTube video has gotten more than 93,000 views.\nMcRae told Rain that music helped him and Ritchotte get through the coronavirus pandemic mental health-wise. “I’m grateful for the outlet and you don’t need many resources to write music, you know?” he said. “If we didn’t have that in this quarantine, I would be entirely morbidly depressed and unfulfilled. I mean, I don’t know how anybody’s survived. I don’t know how not everybody is writing an album right now.”\nTaylor-Joy and McRae’s exact timeline is not clear nor has either explicitly confirm they're dating. But the 26-year-old actress spoke to ELLE three days after the Golden Globes, indicating she had a significant other in March 2021 while explaining why she was doing her Zoom interview from her bathroom.\n“My partner’s just come back from work, and he’s moving around all of his equipment, so this was the safe spot,” she said. She didn’t offer any more details on who he is, how long they’ve been together, and didn’t confirm outright that they were living together.\nTaylor-Joy did open up to Vanity Fair earlier this year about a past relationship ending right before she began production on Emma in March 2019, meaning her relationship with McRae is likely more recent.\n“Prior to filming [Emma] I’d just had a devastating breakup, and it had challenged everything,” she said. “I was just incredibly insecure and very, very unsafe in my own skin.” Taylor-Joy had been working constantly during that time, immersing herself in the characters she played while not taking the time to learn about who she is.\nShe could go into an art gallery and recognize the pieces each character she played would like, “but I had no idea what I liked,” she said. “I had no clue of what I would choose for myself. I’m sitting here talking to you, and for the first time, I’m like, I know what I like. I know what I, as a person, enjoy!… The whole of 2019 was me becoming a woman, essentially.”\nOn July 23, The Sun reported that McRae “has practically moved into [Taylor-Joy’s] L.A. home.”\n“They are inseparable and spend all of their time together,” a source close to Taylor-Joy told the outlet. “Her schedule is really hectic because she is so in demand following The Queen’s Gambit, but he is always there for her.”\nThe source added that “Malcolm is practically living with her at her home in L.A. now, and they spend every night together.”\nTaylor-Joy and McRae proved their relationship was still going strong post-Labor Day when the two were photographed kissing in Venice by paparazzi. Taylor-Joy was at the festival to promote her upcoming film Last Night in Soho.\nMcRae and Taylor-Joy posed side-by-side at Vanity Fair’s Oscars after-party. Taylor-Joy was dressed in a black sheer Dior corset dress alongside her partner.\n\nAhead of their Oscars red carpet debut, Taylor-Joy reflected on dating McRae to British Vogue in her cover story with them. “I said to my partner [the musician and actor Malcolm McRae] the other day that he was my hobby,” she said. “I see reading as something that I have to do. He loved it because he’s the same. I’ve finally found someone who will happily sit in silence with me reading. We’re basically 80 years old and seven at the same time and it works really well.”\nShe reflected on being long distance with him, as she owns a house in east London and is regularly traveling for film projects. “Yes, it is [hard], but it’s also kind of great because when you’re together you’re really valuing the time that you have. Everyday mundane activities are so full of joy. I love going to the petrol station with him and filling up the car and going to get breakfast.”\nCasual dating just wasn’t her style either, she added: “I was not a good dater and I’m quite glad to not be. I hear stories from my friends and I’m like, ’God, I would suck at that.’” \nTaylor-Joy and McRae didn't shy away from showcasing their love for each other during the screening for her film The Northman on April 5 in London. Both dressed chicly, Taylor-Joy and McRae kissed in front of photographers in one of their most public displays of affection yet.\nIn a subtle sign of their ties to each other, both Taylor-Joy and McRae follow each other on Instagram. Until recently, neither Taylor-Joy nor McRae posted about each other though or liked the other’s Instagram posts, but Taylor-Joy recently tagged McRae in a photo implying he was at the scene. Then McRae went Instagram official!\nOn October 20, 2021, McRae shared two shots of he and Taylor-Joy standing in a window’s reflection, smiling and holding hands. He captioned it, “Oof supremely happy.”\nIn the photos, Taylor-Joy is wearing a red razor-back tank top with white piping, and a long checkered shirt over it, her blonder hair pushed back with a pair of sunglasses. McRae is in a white t-shirt and black jeans. \nTaylor-Joy was photographed arriving at the Sydney airport in Australia in late June via private jet. As she reached up to brush her hair from her face, a sparkling rock was spotted on her ring finger. Rumors quickly spread that she is engaged to McRae.\nA person at the scene said, “She bounded off the plane and then seemed to flash the ring at her driver before getting in the car. She was either showing off the ring or doing a dance move. Either way, she looked ecstatic.”\nHer plane outfit included matching purple slacks and shirt and she was carrying her new cat, Kitsune, in a backpack with a window for her pet to enjoy the scene.\nTaylor-Joy and McRae may secretly be husband and wife. A source told Page Six that the couple quietly got married in an intimate courthouse wedding. On July 18, Taylor-Joy was photographed walking with McRae, wearing her engagement ring on her left ring finger. Neither McRae, Taylor-Joy, or Taylor-Joy's rep have yet to commented on the wedding reports as of July 19.\nOn Thursday, September 1, Anya Taylor-Joy and Malcolm McCrae enjoyed a little PDA as they walked through the streets of Los Angeles during a heat wave. The couple held hands as they walked, and were photographed embracing and sharing a kiss here and there on their date night in West Hollywood.\nTaylor-Joy was wearing a pale pink sundress with a square neckline with flower details down the front for each button. She carried a green sweater over her left hand, which obscured any potential sighting of a wedding or engagement ring. McRae was wearing a vintage green Nascar shirt over khaki pants.  \nTaylor-Joy and McRae were seen in Sydney's center for a Saturday night out, leaving popular party spot Frankie's in two stylish ensembles. The actress was wearing a bright purple mini dressed with a leather jacket and lace-up boots. She left her long blonde hair loose down her back, and wore dark red lipstick. By her side, McRae was rocking a grown out shag and a green turtleneck under a blazer with jeans. \nThe actress has been filming in Australia since may for the film Furiosa, of which she is the lead. After leaving the night club, they were escorted into a car and headed off.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, October 18, the couple enjoyed a lunch in Sydney at Mark And Vinny's spaghetti. As they waited for their food to arrive, they couldn't keep their hands off each other, leaning in to steal kisses and hug. At one point, McRae even gave Taylor-Joy's hand a chivalrous kiss in a romantic gesture.\nThe actress was wearing a vivid with matching lipstick and a pair of white mules with black designs. She covered it in a navy bomber jacket and pair of cat eye sunglasses. McRae was dressed in black jeans, a white t-shirt, and a grey button down over it. \nOn Sunday, December 25, Anya Taylor-Joy shared a glimpse of her holiday plans on Instagram, posting pictures of herself in bed with MacRae. \nMacRae was wearing a dark sleeping mask up on his forehead, and Taylor-Joy seemed to be in a fluffy white hat with ear flaps. On closer inspection, it is actually a white cat with gray ears. They both cuddled under the white sheets of their bed, looking sleepy and happy. \n“Merry Christmas to all you filthy animals, from our home to yours,” she wrote in the caption. \nThe couple made their award show debut on January 10, posing together at the Golden Globes, where Taylor Joy was a nominee. They showed PDA in front of the photographers.\nTaylor-Joy was photographed on Sunday, January 15, with McRae backstage at the 2023 Critics Choice Awards in Los Angeles, held at the Fairmont Century Plaza Hotel. The actress was presenting an award at the ceremony alongside Top Gun: Maverick actor Miles Teller. The couple were photographed sharing an intimate moment before the festivities where McRae appears to be adjusting her necklace.\nFor the event, Taylor-Joy wore a sheer, nude netted dress over a matching body-suit of opaque fabric and had her long hair piled into a tall knotted updo. She accessorized with diamond jewelry around her neck and one wrist and a pair of sandal heels with a rhinestone strap across her toes. McRae was wearing a traditional suit with an untraditional ribbon cravat under a white button-down shirt.\nTaylor-Joy gave her partner a romantic shoutout on her Instagram on Valentine's Day 2023, sharing footage of them kissing, and writing, “Mi amor, I'm all yours.”\nTen days after, the couple was photographed holding hands while out at London's Chiltern Firehouse on February 24, 2023. Taylor-Joy had been in town for the BAFTA Awards that previous weekend.\nMcRae and Taylor-Joy put their couple style on display and signaled things were on and strong between them when they attended the Tiffany & Co The Landmark store reopening in New York City on April 27, 2023. Taylor-Joy wore a red lace dress while McRae was dressed in a black suit with a black choker.\nOn Thursday, Taylor-Joy and McRae were seen walking outside a friend's house in Los Angeles. It appeared that the musician was comforting the Queen's Gambit star, wrapping her arms around her and kissing her forehead. The pair arrived at the house with guitars and were accompanied by McRae's bandmate Kane Ritchotte.\nTaylor-Joy was wearing a sleeveless white top and an asymmetrical mini skirt and black leather Maison Margiela loafers. \nTaylor-Joy and McRae never specified if they were actually married. Multiple sources close to the couple told the Daily Mail on September 29 that they would be wedding that weekend in Italy in front of 150 guests.\nA source said, “Anya and Malcolm are incredibly private and wanted to ensure their wedding was kept away from prying eyes. They both love Italy and always dreamed of tying the knot in a beautiful setting surrounded by their nearest and dearest. There will be no expense spared and their guests are bound to have an incredible time.”\nTaylor-Joy appeared in a beige gown embellished with birds and flowers in photos of her posing on a window balcony. She wore her platinum hair half up, half down with a white veil. Guests included Cara Delevingne, Julia Garner, Nicolas Hoult, and Miles Teller.\nNeither Taylor-Joy nor McRae have confirmed news of their wedding themselves or shared official photos yet.\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe actress let ELLE.com in on her getting-ready process ahead of the Rabanne show.  \nNext time I attend Paris Fashion Week, remind me to take a page from Madelyn Cline’s book and do it with the same laid-back enjoyment that the actress emanated ahead of Rabanne’s spring/summer 2024 show.   \n“The environment is best described as chaotic good,” she tells me from her Paris hotel room, where she’s preening and primping with one of her best friends, her glam and styling teams, and photographer Jeff Thibodeau, who captured the morning exclusively for ELLE.com.  \nWhen Cline isn’t styling herself or being dressed by iconic fashion houses, she often works with celebrity stylist Mimi Cuttrell for events and red carpets. “I feel so lucky to work with her,” Cline says. “She also helps me pack sometimes, because I’m a mess.” She says mess, I say chaotic good. And she’s no mess at all, to be honest. Today, she’s well-rested and ready for fashion-fueled madness. In fact, she hasn’t done much other than chill out since landing in Paris. “I love laying in bed and rotting after traveling.”\nThe Outer Banks and Glass Onion star does love the City of Lights, though. Everything about it, she tells me. “Paris is so sexy, and the energy during fashion week is perfection.” \n“I’m so excited for the show,” Cline adds. “I love Rabanne’s unconventional use of materials to create almost otherworldly designs...Rabanne, to me, feels very ethereal. Almost fever dreamlike.”\nFor the big event, she chose a light pink and purple frock (by Rabanne, naturally). It’s lacy, semi-sheer in portions, and printed. She exclaims: “I’ve never seen anything like it, and it’s comfy!” Accessories were kept to a minimum, allowing the dress to take center stage. \n\nInstead of dripping in jewels, she wears Fame, a Rabanne fragrance. “It’s very Parisian and it’s a little incense-y.” She picks up on its notes of jasmine, like the kind that grew in her backyard as a kid. \n “We always start with music and food,” she says. Cline describes her getting-ready playlist for me, which includes Party Rock Anthem by LMFAO, along with other bangers from Missy Elliot, Dua Lipa, and, of course, the Ken song. As for the food, the menu is “champagne and hash browns.” Only the finest. \nDespite swirling rumors about her love life as of late, Cline conducts herself like a true girl’s girl (as evidenced by the hash browns). When I ask what her ideal Parisian date night would entail, she answers: a girl’s night in. “Or out. Maybe both.” \nClick through Cline’s getting-ready diary for the Rabanne SS24 show at Paris Fashion Week in our gallery below:\nMeg is the Associate Fashion Commerce Editor at ELLE.com where she researches trends, tests products, and looks for answers to all your burning questions.

{"title": "Stevie Nicks Sent Her Original <i>Rumors</i> Outfit to Mattel to Help Create Her Barbie", "date": "2023-10-02 19:01:00", "text": "The music legend talks getting her own version of the iconic doll, her signature uniform, and her lasting legacy. \nStevie Nicks is taking this call from her flip phone. The septuagenarian rock icon does have an iPhone, but she mostly uses it to take photos. And lately, the photos have been of her new Barbie—as in, the just-launched Barbie that Mattel has fashioned in her likeness. \n“I’m photographing her everywhere we go. I was photographing her this morning sitting on a pillow looking out at Pittsburgh,” she tells ELLE.com, calling from her latest tour stop before heading to New York’s Madison Square Garden on Sunday (where she ultimately unveiled her Barbie). \nNicks has forged a legendary career for herself as both a member of Fleetwood Mac and a solo artist; she has won Grammys, been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame twice, sold millions of records worldwide, and inspired generations of musical artists after her. Having her own Barbie was something she “never thought” would happen. But now that Stevie Barbie (that’s what she calls her) is here, she can’t get enough of her. \n“I just continued my relationship with this little person. I don’t even look at her as a doll anymore. She’s like a real person. She came alive for me.” Nicks admits she props the doll up for photos as she travels from city to city on her tour, wraps her hair when she goes to bed, and talks to her to cheer herself up. “I just go, ‘Hello, Stevie Barbie, how are you doing today?’ She says to me, ‘I’m doing good. How are you doing?’ And that’s it. I feel a hundred percent better.”\nIn Nicks’ signature style, the doll carries a tambourine and wears a breezy black top with cape sleeves and a matching skirt, recreating the look she wears on Fleetwood Mac’s Rumors album cover. She actually lent the original ensemble—a French silk chiffon look by Margi Kent and 1977 handmade Italian boots by Di Fabrizio—to Mattel for reference. “I sent them the boots, which I would never ever let out of my sight before, and the outfit. I said, ‘This is it. This is the whole package.’”\nLooking back at how that now-iconic look materialized, Nicks says, “I went on the road for the first time with Fleetwood Mac in 1976 with just street clothes that I had bought when we joined Fleetwood Mac six months before. I’d actually had a little money to go out and buy some fun clothes. I got out there, and there was food out there, which there hadn’t been before, because we were very poor. All of a sudden I gained like 10, 15 pounds, and I didn’t fit in any of that stuff. When I came home, I had a friend who knew a designer and said, ‘Listen, you need to see Margi, because you need to have, like I said, a uniform.’”\nSo, Nicks sketched up a handkerchief skirt and wraparound blouse with long chiffon sleeves and collaborated with Kent on a design. “That is what I started wearing on stage, starting at the beginning of 1977, and continued to wear in all different skirt lengths,” she says. She’s been wearing it ever since.  \n“When I told Margi Kent, my designer, to make this outfit, I said to her, ‘I want a uniform, and by the way, I’m going to probably still be wearing this when I’m 60.’ Maybe it’ll be a little bigger, but basically this is what I’m going to wear for the next 50 years. She laughed, so funny, ha-ha. I said, ‘It’s not funny. It’s true.’”\nNicks’ Barbie partnership might come as a surprise, but it’s just another testament to her lasting influence. Forty-two years after her debut solo album Bella Donna (46 after Rumors and 50 after Buckingham Nicks), she continues to inspire not only pop culture as a whole, but notably, the youth. She has performed with Harry Styles and Taylor Swift; Fleetwood Mac’s “Dreams” went viral on TikTok; some women have likened her 1997 performance of “Silver Springs” (sung directly to ex and bandmate Lindsey Buckingham) to the Roman Empire; and her history with Fleetwood Mac gained new interest with the TV adaptation of Daisy Jones and the Six (which she has watched at least twice). Nicks shows no sign of slowing down, either. In the midst of her North American tour with Billy Joel, she just announced more show dates through next year.\n“When I look at her [the Stevie Barbie] now, I not only see my younger self … But I also see me at the age that I am now, which we’re not even going to mention that,” she says. “I see myself now in her a lot. That also really makes me happy and proud, and it makes me look at her and go, ‘This is what we did Barbie. We created a look. We created a persona, we created a character, we created a songwriter. We created what you wanted most.’”\nIn a way, Stevie the doll shows just how far Stevie the person has come. “It’s like we did everything that I wanted to do when I was 27.”\nNicks was a kid when she got her first and only Barbie doll in 1958, she recalls, but she didn’t find the toy relatable at the time. “She was the tall Barbie…and she was in her high heels and her beautiful striped bathing suit with her blonde hair on top of her head. I think I was only 11. It was like, huh, my mom’s five-foot tall, so even at 11, I’m going, ‘I don’t think I’m ever going to be as beautiful and as tall as Barbie.’ I didn’t quite understand it. I was just too young, honestly. I’m from a whole ’nother generation.” Her mother packed away that Barbie, but Nicks hopes to search for it one day when she gets back to Phoenix, where she and her parents lived. “I’m really looking forward to finding her, because I know that I’m just going to go like, ‘Oh my God, you just didn’t understand this beautiful Barbie, because you were just too little.’”\nLike many of us, Nicks watched the Barbie movie and loved it. She even has the Margot Robbie Barbie doll, which was released to promote the film. “I just love Margot Robbie. I’ve also taken thousands of pictures of my Margot Robbie Barbie, who is also my Barbie’s best friend now, because they sit next to each other all the time and talk in the silence of the night.”\nShe calls out some of her favorite scenes, like when Robbie’s Stereotypical Barbie realizes her feet are flat or when she drives to the real world and realizes Ken is in her car. But she especially loves the scene where Weird Barbie makes Stereotypical Barbie choose between a pink heeled pump or a Birkenstock to learn the secrets of the universe.\nAs for which shoe she would choose, Nicks firmly responds: “Oh, Stevie is not a Birkenstock [person]. Stevie would find a pair of sandals that worked and were really good, but that were really cute and had a little ankle strap and could be a little bit fashionable. Had I been Margot Robbie Barbie, I would’ve had a lot of trouble making that choice too.”\nThe Stevie Nicks Music Series Barbie is available at Mattel Shop for $55 starting now. \nErica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.

The talented 11-year-old has also continued to build her makeup skills, which her grandmother and Beyoncé’s mother, Tina Knowles, showed off in a recent Instagram video.\nIn the video, Knowles is wearing red lipstick and dramatic lashes, and she speaks into a mirror, saying, “Hi!

{"title": "Jodie Turner-Smith Just Filed for Divorce From Joshua Jackson", "date": "2023-10-02 16:32:00", "text": "Jodie Turner-Smith and Joshua Jackson’s love story is coming to a surprise end, at least publicly. People and TMZ report that Turner-Smith filed for divorce from Jackson today in Los Angeles after more than three years of marriage. She cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reasoning, per TMZ.\nJackson and Turner-Smith share one daughter, who is three years old. Turner-Smith requested that they have joint custody of her and that neither party receive spousal support. TMZ reported that the two have a prenup. Laura Wasser is representing Turner-Smith in the divorce.\nJackson and Turner-Smith first started dating in 2018 after meeting at Usher’s 40th birthday party. In December 2019, they got married. The pair welcomed their daughter in April 2020.\nThe estranged couple was seen out together quite recently, attending J.Crew’s 40th Anniversary party side by side. They also went out to celebrate Turner-Smith’s 37th birthday that Saturday. Neither have commented on the divorce yet. This is both Turner-Smith’s and Jackson’s first marriage.\nIn December 2022, Turner-Smith spoke to Bustle about the impact that dating Jackson, who broke out on Dawson’s Creek, had on her own life. “The thing is I’m not actually that famous,” she said. “But people have looked at certain elements of my life, and those elements of my life have become subjects of tabloid and gossip.” \n“When I came onto the scene I was secretly married and I was secretly pregnant,” she said of when she first started making tabloid headlines. “And that was a story for people. I think a lot of it was because I was married to a white person. And I was married to a white person who has been in the public eye for decades and you know, has been someone that the tabloids like to talk about.” \nShe added later in the interview that she and Jackson work together to balance their careers and parenting. “Historically, women have always been asked to choose between being great mothers and great at their careers,” she said. “[But] Josh has always tried to maintain that I would always have all the support that I needed so that I could do both.” \n“Right now my daughter still comes with me most of the time, except when I go on trips that are under a week,” she continued. “That has been working for us so far. Obviously it’s challenging because I don’t want to create a space in which my husband can’t see her when he’s working.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "I Didn’t Think This Iconic Serum Could Get Any Better (I Was Wrong)", "date": "2023-10-02 16:00:00", "text": "Sulwhasoo’s First Care Activating Serum just got another major upgrade.\n When it comes to Korean skin-care brands, I’ve always considered Sulwhasoo the crème de la crème. Its products are known for cutting-edge innovation, cultural heritage, and a luxurious user experience—all at once. The company traces its roots to 1932, making it one of the oldest and most respected skin-care brands in K-beauty and worldwide, and in 1966, it became the first-ever beauty brand to formulate with ginseng. Since that time, Sulwhasoo has dedicated more than 50 years of research and technology to the ancient herb. So when I learned that the brand had finally added the star ingredient to its iconic First Care Activating Serum—a product I’ve used and adored for years—I couldn’t wait to give the new formulation a go. Here’s how the upgraded serum is leveling up my routine. \nNot-so-fun fact about yours truly: I have a chronic condition called Netherton syndrome that weakens my moisture barrier. So I’m always looking for skin-care products that help address dry patches. I was happy to find that the new formula is even better suited for this challenge. Sulwhasoo’s hyper-concentrated form of Korean ginseng extract is infused in its Sulwhasoo Master Complex™ to help strengthen the moisture barrier and boost skin’s natural abilities to function optimally. Following my usual routine with the product, I applied it on damp skin after cleansing and before moisturizing. After just a few weeks of use, I’ve noticed that my skin isn’t nearly as stressed or temperamental as usual. My tone appears more even, and my skin’s texture is visibly smoother. \nI just turned 30 and am starting to notice that my fine lines are getting deeper and my skin isn’t as firm as it used to be. In comes Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum VI, which utilizes the power of ginseng to address visible signs of aging, including loss of firmness, lack of hydration, and fine lines and wrinkles. As a beauty writer who has tried countless lackluster products that make these same claims, I appreciate that Sulwhasoo has the science to back them up: Its clinical studies showed that the formula improves the look of 10 signs of skin aging within four weeks.*  \nAnd for my part, I’ve definitely noticed that my laugh lines now appear minimized, and the skin around my eyes and jawline looks more taut.

{"title": "Why Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Weren’t Seen Together at the New York Jets Game", "date": "2023-10-02 15:03:00", "text": "Last night, Taylor Swift went out to support her new love interest Travis Kelce and his team the Kansas City Chiefs for the second week in a row at their game against the New York Jets. But unlike last week, there was no footage or photos of Swift and Kelce physically together. They left MetLife Stadium separately too, TMZ pointed out.\nNo photos have emerged so far of the two together or showing any PDA at Zero Bond, where Swift went post-game. It is not even clear at this point if Kelce joined her there. (At the very least, he wasn’t photographed leaving like she was.)\nNo paparazzi shots of them side-by-side in New York City this weekend have surfaced yet either. But Kelce and Swift did spend time together...in a more low-key way. \nKelce was photographed leaving Swift’s apartment on Sunday morning. A source told Page Six that the two didn’t have a sleepover, just a morning hangout. Kelce, the source said, adhered to his team’s 11 P.M. curfew on Saturday ahead of their Sunday game. Swift, meanwhile, got dinner with friends, including Sophie Turner, Brittany Mahomes, and Blake Lively.\nDespite being one of the biggest emerging celebrity couples in the world right now (and the talk of the NFL), Swift and Kelce successfully managed to keep their relationship more private. This change in approach isn’t too surprising, as both a source and Kelce himself spoke about the pair’s desire to keep things between them.\nKelce said on his podcast New Heights on Wednesday, “What’s real [about me and Swift] is it is my personal life, and I want to respect both of our lives. She’s not in the media as much as I am doing this show every single week and you know, having fun during the NFL season and on other guys’ shows like the McAfee Show, and any other show that I go on from here on out.”\n“I’m enjoying life, and I sure as hell enjoyed this weekend so everything moving forward, I think me talking about sports…will kind of have to be where I keep it,” he said.\nAccording to Entertainment Tonight, “When Taylor and Travis first connected, Taylor was looking to have fun while enjoying some downtime. So far, it’s been a nice change of pace for her. Now, as things progress between Taylor and Travis, they’re both looking to keep it more private. They’re both excited about where things are headed.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé, which documents her journey performing her latest album, is coming to theaters in December. Now fans who didn’t get to catch the shows in person have a chance to join in on the fun—and those who’ve already been can relive the magic.\nShortly after completing her final tour stop in Kansas City on Sunday, Beyoncé announced the news with a trailer on social media. “Be careful what you ask for, ‘cause I just might comply,” she captioned the post, quoting “All Up in Your Mind” and perhaps winking at  fans who’ve been begging for Renaissance visuals for over a year. \nHere’s what to know.\nRenaissance: A Film by Beyoncé opens in theaters on Dec. 1, 2023.\nIt will play exclusively in theaters.

However, some of her past projects are online, like Homecoming on Netflix, Life Is but a Dream on Amazon Prime, or Black Is King on Disney+.\nBeyoncé shared a trailer on October 2. Footage shows her backstage, her team working behind the scenes, and her bonding with her family on the road. There are especially sweet glimpses at her daughter Blue Ivy stretching with her before a performance and her son, Sir, giving her a kiss.\nThe montages show fans gathering to watch her shows, too.

{"title": "Manolo Blahnik on The Craft Room, His Inspirations, and Designing for ‘Beautiful Women’", "date": "2023-10-02 13:00:00", "text": "The legendary shoemaker discusses his latest venture in the digital sphere.\nIn 2021, Manolo Blahnik introduced a virtual archive on its website where you can freely explore the world of the luxury shoemaker, from the eponymous designer’s first-ever silhouette to his muses and inspiration throughout the decades. And today, the brand adds a new room—The Craft Room—which showcases the incredible craftsmanship that goes into each covetable pair (including the Carrie Bradshaw-beloved Hangisi). Not only does it offer an unparalleled look into the world of fine shoemaking, with eight separate rooms dedicated to specific parts of the shoemaking journey—but it’s a celebration of all things Manolo, from its custom processes to the signature lace and buckles. \nTo properly unveil the new venture, Manolo Blahnik hosted an exclusive trip to its factory in Vigevano, Italy, bringing to life the journey from sketch to shoe. In Milan, ELLE had the privilege of visiting some of Blahnik’s favorite places, discovered where he finds inspiration for his collections, and even experienced a day in the factory to watch the full construction process and artisans at work firsthand. Below, the veteran founder discusses why he wanted to bring The Craft Room to life digitally, his muses, and more. \nThe whole experience is a big thank you to the artisans that I work with in the factories. I work so incredibly closely with all the wonderful artisans, and have done for almost 35 years. Craftsmanship is in their blood, passed down over generations. The Craft Room celebrates their work, and I hope it showcases that I would be nowhere without their magic hands. Also, the fact that it is online means anyone is able to see it from anywhere in the world. How exciting!\nFor me, everything starts with a sketch. I need to get it on paper first before anything else happens. I communicate through drawing. The next stage is speaking to the artisans in the factories so they can begin to build the shoe. The team there knows exactly what I am thinking, and strives to bring all my creations to life. Even with the most intricate and embellished designs, they are always pushing boundaries to ensure complete perfection and attention to detail. My inspiration comes from anywhere and everywhere! These days, I spend a lot of time in nature, and find I get a lot of inspiration from my surroundings.\nMy process has not changed at all! The sketch still comes first. I always carry my pens and paper with me so that when inspiration comes, I am always ready. Or else I forget it and the shoe is gone! I have been working with the artisans for so long, it’s like we have a secret language—they feel like family. I am so proud that we have been able to put family first in our business. We are a family that makes beautiful things that we hope make people smile. That’s the most important thing for me. \nIt is extremely important. Once we have decided on the shape and how the shoe will be made, we look into fabric and colors. Sometimes, the fabric and colors are so clear in my mind that the shoe must be made exactly how I envision it. Other times, the shoe needs some experimentation, some trial and error. Some fabrics will work, and others will not. When we see the right fabric and the right color for the right shoe, we know immediately—it’s a gut feeling. There is a collective gasp with the artisans!\nThere is not one type of Manolo muse, so I find it hard to define. Tina Chow was a muse of mine for so long, and I miss her dearly. The same with Anna Piaggi and Isabella Blow. I have so much to thank Diana Vreeland for. All of these women had the most extraordinary style, and that is something all of my muses seem to have in common. I simply love designing for beautiful women who have an enriched life.\nWe don’t call it “sustainability” because I feel sustainability is misunderstood. It’s binary—you either are, or you are not. We use the term  “responsibility” because it is a journey. There is a consistent, continuous, growing roadmap that we are on, looking at how we can improve and move forward. It’s a more realistic approach. We’re on that journey. We have a lot to do, but have had great success so far, and we are constantly striving to be better.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nKevin LeBlanc is the Fashion Associate at ELLE Magazine.

{"title": "Ella Richards and Lucie de la Falaise Are Fashion (And Rock) Royalty", "date": "2023-10-02 12:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe multigenerational style icons on family, style, and staying power. \nOn the outskirts of Paris, a studio blooms with bright flowers—some real, some faux. Lucie de la Falaise, however, is accoutred in all black. “I’m like a strong fairy,” the legendary model jokes. Her daughter Ella Richards, the shoot’s other subject—in a white bathrobe and house slippers, and the same slick blonde chignon as Mom—counters: “If you are, then I am.”\nThat exchange sums up their playful dynamic, the two perpetually in cahoots. When the photographer behind the shoot, Brigitte Niedermair, saw the duo leaving Dior’s Mumbai show in March sniffing jasmine necklaces, very much in fairy mode, she had the idea to photograph them festooned with blooms, and clad in some of fall’s most exuberant, lush takes on floral, from designers like Bottega Veneta and Chanel.\nTheir lighthearted demeanor belies a weighty legacy in both fashion and rock ’n’ roll. De la Falaise’s aunt Loulou was a muse to Yves Saint Laurent, and de la Falaise herself worked for the designer, when, at 21, she decided to marry Marlon Richards, the son of Keith Richards. (They’re still together.) Thus Anita Pallenberg, the late rock goddess and reluctant model who played the villainess in Barbarella, is, in addition to being the subject of the recent documentary Anita, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, Ella Richards’s grandmother.\nAll of which is to say: Mother and daughter have It Girl-dom practically encoded in their DNA, though de la Falaise and her longtime publicist and later business partner Hélène Renaud remind me—warmly, humbly—that I really needn’t go there again. Yes, those rock-royalty genes are a “huge benefit,” and the physical resemblances are obvious. But I could take a different tack when writing about them, like when Cat Power covered “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” and entirely left out the titular chorus (to very satisfying effect, it must be said). Old song, new life.\nAs for de la Falaise—who is based in West Sussex, where the family decamped some two decades ago—she’s relieved to be on the other side of the “old-fashioned idea” that any of us is just one thing. Today, “you can be pretty and have a voice, too,” she says, “and have something on the side.” You can bloom again and again.\nIn 2017, she and Renaud launched Lucie de la Falaise Studio, a lifestyle/interior design firm, to spearhead more of the kinds of collaborations they’ve done in the past. In 2016, de la Falaise designed a wicker picnic hamper kitted out with Dior plates, glasses, cutlery, and napkins. And in 2018, for Schiaparelli’s spring haute couture collection, she dreamed up a series of bags made from raffia, wicker, driftwood, wooden beads, pearls, and upcycled plastic. De la Falaise and Richards demur when asked about upcoming projects—“That stuff’s always hush-hush until the last minute,” Richards says—but it’s something to see them together in the meantime.\nNow 50, de la Falaise was in her early twenties and in the midst of her modeling career when she had her daughter, who then was often on set for (and ended up in) her mom’s shoots. When Richards later accepted her own modeling gigs, for brands like Burberry and Tom Ford, de la Falaise chaperoned her as vigilantly as she’d been chaperoned herself. Richards says her mom encouraged her to “figure out what you love...try a little bit of everything.” (Also, her godmother Kate Moss—whose agency Richards has signed with—has impressed upon her that “No” is a full sentence.) \nBased in London, the 27-year-old Richards is a city girl but not a wild child. Clubbing, she says, has “never really been my thing.” Dinners with friends are so much better. Her closet, bookshelf, and apartment in general are stuffed with heirlooms and hand-me-downs—including Pallenberg’s clothes (an archive she wants to publicly exhibit) as well as her books. She’s planning to read a couple of the classics next: Dune, by Frank Herbert, and The Leopard, by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa—novels, incidentally, about succession and finding your place in the world order.\nHer favorite possessions tend to be secondhand—including a pale pink silk frock that belonged to the model-actress Patti Hansen, her step-grandmother. “I couldn’t wait for the day that I would grow into it,” she says. She loves to look for garments at vintage shops and to browse antiques at online auctions before bedtime. “That’s what excites me these days!” she admits.\nRichards can also be spotted before dawn at the antique stalls in Kempton Park Market, where she has acquired such objets déco as a convex mirror framed with mother-of-pearl, and her description of the scene sounds like advice for life in general: “You [have to] go with a torch and make decisions really quickly,” she says. “You don’t know what you’re buying—but you just have to hope that when the sun comes out, you will like it.” \nHair by Shon Hyungsun Ju at The Wall Group; makeup by Peter Philips for Christian Dior Makeup; manicure by Saloua Derbali for Manucurist; models: Ella Richards at Kate Moss Agency and Lucie de la Falaise; set design by Alexander Bock at Streeters; produced by Shape Production.\nThis article appears in the September 2023 issue of ELLE.\nGET THE LATEST ISSUE OF ELLE\nChantel Tattoli is a Paris-based, Florida-bred culture journalist whose work has recently appeared in T_he Paris Review_, Wired, the New York Times, THR, and the Porsche journal 000. \nCesar Chávez’s Granddaughter on the Biden Campaign\nPhoebe Dynevor Is in Her Fearless Era\nFall Is All About the Big Bag Theory\nRaul Lopez Is Doing It for the Culture\nBishme Cromartie’s Victory Means Something More\nHow Khaite Captured the Cool-Girl Crowd\nThe 1950s Are Back, at Least on the Runway\nMy So-Called #TradWife Life\nFashion Has a Case of Main Character Syndrome\nZendaya Holds Court\n‘Nobody Can Take Your Power’\nIt’s Livvy Dunne’s World\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "Pisces Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-02 11:00:10", "text": "(February 19 - March 20)\nWhat’s REALLY going on here, Pisces? Wednesday, October 4 kicks off an exploratory few weeks as curious Mercury deep dives into Libra and your eighth house of secrets, mysteries and intimacy until October 22. It’s not like you take things at face value, but during this sleuthing span, you won’t be happy until you get to the bottom of the mystery. You might pursue some kind of metaphysical or esoteric study, like Tarot cards or astrology. Keep your intuition humming along by paying extra-close attention to people’s vibes and body language and the synchronicities that others write off as coincidence. (Your tuned-in sign knows better!)\nWith the messenger planet parked in this seductive zone, your magnetism will be dialed up. If you’re single, take your sweet time getting to know someone before merging on a soul level (or whatever you want to call that). Attached? Plan more “just the two of us” time. Bonus points if you do that in a romantic setting, preferably after the sun’s gone down.\nAnother call to the couple bubble comes on Sunday, October 8, as sensual Venus vectors into Virgo and your relationship zone until November 8. This shift is a welcome one since Venus has been paddling through your austere sixth house (Leo) since June 5—an extra-long time due to the July 22 to September 3 retrograde. Since then, you may have felt a bit guarded or more focused on getting grounded and healthy than doing other sorts of things with your body.\nThe odds of finding your “someone” increase exponentially as Venus swings by your seventh house from Sunday until November 8. Yes, even if you are still nursing wounded feelings from a breakup or decided two days ago to take a dating sabbatical to focus on your painting. Cupid’s timing is rarely convenient—and it doesn’t have to be either/or. Who says new love can’t heal you or that your potential S.O. can’t compose songs in the background while you’re layering Cadmium Red onto a canvas? Having boundaries is one thing but making rules to keep yourself “safe” could mean missing out on someone special.\nAlready found your true love? Don’t shy away from talks of exclusivity or areas that could use some improvement. Harmonious Venus lends a hand in the “creative compromise” department. If you both give an inch or put more energy towards a shared goal, your combined efforts might make magic. Old-married types should lighten up about those petty things that make you crazy, like socks on the bedroom floor or dishes in the sink. Instead, focus on the things you love about your mate, and see if that doesn’t make hearts (and other regions) swell.\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Aquarius Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-02 11:00:09", "text": "(January 20 - February 18)\nFree your mind! That’s not something we have to say to an Aquarius often. But ever since mental Mercury plunged into Virgo and your intense eighth house on July 28, you’ve been especially prone to ruminating. (And let’s not even talk about the stuck energy of the August 23 to September 15 retrograde…) But this Wednesday, October 4, Mercury moves on to lighthearted Libra, pulling you out of that rut and restoring your optimism.\nWhile problems won’t evaporate into thin air, your perspective is likely to shift. From now until October 22, you’ll be driven by your sense of humor and adventurous spirit. This is a great time to reconnect with friends in other states or countries. Keep your WhatsApp alerts on because you never know who may ping you out of the blue. Your mind will be hungry for fresh inspiration and information, so sign up for a foreign language class or apply to a certification program that can bump you into a higher pay grade.\nJust as Mercury leaves your eighth house, Venus—the other planet who’s pulling out of a protracted passage—plunges in. On Sunday, October 8, the goddess of love wraps up a four-month tour through Leo and your seventh house of partnerships. That might sound like a heavenly bonus, but since Venus spun retrograde from July 22 to September 3, you may have had your hands full with relationship issues. Your own desire for commitment may have run hot and cold and an ex’s disruptions didn’t make things any easier.\nWith Venus now heading into Virgo from Sunday until November 8, you have a chance to hit the brakes and see who can REALLY go the distance. (And who you actually want to have by your side for that marathon.) It’s not superficial to care about appearances, Aquarius—you like what you like. But looks might take third place to intellect and higher purpose between now and November 8. (Aim for the trifecta of all three and you’ll strike the bull’s eye.) If you’re single and searching, circulate among the high-vibes crowd. Virgo is the sign of service and with this cosmic energy ruling your erotic eighth house it’s no wonder you get all hot for the humanitarian type. No, a meditation circle or activist meetup shouldn’t be treated like a pick-up joint, but there’s no reason you can’t be open to the fringe benefit of meeting someone multi-dimensionally attractive there.\nAre you already half of a purpose-driven power couple? With Venus casting her rosy glow over your relationship until November 8, your resistance to permanent bonding could melt away. Open that joint checking account, start house hunting, get engaged. Already did one or all three of those? Scoop a little out of your shared funds and splurge on a sexier bedroom set or maybe a couples retreat somewhere steamy and tropical. \nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Capricorn Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-02 11:00:08", "text": "(December 22 - January 19)\nThe pumpkin lagers are flowing freely, but starting this Wednesday, October 4, you’ll be on your grind—and perhaps too busy to partake in happy hours. As astute Mercury stampedes into Libra and your tenth house of professional ambition and success until October 22, your competitive spirit is lit! Visualize yourself mingling with the heavy hitters and then, find your “in” to their elite circles.\nClimbing the career ladder involves more than busting your butt on the job. With social Libra ruling your tenth house, you know that it’s also about who you know—and how strong your relationships are. If the aforementioned happy hour serves a bonus opportunity to network, by all means pop up with your elevator pitch rehearsed. Since the tenth house is the domain of the divine masculine, men may appear as “earth angels” over the coming few weeks. Reach out to some of the helpful and influential guys in your sphere if you need a boost.\nRomantically, you’ll be in wilder and far more playful spirits starting this Sunday, October 8. After four months submerged in Leo and your private eighth house, Venus comes up for air, heading into Virgo and your zone of adventures and optimism. You’ve held a lot in since June 5—and may have felt locked tighter than an international bank vault while Venus spun retrograde from July 22 to September 3. But starting Sunday, your icy defenses quickly begin to thaw.\nUntil November 8 (and hopefully after that, too) you’ll enjoy pushing the erotic envelope and expanding your palette. The ninth house rules travel and cross-cultural connections, making it the perfect opportunity to diversify your dating portfolio. You could swoon for someone whose packaging is VERY different from your own. If you’re single and heading out of town over the next four weeks, pack some alluring eveningwear. You might wind up going on impromptu dates when you’re done with your day of meetings.\nCoupled Capricorns, don’t go into early hibernation mode just yet. This Venus cycle wants you out, exploring the world as a pair. If you’re in a relationship, research destinations together, ideally someplace neither of you has been. Even a night in a boutique hotel will do wonders for your mood AND your love life.\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Sagittarius Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-02 11:00:08", "text": "(November 22 - December 21)\nYou’ll have other things on your mind besides “work, work and more work” starting Wednesday, October 4. That day, messenger Mercury saunters into Libra and your eleventh house of teamwork and technology until October 22. This marks the end of Mercury’s hyperactive trek through Virgo and your career zone that began on July 28—an extra-long journey because of a retrograde from August 23 to September 15. Some Archers may have burned the candle at both ends to cover for vacationing colleagues. Now it’s time to let others come to YOUR aid. With the communication planet buzzing through your community-spirited eleventh house, you can blend work with socializing or get chummier with a few cool coworkers.\nPro tip: When recruiting members for the Sagittarius Dream Team, be slow and selective. For ANY joint ventures to succeed, you need to sync up with the right, qualified people. Mercury can make you quick with the trigger finger but take the time to follow through on background checks and references. And before you set off for world domination together, test the waters with a small-scale project to make sure you click.\nBut don’t put the power suit in mothballs just yet. On Sunday, October 8, charming, convivial Venus picks up where Mercury left off, heading into Virgo and your achievement zone until November 8. This shift is a seismic one since it marks the end of Venus’ prolonged passage through Leo and your adventurous, independent ninth house that began way back on June 5. You’ve preferred to be a free-range Sagittarius for the past four months—or at least a Centaur on a longer leash. And while Venus was retrograde from July 22 to September 3, you may have had to face some uncomfortable truths. But the answer to the question “What’s next?” may have eluded you.\nWith Venus heading into Virgo on Sunday, you’ll be ready to get your hands back on the wheel. For the coming four weeks, DON’T just go with the flow, romantically speaking. That’s how you wind up in a whisky-tango-foxtrot kind of dance with…wait, what’s your name, actually? No, you can’t control EVERY aspect of interpersonal relationships, but you can certainly elevate your standards. Keep them high…and also realistic. If you know that your crush is moving abroad in three months, why even set yourself up for torment?\nAlready spoken for? This is power couple time. Dress up and circulate as a pair—working the room together can be such a turn on! Or beef up the shared savings account by making new investment plans or even launching a business together. What starts as a kitchen-table side hustle (a special offering for the holiday season, perhaps?) could draw a legit income stream over time.\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Scorpio Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-02 11:00:07", "text": "(October 23 - November 21)\nHollywood is digging itself out of the lapse from the writer’s strike, but starting this Wednesday, October 4, your imagination will be active enough to fill every missing slot in the “scripted series” category. For this, you can thank messenger Mercury who dives into Libra and the rabbit hole of your dreamy twelfth house. On a “lite” day, you’re a deep thinker, Scorpio (sometimes you’re even a mystery unto yourself). That’s part of your intense appeal—to the people who aren’t content with anything superficial. Between now and October 22, your creative life will be rich. Record every fantastical notion, even if you have zero idea about the practical application just yet.\nWhile Mercury took a long trek through Virgo since July 28—including a befuddling retrograde from August 23 to September 15—your team-spirited eleventh house was in its crosshairs. Have you had your fill of people-time yet? Retreat into solitude (at least a few nights a week) and enjoy the contemplative, restful energy of Mercury in the twelfth house. Once the buzzy planet wings into your sign on October 22, you won’t have many quiet moments. Enjoy a little serenity while you can!\nNot that you can go total “lone wolf,” of course. On Sunday, another planet wraps up a prolonged cycle. This time, it’s convivial Venus who struts into Virgo and your collaborative, experimental eleventh house until November 8. This will be a refreshing change of pace! Since June 5, Venus was parked in Leo, pouring her enchanting energy into your tenth house of career. Despite the rocky retrograde from July 22 to September 3, you may have had some exciting professional developments over the past four months.\nBefore burnout sets in, add more “play” to your work-life balance equation. And if you’re single and searching, take a hard left away from the conventional, Scorpio. With Venus in your delightfully eccentric eleventh house, anyone too “vanilla” will have to wait. Make a policy of NOT judging a book by its cover for the next few weeks. Venus is the image consultant of the skies so make sure you’re wearing enough of your own personality on your sleeve. Push the envelope with your style—even if you have to wait until after office hours to fully unleash.\nThe eleventh house is the tech sector, and with love goddess Venus logging in, single Scorpios have higher odds of success on dating apps. Group hangs could also yield some hot prospects—and with the bonus of friends who can verify their references, which is a huge plus for your gun-shy sign. Coupled Scorpios should make a point of mingling outside the house together more often. Where do your respective friend groups overlap? Here’s your opportunity to form a joint entourage of people you BOTH enjoy—and fill the fall calendar with dinner parties, dive bar nights and weekend trips en masse.    \nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Libra Weekly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-02 11:00:07", "text": "(September 23 - October 22)\nIf your birthday season has been off to a slow start, you might want to buckle up this Wednesday, October 4. After two months slogging through Virgo and your transitional twelfth house, social Mercury commences its annual visit to your sign until October 22, energizing you mentally and physically and sparking your creative juices. Genius ideas and opportunities for collaborations come flowing in like magic, but you won’t have time for small talk. You’re a Libra on a mission, so set your sights for the finish line and hit the gas.\nAre you ready to refresh your personal brand? With the messenger planet whirring in your first house of identity, experiment with new ways of dressing and expressing yourself. This is a particularly rich time to use your language and communication skills, since Mercury rules thought and speech. Don’t worry about “the party line” and spare yourself the corporate jargon. Speak from the heart and you’ll have ’em before you even form the word “hello.”\nOn Sunday, it’s your cosmic custodian Venus who is ending the second prolonged transit of this week. After four whole months in Leo and your cerebral, experimental eleventh house, the love planet glides into Virgo until November 8. With your twelfth house of fantasy lit by Venus for four weeks, you won’t be stuck in your head the way you’ve been since June 5. (And let’s not even talk about Venus’ libido-numbing retrograde from July 22 to September 3.) In fact, a torrent of bottled-up emotions may come rushing out—everything from deep desire to grief. Welcome this release, Libra. Uncomfortable as it may be, it’s also cleansing and gets you back into feeling like the heart-centered, caring soul you relish being in the world.\nRose-colored glasses may be a favorite accessory for some Libras during this phase. Until November 8, your imagination will run towards the dreamier end of the spectrum. This will be a huge blessing for your creative pursuits and your ability to glimpse the highest potential in any situation. But easy does it when it comes to love. True, there are few things quite so magical as “new relationship energy.” But in time the dew will evaporate and you’ll have to deal with the very real human standing in front of you. Go ahead and enjoy the luscious liftoff you get from falling into a lover’s arms. (No one could stop you, anyway.) But wait until you’ve been through a good day and a bad one together before making it Instagram official. People’s “flaws” might shatter a few romantic illusions. But those edges can actually create some undeniably sexy dynamic tension.\nCoupled Libras may feel adrift during this Venus cycle, perhaps due to an unresolved issue you swept under the rug. Instead of ruminating or stewing in resentment, bravely begin a dialogue about the distance you’re feeling. If you’re not able to broach the matter without sounding accusatory or confused, consider that your cue to do some private processing first. The underlying issue may have little to do with bae—and more to do with something you locked in the vault of your childhood memories.

After two months revving its engines in Virgo (including that schedule-skewing retrograde from August 23 to September 15), the messenger planet heads into Libra and your pragmatic, productive second house until October 22. If you need to play catch-up on administrative affairs like paying bills and sorting your work schedule, you’re in luck. Mercury in balanced Libra can help you slow down enough to evaluate the deluge of downloads that have flooded in since July 28.\nNo, this might not be the most fun you’ve had in ages, but as a Virgo, you’re happiest when your affairs are in order. During this three-week transit, you’ll be able to screen out distractions and focus on your high-priority items. Getting your budget squared away is a good place to start, even if that entails cutting back on a bit of socializing. But it’s not all about what you have to go without. Inventive Mercury in your money sector can trigger creative revenue-generating ideas and lead you to collaborators and clients who might play a role in them.\nAnd if you’re worried about being all work, no play, let us allay your fears. This Sunday, October 8 enchanting Venus makes her annual stopover to Virgo and ignites your radiant pilot light until November 8. This shift will be palpable since Venus has been on an extended tour through Leo and your dreamy, fantasy-fueled twelfth house since way back on June 5. There was also a retrograde to contend with between July 22 and September 3, which may have churned up some old fears. If you’ve been flying under the radar, this is your invitation to come back out and play.\nWhen the planet of beauty and love visits your realm, you can’t hide your glow! Others may bask in it, but that doesn’t mean they can treat you like their personal charging station. Unplug quickly from any draining alliances. You need to save that energy for your fellow luminaries! For romance or finance, you could attract some high-visibility players by November 8—and even step into that role yourself.\nCoupled Virgos should lovingly explain that you’re going to need a little more solo time. For best results, reassure your partner that you’re not blowing them off and share openly about your adventures when you return to base. Along with boosting your self-confidence, Venus in Virgo can help you produce some inspired creative work. The muse has been sending plenty of downloads since early June.

On Wednesday, October 4, expressive Mercury leaves your security-minded second house after a protracted two-month visit. Since July 28, you may have been overly focused on work or made a lot of sacrifices to get your budget back on track. (And the retrograde from August 23 to September 3 was not exactly kind to your finances. Grrr.) Relish your role of superconnector again starting Wednesday when effusive Mercury heads into social Libra and your expressive third house until October 22. Your popularity is poised to spike off the charts, with old and would-be friends filing out of the woodwork. If funds are tight, make it your mission to game-ify affordable hangouts. Bake-offs, dress-up movie nights, scavenger hunts and, of course, all the free live music you can find!\nAlso: You won’t have to fill up your tank with expensive fuel to get your fix of fun activities. The third house rules hometown happenings, and your local scene will be hopping. Flit like the social butterfly you are, but don’t feel pressured to settle down in any one garden. With capricious Mercury here, you’ll prefer dabbling to signing on for lifetime membership. And in your communication house, the messenger planet gives you the gift of gab AND the power of persuasion. No one’s tugging on your reins, Leo, so make sure you don’t get carried away with your own impassioned rhetoric.\nNow for the truly major news of the week—at least for all the Lions out there. On Sunday, October 8, you’ll wave love planet Venus farewell after her protracted, four-month journey through your sign. It’s been a wild ride, but after hosting glamour-queen Venus since June 5—including that agonizing retrograde from July 22 to September 3—you could use a little time out from the party scene. Cue up the slow jams station on Spotify and install a dimmer switch while you’re at it. As Venus heads into Virgo and your luxuriating second house until November 8, woe betide anyone who tries rushing you. Wake up a little earlier so you can take your sweet ol’ time to get ready—whether you’re assembling a runway-perfect outfit or journaling as you sip your post-meditation tea.\nThese next four weeks can be plenty sensual. Reduce your speed and savor the simple (but decadent) pleasures: sex on high-thread-count sheets, sharing a great bottle of vino, cuddling up for a marathon of a show that you both love. Of course, slowing down enough to actually talk to each other at the end of the day can be the most potent aphrodisiac of all. Single Leos might be drawn to the more traditional type.

And after two buzzy months activating your social third house, Mercury comes in for a landing in Libra this Wednesday, October 4. As the communicative planet hunkers down in your intimate, domestic fourth house until October 22, make time for the real VIPs in your life—your oldest and dearest friends and people who share your DNA. (The ones you like, that is.) You might take a pass on some fun parties or industry events in lieu of movie nights and home-cooked meals for your BFFs.\nIs your pad hosting ready? If not, use this Mercury cycle to make your living space more comfortable and functional. Reorganize your storage area, create a stunning fall tablescape, and maybe invest in a new crockpot for easy cool-weather meals. Social Mercury might even inspire you to join a cooking, wine or book club to connect in a homespun way with people who share your interests.\nBut don’t go into total hiding, Cancer! On Sunday, October 8, vivacious Venus picks up where Mercury left off. As the glamorous romance planet struts into Virgo until November 8, your concept of “home” may extend to your entire hometown. Whenever cabin fever sets in, flap your social butterfly wings and go explore new venues in your neighborhood. Lively conversations will keep you engaged—careful you don’t miss your Lyft chatting away with that engaging raconteur outside the bar. If you’re not feeling the cultural scene in your area, adopt yourself into a more happening zip code. Switch your fitness membership to a studio there or, if you’re an independent contractor, rent a desk in a co-working space. That way, you’ll have a landing place after your commute.\nLove goddess Venus can make you quite the coquette when she sails through your third house. And TBH, you’re ready to lighten things up! Since June 5, Venus has been hiding out in Leo’s den, spinning her wheels in your traditional second house. The retrograde phase from July 22 to September 3 may have made those once-anchoring routines feel downright stultifying. Or maybe you found yourself bored by the non-options before you. Take heart! Starting Sunday, you can freely sample Cupid’s smorgasbord and be more forward when you flirt. Even if you claim you’re not the Tinder type, you might be pleased by what and who the dating apps yield over the coming four weeks. Coupled Crabs should socialize more often as a pair.

A loud alarm rings this Wednesday, October 4 as your cosmic champion, Mercury, peels out of your domestic zone and races into Libra and your fifth house of self-expression and romance. For the past two months (since July 28), Mercury’s extended saunter through Virgo kept your focus on home and personal issues. Matters under your roof or with family may have been especially bumpy during the August 23 to September 15 retrograde. If you hit a roadblock at work or on a passion project, you’ll be happy to hear that Mercury’s move through Libra can help you overcome it between now and October 22. Residual tension with roommates and relatives should dissipate. If you’ve been keeping a low profile anywhere, the quicksilver planet in your flamboyant fifth house of fame may turn the spotlight directly on you. Pitch, perform, present—and strike a pose!\nSince the fifth house rules romance, cheeky Mercury’s tour through Libra could make you even MORE of a shameless flirt. Talking to strangers is a Gemini specialty. So is leading them on. With fair-minded Libra in the mix, it’s best to be up front about your intentions—or at least your limitations, like say, the fact that you just started seriously dating someone or you’re moving across country in three weeks. If there are obvious lines you don’t intend to cross, honor them. We’re certain you’ll still find ways to get your kicks!\nWhile Mercury makes you the toast of the town, don’t roll up the welcome mat altogether. Romance takes a turn for the cozier this Sunday, October 8 when comfort-loving Venus moves into Virgo and picks up where Mercury left off. As the planet of amour nestles into your sentimental and domestic fourth house until November 8, you’ll be seeking a spoonmate. Expert cuddling skills should be a pre-requisite for anyone wishing to climb into your bed. If you’re not the type who can sleep wrapped up in someone’s arms, consciously create moments for TLC. Maybe a hand-in-hand evening stroll or some downtempo snuggle time before hitting the sack? (Best done with all digital devices out of reach.) If you don’t already live with your love interest, cohabitation may become a hot topic over the coming four weeks.\nAnd roll out the welcome mat for the decorating muse! Venus in DIY Virgo could turn your “maison” into a maker’s space—or at least the canvas for your creativity. If you’re the crafty type, enjoy four fun weeks of making anything and everything by hand. Macrame planters or have a canning party to preserve delicious summer fruits. You could go total Prairie Home Companion on the world, no apologies! If you’re more of an enthusiast than an artisan, join a wine or book club or host a dinner party before November 8. \nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

Odds are, you’re more than ready to get life back into an orderly groove. Mercury’s been on a hedonistic tear through your fifth house of passion and pleasure since July 28. And the August 23 to September 15 retrograde certainly didn’t help with willpower one iota.\nYou don’t have to go cold turkey on anything or make any radical moves. A better approach is to check out a few new activities and see if they’re something you can commit to. While you don’t mind going hard on a workout, the “no pain, no gain” shtick is SO not you, Bull. Don’t forget to add adequate sleep, hydration and reducing stress to your list. Over the next three weeks, book those doctors’ appointments, schedule a massage or two and, as we head into colder weather, focus on preventative medicine, the smartest kind of all.\nOn Sunday, October 8, a second planet wraps up a prolonged passage—and this time, it’s your ruler Venus who we’re talking about.

(And maybe in one of the “haute” pieces in your wardrobe!) Feel free to make a stop at the salon because the whole world feels like your runway for the next four weeks. Your social life—and your love life—are sure to see an uptick with Venus here. Get your name on a couple invite lists and you’ll quickly reclaim your rightful place among the cultural cognoscenti.\nSingle Bulls might have some fresh arm candy to show off before November 8. If you’re attached, Venus could get you ridiculously inspired to co-create, and that may span the range from redecorating your bedroom to getting sized for rings. The fifth house rules fertility, and “getting in the family way” could suddenly seem like a romantic idea.

So you’ll be happy to hear that relationships are due to come into clearer focus this Wednesday, October 4 as flirty Mercury swings into Libra and your partnership house until October 22. Hopefully you got your ducks in a row during the messenger planet’s extra-long tour of Virgo and your organized, health-conscious sixth house that began on July 28. Thanks to a retrograde from August 23 to September 15, you may have been able to get your systems and fitness regimen back on track. Now, Ram, you’re ready to share the good parts of your life with a special someone. Expressive Mercury in diplomatic Libra will supply the perfect words to express your hopes for how you’d like things to be. Been on the fence about a situationship—or been waiting for your partner to go all in on a plan? This quick transit can turn a maybe into a yes—or no way! Well, at least you’ll know.\nOn Sunday, a second planet ends its extended voyage through a sign—and this one will also bring some developments for your love life. Romantic Venus bids passionate, dramatic (and yeah, exhausting) Leo farewell after a protracted passage that began way back on June 5. If you made it through the July 22 to September 3 Venus retrograde with your relationships intact, good on you! But even the healthiest, happiest partnerships were not immune to the theatrics that this four-month cycle kicked up.\nNormally, you wouldn’t be quite so excited to hear that Venus is settling into predictable Virgo for a month, but that news is right on time this Sunday, October 8. Single Rams should make qualities like “lives a healthy lifestyle” and “is grounded and well groomed” top-tier criteria. As within, so without, right? Your odds of being treated well go up exponentially when you pick partners who take great care of themselves. Coupled Rams might hop on the wellness wagon together. When you’re cooking a romantic dinner, make it Paleo or vegan and go for evening jogs in tandem before hunkering down to re-watch an older season of Game of Thrones.\nThis Venus cycle inspires you to get back on the wagon and treat your body like the temple it is. Your sign loves a challenge, but pleasure-seeking Venus is anti-pain. Find a workout that feels fun, maybe one with a competitive element, like cycling or a vigorous dance class. Since you bore easily, look for teachers who change their playlists and sequences often. Since Venus is the planet of romance, you might apply a similar philosophy to the game of love.\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

Last weekend, she sat with his mother, Donna, in the VIP box at Arrowhead Stadium as they played the Chicago Bears. Previous to that appearance, Kelce had admitted to trying attract Swift's attention when he went to her Eras Tour stop at the same venue.\nOn Wednesday, Kelce spoke on his podcast New Heights about the frenzy her game attendance created and his future intention to be a bit more low key as they get to know one another. \n“What’s real is it is my personal life, and I want to respect both of our lives,” he said. “She’s not in the media as much as I am, doing this show every single week, and you know, having fun during the NFL season and on other guys’ shows like The [Pat] McAfee Show, and any other show that I go on from here on out.”\nHe added, “I’m enjoying life, and I sure as hell enjoyed this weekend so everything moving forward, I think me talking about sports...will kind of have to be where I keep it.” \nA source recently told Entertainment Tonight something similar about the pair, explaining that things started casually, but they've been surprised by how well they're connecting.\n“When Taylor and Travis first connected, Taylor was looking to have fun while enjoying some downtime,” the source said. “So far, it’s been a nice change of pace for her.

{"title": "Heidi Klum Reportedly Wants Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce at Her Famous Annual Halloween Bash", "date": "2023-10-01 20:17:00", "text": "Model Heidi Klum is famous for her Halloween costume parties, and she is already considering her guest list. At the top of it are Eras Tour star Taylor Swift and her new romantic interest, NFL star Travis Kelce. In a conversation with the Daily Mail, Klum essentially offered an open invitation to the pair. \n“I would love to invite them,” she said at the American's Got Talent show finale, which Klum judges.\nShe added, “If they would just show up, I'm sure no one at the door will turn them away. Unless the costume is so strong that no one recognizes them, like mine.”\nKlum could have been referring to a number of elaborate costumes she's donned over her many years as a Halloween hostess, but she most likely meant her “earthworm” costume from 2022. She was definitely unrecognizable.\nThe costume went immediately viral and Klum was applauded for her sense of humor, but she said her team told her it was a “crazy” idea and tried to discourage it. Thankfully, she could not be stopped.\nSwift and Kelce were seen together last weekend following the Kansas City Chiefs game at an after party, where photographers snapped a shot of her with an arm around his neck. She was also photographed in the VIP box with Kelce's mother, Donna.\nIt has been rumored that the pair have just started spending time together, but a source said they have already been joking about a couple's costume. Specifically, they want to go as Barbie and Ken from the Margot Robbie-led hit. \n“The whirlwind that this relationship has started is something that Taylor is familiar with, and Travis is OK with,” the insider said. “He wants to get in as much time as possible with her before she embarks on her international tour.”\nThey add, “Heidi Klum's Halloween party is a very big option for them to attend, they haven't made it 100 per cent, but since they have made things official in other ways that they have even started a relationship, they are really feeling it all out and they might want to make that night be the night they go, red carpet official.”\nThe new couple is entirely aware of how much scrutiny they're already receiving.\n“This is the relationship they put themselves into, and they are prepared to see it through and see where it goes and are looking to take advantage of everything it brings on the outside along with the personal enjoyment that comes from it,” the source explained. \nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker's Complete Relationship Timeline", "date": "2023-10-01 20:06:00", "text": "Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker have had a very passionate and public relationship and were engaged after less than a year of dating in October 2021. They shared photos from the beach proposal in Montecito, California.\nThey ended up having quite a few weddings ceremonies, one in las Vegas, one in a Santa Barbara clerk's office to make things legal, and one in Italy. This might all seem fast, but they have actually been friends and neighbors for quite some time. They both have homes in Calabasas but have been in other relationships.\nKardashian has three children with her ex, Scott Disick: Mason, Penelope, and Reign. Barker has two children: Landon and Alabama, with his ex-wife Shanna Moakler, and is the step-dad to Moakler's daughter, Atiana Cecilia De La Hoya. \nIn June, Kardashian and Barker announced they were expecting their first child together. \nHere's Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker's complete relationship timeline.\nThe couple was seen together in Palm Springs at Kris Jenner's home there, sparking rumors they might be dating. People reported in late January that it was official, with a source saying, “They're in Palm Springs together. They've been dating for about a month or two.” The source added, “Travis has liked her for a while.” \nE! reported they went to dinner at Matsuhisa in Los Angeles, and an eyewitness told the publication that “they seem very connected, very close. Travis took her hand, and they giggled as they started having a little thumb war with one another. It was playful and sweet. They were talking constantly and very engaged with one another. It seems like such a natural fit.”\nThey spent that Valentine's Day together, according to Page Six. Barker went semi-Instagram official by sharing a photo of a diamond anklet that he gave her on his Instagram Story. Kardashian shared an ode to her new boyfriend on her Instagram Story: “Roses are red / Violets are blue / Garlic bread / Blink-182,” the poem read.\nShe later went official-official with a picture of her hand and Barker's entwined. Barker commented “🖤” on the post. A source told People at the time,“Kourtney is very happy with Travis. She wanted to confirm their relationship, because it's something positive.”\nIn early March, Barker made an appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show. Barrymore asked Barker about dating with kids, and he took the opportunity to praise Kardashian.\n“Up until now, I would date girls who didn't have kids, and I find it kind of hard because I think they would have trouble understanding, like, ‘Why don't you want to go to dinner every night with me? Or why don't you want to see me every night?’,” Barker said. “And now, I'm spending time with a woman who's a great mom, who's a great friend, and you don't have to worry about any of those things. It just comes natural.” \nLater in March, they were photographed at UFC 260: Miocic vs. Ngannou 2 fight, alongside friends Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly. \nMGK, Megan Fox, Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian in the house for #UFC260 🙌(@espnmma) pic.twitter.com/8kdRcCmnnP\nThey took their first family vacation in April, heading to Deer Valley, Utah. Kardashian shared pics featuring Alabama and Atiana on snowmobiles.\nKardashian called Barker her boyfriend for the first time in a TikTok posted by Barker's daughter, Alabama, while playing the viral “Pass the Phone” challenge. \n“I'm passing the phone to my boyfriend,” she said.\nBarker also shared content from the vacation, including some videos from the slopes.\nThey spent that Easter together as well, and Kris Jenner shared pics of the family gathering on Instagram.\n“Happy Easter, and thank you @callawaygolf #irvingazoff for making our Easter so special!!! 🙏🐰🐣🐥🙏 and thank you for the @coreygamble @realtristan13 @travisscott @travisbarker that are already on the golf course!!!!!!! LOL #impatient,” Jenner captioned the post.\nThat month, a source told Entertainment Tonight that things had become “way more serious.” \n“This is the happiest Kourtney has been in a while, and her family is thrilled for her,” the source said. “Kourtney and Travis' kids get along great, and all have the best time together. Kourtney's been trying to keep their relationship as private as she can on social media, but they're both super into each other and cute together.”\nThen Barker got a tattoo reading “Kourtney” on his chest. \nFor the reality TV star's 42nd birthday, Barker gave her a huge bouquet.\nAnd on Instagram, he wrote, “I F-CKING LOVE YOU! 🖤 YOU'RE A BLESSING TO THIS WORLD HAPPY BIRTHDAY.”\nThey headed back to Utah later that month.\nFor Mother's Day, Barker gave Kardashian more flowers.\nAnd he got another tattoo of the words “I love you,” in her handwriting.\nKardashian helped Barker take his first flight since 2008 after surviving a crash 13 years prior. He captioned his post about the flight to Mexico, “With you anything is possible.”\nThey headed to Italy to celebrate.\nShortly after, Kardashian's ex Scott Disick sent an Instagram DM to one of The Kardashian star's ex-boyfriends, Younes Bendjima, saying, “Yo is this chick ok!???? Broooo like what is this. In the middle of Italy.” \nDisick appeared to be jealous of her affection with with her new beau.\nThe couple went red carpet official at the 2021 MTV VMAs.\nOn October 17, 2021, Barker proposed to Kardashian on the beach in Montecito, California.\nKardashian and Barker spent the holidays with their family, and she shared some pics with the caption, “‘Twas the night before Christmas.”\nThe couple enjoyed a “practice” wedding in Las Vegas after the Grammys, and she shared photos of her and Barker at a chapel, explaining they were not actually married.\n“Found these in my camera roll,” Kardashian wrote. “Once upon a time in a land far, far away (Las Vegas) at 2am, after an epic night and a little tequila, a queen and her handsome king ventured out to the only open chapel with an Elvis and got married (with no license). Practice makes perfect.”\nTalk of having kids is on the table. A source speaking to Entertainment Tonight said that the couple is “so in love,” and they are “open to the idea of having children together and growing their family.” \nIt was added that “their families are both supportive of it too and just want them to be happy.” \nThey had another wedding ceremony in May, but this one was legally binding. TMZ broke the news that they were married on Sunday, May 15, in Santa Barbara. They left the scene of the courthouse in a convertible with a “Just Married” sign attached to its trunk.\nPeople confirmed the news, with a source saying, “They had to legally get married first ahead of their big Italian wedding, which is happening very soon. All the details are set and the whole family, including all the kids, are very excited.”\nThe big ceremony took place in Portofino, Italy, and the event eventually became a special aired on Hulu. \nIn June, Barker had a scary and painful health complication and had to be hospitalized for pancreatitis. TMZ wrote he was checked into West Hills hospital, then transferred by ambulance to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.\nLater, Barker wrote on Instagram Stories, “I went in for an endoscopy Monday feeling great. But After dinner, I developed excruciating pain and have been hospitalized ever since.” \nHe continued, “During the endoscopy, I had a very small polyp removed right in a very sensitive area, usually handled by specialists, which unfortunately damaged a critical pancreatic drainage tube. This resulted in severe life threatening pancreatitis.”\nBarker concluded, “I am so very very grateful that with intensive treatment I am currently much better.”\nOn Stories, Kardashian wrote, “Oh what a scary and emotional week it has been. Our health is everything and sometimes we take for granted how quickly it can change. Travis and I went in for a routine endoscopy together and he ended up with severe, life-threatening pancreatitis.”\nShe added, “I am so grateful to God for healing my husband, for all of your prayers for him and for us, for the overwhelming outpouring of love and support. I am so touched and appreciative.”\nShe then thanked doctors and nurses at Cedars Sinai for their “wonderful care” of them both, writing, “It's crazy how sometimes words could never truly express the gratitude or feelings I have inside me.” \nKardashian joined Travis Barker as he went on tour with Machine Gun Kelly, and shared some pictures of what it looks like being a “tour wife.”\nBarker commented on the post, “Tour life's better with you,” with a black heart and devil face emoji for a little emphasis. He later shared some pics of her too.\n“Practice makes perfect,” he captioned it.\nWhich she re-shared, writing, “Time for drum practice.”\n“Favorite time of the day,” Barker commented.\nIn September, Kardashian told WSJ magazine that she and Barker had decided to pause their fertility treatments when they were planning their wedding. \n“We started an IVF journey, but I stopped. It was a lot,” she said. “I took a break to just focus on our wedding and getting married.” \nKardashian attended Barker's Coachella set with Blink-182 and original bandmate Tom DeLonge.\n“My first @blink182 show!” Kardashian wrote on a post about the night.\nBarker then commented, “Your coming on tour with me.”\nIn May, Kardashian shared on the first episode of The Kardashians' third season more about ending IVF. \n“We are officially done with IVF,” she said in a confessional. “We would love a baby more than anything, but I just really believe in what God has in store for us. If that’s a baby, then I believe that it will happen.”\nShe said added that her seven frozen eggs from before she started dating Barker “didn’t survive, [and none of them] made it to an embryo.”\n“The freezing of the eggs isn’t guaranteed,” she said. “I think that that’s a misunderstanding. People do it thinking that it’s like a safety net and it’s not.” \nShe added, “Whatever’s meant to be... Being happy is most important, and being a good parent to my kids.”\nIn June, Kardashian and Barker announced they were expecting a baby by having the POOSH founder hold  up a sign reading, “Travis, I'm pregnant” at a Blink-182 concert. \nJust one week later, they shared the baby’s sex with a shot of blue confetti: They are having a boy.\nA source told Entertainment Tonight in June, “Kourtney and Travis are on cloud nine. This pregnancy is beyond Kourtney's wildest dreams. Kourtney and Travis feel like this is one of the most magical things to happen to them and a complete miracle. They are so thrilled and can't wait to experience this pregnancy together, bring a baby into the world as a unit, and expand and grow their families.\" \nKardashian shared some very sexy maternity looks with the caption “lost and found.” \nIn September, Barker returned from his Blink-182 tour to join Kardashian at a hospital in Los Angeles, California. The couple were photographed leaving together, but there has been no announcement as to what the issue was. However, the band tweeted about changing tour plans in light of Barker's exodus.\nDue to an urgent family matter, Travis has had to return home to the States. The Glasgow, Belfast, and Dublin shows are being postponed. More information in regards to his return to Europe and rescheduled dates will be provided as soon as available.\n“Due to an urgent family matter, Travis has had to return home to the States,” the band wrote. “The Glasgow, Belfast, and Dublin shows are being postponed. More information in regards to his return to Europe and rescheduled dates will be provided as soon as available.”\nBarker did share images of himself in an airport prayer room as he waited to travel to the U.S. from the U.K.\nHis ex, Shanna Moakler did comment to TMZ that the children she shares with Barker are “safe and sound.”\n“When they have to cancel shows, it's a big deal, so I am praying for his immediate family and the baby and Kourtney is safe and okay,” she added.\nAt the end of September, Barker and Kardashian celebrate their son’s upcoming arrival with a Disney-themed baby shower. \nFans speculated that Barker may have hinted that they plan to name their baby Rocky, as he liked a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, calling the name out as cute.\nOn Saturday, September 30, Kardashian shared a photo in her Instagram Story of a gorgeous rose bouquet sent to her by Barker after he returned to his tour with Blink-182. According to his Stories, Barker had touched down in Lisbon, Portugal.\nOn October 1, Kourtney shared some shots of one of her Halloween costumes as the “Bride of Frankenstein.”\nIn her Stories, she reposted a Reel from when she and Barker dressed up as the Bride and Frankenstein's Monster.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber Reportedly Did Not Dine Together at Same Paris Restaurant", "date": "2023-10-01 18:35:00", "text": "A few days ago, Hailey Bieber and Selena Gomez were seen entering and leaving the same restaurant in Paris as the city flooded with celebrities for Fashion Week. Fans of both immediately went wild, speculating on possible interactions between the two. However, TMZ reports that while they both stopped in at L'Avenue, they did not dine together and were even on different floors of the venue. \nTo add to the speculation, the model and The Only Murders In the Building star were both seen at the same fashion after-party, which was also attended by Kendall Jenner and Nicola Peltz. Once again, they reportedly did not interact.\nSome of the confusion is linked to a viral TikTok insinuating a secret meet up.\nGomez is frequently linked to the Rhode founder even when they have zero contact. She was the on-again-off-again girlfriend of Justin Bieber before they ultimately split in 2018. He married Hailey shortly after. All three parties appear to have long ago moved on, but any hint of interaction or comment is picked apart by their followers as evidence of an ongoing feud.\nAbout six months ago, Gomez's fans targeted Hailey after she posted a TikTok made with Jenner and Justine Skye, in which they're lip-syncing to the words, “I’m not saying she deserves it, but God’s timing is always right.”\nThe TikTok was posted around the same time Gomez was receiving unflattering attention over some paparazzi photos. Hailey has denied the post was related at all, and deleted the TikTok.\n“I never comment on this type of thing but we were just having a girls' night and did a random TikTok sound for fun,” she wrote later. “It’s not directed at anyone.”\nHailey eventually asked Gomez to speak with her fans about the ongoing harassment she was receiving. \n“This isn't what I stand for. No one should have to experience hate or bullying. I've always advocated for kindness and really want this all to stop,” Gomez said on social media.\nHailey responded with gratitude, saying, “I want to thank Selena for speaking out, as her and I have been discussing the last few weeks how to move past this ongoing narrative between her and I.”\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

On December 25, 2022, the musical icon shared a photo on Twitter of a giant diamond ring in a pear shape being held by Edwards, displaying the jewelry box and his flame manicure design.  \n“THERE R NO WORDS,” Cher wrote in the caption, adding, “ALEXANDER, A.E.”\nTHERE R NO WORDS,ALEXANDER,A.E pic.twitter.com/TZOYLGVWkv\nIt seemed like an engagement is being strongly implied here, but a few hours later, Cher posted the pic again, saying coyly that she posted it “cause his nails are so cool.”\nI posted this cause his nails are so cool pic.twitter.com/aeUOOy4IIE\nIn May 2023, TMZ reported that the couple broke up weeks before after six months of dating and were never even engaged. Then, in mid-September 2023, they were reported to be exploring their relationship again.\nGiven all that history, here’s what is known about Edwards.\nEdwards is the VP of A&R at Def Jam Records, and is known for his relationship with model and reality star Amber Rose. He and Rose got together in 2018, and had a son in 2019, who they named Slash Electric Alexander Edwards. They broke up in 2021.\nUs Weekly reported on September 18, 2023 that they were exploring reconciliation. “They had stayed in communication even though they called things off a few months ago,” the source said. “They’ve reached a point where they want to give things a second try. They’re not officially back together yet, but they’re enjoying spending time together again and they make each other happy.” The pair was photographed out together days before, on September 15.\nThen, during Paris Fashion Week, they made several appearances out together in the city. On Friday, September 28, they arrived at the Costes Hotel together in coordinated ensembles. Cher was wearing black leather over a matching satin dress. Edwards sported a black tuxedo jacket, over a white button-down, and he also had platinum locks. That same day they were photographed at the Givenchy show, again coordinated in black.\nOn Sunday, October 1, they were seen arriving together at the Valentino show, this time with Cher wearing her hair black.\nCher started tweeting about Edwards in November 2022, sharing heart emojis and pics of him to her fans. They were spotted holding hand in Los Angeles that same month. The 77-year-old singer and 37-year-old artist apparently met in September 2022 at Paris Fashion Week.\nAlexander♥️ pic.twitter.com/o8tH1F0Th6\nCher said in a tweet that Edwards approached her. \n“He’s 36 & In End He Came after me,Till we met in the middle.He’s Consistent one ,I’m The Skittish one. We love each other…. LADIES NEVER GIVE UP,” she wrote.\nLater, she discussed their relationship on The Kelly Clarkson Show, addressing the age gap.\n“On paper it’s kind of ridiculous but in real life we get along great,” she said. “He’s fabulous, and I don’t give men qualities that they don’t deserve. But he’s very kind, he’s very smart. He’s very talented and he’s really funny so, and I think he’s quite handsome.”\nShe added, “If I hadn’t met younger men in my life I would’ve never had a date...Older men just didn’t like me all that much. ... Younger men don’t care if you’re, you know, funny or outrageous and want to do stupid things and you have a strong personality. I’m not giving up my personality for anybody.”\nSources close to the couple told TMZ on May 1, 2023 that Cher and Edwards broke up quietly weeks before. The exact reason wasn’t disclosed, but the sources revealed they were never actually engaged. Edwards had just gotten Cher a diamond ring for the holidays, and they went along with engagement speculation for fun.\nThe Moonstruck star was married to the late Sonny Bono from 1964 to 1975, and then to Gregg Allman from 1975 to 1979. \nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "Florence Pugh Wears Semi-Sheer Gown With String Bikini Bodice", "date": "2023-10-01 16:31:00", "text": "On Saturday, Florence Pugh attended the The BoF 500 gala in a stunning black Valentino gown made from semi-sheer fabric. The dramatic skirt trailed along the red carpet in a long train while the bodice was composed of minimal fabric, forming a string bikini-style shape around her bust. \nShe wore the gown with black platform heels and accessorized with a gold pendant necklace studded with diamonds, her gold septum piercing, and a few rings. The Black Widow actress had her short platinum hair slicked back away from her face with a slight finger wave. Her makeup was a natural palette with pale pink lips and a smokey eye.\nPugh loves Valentino and sultry looks that display her figure. In 2022, she wore another Valentino piece in Rome that caused some controversy because of its see-through top. She told ELLE UK that she likes clothes that show her as she is.\n“I'm not trying to hide the cellulite on my thigh,” she stated. “I speak the way I do about my body because I'm not trying to hide the cellulite on my thigh or the squidge in between my arm and my boob: I would much rather lay it all out....I think the scariest thing for me are the instances where people have been upset that I've shown ‘too much’ of myself.”\nShe added, “When everything went down with the Valentino pink dress a year ago, my nipples were on display through a piece of fabric, and it really wound people up...It's the freedom that people are scared of; the fact I'm comfortable and happy. Keeping women down by commenting on their bodies has worked for a very long time.”\n“I think we're in this swing now where lots of people are saying, ‘I don't give a sh-t,’” she continued. “Unfortunately, we've become so terrified of the human body that we can't even look at my two little cute nipples behind fabric in a way that isn't sexual...We need to keep reminding everybody that there is more than one reason for women's bodies [to exist].”\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

Swift is longtime friends with Lively and has seemingly been supporting Sophie Turner this past month as she faces divorce proceedings and a custody battle with her ex-partner, Joe Jonas.\nMahomes and Swift appear to have recently become better acquainted since the Eras Tour star attended a Kansas City Chiefs game last weekend. Mahomes is married to the Chiefs' quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, and Swift has reportedly been on a few dates with his teammate Travis Kelce. Swift's appearance at the game at Arrowhead Stadium alongside Kelce's mother cause quite a frenzy amidst Swifties and NFL fans.\nFor the night out in NYC, Swift wore a spaghetti strap minidress in black with a belt at the waist and a pair of strappy sandal heels. She had a black handbag on a long strap and a pendant around her neck. The Midnights singer swept her hair up into a bun with tendrils around her face and wore her signature red lipstick.\nLively went with more of a layered fall look, wearing a multi-colored pencil skirt by MOTHER. She paired it with a beige crop top and a tweed jacket over her shoulders and had on suede knee-high brown boots.\nTurner arrived a bit later in a rich red-brown leather two-piece composed of a mini skirt and long sleeved jacket. She wore it with knee-high black leather boots and carried a small matching purse on a gold chain.\nMahomes wore black leather pants with a white t-shirt and an over-sized jacket made from black and gray leather with white piping, and a pair of black boots.\nSwift and Mahomes became friendly at the afterparty for the game last weekend, and it's rumored Swift will attend the Kansas City Chiefs game against the New York Jets on Sunday night.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

Intensifier Mars is also in Libra until October 12, and on October 14, eclipse season begins with a Libra solar (new moon) eclipse—the first of this month’s changemaking duo. \nEclipses come in pairs, and the October 14 eclipse is the first one to land in Libra since 2016. It’s part of a two-year series on the Aries/Libra axis that’s revolutionizing your approach to money, self-worth and joint ventures. Your most important ties could be revolutionized, and your values and priorities might undergo big shifts. \nThe second eclipse arrives on October 28, and it’s a full moon (lunar) eclipse in Taurus. This one will impact your social life and the way you express yourself. As it beams into your third house of communication, you could get long-awaited news or a surprising message. This is the grand finale of an eclipse series that began in November 2021, touching down in Taurus and Scorpio and revolutionizing communication, learning, travel and your role in the community.\nEclipses can bring sudden changes, shifting alliances and curveball news. For that reason, you might be glad that all of the slow-moving outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto) are in low-power retrogrades this month. It will give you a chance to process! \nThe one exception is on October 10, when transformational Pluto corrects course and turns direct (forward) in Capricorn and your eleventh house of friendship and teamwork. If power struggles have disrupted a group dynamic or your social circle’s gotten shadier than a Bridgerton scandal sheet, the drama will start to die down. \nPerspective returns starting October 23, when the Sun moves into Scorpio and your adventurous, optimistic ninth house for a month. Pull yourself out of tunnel vision and go reconnect with the wider world. Make travel plans, follow your natural curiosity about a topic, explore a business startup idea. Let your visionary side out to play now, Pisces. \nDive into those mermaidy depths, Pisces. October always starts out as an intense and introspective time for you as the Sun makes its annual rounds through Libra and your private eighth house until October 22. You’re not exactly eager to be in the limelight now, especially with energy planet Mars also in Libra until October 12. Swim under the radar as often as you can. This is an excellent time for behind-the-scenes work, intensive research and focused tasks you can do without distraction.\nThe eighth house rules merging, and this solar cycle can strengthen your bonds with the innermost members of Team Pisces. You don’t have to isolate yourself or struggle alone—in fact, please DON’T do that. If you’re grappling with something complex and confounding, reach out for support from trusted people, whether friends or a professional, such as a therapist or energy worker. Real estate, long-term finances and other assets also fall under the eighth-house domain, so use this month to assess your plans and make sure you’re properly set up for the future.\nFrom investments and shared finances to engagements and pregnancies, the Sun in this perma-linking zone has you evaluating all your closest alliances—and how far you want to go together. Libra season could spark a strong mind-body-spirit attraction to someone, so keep your antennae up for a sexy soulmate or, if you’re in a relationship, for ways to deepen your intimacy. \nWatch your temper on October 8, when a volatile square forms between Mars and powermonger Pluto, which is in Capricorn and your eleventh house of teamwork and technology. Jealousy could erupt between friends, or a simmering rivalry might reach a meltdown point. Do your best to stay out of the controversy. Attempts to mediate may backfire, so let the drama queens and divas settle their own issues without you! \nIf you have to protect any legal rights or intellectual property, that’s a different story. (You’ll still need to stay out of the low-vibe conflict, though.) Call an attorney and handle your strategy on the downlow instead of getting sucked into any interpersonal scuffles. This square could also crank up some sexy tension with a friend or co-worker. Think VERY carefully before crossing that line.\nOn October 10, karmic powerhouse Pluto wakes up from a five-month retrograde nap, powering forward in Capricorn and your eleventh house of groups and teams. A stalled collaboration could pick up speed, and you may find group dynamics improving (hooray!), especially if tension has been simmering beneath the surface. \nEarlier this year, yous social circle may have gotten an upgrade. Associating with a more mature and ambitious crowd is paying off for you, and Pluto’s course correction could turn a few of those folks into powerful allies who can open doors. \nA mind-body-soul connection could turn into a sizzling fall romance, especially near the October 14 Libra new moon—a potent solar eclipse—which sends fresh-start signals into your intimate eighth house. The eighth house rules permanent bonds, from marriage to cohabitation to any way you might join your life with another person’s. Maybe the connection is more of a business spark, but it will ignite with equal fervor at this eclipse. \nThis is the first eclipse in Libra since 2016, and the second in a two-year series on the Aries/Libra axis that will revolutionize your money, intimacy and investments zones between March 2023 and March 2025. \nThe eighth house rules shared finances and investments, making this a great time to explore ways you can multiply your moolah. The solar eclipse could serve up an opportunity to join forces with a well-connected VIP. Could you merge your superpowers for mutual gain? With healer-feeler Chiron opposite the new moon, you may have to do some deeper inner work to get to the root of any blocks. \nYour perspective widens on October 23, when the Sun shifts into Scorpio and your ninth house of adventure, travel and expanded horizons. All that deep reflection of the past month will yield a refreshing wider-angle view of the world. \nYou could also adopt a traveler’s mindset closer to home, looking at your current situation in a completely new and exploratory light. Perhaps you’ll sign up for a mind-expanding workshop or teach one yourself. Or maybe you’ll master that foreign language you’ve only flirted with thus far, either in a class or with an app like Duolingo. \nThe actions you take are less important than your mindset: When it comes to realizing your wildest dreams, think big, Pisces. Got an idea for a business you could launch? Go-getter Mars will also join the Sun in Scorpio from October 12 until November 24, making you extra pumped to explore your entrepreneurial side. \nOn October 28, the year’s only Taurus full moon is a partial lunar eclipse, igniting your third house of communication and community. An idea that’s been percolating since the corresponding Taurus new moon on May 19 could reach an exciting turning point. Have you been waiting for news or a green light on a project? It could come—and faster than you expected! \nMake sure you’re camera and microphone ready. Your opinion could be in high demand today. Record a podcast or an Instagram Reel if you’ve got the irrepressible urge to speak out. Stand up and share at the meeting. Take the plunge and be honest with friends instead of saying everything’s “fine.”\nThe energy is especially kinetic today because it’s the grand finale of a two-year eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021. You’ve been finding your voice, speaking your truth and clarifying your message ever since. Assertive Mars (in Scorpio) is also opposite outspoken Jupiter (in Taurus) today. You might find that once you open up that can of truth serum, there’s a whole lot more in there than you expected!\nCosmic cuffing season arrives with serious intention this month! On October 8, Venus will cruise into Virgo and your seventh house of partnership until November 8. If the balance in a key connection feels off-kilter, these next three weeks provide an opening for talking it out and finding a workable compromise. \nSingle Pisces should lean into your natural gift of gab for attracting someone with LTR potential. Sultry conversation is the best aphrodisiac! Don’t be surprised if a meeting of the minds quickly turns into a linking of the hearts too.\nYou may have some lingering tension to clear as Venus finally exits Leo and your stressful sixth house after an extended four-month visit. Since June 5, life has felt mired in the practical more than the magical—not the preferred ratio for you, Pisces. And to make matters worse, Venus was retrograde in Leo from July 22 to September 3, putting a damper on the sweet summer lovin’ you look forward to every year. \nGrrr! Use this new Venus in Virgo monthlong cycle to get back in sync with your closest people—and yourself—and to bring balance back to your bonds.\nEmotions could still be intense for the first half of October, running the gamut from jealousy and obsessiveness to a passion that’s burning so strong you can’t even think about the outcome. That’s because Mars is wrapping a visit to Libra and your intense, intimate eighth house that began on August 27. With Mars in this heat zone until October 12, lust or anger can override common sense. Make sure to have plenty of healthy outlets to prevent a reactive meltdown and a messy cleanup job.\nYour fun-loving side returns on October 12, when the randy red planet relocates to Scorpio and your expansive ninth house until November 24. Mars in this big-picture zone will snap you out of tunnel vision and help you see all the amorous options and adventures that await. \nSwim up to the surface, Pisces, and have a look around! With your wanderlust fired up, too many cozy days at home could make you feel claustrophobic. Poke through the travel sites and make some calls, even if the website says the place is fully booked for the holiday season. You might as well get on the waitlist. Under this spontaneous surge, hopping a last-minute flight isn’t too far out of reach. \nAnd if you can’t get away, bring the action and adventure close to home. With your vivid imagination, a sexy staycation should be easy to plan—whether it’s for yourself or shared with a playful plus-one. \nInvest and inspect! With the Sun in Libra until October 23 and go-getter Mars here through October 12, this is a powerful period to examine your financial and wealth-building efforts through a microscope. Libra rules your laser-focused eighth house, the realm of joint ventures, research and large lump sums. \nYou’ve got the stamina for those nitty-gritty details—and you could make a compelling pitch for a shared business endeavor, especially at the October 14 Libra solar eclipse. Get things in order and you could welcome a windfall!\nExciting news could arrive with the October 28 Taurus lunar eclipse, which spotlights your communication house and attracts kindred spirits and helpful collaborators. Make your announcement, drop your new product, tell the world what you’ve been up to these past few months!\nLove Days: 6, 11\nMoney Days: 18, 27\nLuck Days: 14, 25\nOff Days: 9, 13\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(January 20 - February 18)\nThink big—no, bigger, Aquarius! October is your most visionary month, when your ambitions are amplified and you feel like everything’s possible for you. With two game-changing eclipses lighting up the skies on October 14 and October 28, change is happening whether you want it to or not. \nRide the wave. These eclipses could bring an unexpected business opportunity or living situation. Buying a home, moving or a change in your family could be on the agenda at the October 28 Taurus lunar eclipse especially. That one is the grand finale of a two-year eclipse series on the Taurus/Scorpio axis that’s been making major waves in your personal AND professional endeavors. You could close out October with big decisions in both areas.\nBut for now, there’s a wide world to explore! The Sun is soaring through Libra and your ninth house of expansion, travel and adventure until October 23, a time when you feel like anything’s possible—and hey, why shouldn’t you? This buoyant starmap is further amped up by energizer Mars, which is making its biennial blast through Libra until October 12. \nYou could give any motivational speaking guru a run for their “idea evangelist” money with this cosmic lineup, especially near the October 14 Libra new moon solar eclipse. From launching a startup to returning to school to publishing your ideas, this eclipse presses down hard on the “share” button and inspires you to put yourself out there in a big way.\nWhether you realize it or not, your subconscious has been gathering a lot of wisdom and creative capital over the spring and summer. Shadowy Pluto ends a five-month retrograde on October 10 that began in your sign on May 1, then slipped back into Capricorn and your imaginative, healing twelfth house on June 11. You could emerge from this soul-searching period with many gifts to share. \nThe other four slow-moving outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) remain retrograde for the whole month, giving you space to ponder matters of money, home and family at a gentler pace. Don’t rush into decisions if you can help it—but know that the eclipses may force your hand despite these cosmic cycles.\nScorpio season sweeps in on October 23 and revs up your ambitious, professional tenth house. With motivator Mars energizing this career corner of your chart from October 12 to November 24, the last quarter of 2023 could be a lucrative one. Why not end the year with a success story, Aquarius? \nHalloween could be filled with tricks AND treats thanks to the moon in Gemini and your playful, passionate fifth house. Feel free to make it a spicy night for romance. But watch out for jealous vibes and masked intentions as the moon squares off against Venus in Virgo and your secretive eighth house. Maybe you’ll sneak off with a sexy costumed cutie—but screen them for skeletons in the closet and ghosting tendencies before you get swept away.\nSpread your wings, Water Bearer! The Sun is blazing through Libra and your expansive ninth house until October 23, giving you a wide-angle view on life and emboldening you to take risks—creatively, emotionally and in every way. \nFor your future-forward sign, who’s happiest when you have something big to look forward to, Libra season might be one of your favorite times of year. With your mind so open to new possibilities, you’ll be able to take advantage of those spontaneous moments that can lead to new friendships and adventures. Follow your curiosity, Aquarius, and see where it takes you.\nEvery two years, Mars arrives to ramp up your excitement to triple-exclamation-point levels—and here it is! Until October 12, the red planet will ride shotgun with el Sol, heating up your enthusiasm even more. If you can slip in a getaway, even for a weekend, this month would be ideal. You want anything but “business as usual” now, making this a stellar time to launch an indie business, sign up for a workshop or class, or to expand your mind by exploring new metaphysical ideas. Shift your perspective on the world and watch yourself attract a whole different set of results. \nOne day to lay low arrives on October 8, when rash Mars locks into a volatile square with subterranean Pluto. Mars in your outspoken and expansive ninth house can tempt you to make a blunt comment or take a big risk that you haven’t totally thought through. \nWith shadowy Pluto playing the blame game, you could be undermined at every turn. Someone may turn your words around on you or punish you for a misstep. You might be pointing fingers instead of taking responsibility for your actions. Catch yourself if you’re doing that, Aquarius. Where can you take the high road here instead of getting dragged into drama or defensiveness?\nCome out of the fog, Aquarius. On October 10, karmic Pluto wakes up from a five-month retrograde, powering forward in Capricorn and your twelfth house of sacrifice and endings. This could be a bit like a bear rousing from hibernation—you don’t know if he’ll be grumpy and reactive or just groggy enough to seem harmless. Similarly, your own energy could be a bit erratic for the next couple days, especially with an eclipse coming.\nPluto’s been retrograde since May 1, and the first six weeks of its backspin (until June 11) it was in Aquarius—a new 20-year phase that we got a sneak preview of in March and April and where it will return to in earnest next year. Until then, you have a few loose ends to wrap up!\nSince June 11, Pluto’s been back-spinning through your zone of healing and closure. Some Aquarians weathered a loss or were plunged into the depths of emotions you might not have wanted to deal with. Perhaps you did some important forgiveness work or faced up to an addictive pattern. If you’ve been forcing an outcome and swimming upstream, Pluto retrograde was a time to STOP pushing an agenda. \nThe only way to free yourself from suffering is to practice radical acceptance—to the best of your human ability. That might get easier now with Pluto direct. Other important lessons from the retrograde? Allowing others to support you and for things to unfold in their own time. Now you’ll start to see that tough inner work pay off. \nWhere would you like to be six months from now? And what horizon-broadening experiences do you want to have between now and then? At the October 14 Libra new moon, start putting plans into action. This new moon, which falls in your visionary and risk-taking ninth house, is also a solar eclipse—the first one we’ve seen in Libra since 2016! \nBig ideas could turn into reality quickly, so fasten your seat belt. Get some bucket-list goals on the agenda, from launching a startup venture to visiting a dream destination. The ninth house rules travel, study and entrepreneurship. Don’t limit yourself—explore all possibilities during this blue-sky month without holding back! \nThis eclipse is part of a two-year series on the Aries/Libra axis that will revolutionize your zones of communication, local events and long-distance connections between March 2023 and March 2025. Influential people can enter your life from far away and right down the street in your homegrown community. Keep an open mind (and door) to all possibilities.\nGot some emotional repair work to do around your confidence and using your voice? The new moon will also be opposite healer-feeler Chiron in Aries and your communication house. Reminder, Aquarius: You have something important to say, and people want (need) to hear it! Telling your own story can be transformational to someone else who’s going through a similar struggle now. Share generously—you never know who you might touch. \nCareer becomes your focus starting October 23, when the Sun moves into Scorpio and your tenth house of ambition and professional goals. What would you like to accomplish over the next month, before the holidays kick into high gear? \nIf excess and hedonism sent your life a bit off the rails over the past three weeks, you can corral things into more of a structure during this disciplined time. Or if you’ve had a million “ahh-mazing” ideas, you can now sort the winners from the duds and get to work on building those out. \nGo-getter Mars is blazing through Scorpio too from October 12 to November 24. You can make serious strides to the top for the rest of the year. Align yourself with power players and well-connected people or tap a mentor who can show you the ropes and save you from wasting valuable time and energy!\nBut take a break from being “all business” on October 28 and make time for home, hearth and heartfelt bonds. The annual Taurus full moon is a partial lunar eclipse, landing in your domestic and sentimental fourth house. The spotlight is on personal matters, so take a deeper look at your emotions. If you’re thinking of moving, buying or selling property or expanding your brood, this full moon could set things in motion.\nToday’s full moon is an especially big deal because it’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021. For the past two years, major momentum has come to your living situation and your career. One Aquarius we know moved four times; another was promoted to an executive role, only to be recruited for an even better gig six months later! Yet another Aquarius relocated to a suburb and separated from her partner for a short term, who later moved back in on a part-time basis, and, well, they’re still figuring it all out. \nSuch is life with eclipses in these important zones of your chart! You may feel the split between your work and non-work life acutely today because intense Mars in Scorpio is facing off in opposition to expansive Jupiter in Taurus. Demands are coming from all directions, and you might wish you could clone yourself several times over. \nBut the goal here, Aquarius, is to feel less fragmented and more integrated. Pay attention to the signs the eclipse is sending you instead of trying to control everything with your mind. Allow the universe—and the people in your world—to support you! In order for them to do that, you have to open up a little, sink into your heart, and admit that you don’t have all the answers. Good news: None of us do, so you’ll be in good company with the other 8.1 billion people on this planet.\nPartnerships: getting back on track! On October 8, Venus rounds out its extended four-month trip through Leo and your committed relationship house that began back on June 5. While that sounds like a dream for lovestruck Water Bearers, this fortunate cycle was disrupted for six whole weeks when Venus turned retrograde. From July 22 to September 3, there was static, if not constant disconnection, on the line. While things have been clearing up over the past month, you could still feel some lingering tension.\nOn October 8, Venus sails into Virgo and your smoldering eighth house until November 8, making for one scintillating and sexy month! Lower the blinds, queue up the slow jams. Your inner siren comes out to play as amorous Venus slips into this erotic zone. Boudoir fun and games are high on your priority list. \nSnuggling up in bed is a great place to start, so find room in your calendar for intimate connection. Do little things to get yourself in the mood. Upgrade your lingerie collection, commit to regular yoga practice, meditate each morning to shift into a state that is relaxed, receptive and ready to get close.\nThat might not happen until October 12, when lusty Mars moves into Scorpio (more on that in a minute). Until then, the randy red planet is burning through your freedom-loving and expansive ninth house, where it’s been since August 27. You may feel more experimental about dating, perhaps considering a long-distance or open relationship or seeing multiple people more or less simultaneously.\nBut starting October 12, your tune changes. Mars will move into Scorpio and your tenth house of long-term goals and serious endeavors until November 24. Now, you’ll want to know where things are headed. Where you were okay keeping things in the undefined realm, suddenly, you’ll feel the need to have clarity and direction. Keep in mind that this sudden change could give the other party in your situationship whiplash. Make sure you don’t start issuing demands and directives out of nowhere! \nFor happily coupled Aquarians, the early holiday season could be an amazing time for some VIP dates and parties. RSVP “yes” and have fun dressing to impress (and express), then going out and turning heads together.\nBring on the blue-sky visions! Your ninth house of expansion, entrepreneurship and higher learning is the area of emphasis as the Sun visits Libra until October 23, joined by unstoppable Mars through October 12. The October 14 Libra solar (new moon) eclipse could set the stage for you to turn one of those dreams into reality. \nBig plans and priorities start taking shape in the second half of October. On October 12, motivator Mars blazes into Scorpio and heats up your ambitious tenth house of career and professional moves.  Until then, allow yourself to entertain possibilities far outside your usual scope. \nLove Days: 3, 9\nMoney Days: 14, 25\nLuck Days: 13, 23\nOff Days: 6, 11, 21\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(December 22 - January 19)\nThe waiting game is coming to an end, Capricorn! This month is filled with gutsy moves and powerful networking opportunities as the Sun travels through the top of your chart, heating up your most public sectors. Not only is the Sun in Libra and your professional tenth house until October 23, but energizer Mars is also making its biennial blaze through this zone until October 12. \nTwo days later, on October 14, eclipse season begins with a potent solar (new moon) eclipse in Libra and this same ambitious sector. And on October 28, a second eclipse, this one a lunar (full moon) version, beams into your fifth house of fame and self-expression. Lights, camera, Capricorn! Your solo moment is coming. No need to wait for Halloween to put on a show and turn some heads.\nThe good news rolls in all month, really. On October 10, powerhouse Pluto wakes up from a five-month retrograde that started on May 1, splitting time between Aquarius and Capricorn. Since June 11, Pluto’s been backsliding through YOUR sign, making it hard for your ideas and personal projects to gain proper traction. That will change as Pluto rockets into direct motion again, rounding out a 16-year, once-in-a-lifetime tour of your sign that ends in 2024. \nAll four of the other outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) are still retrograde this month, but you might be grateful for a little slowdown to the action. Saturn and Neptune are reversing through Pisces and your third house of communication and ideas. Take your time before unleashing all of your best material on the interwebs, Cap! Jupiter and Uranus are retrograde in Taurus and your passionate fifth house, tempering that eclipse a teensy bit. So maybe you won’t let it ALL hang out just yet…but start warming up the mic anyhow.\nOn October 23, the Sun moves into Scorpio and your eleventh house of groups, teams and networking. Unchain yourself from command central and go circulate! This social season lightens your spirits and attracts like-minded people who could become great collaborators. Get to the Halloween parties and set up those lunches before everyone gets too busy with year-end and holiday mania. You’ve got places to go and people to meet!\nGet to work, Capricorn! Your marching orders come direct from the cosmos while the Sun makes methodical steps through Libra and your structured, ambitious tenth house until October 23. As the natural ruler of that realm, Capricorns should truly feel “in the zone,” ready to take last month’s lofty ideas and plug them into concrete goals.\nThis year is even more ambitious because you’ve got energizer Mars burning through Libra until October 12, making you resemble every hard-working, hustling Capricorn stereotype. No shame in that, though! The tenth house is the zone of leadership and public image, and with Mars here, you can rise to a new level of prominence. \nIf you’re not plotting your meteoric rise at the moment, it’s still an excellent month to clarify a few “pillars” that you’d like to focus on achieving for the remainder of 2023. Close your eyes and imagine it’s New Year’s Eve: What would you like to say you accomplished and raise a toast to yourself for, Cap? Prioritize THAT and make some bold moves. The October 14 Libra solar eclipse could open a huge portal for your efforts, perhaps one you didn’t even imagine or anticipate!\nSome career chaos could erupt on October 8, when hotheaded Mars, which is in Libra and your professional tenth house until October 12, clashes in a stressful square with powerhouse Pluto in Capricorn. Your own vision could be at odds with the group’s, or you may lock into a power struggle with a person in a position of authority. \nWhere are YOU feeling trapped by rules, roles and responsibilities? Your soul might be longing for some freedom of expression, yet crushing demands and deadlines are thwarting that. Instead of having a meltdown (if that’s avoidable), use this jarring come-to-the-light moment to STOP doing things that sabotage you personally and professionally. Saying no to what doesn’t work might be the simplest first step. You don’t have to carry the weight of the whole world, Capricorn!\nYour call to greatness gets amplified by transformational powerhouse Pluto, which wakes up from a five-month retrograde on October 10, powering forward in YOUR sign. As karmic Pluto shifts into direct motion, you’ll emerge from the shadows and step back into the spotlight. Didn’t see that coming, did they? \nIf you’ve been hiding out or dimming your lights, Pluto’s course correction turns up the intensity again. A personal project could speed up, especially if you’ve been blocked by a few obstacles or resistant people who seemed to be undermining your efforts. Have you been considering a style revamp or a major life change? The soul-searching you did over the spring and summer could now pay off, inspiring you to make decisive moves.\nReady for a change to your professional path? Ready or not, one could be en route. The October 14 Libra new moon is the perfect day to start something new professionally or to get going on a major goal. \nDon’t worry, you’ve got the wind at your back in a major way. Today’s new moon is also a boldfaced solar eclipse, the first one in Libra and your career zone since 2016. It’s part of a two-year series that will ripple across the Aries/Libra axis, transforming your personal and professional lives. If you’ve felt polarized between the two, these eclipses, which are occurring between March 2023 and March 2025, can help you become a better-integrated person. \nWith today’s new moon sitting opposite healer-feeler Chiron, you may have some deep insights into childhood wounds that you’re still carrying with regards to your work. Perhaps you’ve avoided pain by immersing yourself in a sense of duty, both at home and the office. Maybe you feel locked into an uber-responsible persona, carrying the weight of the world and your loved ones but never letting yourself have any fun! \nUntangling this will be a process, but today’s eclipse will push you into a place where you’ll consider what happiness and professional fulfillment could look like for the person you’ve become. Stay open: It could be wildly different from anything you’ve done so far.\nLevity arrives on October 23, when the Sun shifts gears, moving into Scorpio and your eleventh house of groups, teamwork and technology. Step away from your workspace and go mingle. You’ll accomplish more when you focus on “who you know” rather than “what you do.” \nWith Mars also in Scorpio from October 12 through November 24, teamwork will be catalyzed. Between now and mid-December, a splashy launch, especially of any digital projects, could grab hold of public attention!\nYour passionate side ignites as the October 28 Taurus full moon—a powerful lunar eclipse—blooms in your fifth house of self-expression, romance and fame. This once-a-year lunation brings out your full-bodied, perhaps lesser-seen, side.\nToday’s full moon is a big deal because it’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021. You’ve been learning to navigate between head and heart, to figure out when to be the star and when it’s better to be a team player. With expansive Jupiter in Taurus opposite Mars in Scorpio today, you could feel this stretch even more acutely. Should you dive in with your whole heart or hold back a little and play it cool? That’s the equation you’ve been working out.\nYou’ve had a few spotlight moments during these past couple years, Capricorn, and this one is your encore. What passion, talent or message have you not expressed? Leave it all on the dance floor—this full moon invites you to put it all out there!\nNot that you have to go overboard to turn heads now. You could attract attention, possibly without trying, and la luna invites you to unleash the glamorous or showy parts of your personality. Let that inner performer out to play! One of your new fans could have romantic potential. And if you’ve been giving all your lovin’ to an undeserving person, the lunar eclipse reminds you just how many (interested) fish are swimming in the sea. Onward and upward!\nShake it off, Capricorn! On October 8, Venus rounds out its extended four-month trip through Leo and your intense, intimate eighth house that began back on June 5. While that might sound like something to hold onto, there’s a good chance this cycle had its complications. After all, Venus was retrograde from July 22 until September 3, which could have caused major jealousy, mixed messages and suspiciousness to flare.\nOn October 8, amorous Venus soars into Virgo and your adventurous ninth house until November 8. Ah, now that’s more like it! Perspective returns and tunnel vision clears up. Venus finds freedom a major turn-on in this part of your chart, so any obsessing will give way to a more balanced view of it all. An attraction to someone of a different culture or background than yours could spark up. For couples, this is a favorable cycle to travel together.\nMeantime, energizing Mars is wrapping up a visit to Libra and your career house in the first half of the month, which spans from August 27 to October 12. You could have a LOT going on at work too, which can make it hard to get into that slow and sensual groove. And “leaving it at the office” won’t be that simple. If the object of your affection happens to be connected to your job, well, that’s just more midnight oil to burn. You could meet someone through a work-related event in the first couple weeks of the month.\nThe lightness from Venus will soon be amplified by her dance partner Mars, however. From October 12 to November 24, Mars will blaze a fiery trail through Scorpio and your eleventh house of friendship and casual connections. Your love life gets stoked by hanging out in groups, whether you meet someone through mutual friends or just bring levity back to your relationship through attending a fun event. Sports games, hayrides, Halloween parties: pick your pumpkin patch poison and take a hearty gulp. A strong dose of Vitamin F (Fun) will be the aphrodisiac you didn’t know you needed quite so badly!\nPlain and simple, October could be one of your most successful periods this year. With the Sun and unstoppable Mars both in Libra (the Sun until October 23, Mars through October 12), your tenth house of career and success is ablaze with energy. \nThrow in the October 14 Libra new moon—a scene-stealing solar eclipse—and opportunity won’t just come knocking; it’ll barge down your door. It won’t take “no” for an answer, so sort through your options with care. It’s not a question of whether you’ll get a great offer, but rather, of which one you’ll accept!\nThe spotlight comes calling at the October 28 Taurus lunar eclipse, a day to step out of the shadows and perform your solo act. A creative project, or just your natural talents, could draw attention and even bring fame. Embrace that celebrity status and give your fans the performance they want!\nLove Days: 2, 6\nMoney Days: 13, 23\nLuck Days: 11, 21\nOff Days: 3, 9, 18\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(November 22 - December 21)\nGet out and circulate with your people, Sagittarius! You’re the maestro of every ceremony, at least for the first three weeks of the month while the Sun is in Libra and your social “superconnector” eleventh house. You love playing matchmaker, whether you’re introducing two compatible colleagues or people you think would be a great romantic pairing. \nWith energizer Mars also in Libra until October 12, you’re especially motivated to mix, mingle and become a member of an exciting group. Together, you can go farther faster—and with your ambitious plans, Sagittarius, it definitely takes a village to pull them off. \nThings could happen fast this month because October is eclipse season! On October 14 and 28, two change-making eclipses will light up the skies. Expect the unexpected! The first one, a solar (new moon) eclipse, lands in Libra, adding midmonth momentum to your social network. You could be offered a big opportunity to launch a digital venture, speak at a TEDx conference or join a group of thought leaders. Why NOT you, Sagittarius?\nIf money’s been a source of stress this spring and summer, you may rejoice when alchemical Pluto ends a five-month retrograde on October 10. The other four slow-moving outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) are still retrograde for the whole month of October, giving you some extra space to step back and weigh your decisions, particularly about work, home and your living situation. Take your time to ponder those while freely exploring some new revenue opportunities.\nPower down a little starting October 23, when the Sun moves into Scorpio and your twelfth house of closure, rest and healing. But don’t sink too deep into your down comforter yet. Energizer Mars is in Scorpio from October 12 to November 24, which will stoke your imagination and creativity. A bedside journal and morning free-writing sessions could yield some true gems. Be sure to capture them!\nOn October 28, the lunar (full moon) eclipse in Taurus brings a two-year eclipse series on your health and healing axis to a close. Your body and well-being have demanded your attention since November 2021. There’s no denying that your relationship to both the physical and spiritual planes has been transformed. If you answered the call, this could be a moment to celebrate! \nTake inventory of your habits then and now. Perhaps you went through a medical odyssey, changed your eating habits or completely revamped your routines with supplements or regular exercise. Whatever the case, you’re graduating from this eclipse period—with all of its highs and lows. Here’s to your continued good health!\nBut first: candy. This Halloween features a moon in your opposite sign of Gemini, which rules your partnership house. Coordinating costumes, anyone? While that’s not typically your style, you might have fun sharing some part of the celebration with a friend or plus-one. Dress up as the left and right hemisphere of the brain or pick your pop culture celebrity duo and do a spooky send-up (zombified Taylor Swift and the ghosts of her dating past?). Most important item on the agenda is that you have some well-deserved fun!\nGather with your people, Archer. The Sun is in Libra and your eleventh house of group activity until October 23, a perfect three-week period to network, entertain and collaborate. Although you’re an independent sign by nature, you need people—and now is the time to put a few key players in place to support your mission. \nWith go-getter Mars also in Libra until October 12, you could be cheered and supported by members of your circle. One or two of them could shuttle your ideas onto the fast track, especially near the October 14 Libra solar eclipse. \nMars adds excitement and stress in equal measure, and you may go into “people overload” at moments, having almost too much of a good thing. Teamwork does indeed make the dream work this month, but you need to have some literal dreams (as in, a good night’s sleep!) to keep your energy levels up. There could be a zillion events, conference calls, video chats and parties to rsvp to, so choose selectively. And be sure to log off those social media sites whenever possible, even if your posts keep going viral!\nMars is in “detriment”—a weakened position—in Libra. After all, the planet of war isn’t terribly comfortable in the sign of peace. It’s all too easy to overestimate what you can handle (a Sagittarius issue by nature). Better to underpromise and overdeliver than the reverse. Manage people’s expectations and be sure to delegate! With Mars in this team-centric zone, you could have a power posse of capable collaborators ready to pitch in. Do your part by giving them clear instructions…then letting go and trusting.\nTension over money could spike on October 8, when Mars locks into a heated square with calculating Pluto in your work and money house. \nGo-getter Mars is blazing through Libra and your eleventh house of teamwork until October 12, catalyzing your collaborations. While it could be stressful to manage a few outsized egos and personalities, you can still triumphantly bring these people together for a shared victory. \nToday, however, it could be challenging to get everyone on the same page. Fights around funding or clashing work styles can culminate in a major ego battle. You may have to step in (or pull yourself out) if things get too heated and volatile. Do you have the confidence to pull off a major project? The answer is yes—but you might need to do some internal fortifying before YOU actually believe it. \nLean on your trusted circle and reliable team members to a point, but remember: They’re not your therapists! Reach out to a coach or trained counselor to do that inner work.\nAny controlling or micromanaging tendencies start to clear up on October 10, when calculating Pluto wakes up from a five-month retrograde that began on May 1, splitting its time between two signs. Since June 11, Pluto’s been reversing through Capricorn and your second house of work and money. Whew! \nWhile the karmic planet reversed through this zone, it may have driven up old fears and limiting beliefs that impacted your bottom line. From power struggles with co-workers to stressful money fluctuations, conditions haven’t always been favorable for you, Sagittarius. Your confidence may have taken a few hits during this cycle. \nNow, as Pluto returns to forward motion, you can regain a sense of power and get back into the financial driver’s seat. If you’ve been unsure about whether to work with someone or take on a project, Pluto’s course correction can help you make a clear decision. \nGet ready for a spike in your popularity and influence, Sagittarius. On October 14, the year’s only Libra new moon—a boldfaced solar eclipse—beams into your eleventh house of groups and teams. Is it time to join a new crew or catapult a collaboration to greater heights? No need to work overtime because the eclipse is pouring rocket fuel in your tank.\nThis is the first eclipse in Libra since 2016 and the second in a two-year series on the Aries/Libra axis that will revolutionize your stardom and your team efforts between March 2023 and March 2025. You’ll learn how to navigate the spotlight as well as delegate to a capable crew. \nSharing power is not always easy for your self-directed sign, to be honest. That’s why these eclipses are here to teach you important lessons about leadership. You don’t have to sacrifice your individuality to be part of a group, but that’s how you’ll learn when it’s time to compromise a little instead of bottle-necking progress. \nToday’s lunar mission: Start stocking your squad with people qualified to go the distance with you. This is a powerful time for networking, and, since this futuristic house rules technology, you could launch an online venture or viral piece of content. An opportunity to commune with a cutting-edge group could catapult one of your visionary ideas into the stratosphere. Team up for the win! \nWith this new moon opposing wounded healer Chiron today, old pain around feeling invisible, ignored or “less than” could flare up. Your ego may need some repair work—or to head to the timeout chair. If you’re craving recognition or yearning for attention, ask yourself: Why do I want it so badly? Painful as it might be to confront the feelings of abandonment or unworthiness that lie beneath, it’s time to shed those already. What if your desire to share a message was really in service of sharing your light and spreading joy? That’s much more of a win-win, Sagittarius, motivated by creativity instead of a feeling of lack.\nPower down starting October 23, when the Sun shifts into Scorpio and your twelfth house of rest and endings. For the next four weeks, the Sun’s low-lit position invites you to slip off the grid as much as possible for self-care and restorative activities. \nShield your field if you step out into a crowd since you’re susceptible to absorbing everyone’s energy. Carry a grounding crystal, bring a wingperson and have a ready excuse if you need to depart early and get some shuteye! \nWith energy planet Mars also in Scorpio from October 12 to November 24, you’ll definitely need to conserve your resources and get extra rest. You may feel both wired and tired at times. Regulate your nervous system by powering down devices an hour before bedtime, unwinding with a healing sound bath (or bubble bath!) and by nourishing yourself with lots of open calendar space. It may take you longer to bounce back after you exert a lot of energy, so if you work hard, make sure you take twice as much rest as you think you need!\nWellness check! The October 28 Taurus full moon is a partial lunar eclipse, illuminating your sixth house of health, fitness and organization. Before you tuck yourself into bed completely, the celestial spotlight beams onto your practices and habits. Are you being as efficient as you could be? Delegating instead of trying to DIY everything? \nThe sixth house rules helpful people and employees. This full moon can bring a change of the guard on Team Sagittarius. You could hire, fire or meet someone who’d make a rock star assistant. Is it time for a system overhaul? From a deep decluttering to a purge of apps and subscriptions you don’t use, it’s a powerful day to clear your spaces. \nToday’s full moon is an especially big deal because it’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021, revolutionizing your health and healing sectors. Your approach to work, well-being, spirituality and self-care has been radically revamped over the past two years. \nHow are your stress levels? These eclipse helped you find a middle ground between being micromanaging and being checked out. There were moments when your inner control freak got benched, and other times when you needed to snap out of denial and take action. \nToday, this dichotomy is further underscored by your ruler, expansive Jupiter, in Taurus opposing stressful Mars in Scorpio. Rather than bury your head in the sand, it’s a day to finally delegate to the capable and supportive people on Team Sagittarius. An “impossible” situation can be solved with a simple plan—but you don’t have to come up with that alone. Where there’s a will and a willing heart, there’s a way!\nChanging of the guard! For the past four months, romantic Venus has been taking an extended trip through Leo and your expansive, free-spirited ninth house—the zodiac zone that Sagittarius rules. Since this is one of your favorite Venus positions, you were probably one of the signs least affected when Venus turned retrograde from July 22 to September 3.\nStill, it wasn’t exactly screaming “summer lovin’ had me a blast,” Archer. Hopefully you made up for lost time over the past month, with Venus back on track and swaggering through your ninth house of travel, adventure and personal growth. (We spent a chunk of that time eating and greeting our way through Barcelona—so we hope our fellow Sags made equally good use of the transit!)\nStarting October 8, things could take a turn for the serious as Venus moves into Virgo for a month. With the love goddess in your regimented tenth house of long-term goals, you may flip the switch and suddenly want to prioritize some romantic plans before the holidays. Cuffing season could get off to a better-late-than-never start for Archers looking to make things official or strengthen the relationship you’re already in.\nMeanwhile, lusty Mars is powering up your social life as it revs through Libra and your collaborative eleventh house until October 12. For your free-spirited fire sign, this cycle might crank up your needs for independence and autonomy; single Archers might feel like your love life is one grand adventure. The boundary between platonic and passionate could be thin, and things could get romantic with a friend, especially near the October 14 Libra solar eclipse. One tiny word of caution: You might not have the self-restraint to think through potential consequences—but try to anyway.\nOn October 12, no-holds-barred Mars moves into your twelfth house of transitions until November 24, decelerating the energy. This temporary slowdown has a silver lining, though: Mars will next move into Sagittarius, cranking up the holiday heat!\nUntil then, you’re ready to detoxify and downsize. From hauling junk out of the basement to ousting a faux friend from your inner circle, wrap this season with a clean slate. Easy though! With brash Mars egging you on, you could act in haste. (Once you’ve donated the wedding china from your short-lived first marriage to Goodwill, it’s gonna be hard to get back.) If you must say goodbye, do it with compassion—even if you’re done for good. \nTeam efforts are the fastest route to success this month, thanks to the Sun, Mars and an October 14 solar eclipse in Libra and your collaborative eleventh house. There’s no question you can go ten times as far when you join up with a supportive squad. \nDon’t be afraid to speak up and ask for what you need. With assertive Mars here until October 12, the key is being direct yet diplomatic. This will take extra finesse when working with a team. Err on the side of politeness at all times, Sag. At the October 14 eclipse, you could be invited to join an elite or avant-garde crew, perhaps one with a humanitarian twist. Membership has its privileges indeed!\nBut don’t forgot those humble roots—not that you ever would. The October 28 Taurus full moon, a powerful lunar eclipse, illuminates your sixth house of employees and organization. Delegate, systematize and maybe hire some help. Be sure to thank the supportive people who helps you get where you are today. If someone on Team Sagittarius is no longer a fit, this eclipse could be your cue to amicably part ways and wish each other well.\nLove Days: 27, 3\nMoney Days: 11, 21\nLuck Days: 9, 18\nOff Days: 2, 6, 14\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(October 23 - November 21)\nHang in there, Scorpio. The first three weeks of the month could be a little bumpy—but they’ll be easier if you find the courage to surrender instead of clinging to control. Resistance is futile anyhow. With two changemaking eclipses sweeping through the skies on October 14 and 28, this month will pry away anything that no longer serves you. The good news? They’ll clear a space for you to step into something even better and more genuinely suited to the person you’ve become.\nConserve your energy while the Sun is in Libra and your restful, foggy twelfth house through October 23. Energizer Mars is also in Libra until October 12, which could push you to the verge of burnout if you rush to the save and try to extinguish every little fire. You’ll pass through the eye of the needle on October 14, when a Libra solar (new moon) eclipse—the first one since 2016—brings a moment of spiritual awakening and serendipity. Allow the divine guidance to lead you instead of trying to force an outcome.\nOn October 10, your ruling planet Pluto will wake up from a five-month retrograde, moving forward in Capricorn and your communication zone. Have you felt ignored, undervalued or misunderstood a lot over the summer? Pick up the mic again, Scorpio. Your words will have more potency, and your genius ideas will be recognized. \nYour co-ruler Mars will amplify this Pluto power. From October 12 until November 24, the red planet will blaze through Scorpio for its biennial visit. It’s as if an inner light was turned on and suddenly the world is responding to your confidence and charisma. Ah, now that’s more like it! \nWhen the Sun moves into Scorpio on October 23, it will team up with Mars for the next four weeks. You might have moments where you feel outright invincible! But pace yourself just the same. We’re still waiting for four of the slow-moving outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune—to end their retrogrades, and that won’t start happening until next month. All of these planets are in parts of your chart related to romance and relationships. Proceed with caution before making anything official. \nThere’s even more wisdom to taking it slow with your dynamic duos. Eclipses come in pairs, and the second one is on October 28 in Taurus, your opposite sign. It’s the grand finale of a Taurus/Scorpio eclipse series that began November 2021. Over the past two years, these eclipses have revolutionized your approach to both personal identity and relationships. You’ve stepped into new roles and shed connections that aren’t a fit. Now it’s graduation day!\nTake a little break, Scorpio. The Sun is in savasana until October 23, journeying through Libra and your twelfth house of rest, closure and healing. Slip off the radar for the first three weeks of the month—as much as you possibly can—and prioritize activities that replenish your mental, emotional and spiritual tanks. From meditating and spending time in nature (especially near water) to dancing and listening to music: Choose your escape route and float away!\nBut note to Scorpios: Powering down won’t be easy with energizer Mars in Libra, disrupting this normally Zen zone until October 12. Mars is in “detriment” here, its least comfortable sign to visit. It makes sense: Mars is the warrior planet and Libra is the sign of peace. As a result, the uneasy combo can make it hard to chill out. People will be passive-aggressive, even whiny, and you might find yourself tossing and turning over stressful thoughts. \nOn October 12 Mars will move into Scorpio until November 24, amping you up even more. Put in extra measures to power down at night, enforcing a strict “devices and lights off” deadline and having supportive people (whether friends, therapists or healers) lined up if you’re processing any heavy emotions or confronting some grief that you pushed aside. \nWith a solar eclipse in Libra stirring up old wounds midmonth, you might as well surrender: This is your chance to heal and deal. Silver lining? By the time Scorpio season rolls around, you’ll have gotten a lot of the heavy-duty emotions out of your system!\nWatch your words on October 8, when your co-rulers, penetrating Pluto and combative Mars, lock into a heated square. With Pluto in your communication sector and Mars in your twelfth house of hidden agendas, this day could crank up the gossip mill and bring passive-aggressive people out of left field. \nEvade the shade by knowing that people are likely to lure you into drama—and it’s your job to not take that bait! Be careful not to push anyone’s buttons or prey on their sensitive spots, even unintentionally. Stick to neutral topics and save the conflict-resolution efforts for another day.\nClear your throat and speak, Scorpio! On October 10, transformational and karmic Pluto wakes up from a five-month retrograde, which began May 1 in Aquarius and your fourth house of home and family. Since June 11, Pluto’s been reversing through Capricorn and your third house of expression, community and media. Messages may have gotten scrambled—or totally lost—during this retrograde. You’ve been pushed to do a LOT of thinking about how you articulate ideas and engage with others.\nCommunication has been an ongoing issue for you to transform and improve for the past few years as Pluto makes its lengthy, once-in-a-lifetime journey through Capricorn from 2008 to 2024. You’ve already learned HUGE lessons about how to interact impactfully with others and when to trust someone enough to forge a friendship or creative collaboration. \nSince summer, many Scorpios have struggled to get their point across—and Mercury’s recent retrograde from August 23 to September 15 didn’t help! Old fears, some driven by shame and anxiety, may have created blocks in key relationships. As Pluto corrects course, you’ll be better able to smooth out dicey dynamics. And during this psyche-probing October, you can get down to the root cause, which will help you make lasting change.\nThe October 14 Libra new moon—a potent solar eclipse—sweeps into your twelfth house of healing, closure and fantasy. On the positive side, this can be a beautiful moment for creativity and spirituality. It can also abruptly shut one door and catapult you through another. Eclipses can deliver swift changes that don’t leave us much time to react. Clinging onto something that’s past its prime will be futile.\nHave you been holding a grudge that’s eating at YOU? This new moon eclipse invites you to commence any necessary forgiveness or amends-making process. Trade that resentment for radical acceptance. You can’t change the past, but you CAN make better choices for the future. Protect your own boundaries and let yourself be vulnerable and open again. \nThis is the first eclipse in Libra since 2016, and the second in a two-year series on the Aries/Libra axis that will revolutionize your health and healing sectors between March 2023 and March 2025. \nThis new moon is also opposite healer-feeler Chiron. A spiritual or artistic endeavor gets a boost from these moonbeams, and projects you begin now will blossom in the coming six months. Your efforts to release an emotional block may feel painful or laborious now, but by next spring, any hard inner work you do will also pay dividends in the form of more serenity. Take the first steps to reclaim your equilibrium.\nGreat news: Scorpio season shifts into gear on October 23, flipping the lights back on. After an intense and internally focused month, it’s time for some action! Pace yourself because even as your confidence and can-do spirit return, you could easily over do it. Prioritize passion projects for the next four weeks while your solo endeavors get a special hit of solar power.\nWith Mars blazing through Scorpio from October 12 to November 24, your powers of persuasion will be unstoppable! No more burying your head in the sand and ignoring your deepest personal desires. Put your most cherished dreams on the front burner, whether that’s starting your own business or committing to a personal goal. Do what Scorpios do best: Radar in on what you want and block out all distractions.\nOn October 28, the year’s only Taurus full moon, a partial lunar eclipse, will catalyze your seventh house of committed partnerships. A budding connection, either romantic or business, could turn official at lightning speed. On the other hand, a contract or collaboration might end, or it could turn in an unexpected new direction. If any relationship in your life could use some revolutionizing, this full moon eclipse is make sure that happens!\nEclipses, especially lunar ones, can abruptly turn the tides, whether you want that to happen or not. Today’s full moon is a big deal because it’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021. Your relationships AND your personal growth have both soared into new dimensions over the past couple years. And if you took the “moon medicine,” you should know thyself like never before. \nThe eclipses also helped you reshuffle the balance between “me” and “we,” teaching you when you needed individuate and when it was better to partner up. With Mars in Scorpio opposing expansive Jupiter in Taurus today, you may feel the dichotomy even more acutely. Where are you giving too much at the expense of your own needs? Where might you be acting selfishly instead of collaborating and sharing power? Take one last deeply honest look at this today, Scorpio.\nHow about a little lightness back in your love life? That starts to happen as October rolls on, and not a moment too soon.\nOn October 8, Venus rounds out its extended four-month trip through Leo and your tenth house of long-term goals that began back on June 5. While there were some opportunities to get on the same page about the future, there were also a few interruptions. Venus was in a tricky retrograde cycle from July 22 until September 3, disrupting your summer flow. \nMeanwhile, Mars has been in Libra and your foggy, low-energy twelfth house since August 27, dragging its heels through this realm until October 12. On the plus side, this is the realm of fantasy, and you may have had a few sexy encounters. However, they may have come with a side of mixed messages or uncertainty, layered with angst around which direction to take. \nIf you were able to find your center through the cacophony, you might have had a major breakthrough in the past month, especially since Venus turned direct. One Scorpio we know got engaged after a relatively short courtship. “When you know, you know,” he assured us.\nWhatever the case, any mishaps or misgivings all start coming out in the wash starting October 8. That day, Venus moves into Virgo and your indie-spirited eleventh house until November 8. If you’re not happily hooked up, you may feel more experimental about dating, perhaps considering a long-distance or open relationship or seeing multiple people more or less simultaneously.\nThis is a great cycle for getting out and hanging with friends and not being so serious about love. You may be hard to pin down—if one can even find you—and attracted to people who think outside the box and aren’t afraid to pursue their grandest visions. If you’re in a relationship (or trying to be), Venus in Virgo gives you the courage to be more playfully authentic about your desires. \nBut things really blast off on October 12, when red-hot Mars blazes into Scorpio, cranking up the heat, passion and your famously magnetic sex appeal. Carpe diem! This passionate planet only visits your sign every two years, and you’ll have its energizing presence at your disposal until November 24. You’ll also have plenty of momentum for a personal project, which could turn into a cult of personality with you at its epicenter. Suddenly, you’ll flip from feeling invisible and irrelevant to the hottest thing in town. Enjoy the wave of confidence and charisma, and ride it through to the holiday season! \nConserve your energy this month, Scorpio, at least for the first two weeks. Energy planet Mars is in Libra and your twelfth house of rest and closure until October 12, alongside the Sun (here until October 23). There’s also a solar eclipse in Libra on October 14, which could finalize the loose ends of a lingering life chapter. Focus the lion’s share of your energy on wrapping up any unfinished projects and balancing that out with lots of self-care. If you can slip off for a short sabbatical (even the three-day-weekend kind), do it. \nYour motivation will return with a vengeance once Scorpio season begins on October 23. But it could ramp up even sooner as go-getter Mars starts the Scorpio soiree, visiting your sign from October 12 to November 24. Get ready: You’ll bring new meaning to the concept of finishing the year strong!\nWhen the Taurus lunar eclipse ignites your partnership house on October 28, you could ink a deal or team up with a complementary collaborator for an even bigger win.

Not only is the Sun in your sign until October 23, but the spotlight’s a few megawatts brighter (and hotter) while mojo-boosting Mars is also in Libra until October 12. Things are moving at a much more rapid clip than you’re used to, which could be equal parts stressful and exciting. Load up on the immune-boosting supplements, especially if you’re running all over the place. (Being in demand brings perks AND challenges.) \nMidmonth, one of the most powerful moments you’ve had since 2016 arrives. The Libra new moon is a change-making solar eclipse, the first to land in your sign in seven years. Ready or not, a new chapter is beginning—and this time, it’s custom-tailored to the person you’ve become. Allow inauthentic relationships and roles to fall away. Shed that skin and step out as a truer, more self-actualized you.\nSo yeah, it might sound like a lot, Libra, but consider the alternative: Summer 2023. Suffice to say, you’ve earned a do-over! October is a welcome relief from the uphill battle you’ve waged with the stars since July—and you’re just crawling out of that now.\nIt all started on July 22, when your ruling planet, Venus, turned retrograde for six weeks, making you feel out of sync socially and emotionally until September 3. Layered on top of it, you endured energy planet Mars in Virgo and your sluggish twelfth house until August 27. Then, adding insult to injury, mental Mercury turned retrograde, shrouding you in mental fog from August 23 until September 15. If you felt invisible, exhausted and adrift at moments, that cosmic lineup certainly played a role.\nThe slow-moving outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto) are all still retrograde this month. But on October 10, Pluto will straighten out, correcting course in Capricorn and your family sector. Challenges in your living situation or with loved ones should get easier, particularly if you’ve had any power struggles.\nEclipses come in pairs, and the October 14 solar eclipse is the first of this month’s duo. The second one, a lunar (full moon) eclipse, will land in Taurus on October 28, touching down in your eighth house of intimacy and investments. It’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled over the Taurus/Scorpio axis for the past two years, revolutionizing your approach to money, self-worth, shared property and the ties that bind.\nSeal those changes with a ritual, perhaps on Halloween. That day, the moon will be in Gemini and your expansive ninth house, putting you in optimistic and adventurous spirits. You’ve had enough of those cosmic tricks. Now it’s time to be treated to a wide-angle view of the possible treats that await you, Libra. Let the transformational power of the eclipses carry you over that threshold!\nIn it to win it! This year’s Libra season charges out of the gate at an especially frisky pace as the Sun soars through your sign until October 23, joined by activator Mars, the planet of energy and drive, which is making its biennial blast through Libra until October 12. This October, your trailblazing initiatives could start a huge buzz. \nThe balance your sign is forever seeking may be in short supply as the Sun and Mars keep your schedule action-packed. Roll with it for now, Libra. You’re the spotlight’s favorite target, so shamelessly self-promote! On top of that, a rare Libra solar eclipse arrives at the October 14 new moon, pushing you into prominence and power. Seize this rare opportunity. \nLibra may be the sign of peace, love and harmony, but when you sense injustice, you can see red. Your legendary patience could evaporate on October 8, when aggravator Mars locks into a heated square with manipulative Pluto, ramping up the conflict and tension. \nMars is in Libra and your first house of self until October 12 while Pluto’s simmering in Capricorn and your home and family sector. Those ties that bind could feel downright suffocating today. Is a close person trying to manipulate you by tugging on your heartstrings? Hold your ground in the face of emotional blackmail and don’t take the codependent bait. You may need to assert yourself in a way that feels unusually forceful. \nIt’s not always comfortable to individuate from your family or support circle—Libras as a rule dislike conflict. But the Mars-Pluto square is demanding that you step up and voice your needs powerfully.\nFamily and home take a turn for the better on October 10, when karmic Pluto ends a five-month retrograde that began on May 1. Until June 11, Pluto was reversing through Aquarius, stirring the pot in your fifth house of romance. Then it slipped into Capricorn and your domestic fourth house for the duration of its backspin. \nSince mid-June, you’ve been navigating intense moods and what felt like a series of emotional earthquakes, especially in your household. Power dynamics with a female relative in particular may have been volatile, with seething resentment or outright anger welling up from the depths. \nMaybe your thoughts turned to your ancestors, with dreams about departed loved ones so vivid that they felt like a visitation. Old family patterns and baggage could have surfaced, making this a productive (if painful) time to process the past and untangle those knots. If you’re a parent, you may have struggled with separation issues between yourself and a child—either feeling smothered by too much closeness or fearful when they pulled away.\nThat begins to change once Pluto resumes forward motion, helping you pierce the veil of confusion. You’ll be better able to connect the dots and address household conflict at the root, and to let your loved ones be individuated people as you figure out a healthy level of bonding. If the energy in your house feels off, you might experiment with some Feng Shui techniques, starting with a space cleclass=\"body-el-link standard-body-el-link\" aring and deep cleaning. (Check out our Home Reset course for a deep dive.) As you work through emotional issues AND beautify your space, you’ll begin to feel comfortable in your skin again—at home inside yourself.\nRebirth! The October 14 Libra new moon could be a day when fortune and favor smile upon you. Not only is this the sole new moon in your sign this year, but it’s a boldfaced solar eclipse. Think of it as your personal new year or a fresh start times ten. It’s a day to set intentions for the coming six months and then take a bold step forward on your path. \nWhat personal goal would you like to achieve before 2023 closes out? Connect and commit to that today; these me-first moonbeams have your back! \nThis is the first time an eclipse has fallen in Libra since 2016, so it’s an even bigger deal. Ask yourself: What do YOU want? That can be a hard question for your partnership-oriented sign to answer, especially since the moon is opposite healer-feeler Chiron in Aries today. You might feel guilty or torn about wanting something just for yourself. \nBut the stars are lined up in full support of that now. It’s okay to prioritize yourself, Libra. You’ll be learning to strike the right balance between “me” and “we” through March 2025, during a two-year eclipse series on the Aries/Libra axis. Give yourself time. There will be moments where your own projects need top billing and other times where cooperation and teamwork are called for most. You can expect to have a hearty dose of both!\nSome grounding energy comes in beginning October 23, when the Sun shifts gears into Scorpio and your second house of money, routines and stability. The excitement and excess of Libra season gives way to an industrious groove. Prioritize your projects and devote your time to the ones that will build a sense of security—and a nest egg. \nIf birthday binges left you and your wallet with a lingering hangover (well worth the fun!), you can get back to some daily practices and healthy habits that help you feel centered. With go-getter Mars in Scorpio from October 12 until November 24, this year’s Scorpio season is filled with motivating energy that can rev up your revenue and position you for prosperity before the year ends.\nWho needs Halloween to get spooky…or freaky? This October 28, a lunar eclipse arrives at the Taurus full moon, beaming into your eighth house of mysteries, eroticism and power. This full moon might mark a turning point in a key relationship: Should you stay or should you go? A simmering sexual attraction could reach the point of no return. Longtime couples may venture onto more permanent terrain, such as an engagement, pregnancy or perhaps an official split. Strong emotions can surge up from the depths today, surprising even you.\nToday is an especially big deal because it’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s traveled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021. For the past two years, major shifts around money, self-worth, sex and shared investments have been sparked by the eclipses. What’s “mine” and what’s “ours” got some serious sorting out. And you could feel a strong tug to draw that line at the eclipse, especially with expansive Jupiter in Taurus opposing aggro Mars in Taurus. Anyone making too many demands on you could push you over the edge.\nAs the eclipse blasts into your eighth house of merging, intimacy and joint ventures, you might be offered an opportunity to blend your superpowers in a shared business project, but be sure to conduct due diligence before you go all in. Legal and real estate matters can be resolved, and since the eighth house rules windfalls, you could receive word of a large lump sum (hopefully being paid TO you, not BY you). Look back to the May 19 Taurus new moon for clues of what’s likely to develop now.\nLook out for Libra! Lusty Mars is on its biennial tour of your sign until October 12, making you irresistibly magnetic, upping your already serious charisma and drawing attention your way wherever you go—especially locally. On top of that, there’s a solar eclipse in your sign on October 14, putting all eyes on you again.\nMake a point of putting yourself out there and letting your sensual side lead. Mars here can offset some of your natural tactfulness, and without meaning to, you could come off a bit opinionated or argumentative. By all means, be direct about your desires. Just give others the same room to express themselves too.\nIf you’re in a LTR, the first two weeks of October are a great cycle for open, honest communication and being crystal-clear about any needs that aren’t being met. Your side of the bargain: Listen as much as you talk, and don’t get defensive (which Mars can exacerbate). Assume your partner has valid points and, later, take an unblinking look at behaviors you might actually want to shift. Once things are in a nice groove, focus on doing more together as a couple, like taking classes, exploring your neighborhood or taking short romantic day trips.\nMeantime, romantic Venus, your ruler, is wrapping up a four-month tour of Leo and your friendship sector that began on June 5. If a connection wavered from platonic to possibly-maybe-romantic all summer, no surprise. Venus was retrograde from July 22 to September 3, making you hesitant at best to explore a connection with more than a toe in the water.\nVenus has been in direct (forward) motion for the last month, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you should rush into anything without due diligence. From October 8 to November 8, Venus will visit Virgo and your twelfth house of fantasy and closure. On the one hand, this could be a wildly windswept and romantic time. But it could also be a time of mixed messages and confusions while the love goddess traverses these foggy lands. \nDial up the sensuality and luxury—and try not to worry to much about “where things are going.” That could be challenging, however, as driven Mars will be in Scorpio and your security-seeking second house from October 12 to November 24. While your appetite for luxury will be off the charts now, you might also bicker over money or feel anxious about locking down a clear commitment from someone. Perhaps you’ll be the one who feels pressure from a “person of interest” who’s pushing for clarification when you’re just trying to explore.\nStill, you may not be able to push a decision off until next month. A major moment of truth could arrive at the October 28 Taurus lunar eclipse, which floods your eighth house of erotic encounters, intimacy and permanent bonds. The eighth house is pretty black-and-white, and you may be given an ultimatum. Information could surface that pushes you firmly in one direction. It could be as wild as finding out a secret or someone surprising you with a full moon proposal. \nLibras hate making decisions under duress, but sometimes eclipses have to push you off the fence and into action—before you lose a good thing or miss your moment to exit a situation that’s dragged on past its prime.\nPut yourself out there, front and center! This is one of the hottest months of 2023 to make your grand debut, loud and proud. Not only is the Sun in Libra until October 23, but mojo-booster Mars is also in your sign through October 12, pushing you into the spotlight. And if that wasn’t enough, there’s a solar eclipse—a supercharged new moon—in Libra on October 14.\nDon’t be surprised if you draw attention for your trailblazing ideas—no need to apologize for tooting your own horn. If your ideas are great and can change people’s lives, why wouldn’t you want the world to know about them? \nYou can start making money moves on October 12, when Mars makes a fiery trail into Scorpio and your second house of money and earned income. Between now and November 24, you may have a few more expenses, but they’ll also motivate you to raise your rates or seek new revenue sources, which you’ll attract easily under this dynamic transit.\nThe month ends with the October 28 lunar (full moon) eclipse in Taurus and your eighth house of investments, joint venture and windfalls. Expect the unexpected—hopefully in a large lump sum with a few extra zeros added to the end! You could get a sudden opportunity to buy or sell property, team up with a powerful collaborator of earn a commission. If you’ve been dealing with an ongoing legal matter over the past couple years, things could be finalized and settled at this eclipse.\nLove Days: 23, 27\nMoney Days: 6, 14\nLuck Days: 3, 13\nOff Days: 11, 2\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Virgo Monthly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-01 15:10:07", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(August 23 - September 22)\nSweet stability at last! October will be eventful, but it still holds plenty of opportunities to get settled and centered. Prune your plans and prioritize your options. Focus on one or two key items, especially during the first three weeks while the Sun is in Libra and your sensible second house. Better to do less but do it well!\nAs a Virgo, you like feeling that you’re making progress toward a goal, even if your process is all over the map. That hasn’t been easy for the past couple months, which were wildly unpredictable for you. First, creative Venus was retrograde for six weeks starting July 22, making your mind foggy and your load too burdensome. Then your ruler, Mercury, joined the retrograde brigade, back-spining for nearly the entire Virgo season, from August 23 to September 15. Talk about a buzzkill! One Virgo friend of ours wisely took the month off to travel through Europe. Well-timed indeed.\nNow, after feeling a bit like a helium balloon with the air let out of it, you can get yourself grounded. Or at least, begin the process. Because, as we hinted, October has a few more plot twists in store. Two, to be exact: a solar eclipse on October 14 and a lunar eclipse on October 28.\nThe first one is in Libra, which could bring new revenue streams and moneymaking opportunities. If you need to ground yourself with regular routines and healthy habits, this October 14 eclipse gives you a giant boost. The October 28 Taurus lunar eclipse touches down in your ninth house of travel, study and personal growth. It’s the grand/finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled over the Taurus/Scorpio axis for the past two years, revolutionizing your approach to communication, learning and social connections. \nWhile Libra season will keep you busy and productive, your social life picks up speed on October 23, when the Sun moves into Scorpio and your interactive third house. With energizer Mars also in Scorpio from October 12 to November 24, a fun and flirty fall awaits. Step away from your duties and go mingle with kindred spirits and fellow innovators. Exchanging ideas (and contact info) will do more for you now than being chained to your workspace.\nRSVP “yes” to that Halloween party, especially if there’s a networking component. With the moon in Gemini and your career corner on October 31, mixing business with pleasure—and costumes!—could put some extra goodies in your basket.\nProductivity returns! We’re in the fourth quarter of 2024, meaning it’s time to make a plan. Music to your Virgo ears! With the Sun in Libra and your sensible, sensual second house, the stage is set for you to get ‘er done. Unleash your inner project manager, and you’ll soon feel back on track. \nNormally, you’re on top of your game every fall. But thanks to Mercury’s long retrograde in your sign from August 23 to September 15, motivation and focus went MIA. Don’t worry if you’re making up for lost time. You can accomplish a lot now—AND treat yourself to a few luxe rewards along the way. \nThis year, you get a bonus bottom-line boost from energetic Mars, which is making its biennial blaze through Libra until October 12. As the red planet revs up your revenue, a project or plan could heat up fast. Be careful what you wish for, Virgo. You could end up with your hands in many different pots (of gold, but still…) or juggling an accelerated schedule. Be extra discerning about what you take on. Before you say yes, make sure it’s both profitable AND pleasurable for you!\nYou normally keep a level head, Virgo, but even your even-keeled sign can lose it from time to time. Make an extra effort to hold your fire on October 8 if you can. That day, a volatile square forms between hotheaded Mars in your security-seeking second house and intense Pluto in your dramatic fifth.\nOne part of you wants to stir the pot just to see if you can get a rise out of someone. Maybe you’re craving attention or feeling insecure and needing to test whether they care about you. But instead of pushing THEIR sensitive buttons, how about just asking point-blank where you stand? Being overly direct may not work, but taking a back-door approach won’t either. (And don’t even THINK about snooping, Virgo.)\nYour desire to share your gifts returns with a vengeance on October 10 as transformational Pluto wakes up from a five-month retrograde that began on May 1. For the majority of the retrograde (since June 11), Pluto’s been reverse-commuting through Capricorn and your fifth house of creativity, passion and self-expression. \nOver the summer, you may have dipped below the radar, hiding your radiance while feeling self-conscious. If you were struck with a bout of stage fright or performance anxiety, Pluto’s return to forward motion reminds you that you have something meaningful to offer to the world! Instead of worrying about doing it “perfectly,” focus on the lives you’ll improve with your gifts and talents.\nA love affair or relationship may have gone through intense cycles during Pluto’s retrograde. Perhaps an ex surfaced, or you had to work through some old fears and baggage in your current union. That old “come here, now go away” dance gets exhausting! You deserve a break from that confusion, Virgo, and as Pluto corrects course, clarity returns. Should you cut ties or stick around and work through a difficult dynamic? That answer will soon become clear.\nDid someone say abundance? Get ready for some money moves as the October 14 Libra new moon—a potent solar eclipse—kicks off a prosperous six-month cycle. This boldfaced eclipse in your second house of financial security could start changing everything from how you make a living to your daily routines. If you’re thinking of initiating a new regimen, like eating cleaner or going to a sunrise boot camp, this lunar lift is a perfect start date. \nThis is also the very first Libra eclipse the skies have seen since 2014 to 2016, so you might look back to nearly a decade ago when the eclipses were last in Aries and Libra. That was a powerful time of transformation for your money, investments, intimate partnerships and spirituality, Virgo. And from March 2023 until March 2025, you’re going through another cosmic cycle that will not only rev up your revenue streams but revolutionize them too. \nGot money wounds lingering? This solar eclipse will be opposite healer-feeler Chiron, giving you a chance to dive deep into your past and explore what might still be there. While that won’t necessarily be comfortable, it’s important to clear those blocks out of your path. Just because you don’t acknowledge them doesn’t mean they don’t exist! But fear not: You’ll have a couple years of rich and eye-opening experiences that will remind you how powerful you truly are.\nStep away from your work and get out among the people again! On October 23, the Sun moves into Scorpio, heating up your third house of communication and community. Your brilliant ideas could find a solid fan base and an eager audience. Kindred spirits can pop out of the woodwork, and everything will be more enjoyable when you make it interactive rather than isolating yourself. \nGot an important message to share? With bold Mars also in Scorpio from October 12 until November 24, you’ll have the planet-powered confidence and courage to speak your truth. Use all the social media and in-person channels you can to connect with like-minded people. RSVP “yes” to events where you can meet more of them. But pace yourself a little bit as you’re unlikely to know your limits and could easily overdo it!\nNo limits! On October 28, the year’s only Taurus full moon arrives as a partial lunar eclipse, illuminating your expansive and adventurous ninth house. This is an especially big deal because it’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021. \nThe way you think, view the world and express yourself have been indelibly impacted by these eclipses. You’ve grown bolder in your expression, more willing to take a chance in business and life. Your adventurous spirit got a chance to flap its wings and fly!\nSince the ninth house rules global connections, risk-taking and growth, this lunar eclipse could bring an utterly magical moment in which one of your gambles pays off or a visionary idea springs to life—and spreads like wildfire. Your hunger for knowledge could be sated by a mind-blowing realization that helps you see a situation from a new perspective. Suddenly everything makes sense. \nWith worldly Jupiter in Taurus opposing dynamic Mars in your third house of local events today, you might have a real itch to get out of city limits. An opportunity to travel could arise out of the blue. Don’t overthink it. Two words: Wheels up!\nAt last! Your long-overdue time to shine is about to be here, Virgo. We’re gonna come out and say it: You’ve weathered insult to injury the entire summer and into fall, and your love life was one of the casualties. Not only was your ruling planet Mercury retrograde in your sign from August 23 to September 15, but love planet Venus has been in Leo and your foggy, fumbling twelfth house for FOUR months (since June 5)—with the audacity to go retrograde from July 22 to September 3. \nSo…drumroll. On October 8, Venus FINALLY wraps her off-duty summer and enters the realm of Virgo! For one solid month, the love goddess will dance with silk scarves and resume her sultry moves on your behalf. Great ready for an amorous awakening! Freedom is your aphrodisiac this month, so revel in all the admiration that comes your way. And with Venus in your self-empowered first house, you can have a lovingly honest conversation about what you need to feel happy and NOT claustrophobic.\nBut for the first week of October, you may have to wade through a few lingering insecure and vulnerable moments. And with Mars in Libra and your security-seeking second house until October 12, you could be a bit preoccupied with “where things are going” and ticking off the requisite boxes. \nTry NOT to give into those concerns too much, Virgo, because from October 12 to November 24, Mars will blaze through Scorpio and your social, interactive third house. You’re about to lighten up in a huge way. This will make for a flirtatious and festive lead-up to the holidays.\nWith bold and fiery Mars in your communication zone until November 24, you’ll be quick with a clever quip and a sassy retort. Warning: Mars adds a bite to your communications. This might come in handy when you have to stand up for yourself, but it could burn some bridges if you keep it up 24/7. \nFriendships will be lively, but you’ll be clear about who you can stand and who works your nerves. One of those platonic peeps could turn into something more under the spell of impulsive, randy Mars. Don’t rush to make it more than it is, though. If it’s a fall fling, let it be just that. There’s no harm in having a little fun—and if anyone’s earned the right to a frisky free ride now, Virgo, it’s you!\nOctober could be one of your most profitable months of 2023 if you play your hand right. The Sun is in Libra and your second house of work and money until October 23 while motivator Mars is revving up your revenue through October 12. There might be a few aggravating expenses thanks to Mars, but there are twice as many chances to multiply your money-making. Don’t overthink it: get moving!\nWith the October 14 Libra solar eclipse delivering fresh-start energy to your finance sector, a new opportunity or income stream could appear. Eclipses bring surprises and this one might come with dollar signs attached. Your efforts could pay off quickly and build up momentum over the next six months. \nThe October 28 lunar eclipse in Taurus could bring an exciting opportunity to launch a business, publish your work or teach your subject matter expertise at a university or continuing education level. A sudden travel invitation could also arrive that’s related to sharing your big ideas with the wider world. Keep your suitcase and jetsetting accouterments ready!\nLove Days: 21, 25\nMoney Days: 3, 13\nLuck Days: 2, 11\nOff Days: 27, 9, 23\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(July 23 - August 22)\nAt last—some momentum returns! From social sync-ups to buzzy brainstorms to exciting business ideas, October is ripe for making connections. And let’s be honest, you’re catching up on lost time, thanks to a challenging summer. \nIt wasn’t easy being a Leo, although a little character-building patience isn’t the WORST thing. But still…Venus spent what felt like an endless six-week retrograde in Leo from July 22 until September 3. Then Mercury retrograde jumped in and dragged out the delays until September 15. Argh! If you felt stuck in a constant holding pattern or misunderstood at every turn, fasten your seat belt. Life’s about to move at a much swifter pace.\nEven better? You don’t have to do it alone. Until October 23, the Sun is in Libra and your third house of communication, ideas and kindred spirits. Finally you have an eager audience for your novel ideas! Life is so much easier when people are receptive, rather than resistant, to your ideas.\nEnergizer Mars is also in Libra until October 12, rekindling your fan base and sparking up your creativity. The first couple weeks of the month should be filled with exciting opportunities to share your message and get back on the same page as your crew.\nEclipse season picks up the action even more in the second half of the month. October will feature TWO eclipses—a Libra solar eclipse at the October 14 new moon and the final Taurus lunar (full moon) eclipse in a two-year series on October 28. These game-changing lunar lifts will sweep through your communication and career corners respectively, shaking up the stagnant parts. Out with the old! From unsatisfying friendships to professional plateaus, you are so done with it all. \nMidmonth, connect to as many innovative thinkers as you can. Explore synergies and test your chemistry with a small collab. Then get ready to bid adieu to a chapter of your career or a going-nowhere goal you’ve outgrown. Things are about to get a LOT more interesting, Leo—and way more “on brand” with the person you’ve become.\nCaveat: We’re not entirely done with retrogrades, but the planets that remain in this powered-down speed this October are the slow-moving outer planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and (until October 10) Pluto. Luckily these giants don’t really affect our day-to-day lives as much, and their retrogrades can actually be helpful times of integration and reflection.\nTwo of them, Jupiter and Uranus, are retrograde in Taurus and your career house. You’ll probably be more than ready for any changes that blow in with the October 28 eclipse. Perhaps your Halloween costume should simply be “Leo 2.0”—because by the time the month ends, you’ll feel like a whole new person.\nTake a little time to let that sink in. On October 23, Scorpio season begins, and the Sun takes a pre-holiday respite in your domestic fourth house. Catch up on things at Chateau Leo and make all those plans with family. A month from now, the spotlight will be shining directly on you, and you’ll want to have everything in place so you can finish the year with a star turn—the way the stars intend for you, Leo!\nLightness at last? October is one of the liveliest and most social months for you as the Sun makes its annual trip through Libra and your communicative third house until October 23. There’s nothing you love more than swapping stories with a kindred spirit as you share a decadent treat at that buzzy new cafe or window-shop for hours. \nIf you’re not talking about everything from your latest bingeable series and “oh my god you have to try it” organic skincare line to that session you just had with a psychic medium, you’ll be devouring books, podcasts and blogs that feed your need for fresh intel. Hello, hungry lion!\nAnd like a true cub, you need to romp and play. That impulse is even stronger this year since energetic Mars is in Libra until October 12, making you restless and shortening your attention span. Let your inner event planner have a field day during Libra season, hosting little parties or rallying the troops for excursions. Hit the fall festivals and gather your friends (and their friends) to check out new hotspots in your ‘hood. Gather recommendations for books, podcasts and restaurants to try. Your curiosity knows no bounds!\nDo your best to stay cool on October 8, when an explosive Mars-Pluto square provokes your critical side. With assertive Mars in your communication zone locked into a heated 90-degree square to intense Pluto in your controlling sixth house, you might feel attacked by someone’s harsh words. Your own micromanaging could put someone else on the defensive, making them feel like you’re doubting their judgment. Ask questions before you fling any accusations.\nIs the devil in the details? You may find out as soon as October 10, when transformational Pluto ends a five-month retrograde that began on May 1. The retrograde’s first leg was in Aquarius and your relationship sector. But on June 11, Pluto slipped back into Capricorn and your sixth house of health, organization and analytical thinking. \nPower struggles could have erupted, especially with employees or co-workers. If you’ve been dealing with anxiety or a health issue, it may have been hard to discern the cause with shadowy Pluto back-spinning like this. Chronic might have disrupted your sleep patterns or caused you to lapse into self-soothing habits like emotional eating.\nNow with Pluto resuming forward motion, you can corral the chaos and get to the root of what ails ya. Take a deep breath: You’ll be better able to manage people—and their dynamics—once Pluto straightens out. \nHave you been afraid to step into your power because you’re worried about pleasing others and being liked? No more! The dwarf planet’s course correction will help you get a better grip on mind-body-spirit balance. A nagging psychological or emotional issue may have been affecting your physical health. The link could soon become clear, putting you back on the path to wellness and vitality.\nShare your brilliance, Leo! The October 14 Libra new moon solar eclipse is an especially prime day to spark up a new friendship or have an important conversation. If you’re pitching a creative concept or meeting a would-be client, these moonbeams will give you the gift of gab, so schedule your appointments accordingly.\nThis is the first eclipse in Libra since 2016, and the second in a two-year series on the Aries/Libra axis that will recalibrate your communication sector between March 2023 and March 2025. Get ready for new ways to craft your message, share your ideas and join forces with kindred spirits. \nBut first: Do you still have any baggage around doing that? With la luna opposite wounded healer Chiron today, you may need to release some old fears about speaking up and being ostracized for your beliefs. It’s risky to wear your heart on your sleeve (even for a self-expressed Leo). At the end of the day, you want to be loved and praised for your ideas. \nWell, this Libra new moon might be an invitation to care a little less about what other people think and to start taking some risks! You don’t have to put everything out there all at once, either. Share a little taste of your ideas with the public. Take a class or a workshop to build your skills. Test your chemistry with a collaborator on a small project. Start treating life like a grand experiment instead of a performance or a juried competition. You’ll be much freer—and you’ll have a lot more fun! \nHad a little TOO much fun, Leo? Nesting time has arrived. On October 23, the Sun moves into Scorpio and your foundational fourth house. Home, family and emotional restoration are the themes for the next four weeks. Lean in to those so you can have a full tank for when Sagittarius and holiday season arrive in a month, your most festive time of year! \nWhat do you need to feel like you’re anchored and secure? This is a worthy exploration. You’re incredibly self-sufficient, but just because you CAN do it all yourself doesn’t mean you should. During Scorpio season, it’s okay to pare down your packed schedule and leave some white space in your calendar. Rest, contemplation and self-care will give your inner voice a chance to get a word in edgewise!\nFinding peace and quiet at home could be a little challenging, however. With super-active Mars in Scorpio from October 12 until November 24, your household could be a heat zone. There may be visits from family, roommate friction or the extra stress of early holiday preparation. \nDon’t make it more dramatic than it needs to be, Leo. View any flare-ups as a sign. You might need to reconfigure your home’s layout for better space-sharing, especially if you’ve got introverts and extroverts overlapping in common areas. Maybe it’s time for some Fengclass=\"body-el-link standard-body-el-link\"  Shui or space clearing. (Check out our Home Reset course to usher in new energy.) With the eclipses stirring up so much, you might want to start these kinds of projects in November, after the dust settles!\nTake a break from all the personal-life stuff on October 28, when the year’s only full moon in Taurus, a partial lunar eclipse, beams into your tenth house of career, leadership and success. You could reach a professional pinnacle where you’re recognized for your talents and hard work. If you’ve been pondering whether to cut ties and move elsewhere, this full moon will light the way.\nToday’s full moon is a big deal because it’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021, radically refashioning the balance between career and home. Your personal and professional paths may look nothing like they did a couple years ago.\nWith expansive Jupiter in Taurus opposing dynamic Mars in Scorpio, you’ll feel this world-life dichotomy acutely today. In fact, you might be even quicker to hit a breaking point if you feel your two “selves” being split. Demands at home could really start to take a toll on your ambitions in ways that push you to the breaking point. \nReminder, Leo: You CAN and should redesign your life any way you like. But it’s up to you to ask the people around you to pull their weight or to make the necessary changes that support your dreams. You’ve got this—and today’s eclipse is here to drive that message home!\nWell…THAT was interesting. For the past four months (since June 5), you’ve been hosting love planet Venus in your sign—an extended trip since Venus typically only hangs out for about a month. Sounds dreamy? Alas, not so much. From July 22 to September 3, Venus was retrograde (backward), disrupting harmony and complicating matters for many Leos in love, friendship and all around ease. \nVenus has been doing her best to make it up to you for the past month since returning to direct (forward) motion in Leo. But it might have been too little, too late. So…let’s try this again next year, Venus? \nOn October 8, Venus move on to Virgo. As the love goddess decamps to your stable second house until November 8, she’ll whet your appetite for luxury and stability. Now you’ll settle into a more grounded romantic groove. \nWith Venus heating up your earthy second house, you’ll be attracted to reliable people who might have seemed “boring” at another time. For single Leos, sparks could fly with a coworker or someone you meet at an industry event. This realm rules your finances, so couples may need to smooth over any tension around money (luckily, peacemaker Venus is here to help). Whether your “security issues” are fiscal or emotional, talk them through and remember, you’re on the same team here. \nMeanwhile, Mars is charging through Libra until October 12, energizing your third house of communication and kindred spirits. You won’t be at a loss for meeting people now! You could meet someone who sweeps you off your suede booties when you least expect it. Pay attention to friends who insist they know the “perfect” person for you. For once, they might be right! \nCouples will appreciate having a chance to step out of any stressful circular conversations and just enjoy each other’s company. Organize some casual gatherings with mutual friends, like concerts or comedy shows. Variety can’t help but bring some sizzle to your shared life!\nHome is where the HEAT is once restless Mars grooves into Scorpio and your domestic sector from October 12 until November 24. No need to wait until the official holiday season to feather your nest or turn your place into a love den. If you’re a Leo who loves to entertain like La Martha herself, Mars will create a lively—and sexy—vibe for any get-togethers you might throw. \nCaution: demanding roomates and relatives could add friction (and not the good kind) to your household with intensifier Mars in Scorpio. Perhaps it’s time to reconfigure your layouts, creating more privacy for yourself. Is WFH life making it hard to unwind into a sensual groove after hours. Follow Virginia Woolf’s directive and find “a room of one’s own”—or a charming cafe—to do work outside your house.\nPut your money where your mouth is, Leo, and start spreading the news! With go-getter Mars in Libra and your communicative third house until October 12, your ideas are your currency. You may get a chance to pitch your ideas to a well-connected person at the October 14 Libra solar eclipse. Be ready—the opportunity could arrive in the last minute!\nA peak professional moment arrives at the October 28 Taurus lunar (full moon) eclipse, which floods your tenth house of career and success with its manifesting beams. Ready to throw in the towel on an unfulfilling job and try a new path? Poised for a promotion or to pitch a profitable prospective client? This is your moment to go for it. Bring on the deals! \nIf you’ve been on the fence about a job or role, it’s a great day to talk to the key players or decision makers and hash out a new, more fulfilling position for yourself. This is the final Taurus eclipse in a two-year series that’s been revolutionizing your career path. Don’t be surprised if an offer comes out of the blue, or a sudden change of the guard happens with your company or clientele. If someone is “eclipsed” away, trust that a much better fit is en route to you, Leo.\nLove Days: 18, 23\nMoney Days: 2, 11\nLuck Days: 27, 9\nOff Days: 6, 21, 25\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Cancer Monthly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-01 15:10:06", "text": "(June 21 - July 22)\nIt’s the (second) most Cancerian time of the year! With the Sun visiting Libra and your cozy, domestic fourth house—the zodiac zone ruled by Cancer—October puts you in your nurturing, nesting element. Motivator Mars is also in Libra until October 12, energizing your efforts. Whether you’re hosting loved ones, changing up your seasonal decor or getting an early start on holiday prep, your inner “householder” is running at warp speed. (Just please don’t hang up any Christomas lights before Halloween, okay?)\nYour ruling planet, the moon, is as busy as you are this month! Two eclipses will activate the skies in the second half of October, moving any stuck energy forward around your living situation, family and friendships. Eclipses are turbocharger transits, pushing us past plateaus whether we’re ready or not. Stay ready for action this month, Cancer, because things could move fast.\nRelationships also regain steam after October 10, when alchemical Pluto ends a five-month retrograde and pivots forward in Capricorn, adding potency to your partnership realm. The other four slow-moving outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) are still retrograde all month long. But with the eclipses sparking up so much action, you might be grateful to have a few parts of your life on temporary hold.\nOne part that will be far from dormant after October 23: your love life! That day, the Sun sidles into Scorpio for a month, heating up your fifth house of passion, pleasure and play. With spicy Mars here from October 12 until November 24, you’ve got an extended cuffing season. Not that you’ll necessarily want to be “cuffed.” With the Sun and Mars in this frisky zone, you might enjoy basking in the attention of many admirers rather than rushing into an exclusive. If you’re already partnered, enjoy the romantic boost. Halloween costumes could be even more fun to take off than they are to put on. Oh behave! Wait…no, don’t!\nAll the feelings! The emotion ocean is reaching high tide this October, with a few extra currents pulling you this way and that. For starters, the Sun is in Libra and your sensitive and sentimental fourth house until October 23, which always puts you in a nostalgic state.\nAs the natural ruler of the zodiac’s fourth house, you’re usually “in the zone” during Libra season as el Sol travels through the foundation of your solar chart and draws out your nurturing and domestic side. Your attention is focused on your family or domicile as the Sun illuminates this most personal part of your life. Ambitious plans and worldly duties can wait. You’ve got root vegetables roasting in the oven and a “vintage botanicals” Pinterest board underway. (Priorities, people!)\nThis Libra session is extra lit with energizer Mars in Libra on October 12 and a Libra new moon that’s also a solar eclipse on October 14. Change won’t come to your personal life with much subtlety. Get ready for some possible pivots, from a change of address to unexpected visits from relatives to a sudden urge to change up your entire home decor scheme. Easy does it, Crab! You could quickly get in over your head, underestimating the amount of work required to pull off an ambitious domestic or hosting plan.\nWatch those volatile emotions this October 8, when combative Mars locks horns in a tense square with vengeful Pluto. Touchy Mars is in Libra and your emotional fourth house until October 12, making you thin-skinned. As the red planet clashes with Pluto in your relationship zone, strong emotions may get the better of you. If you find yourself at wits’ end, pause for self-care instead of forcing a conversation or staging a stormy confrontation. \nThings in a key relationship could blow up—and perhaps this will be a good thing in the long run. Sometimes things just have to come into the open before they can get better. But if there’s any way to have this showdown another day, you’ll have less damage control to do. Unless someone’s behavior or actions need to be addressed immediately, take a timeout to assess the right course of action.\nTransforming your relationships is an important item of business starting October 10, when karmic Pluto ends a five-month retrograde in Capricorn and your partnership zone. Have you been embroiled in a power struggle with a key person? Maybe you’ve been hashing out deal points but keep stopping shy of signing on the dotted line for a professional venture. \nEnergetically, something’s been holding you back or getting in the way of making things official…but perhaps it’s a blessing in disguise? Now that Pluto returns to forward motion, you can see these dynamics more clearly and work to balance them. With cuffing season underway, it’s a great time to apply your new insights to an existing relationship or with new long-term prospects!\nChange arrives at your doorstep—literally—on October 14. The year’s only Libra new moon is a solar eclipse, setting off a fresh six-month cycle for matters of home and heart. Eclipses are harbingers of unpredictable change. These moonbeams will propel you to turn to a fresh page with loved ones. Maybe you’ll suddenly scout for a new address or living situation if you’re in the market for that. (You could find out unexpectedly that you are!) \nThis is the first eclipse in Libra since 2016, and the second in a two-year series on the Aries/Libra axis that will revolutionize your personal and professional life between March 2023 and March 2025. For the past six months, many Crabs started craving a better distribution of time spent between work and home. Perhaps your career became more demanding, forcing you to delegate some of the household work or vice versa. Maybe you picked up the slack with some family caretaking and needed someone else to hold down the work fort.\nIf you’re burnt out on your responsibilities, this inaugural Libra eclipse is here to help you add more self-care, art and creativity to your life. Libra, after all, is the sign of balance. The most important thing you can do now is find some of that for yourself. With the eclipse opposing wounded healer Chiron in Aries, you may find that some of your inner journeying informs your next career moves.\nReady to bring a few fall colors back into your life? Some well-deserved fun arrives on October 23, when the Sun moves into fellow water sign Scorpio and your fifth house of pleasure, passion and play. Creativity spikes with your mojo; a fall romance could heat up before the holiday season begins. If you’re in a relationship, get some date nights and fun outings on the calendar, along with a few occasions to pull out your glam gear, even if it’s for a small event you host. (You look adorable in athleisure, Crab, but you clean up nicely too!) Scorpio season ignites your fifth house of creativity, a time to get free-range with an artistic project or put your talents on display.\nLusty Mars will join the Sun in Scorpio, visiting this libidinous lair from October 12 to November 24. Get ready for the passionate energy to dial up another ten notches! Suddenly you’re turning heads and attracting attention with little effort. Enjoy basking in that admiration and let the spotlight reveal your multifaceted talents already. \nYou could draw fame quickly with Mars here, but warning: Drama is just as likely to find you. Your emotions are heightened, and the filters are off with combative Mars in this expressive zone. Watch those knee-jerk reactions, which will be even more amplified by the intensity of eclipse season. Channel your diva and dramatic inclinations into a sexy Halloween costume and even sultrier celebration.\nIf things get a little TOO intense, you can take a huge step back at the October 28 Taurus full moon, which is a partial lunar eclipse. La luna lands in your eleventh house of objective thinking, helping you pull back from the heat zone and cool down. Instead of getting swept up in emotions, you can be the diplomat in the room, helping everyone feel seen and heard.\nToday’s full moon is a big deal because it’s the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021. For the past two years, you’ve been learning to navigate the line between drama and detachment. When is the right time to step into the spotlight and when should you be a team player? The Taurus/Scorpio eclipses gave you equal opportunities to steal the show and be an awesome “backup dancer.”\nHave you been way too much of a solo act? The lunar eclipse could bring an exciting opportunity to collaborate, perhaps with someone you meet online or through a cutting-edge community project with a social justice twist. You could connect with a like-minded group of people or discover firsthand how much power there is in numbers. Since full moons can bring endings or transitions, you may part ways with a friend or clique and start hanging out with people who are more on your wavelength. Since eclipses can move at a much more radical pace, you might abruptly part ways with a friendship or a group and move on to another affiliation.\nExpansive Jupiter in Taurus will oppose Mars in Scorpio today, underscoring your need to be around people who support your ascent rather than diminish it. Let the jealous haters go elsewhere. You need to be around people who celebrate your full, authentic expression.\nMatters of security are on your mind during the first half of the month, as the love planets move through more stabilizing zones of your chart. Mars is in Libra and your fourth house of home, family and emotional security until October 12. Meanwhile, Venus is rounding out an extended four-month trip to Leo and your rooted second house that’s spanned from June 5 to October 8.\nWhile it might sound romantic to host the love planet in this passionate sign for four whole months, there was a plot twist. Venus was in a tricky retrograde cycle from July 22 until September 3, disrupting any hopes of a memorable summer love.\nFear not, Cancer: Your do-over has arrived! The month moves into a flirty and confident phase on October 8 when Venus moves into Virgo and your social, lighthearted third house until November 8. Now, rather than worry about where things are going, you’re feeling independent. If you’re unattached, you may be more interested in cantering around the pasture than in tying up to any one hitching post in particular. You could meet someone through mutual friends or while out on the town.\nThis frisky energy builds to a crescendo starting October 12, when white-hot Mars zips into Scorpio and your fifth house of fame, passion and romance until November 24. When it comes to love, you tend to favor exclusive relationships, but this could be the moment where you finally discover the joy of casual dating. Dress up as often as you can, if only to make yourself happy (and definitely for Halloween). Baby fever could strike some Crabs now, and if at first you don’t succeed, Mars gives you the momentum (and libido) to try, try again. \nHome, profitable home? With energizer Mars in Libra until October 12 along with the Sun (through October 23), your domestic fourth house is a hot spot. If you work remotely, this is a prime month to get your home office set up for maximum productivity or start a cottage-industry side hustle. \nEven if you report to an offsite location, you’ll still want to bring the crisp edges back to your home, doing a deep clean and purging your file cabinets, for example, or investing in some decor upgrades. Got a room or space you can put on Airbnb or VRBO? Consider supplementing your income with some extra rental cash, especially near the October 14 Libra solar eclipse. \nAll together now! The Taurus full moon, a powerful lunar eclipse, could bring your shared efforts to a peak moment this October 28. If you have a team project to complete or a tech venture to launch, this eclipse will add momentum. Eclipses bring surprises, and this one could impact the people in your org chart. A colleague or group member could make a sudden departure, perhaps getting recruited to a new job or department. \nIs it time to make your own digital debut? With Mars in Scorpio and your fame-worthy fifth house from October 12 to November 24, this eclipse could put you on center stage with a viral post or a meaningful message.\nLove Days: 14, 21\nMoney Days: 27, 9\nLuck Days: 6, 25\nOff Days: 3, 18, 23\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(May 21 - June 20)\nReady to add some spice to your fall escapades, Gemini? After a challenging three months—with love planet Venus AND your ruler, Mercury, both in signal-scrambling retrograde—you should finally start to feel back on your game. Your jokes will earn cackles instead of cancellations, and your fans will stop being impervious to your charms. Now that’s more like it!\nEnjoy this lift while the Sun is in Libra and your fifth house of passion, fame and magnetism through October 23, amplified by energizer Mars, which is in Libra until October 12. It may be cuffing season, but you probably won’t want to be tied to any one person when there are so many enticing choices.\nIn the second half of October, eclipse season gets underway. The year’s last two game-changing lunar events arrive on October 14 and 28. The first one, a Libra solar eclipse, happens at the October 14 new moon. This could bring a romantic connection or a creative opportunity, perhaps even some fame, when you least expect it.\nYour spiritual life is in the spotlight at the October 28 lunar eclipse in Taurus and your twelfth house of surrender and serendipity. It’s time to let go of something you’ve been trying to control or desperately hold onto. This is the grand finale of a two-year Taurus/Scorpio eclipse series that’s rippled across your health, wellness and soul sectors since November 2021.\nWith so much to process, you may actually feel relieved that all five of the slow-moving outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto—are retrograde this whole month. The only exception is Pluto, which will turn direct (forward) in Capricorn and your deep-diving eighth house on October 10. Use this modulated pace to process all the changes from this year and get yourself centered. Eclipse season is bound to deliver its share of surprises.\nScorpio season will also lend a helping hand. As the Sun spends a month in your orderly and clear-thinking sixth house starting October 23, you can break things down into bite-sized manageable steps. That long list seems a lot less daunting when you tackle it a piece at a time.\nOn the shiny-happy side of things, the Sun is making its annual visit to Libra and your pleasure-seeking, playful fifth house until October 23. A touch of “fall fever” could overtake you as el Sol gives the frisky side of your Gemini nature cosmic permission to roam free. \nThe leaves won’t be the only things putting their fiery colors on display! Sizzling Mars is also in Libra until October 12, adding a dash of drama and sending your charisma off the charts. During these glamorous and giddy three weeks, you’ll be the life of every party as you hold court and build your fanbase. It’s is also a richly creative time, with the Sun warming up this expressive zone of your chart. Share your talents and nurture your artistic abilities. When the Sun is in this be-here-now zone, your best bet is to immerse yourself fully in the moment…your most direct path to joy.\nWatch for challenging fireworks on October 8, when Mars locks into a heated square with power-tripping Pluto, which is in your eighth house of intimacy and control. A fast-moving attraction could be stalled by your unwillingness (or theirs) to get truly vulnerable. Surrender is required at a certain point—but how soon is too soon? Some old trust issues could flare up. \nBefore you just react to those raw emotions, which you’ll be tempted to do under this powder-keg transit, look inward at what’s really driving up your fears or resistance. Don’t slam the drawbridge on a budding connection before you do! On the flip side, if you’re obsessing over someone, the Mars-Pluto square could spin you into tunnel vision if you’re not careful. Much as you’d like to control this situation, Gemini, people resent being micromanaged. YOU certainly do!\nAnd if that weren’t enough, there’s a whole lot more activation energy afoot as Pluto, the planet all things hidden, makes its presence again after a five-month retrograde. Since May 1, Pluto’s been back-spinning through Aquarius and your visionary ninth house (until June 11), then Capricorn and your zone of merging, intimacy and shared possessions. \nOver the summer and early fall, you may have done some deep soul-searching and released turbulent emotions, like shame, resentment and codependence. Pluto’s retrograde might also have revealed fissures in your closest relationships. An ex could have resurfaced, driving up jealousy or suppressed desires. Button-pushing people may have acted as “mirrors” who reflected something you needed to examine within yourself. Anyone that you’re in a financial, emotional or sexual entanglement with could have been the source of a power struggle.\nIf you happen to have buried any feelings (retrogrades can cause us to suppress and avoid certain emotions), Pluto’s pivot back to forward motion could drive them up once again. Have you been unsure whether to trust someone or get financially entwined? Clarity could arrive over the next couple weeks. Aim to be more aboveboard with the people in your life. \nOn October 14, the year’s only Libra new moon arrives, awakening your fifth house of passion, pleasure and expression. Even better? This one is a potent solar eclipse, the very first one to make landfall in Libra since 2016. \nThe eclipse could also bring love out of the blue! It will set off a six-month cycle that draws you out of your head (the Gemini “safety zone”) and helps you drop into your heart a little more. See what happens if you allow your emotions to roam free instead of trying to manage them. Your life could start to feel richer and more alive! Think: less control, more “carpe diem.”\nEclipses can bring surprises and sudden plot twists. In your fertile fifth house, this could bring unexpected baby news to Geminis of the childbearing set. Others might birth an amazing creative idea. This eclipse will prod you onto center stage, whether that means getting glam new headshots, booking a performance or just sharing more openly without caring about what anyone thinks.\nDon’t worry, you don’t have to make this change all at once. Between now and March 2025, eclipses will travel over the Aries/Libra axis, pushing you to be a bigger star AND a great team player. Today is a spotlight moment for you, Gemini. Step into that beam and let your personality rip. Don’t overthink it!\nAnd…cut! Fall friskiness and flamboyance give way to cleaner, greener days as the Sun moves into Scorpio and activates your sixth house of efficiency and wellness for a month. Get ready to turn over a new leaf amid the turning leaves. Before the holiday hedonism kicks into gear, use these coming four weeks to start some healthy habits and regular routines around eating, sleeping and exercise. With energizer Mars also in Scorpio from October 12 to November 24, you’ve got an added dose of motivation. Start wherever you are—the key is to get going and let the momentum build.\nLet’s face it: You are far more productive when you get a full night’s sleep, incorporate regular exercise in your lifestyle and eat your dark leafy greens. Sure, you can sneak in a little Halloween candy, but you’ll feel so much better if you also harvest recipes for healthy, anti-inflammatory and plant-based treats. Aim for moderation now, instead of extremes. \nThe sixth house rules helpful people, service and systems. Scorpio season is a great time to corral any chaos at work or home with a deep clean and decluttering, especially with Mars putting the wind in your sails. Take inventory of Team Gemini and make sure everyone’s feeling clear and connected. Tweak plans for the rest of the year and set a couple of ambitious “stretch goals” for between now and Black Friday. \nGet ready…the last eclipse of 2023 will arrive just a few days shy of Halloween. It’s also the grand finale of an eclipse series that’s rippled across the Taurus/Scorpio axis since November 2021, reshaping your approach to health, healing, work and wellbeing. \nOn October 28, the annual Taurus full moon, a partial lunar eclipse, floods your twelfth house of healing and closure with its “let it go” prompts. Is it time to release someone or something, Gemini? If you’re hanging on to a person, situation or behavior that just isn’t giving you life anymore, it’s time to radically redirect those tides. \nYou might literally walk away, sure, but leaving isn’t always the answer. As the saying goes, “Wherever you go, there you are.” Maybe a better focus would be to try to transform the situation by NOT trying to control, micromanage or save it. This full moon could be a powerful portal for a spiritual message—don’t dismiss any strong intuitive flashes or inner guidance! An escape, preferably near water, could reset you and help you download some divine inspiration. \nLook back to the May 19 Taurus new moon for clues of what could come to fruition now. Where do you need support, including spiritual and emotional? This lunar eclipse is about receiving. Lean on your tried-and-true champions or seek new ones, such as a therapist or healer.\nIn sync with the lunar eclipse, lucky Jupiter in Taurus will oppose combative Mars in Scorpio. As you grow and expand in new directions, you may feel increasing stress from the people in your life. Their demands and needs could be at odds with your own need for greater independence. At this eclipse, you’re encouraged to fully use your voice and self-advocate, Bull. If you don’t have the capacity to take care of others now, simply let them now instead of getting angry or rebellious. Remember: “No” is a complete sentence!\nThe first week of the month is a social one, as Venus rounds out a four-month visit to Leo and your chatty, interactive third house. The other love planet, spicy Mars, is in Libra and your passionate fifth house until October 12. A fall fling or some epic date nights could start the month of right. On October 14, the Libra solar eclipse could bring a brand-new chapter to your love story, with someone new or the person you’re with.\nOn October 8, Venus ends a long visit to Leo that began on June 5 and included a challenging retrograde from July 22 to September 3. Now, the love planet moves on to Virgo, activating your fourth house of home, family and emotional foundations until November 8. \nWith tender Venus ensconced in Virgo, you’ll feel the magnetic pull of Chez Virgo and a desire to spend more time around your closest people. If you’re in a relationship, you might want to zip yourselves into your couple bubble and not emerge till after Thanksgiving! While you’re in there, share a few vulnerable confessions and be receptive to theirs.  \nIf you live with your S.O., you might be inspired to refeather your shared nest, whether it’s with a major home-improvement project or just some decorating changes. Single Geminis might need to pry yourselves out of the house and into some good mingling settings. Grab a chatty wingperson to keep you from bailing or sneaking off early.\nMeanwhile, over in your passionate fifth house, lusty Mars is stoking your libido as it makes its biennial blaze through Libra and your pleasure sector until October 12. Whether you’re single or attached, the first half of the month grants you head-turning magnetism and major mojo—plus, plenty of options to choose from, especially at the October 14 Libra solar eclipse. \nMake the most of this glamorous cycle by dressing up and enjoying all the attention you effortlessly attract. For some Twins, a casual flirtation could heat up to full consummation. (Note: This could come with a side of drama since Mars can drive up jealousy and competitiveness.) Longtime couples will enjoy these sizzling vibes, which, P.S., also shed ideal babymaking mood lighting if you’re of that mindset!\nOnce lusty Mars zips into Scorpio on October 12, you’re lit with motivational energy until November 24. Surprise: You’ll be as pumped about spreadsheets as you are about Spin class. Before you shoot for the moon, though, make sure your tanks are filled with rocket fuel (read: clean, vitamin-rich food and enough cash to pull off the plan). Single Geminis could meet someone while engaged in healthy pursuits. Paired-up Twins can get closer by tackling a shared project or fitness goal. The magic is in the mundane!\nTurn your passion into profits! With activator Mars in Libra and your creative, spotlight-grabbing fifth house until October 12, one of your talents could take hold of public attention. You’re one of the most creative and naturally entertaining signs, so it won’t be surprising when you capture the attention of a fascinated (and fascinating) fanbase. The October 14 Libra solar (new moon) eclipse is an especially fortunate date to put your bolder ideas into the public sphere.\nWhen Mars moves into Scorpio from October 12 to November 24, you’re ready to bring the sharp edges back to your life. Scorpio rules your sixth house of systems, order and helpful people. You may need to corral Team Gemini into shape—or, if you’re a party of one, start delegating and outsourcing tasks that have become procrastination points for you. Instead of DIY-ing, find a capable specialist who can knock it out in a few hours. It will be well worth the investment, even if it doesn’t seem like it at first. \nMars in Scorpio is a motivating time to organize and declutter before the holidays begin. Tackle one task (or micro-task) each day and you’ll have plenty to be thankful for by the time turkey is served and the Christmas lights start twinkling.\nLove Days: 13, 18\nMoney Days: 25, 6\nLuck Days: 3, 23\nOff Days: 2, 14, 21\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

{"title": "Taurus Monthly Horoscope", "date": "2023-10-01 15:10:05", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n(April 20 - May 20)\nDid back-to-school season get off to a slow start, Taurus? Fear not! You’re actually right in sync with the stars. For the first three weeks of the month, the Sun is in Libra and your systematic, sensible sixth house. Energizer Mars is also riding through Libra in tandem until October 12, fueling your resolve to get healthy and organized.\nIt also happens to be eclipse season as the two final lunar events arrive on October 14 and 28. The first one, a Libra solar eclipse, comes at the October 14 new moon to really boost up your work and wellness efforts. Then, the grand finale of a two-year Taurus/Scorpio eclipse series finishes off the month. Brace yourself, Bull: The October 28 lunar eclipse is in YOUR sign and will bring all of the personal growth work you’ve done since November 2021 together with a flourish.\nThis “uncorking” will be a welcome change after a sluggish summer. Although all five of the slow-moving outer planets will be retrograde (backward) this month, that trend starts to reach an end.\nOn October 10, alchemical Pluto will end a five-month retrograde that began on May 1, splitting its time in Aquarius (until June 11) and Capricorn. Pluto’s reversal made you deeply rethink your career and what inspires you. As Pluto emerges from this season of soul-searching, you’ll have a chance to explore how to add some soul to your goals.\nPartnerships take center stage starting October 23, when the Sun dives into Scorpio and your relationship sector for a month. Explore those ties that have dynamic-duo potential, but wait until that big Taurus eclipse on October 28 to make any binding decisions.\nEclipses are famous for bringing curveballs and surprises, or at least for revealing hidden information. Whether it’s a trick or a treat, it could take until Halloween before you can really see the whole picture. Give the energy a few days to settle—some new information could be revealed. As a steady Taurus, you understand the power of waiting and collecting ALL of your options before making a decision. Follow those natural instincts now!\nReady to bring those crisp edges back, Taurus? The stars are lined up to support your efforts this month, whether you’re doing a deep clean and declutter, mapping out a project plan or starting healthy habits. With the Sun in Libra and your sixth house of well-being and organization until October 23, it’s time to prioritize the practical. \nVirgo season, which ended on September 23, is typically an indulgent time for you. If you tipped too far into hedonism, the Libra Sun helps you return to balanced living. Think: consistent mealtimes, movement and sleeping hours. To power up your efficiency efforts, energizer Mars is making its biennial visit to Libra until October 12. You’re ready to tackle whatever “problem spot” you set your sights on—and to be as proactive and solution-oriented as possible. \nMars in Libra can also rev you up to get a fall fitness plan underway. But be sure to stretch your muscles and warm up before workouts. The hasty red planet can make you accident-prone and susceptible to strains or injury. Monitor your stress levels to keep your health in check now too. \nOne day that could find you racked with indecision—and stressed about it—is October 8, when anxious Mars locks into a high-pressure square with power-tripping Pluto. \nMars is in Libra and your analytical sixth house, which could drive up anxiety and make you feel overwhelmed by all the details. Pluto in your expansive ninth house can serve up big schemes and dreams. But putting an actual plan in place, which is usually a Taurus specialty, might fall apart. Your inner control freak will want to micromanage the process—or your mind will spin through all the reasons “this can’t work.” \nIs this a fear of success…or of failure? Maybe both. Either way, don’t let the intensity get the best of you. Examine the concerns that arise and conduct due diligence. But don’t empower the intense fear or emotion behind those factors.\nAs Pluto powers forward in Capricorn and your ninth house of higher education until January, you might consider returning to school. Don’t rush into any major degree programs, Bull. More likely, this transit could draw you into a course or workshop on a specific topic, perhaps even something related to personal growth and transformation. \nSometimes you have to dive deep to excavate your purpose—and bottomless Pluto will happily pull you into those recesses. With expansive Jupiter and changemaker Uranus both in Taurus (but retrograde) for a long stretch, self-realization work could unearth a treasure! It won’t be an overnight process, but it’s one well worth exploring. Follow your curiosity!\nThe Libra new moon on October 14 is a solar eclipse, making it particularly auspicious for starting a new habit, work project or wellness practice. With holiday hedonism on the horizon, regular exercise and clean eating will help balance out the impending temptations that will be way too good to resist. Want to get more in tune with the rhythms of your spending patterns, health and time management? There’s an app for that; install a few! \nThe sixth house rules service, so look for volunteer opportunities or initiate a giving drive at work. Bonus points if you round up a few friends and turn your do-gooding into a social occasion. Since pets also fall under this new moon’s domain, pay attention to the unconditionally loving critters in your life. If you’re thinking of adopting, start your search. \nThis new moon will sit opposite wounded warrior Chiron in Aries and your twelfth house of closure. Are you still holding onto past pain or feeling like life is somehow stacked against you? Even if it’s an unconscious pattern (and it probably is), this eclipse—and the ensuing eclipses on the Aries/Libra axis touching down until March 2025—are taking you through an important healing cycle. Get support when it feels like you’re falling apart instead of pretending you’ve got it all together. There are no awards being handed out for perfectionists and martyrs, especially not now!\nIf the eclipse’s messaging wasn’t loud enough, the universe sends out another call for you to lean on the people in your life. On October 23, the Sun enters Scorpio and your zone of dynamic duos for a month. Forget about using that old “I’ll just do it all myself!” strategy. The stars will insist that you encircle yourself with a few true-blue souls who have your back through it all. \nMotivator Mars is also in Scorpio from October 12 to November 24, making your Scorpio season duos extra dynamic. You could attract some powerful and charismatic people now. This sizzling Sun-Mars combo could add an extra dash of spice to your love life, but it could also multiply the stress. \nIf you feel pressured to give someone an answer, whether in love or business, tap the brakes. We’re not saying you should downshift to an overly cautious pace. Just buy yourself enough time to think any important moves through clearly. If you’re the one rushing someone into a decision, calm down so you don’t scare them away. \nThe lunar loudspeaker is blaring your name on October 28 as the year’s only Taurus full moon arrives to turn your birthday wishes into reality. This one is extra-special because it’s also a lunar eclipse, which will cast its brightest beams on your first house of self and independence. Not only that, it’s the grand finale of a two-year eclipse series that’s thundered across the Taurus/Scorpio axis, revolutionizing your personal identity and your relationships. \nYou’re not the same person as you were in November 2021, when these change-making eclipses began to work their magic. And that’s the point! Hopefully you’ve shed some inauthentic layers and become more of yourself. If you did, you undoubtedly found people who aligned with that. Some of your relationships may have dramatically changed, a few ending or transforming. Not only is that natural, it was the point of these eclipses. \nYour meteoric growth is far from ending, though. Expansive Jupiter will continue its journey through Taurus all the way through late May 2024. Today, you might get a boldfaced look at how much you’re grown as Jupiter opposes Mars in Scorpio and your interpersonal house. A close relationship could reach a tipping point—or a breaking point. You can’t tamp down your truth to keep the peace anymore, Bull. At the same time, make sure you’re not being confrontational or pushy in an effort to get others on board with your vision. This eclipse, along with the Mars-Jupiter opposition, gives you one last big chance to refine both your messaging and your delivery.\nBack on track for cuffing season! Your ruling planet Venus has been a tricky one for the past few months. Venus took an extended trip through Leo and your heartfelt, homey fourth house from June 5, one that will end on October 8. That would be lovely, except Venus also spent six of those weeks (from July 22 until September 3) in low-power retrograde, disrupting the harmony of your closest bonds.\nWell, it’s time for a do-over, Taurus! On October 8, amorous Venus sashays through Virgo and your flirtatious, flamboyant fifth house. Between now and November 8, love is in the air as much as the scent of pumpkin-scented everything. Whether you’re single or attached, you’ll be in the mood to dress up, turn heads and pack your calendar with events. Unattached Lions may not want anything too serious during this cycle, especially since you could have lots of admiring options. Be upfront about your intentions (or lack thereof)—but prepare to have your heart captured just the same!\nUnfortunately, it won’t be all tangled bedsheets and intense tete-a-tetes. Over in your detail-minded, hypercritical sixth house, passionate Mars in Libra could be stirring up anxiety and self-doubt until October 12.\nBut once that cycle ends, this angst-y energy lifts. Fierce Mars will move on to Scorpio from October 12 until November 24, heating up your seventh house of commitments. Once the red planet relocates to your relationship zone, your energy will get channeled into adding spicy adventures to your twosome time. The last couple weeks of the month could be seriously sexy—with things moving to official status or a more committed level fast. And with a lunar eclipse in Taurus on October 28, it’s anyone’s guess what could happen!\nTwo heads are definitely better than one during this seven-week phase, but keeping those heads cool is a whole other story. Beyond the passion and lust, Mars can fire you up in relationships—and this could spell “trouble in paradise.” Be patiently assertive with your partners in all areas of life. But remember: Just because you say “Jump!” doesn’t mean they’ll auto-respond with a swift “How high?”\nIt’s all in the details, Taurus! With energizer Mars in Libra and your organized, administrative sixth house until October 12, you’re revved up to get everything put in place. The Libra new moon on October 14—a galvanizing solar eclipse—is a great day to declutter, map out an org chart or look into hiring someone who can make your life fun more efficiently. Implementing new processes and systems can also be helpful. \nPartner up with the movers and shakers starting October 12, when Mars moves into Scorpio and your dynamic duos sector until November 24. You don’t have to do it all by yourself, Bull! But do get ready for your solo moment on October 28, when the Taurus full moon lights the fall skies as a lunar eclipse in your first house of personal passions. \nAdvocate for yourself and your ideas—and don’t be surprised if others rally to champion you, if not hop fully aboard in support. But just because they’re excited doesn’t mean they’re the right partners for you. If you’ve learned anything these past couple of years, it’s how to better screen people and make sure your relationships are a two-way street. This is the very last Taurus eclipse in a series that began back in November 2021. Acknowledge the lessons you’ve learned and step into your rightful role, as the leader of your own life!\nLove Days: 11, 14\nMoney Days: 3, 23\nLuck Days: 2, 21\nOff Days: 27, 13, 18\nSee All Signs\nIdentical twin sisters Ophira and Tali Edut (a.k.a.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nFor when you need a bit of arm candy. \nWhile the rest of the world is mourning the departure of sunny weather and 9 p.m. sunsets, fashion aficionados are rejoicing over the arrival of fall—the ultimate season to cocoon ourselves in scarves, stomp around in our favorite boots, and show off all of the sweaters that have been piling up in our closets. ’Tis the season to layer and accessorize, and there are few pieces we love as much as a gorgeous handbag. \nWhere summer was all about canvas bags and straw totes fit for a picnic in the park or a day at the beach, fall assemblages call for a bit more repose and sophistication.

{"title": "The 25 Best ‘Sex and the City’ Guest Stars", "date": "2023-10-01 04:00:00", "text": "I couldn't help but wonder, who hasn't been on SATC?\nFor six seasons, Sex and the City was a revolving door for actors and actresses who were either fans of the show, friends of the show, or up-and-comers who just wanted to be part of the action. Some played versions of themselves (Matthew McConaughey, Lucy Liu), while others were barely recognizable (a young Kat Dennings, Andy Cohen). Here, a look back at some of the famous faces who crossed paths with Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte over the years.\nAll episodes are available to stream on Max\nJack (Bradley Cooper) was bad news from the beginning. As Carrie says in the episode, \"They Shoot Single People, Don't They?\" Jack was everything she needed at 2 a.m. on a Tuesday at a gay bar: single, straight, smoker. It could've been the greasy hair, the tempting smoking habit (she was trying really hard to quit), or the fact that Jack later discovered Carrie's \"Single & Fabulous?\" New York Magazine cover story — the two never did anything more than make out in a crowded bar and briefly, in his convertible. \nIn “The Perfect Present,” Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda head to a purse party thrown by the recently dumped Vanessa, played by the queen of the bend-and-snap. “Isn’t life funny? Because of that fucker, I’ve discovered, I’m Fendi!” she says in the episode, moments before walking into Samantha and Smith (in his pre-Gus Van Sant days) boning against several glass racks. \nGeri Halliwell played Phoebe, someone Samantha runs into on one of the hottest days of the summer. While fanning herself, Samantha learns (via Phoebe) that the pool at Soho House is the place to be, that is, if you can get past the waiting list. Enter: Annabelle Bronstein, whose membership card Samantha finds in the bathroom and uses a few times before her jig is up.\nBetween the end of The X-Files (the OG run) and the beginning of Californication, David Duchovny guest starred on several TV shows including Sex and the City. He played Jeremy, Carrie’s high school boyfriend (sorry, \"sweetheart\") who completely sweeps her off her feet before revealing he’s starting treatment at a mental institution in Connecticut. Here he is welcoming Carrie to the Juneau Spears Center, a place harder to get into (and out) of than the Soho House.\nJustin Theroux had the distinct honor of guest starring on SATC twice. On the season one episode, “The Monogamists,” Justin played Jared, a writer friend of Stanford’s who had a thing for giving the thumbs-up and was named one of  New York Magazine’s “30 Coolest People Under 30.” His character didn’t venture too far in the occupation department the second time around; on the season two episode “Shortcomings,” Justin played Vaughn, a fiction writer who orgasms too fast (hence, the episode’s title). \nIn the same episode where Samantha famously said, “I don’t believe in the Republican party or the Democratic party; I believe in parties,” Elizabeth Banks checked off one of her very first TV roles. In “Politically Erect,” Elizabeth played Catherine, the pearl-wearing fiancée of a politician Charlotte had set her eyes on at a fundraiser. According to Catherine, she met Bob, the fiancée, at a party where women brought guys they didn't want to date, leading a martini-filled Charlotte to mumble something about one women's trash becoming another's treasure.\nJohn Slattery played politician Bill Kelley, who was running for city treasurer and famously told Carrie, \"I love making love with you,\" before asking her to pee on him in the shower. When Carrie offered to \"dribble warm tea\" on him instead, Bill dumped her, citing that his campaign advisors didn't like her sex column. This of course, led Carrie to write a bit called, \"To Pee or Not To Pee?\" without using his real name. \"It was much more political not to,\" she said on the episode.\nReason #2409 why you should never date someone you meet at your therapist’s office: Seth, played by Jon Bon Jovi in “Games People Play.” In the episode, Seth takes Carrie out to dinner, plays a sexy game of Twister, and tells her he’s in therapy because he’s “really fucked up about women… after I sleep with them I lose interest” — after sleeping with Carrie.\nRemember when Samantha used Lucy Liu’s name for a Birkin bag that had a 5-year waiting list? On “Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda,” Samantha committed this very crime – a travesty in the PR world – and got caught by Lucy, who played herself on the episode.\nIn the L.A.-set episode, appropriately titled \"Escape From New York,\" SMG played Debbie, the \"most ambitious and feared creature,\" according to Carrie. Debbie was a junior development executive who really, really wanted to make a movie out of Carrie's columns. She also predicted that the movie would be \"chick flick big\" before declaring that the man who came up with that term \"should have his balls cut off.\"\nIn the same L.A. episode as SMG, Matthew McConaughey played a hyper version of himself who was interested in Carrie's movie and her columns. In a cringe-worthy business meeting, the SATC version of Matthew declared that he wanted to play Mr. Big and sleep with Carrie, all while biting on a toothpick. \"We are animals, men, women, walking the earth,\" he said in this scene. \"We are made of head, heart, and loins. We're talking about using them, am I right?\" Nah. Carrie was good, which is why she GTFO of there.\n\nBefore she was Bailey on Grey’s Anatomy, Chandra Wilson played a cop who confronted Samantha about her Richard “CHEATER” posters in the episode titled \"Anchors Away.\" When Samantha explained, “This man said he loved me, and I caught him eating another woman’s pussy,” the extremely understanding cop backed off in full support of this public shaming.\nCarrie’s columns never did turn into a movie, but they did turn into a book thanks to the brains of Lily Martin, book agent, played by Molly Shannon. Together with Courtney Masterson (Amy Sedaris; see next slide), Lily transformed Carrie's words  into something with a spine. At their first meeting, Lily got right to the point: “Is it hopeful? What's the message? What’s your point of view, after all the break ups and disappointments and train wrecks? You still believe he’s out there, right?” That gasp you heard? Millions of people asking why after all these years, Lily still knows what they’re thinking. \nWhen she was not finishing Lily’s sentences, Courtney (Amy Sedaris) was busy introducing future lovers to each other. Case in point: Carrie and Berger, who met while Carrie was in a book meeting with Courtney at her office. Hard to believe this relationship eventually ended with a Post-it note by way of The Hamptons, motorcycle rides, and a white noise machine that only took Carrie to the rainforest.\nBefore he was Tag on Friends, Eddie Cahill played Sean, Carrie’s bisexual “generation-something else” fling that she met at a party celebrating his “internet magazine… that I still couldn’t find on my computer.” Carrie Bradshaw and her internet talk! Despite the fact that they had a great time on her ice skating date (she smoked and drank on the ice like a rebellious young!) Carrie was not prepared for where he took her to next: a party attended by the next SATC guest star on this list...\n... Alanis! On \"Boy, Girl, Boy Girl..\" the Canadian singer played Dawn, who kisses Carrie in a game of spin the bottle. Following the experience, which \"wasn't bad, kind of like chicken,\" Carrie went home and confirmed that she was indeed  \"too old to play this game.\" Other than Carrie's giant flower brooch (which of course got an update in one of the movies), this kiss was a shining moment for the episode.\nTo give back, Charlotte volunteered to be a guide for the blind on season six. Part of her training required walking in public with a mask and a guide to experience what the blind experience. Enter: Carrie, who fails miserably as Charlotte's guide. I guess this is why you shouldn't perform these training exercises at a Barneys, especially with stellar shoe salesmen like this one, played by SJP's real-life BFF Andy Cohen, around.\nThere was no one better than Kat Dennings for the role of Jenny Brier, a bratty, lip-gloss wearing 13-year-old who asks Samantha to plan her Bat Mitzvah on season three. When Samantha hesitates, Jenny name drops Carson Daly and \"The Clintons\" (who \"of course can't make it\") before casually revealing her bank account: \"We'd be lucky if we can swing this for under a mil.\" To which Samantha responds, \"We'll never get *NSYNC.\"\nOn an episode titled \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" Samantha has a fling with Adam, a director who has well, funky spunk. When he says she's just trying to avoid blowjobs and that they're \"easy,\" Samantha, arguably the best sex-ed teacher (and life coach) on TV, launches into one of the most memorable SATC speeches: \"I love giving head. Easy? You men have no idea what we're dealing with down there. Teeth placement, jaw stress, suction, gag reflex, all the while bobbing up and down trying to breathe through our noses. Easy? Honey, they don't call it a job for nothing.\" Mic. Drop.\nOn season four, Margaret Cho played Lynne, a fashion show producer who recruits Carrie to walk in a show that features New Yorkers and models alike. “No one is more New York or has more style than you,” she says on the episode, “The Real Me.” When Carrie hesitates, Lynne delivers another convincing command: “You’re fucking doing my show. If I have to hunt you down, skin you alive, and have one of the models fucking wear you.” The only problem with this character was that there was not enough of her. Imagine her having a showdown with Samantha?\nPeggy is Cosmopolitan.com’s entertainment writer, specializing in Leonardo DiCaprio, This Is Us, and the royals.

{"title": "Spring 2024 Makeup Trends We Love from Fashion Week", "date": "2023-10-01 03:58:00", "text": "Fresh off the runway. \nIt’s the most wonderful time of the year—no, it’s not the holidays (yet); however, it is a fashion holiday: fashion month. And while you may be eyeing the celebs sitting front row or dreaming of your next outfit, the runway is the perfect place to discover what’s next in beauty. \nThis season, the crystal ball, er, runway, proved that even though we’re not masking up as frequently (rethink that: Covid cases are rising), eyes are a major focus and using color as a way of expression. Skin is in—with fresh faces and dewy skin taking priority on the runway. In fact, this season, many skincare brands, prepped models’ skin for the runway. After all, if you want great looking makeup, you must take care of its base: Your face. Brandon Maxwell leaned into a skin-focused beauty look, utilizing Noble Panacea products for a hydrated, fresh glow. \nDo you want to peek into the future to see what’s in store for 2024? Katie Jane Hughes, celebrity makeup artist and founder of KJH.brand whose clients include Hailey Bieber and Karlie Kloss as well as Kim Baker, celebrity makeup artist and founder of Glamazon Beauty divulge to ELLE.com all top Spring 2024 makeup trends, fresh off the runway!\nGraphic liner, floating eyeliner—whatever you want to call it, it’s a vibe and you will see it all Spring/Summer 2024. This graphic liner look on Paloma Elsesser at Eckhaus Latta gives a butterfly wing effect and plays up her high cheekbones. \n“I love how a graphic eye can be an accessory to your look,” shares Katie Jane Hughes in response to the Jil Sander show at Milan Fashion Week.\nCelebrity makeup artist and Lancôme Global International Makeup Artist Sheika Dailey took us to the year 3000 with this futuristic cat eye. Playing with negative space and floating lines in the inner eye, ups the sex appeal of this sultry look. “It’s editorial yet still super wearable and sexy,” says Hughes. You can read more about the look, here.\n“I predict that the Spring/Summer ’24 makeup trends are going to be all about vibrant, bold, color eyeliners,” shares Glamazon Beauty founder and celebrity makeup artist Kim Baker. Curious as to which colors? Baker says, “Eyeliner in bold over the top shades such as Periwinkle, royal blue, vibrant red, and shocking pink” will be all over the lids of trendsetters and beauty girlies next spring.\nHughes also agrees that color eyeliner is a big Spring/Summer ’24 trend. “I love how they matched the eye look to the fashion at Helmut Lang,” says Hughes. “In 2024, the vibrant color lined eye will dominate the street and our makeup bag,” adds Baker.\nDon’t have colored eyeliner? You can fake it with eyeshadow. “We saw royal blue being used at shows such as Altier Ndigo. Makeup artist T. Cooper used the shade ‘Oshun’ featured in the Supreme Being Palette by Glamazon Beauty to create a killer eye look that works for runway to real-way,” says Baker.\nFor Spring/Summer ’24, imperfection is perfection. And while we normally see this trend with the hair, this season, it’s visible with makeup in a bold, bright way. The mismatched eyeshadow seen at Chopova Lowena was a favorite for Hughes. She shares, “I think this is a really cool and fresh take on how to do eyeshadow that is unusual and out of the box.”\nAt Phillip Lim 3.1, this neon, one shadow look plays up negative space in opposite accords.\n“The look I kept seeing across the board was glowing skin. Everyone had dewy, glowing skin and I can’t think of a better feature to play up for Spring and Summer,” says Baker. At Retrofete, it was all about sexy, glowy, and hydrated skin. Elyse Reneau, Executive Director of Global Beauty at Too Faced states, “Humidity has never looked so sculpted!” \nAt Altuzurra, celebrity makeup artist Diane Kendal showcased her famous “flawless face” technique that she developed early in her career. It focuses on making skin look as radiant and perfect as possible, using minimal makeup.\nMermaidcore gets an update for Spring/Summer ’24. At Sandy Liang, rhinestones were placed haphazardly around the eyes to mimic barnacles. Into this look? You can read our full take on it, here.\nMermaidcore is more than just rhinestones and shades of blue and green. Jason Wu’s interpretation highlights healthy skin. “Inspired by Jason’s vision of experiencing rebirth after a shipwreck, we crafted a cohesive makeup look that exuded a dewy, aquatic allure,” shares Kendal, who was the Lead Makeup Artist. Wu’s Kindness For Your Lips Lip Oil was applied on the high cheekbones for a luminous glow.\nIf a sensual siren decided to attend a rave, this look is how I envision their makeup. The amalgamation of blue, green, and yellow mimics underwater coral reefs and is a festival of color for the eyes. Somewhere, somehow, I think Ariel would approve. \nDanielle James is the Digital Beauty Director of ELLE.com.

{"title": "What's the Deal with Probiotics for Women?", "date": "2023-09-30 23:46:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nCan you stop your stomach issues with a single capsule? \nWhen we think about bacteria, negative connotations often come to mind. But, not all bacteria is bad, and probiotics are the prime example of what health experts call good bacteria. “Probiotics are friendly, healthy, good-for-you bacteria that work to improve your health,” says Dr. Roshini Raj, a gastroenterologist, author, and founder of Tula Skincare. Most notably, probiotics can help to promote a healthy gut, but these essential microorganisms can also lead to clear skin, a high-performing immune system, and balanced pH levels (down there) for women. \nAs for how to ingest probiotics, it’s essential to note that they are naturally found in foods like greek yogurt, kombucha, and kimchi. However, depending on your diet, you might not consume enough probiotics on a daily basis. In that case, you might want to consider taking probiotic supplements. “When choosing a probiotic supplement, the first step is to look at the ingredients,” Dr. Raj advises. “You want powerful ingredients that are not only good for you but that will also be effective.”\nThere are an array of probiotic supplements that are formulated to target specific concerns, so the first step is to understand what exactly you need help with. For example, if you are experiencing digestive issues, the Cleveland Clinic suggests selecting a capsule that contains lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, bacillus or saccharomyces boulardii. We know these names sound extremely complicated, so it might also make sense to consult your doctor or a professional that could point you in the right direction.\nAccording to Dr. Raj, if you incorporate effective probiotic supplements into your diet, you should start to feel, and look, much healthier. “After my patients began probiotic treatments, I saw a significant improvement not only in their internal health but also in their appearance,\" says Dr. Raj. “Oftentimes their skin was calmer and clearer and I could tell they were feeling better before they had the chance to tell me.” But don’t just take Dr. Raj’s word, try it yourself! \nAhead, scroll through a list of the best probiotics to improve your overall health.  \nGarden of Life’s probiotics are crafted specifically for women  to support vaginal, digestive, and immune health.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nEager to have luscious locks? Look no further. \nThere’s nothing more upsetting than looking in the mirror and noticing sparse areas of hair on your scalp— dare we say bald spots. For those of you who have dealt with hair loss or hair thinning, you've probably gone down a rabbit hole of research, attempting to discover the best ways to restore your beloved strands. While desperately scouring the internet for answers, we're guessing that you came across a variety of hair growth shampoos and hair growth oils . And perhaps you found a thing or two about collagen.\nOn a basic level, collagen is one of the most abundant structural proteins found in the body. Composed of several types of amino acids, this powerful protein helps to promote skin elasticity, support muscular health, and encourage hair growth. “The most abundant amino acids in collagen are glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and arginine, which are crucial for maintaining the health, elasticity, and strength of skin and hair,” says Dr. Dusan Sajic, board certified dermatologist. Thus, it comes as no surprise that many of us rely on collagen supplements to foster thriving hair.  \nConsuming collagen supplements can be a great after-the-fact solution, but it should also be considered as a preventative measure, especially as we get older.  “As we age, not only do we produce less collagen, we also lose excessive collagen due to environmental stressors like UV exposure, smoke exposure, and poor health habits,” says Shannon Augustine, board certified aesthetic nurse practitioner. But fear not, because luckily, there are plenty of collagen supplements that exist— from capsules to powders, and even liquids. Ahead, we’ve curated a list of the best collagen products for hair growth and we've also consulted medical and cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Dusan Sajic as well as aesthetic nurse practicioner Shannon Augustine, who have shared everything you need to know about collagen. \nVital Proteins’ formula is packed with hydrolyzed collagen peptides that help promote hair growth in addition to encouraging nail, bone, and joint health. Simply take a scoop of this powder and mix it into your favorite drink for your daily dose of collagen. \nType: Powder \nKey Ingredients: Collagen peptides, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid\nCertified: Paleo-friendly, gluten-free, dairy-free \nAmazon Rating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I noticed my hair was growing faster. I didn't measure it, but I feel convinced that I've experienced faster hair growth.”\nAnthony’s Collagen Peptide Powder is extracted from grass fed cattle,  which makes this blend rich in protein. And despite the fact that this collagen is animal-derived, Anthony’s formula is crafted without hormones, steroids, and antibiotics. \nType: Powder  \nKey Ingredients: Collagen peptides, pure hydrolysate\nCertified: Gluten-free, non-GMO\nAmazon Rating: 4.6/5 \nWhat reviewers are saying: “I’ve used this collagen consistently for a few years. I put it in my morning coffee or smoothies. My skin looks brighter and my hair is noticeably healthier.”— Danielle James, Beauty Director, ELLE.com \nAccording to Spoiled Child’s website, users reported stronger hair simply after 6 weeks of consuming the E27 Extra Strength Liquid Collagen on a regular basis.  For the best results, it's recommended to take one to two tablespoons a day.\nType: Liquid  \nKey Ingredients: Collagen Peptides, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid\nCertified: Sugar-free, gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, non-GMO\nSpoiled Child Rating:  4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “The mango flavor adds a little sweetness and kick to my morning smoothies. I love that it has hyaluronic acid—the hero ingredient in the Hailey Beiber Erewhon smoothie. Now I can have a hydrating smoothieat home for a fraction of the price.” — Danielle James, Beauty Director, ELLE.com \nThese citrus flavored gummies are not formulated with any animal-derived ingredients, so they're perfect for those who are on a vegetarian or vegan diet.  In addition to collagen and biotin, these gummies are also infused with zinc, which is a crucial element regarding hair growth. \nType: Gummies  \nKey Ingredients: Collagen, biotin, zinc\nCertified: Vegan, cruelty-free, gluten-free\nSephora Rating: 5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I’ve tried my fair share of skin, hair and nail gummies and these are my favorite. I’ve been trying to grow out my hair after bleaching it for a year and I needed all the help I could get. The best part is they taste great!”\nIf you love the taste of pomegranate, you won’t be able to resist NeoCell’s liquid collagen blend. Formulated with vitamin C, this nourishing mixture helps to strengthen hair strands.   \nType: Liquid  \nKey Ingredients: Collagen, vitamin C\nCertified: Gluten-free\nAmazon Rating: 4.4/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I’m not losing hair like I have been for several years. So few hairs in the brush after one month of two tablespoons each night. It's thicker, as well.”\n Kourtney Kardashian is all about living a healthy lifestyle, so it comes as no surprise that she translates that same mindset into her brand, Lemme. Lemme’s biotin and collagen supplements come in the form of delicious gummies that are comprised of natural nutrients like biotin and zinc, which promote hair, skin, and nail health. \nType:  Gummies \nKey Ingredients: Grass-fed collagen peptides, biotin, vitamin C\nCertified: Non-GMO, dairy-free, gluten-free, soy-free, paraben-free\nRating: 4.1/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I started using Lemme Glow on a whim, and it’s become a must-have in my beauty routine. It's made my skin smoother, and my hair and nails look healthier than ever.”\nIf you’re always on the go, it might be helpful to pop a bottle of collagen capsules into your purse. We highly recommend  Ancient Nutrition’s Collagen Peptide Pills as they’re great for rejuvenating various parts of your body including your hair, joints, and nails. \nType:  Capsules\nKey Ingredients: Bovine collagen, ashwagandha root and leaf extract, amla berry extract \nCertified: Non-GMO, keto friendly, dairy-free, gluten-free, soy-free\nRating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “Noticed results within a couple of weeks!

It definitely helps to grow your hair and nails out quickly. Easy to use.”\nThere are various kinds of collagen, and one of the most popular types is marine collagen. Marine collagen, extracted from fish, is specifically coveted for its ability to absorb more quickly into the body in comparison to bovine or porcine collagen. If you’re interested in trying out marine collagen, consider Amandean's  Marine Collagen Peptides which supports smooth hair and skin.\nType:  Powder\nKey Ingredients: Water hydrolyzed marine collagen, lime extract, aloe vera extract\nCertified: Gluten-free, soy-free, shellfish-free, keto friendly \nAmazon Rating: 4.4/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “This collagen powder is great for hair and nail growth and joint pain. I have been taking it for 3 months and my arthritis pain is practically non existent. My hair is so thick and grows very fast.”\nFor those seeking a collagen blend packed with extra protein, look no further than Garden of Life’s Grass Fed Collagen Peptides Powder. With 18 grams of protein, this blend contributes to skin elasticity and healthy hair. \nType:  Powder\nKey Ingredients: Grass fed collagen peptides\nCertified: Gluten-free, non-GMO\nAmazon Rating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I can’t believe how much this Garden of Life collagen powder has improved my overall health. Not only does it promote healthy skin, hair, and nails, but it also provides proven joint mobility support.”\nDr. Sajic tells ELLE.com that collagen is a protein formulated with amino acids that provide structure, elasticity, and strength to both skin and hair. “Altogether around fifty-six percent or more of the amino acids in collagen are foundational for skin and hair proteins, and thus has a great ratio that will contribute directly to hair health and vitality,” Dr. Sajic explains. \nHowever, it’s essential to understand that while collagen can certainly help to solve some of your hair problems, maintaining a healthy diet is equally important. “Optimal hair health also requires a more comprehensive approach, including other proteins, vitamins, minerals, and care practices,” Dr. Sajic says. \nAlthough collagen is widely recognized for its ability to promote healthy hair and skin, this abundant protein also plays a crucial role in other bodily functions including joint health and bone health. “Collagen assists in maintaining the integrity of cartilage, which is essential for healthy joints, and it helps to maintain bone density, which is crucial for preventing age-related bone issues like osteoporosis,” Dr. Sajic explains. \nIf you’re looking to target these areas of your body, or simply interested in a supplement that provides a cohesive approach, it’s worth incorporating collagen supplements into your daily wellness routine. \nAlso to note, some collagen supplements are infused with additional nutrients that help to nourish the body. “Collagen supplements may also include vitamins like vitamin C, zinc, vitamin B, and omega-3s which further support your body and health,” Augustine says. \nSo, we’ve heard about all the wonderful benefits of collagen but are there any side effects? Dr. Sajic shares that although collagen is generally safe for most individuals, there are a few things to note. “Some may experience side effects like stomach discomfort, a bad taste or possible allergic reactions,” Dr. Sajic says. “It’s essential to choose high-quality collagen supplements and consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen,” he adds.\nTo avoid allergic reactions, or any added ingredients that might not sit well with your body, Augustine also suggests taking the time to thoroughly read the ingredient labels.  \n“You should always talk to your health care provider before taking any oral supplements or medications,” says Augustine. She also explains that consulting a healthcare professional is especially important if you are taking daily medications or have serious drug or food allergies.\nDr. Sajic shares that those with fish, pork, or bovine allergies should avoid collagen, as many collagen supplements are derived from these animal sources. “It’s also important to talk to your doctor if you have liver or kidney disease, as the excess protein may put extra stress on these organs,” he adds. \nCollagen supplements exist in many forms— including liquid, powder, and capsules— but they all have relatively equal effects. \"There are not enough non-bias studies to suggest that one is better than the other,” Augustine shares. \nAt the end of the day, it simply boils down to your personal preferences, lifestyle, and dietary restrictions. “Liquid collagen can be consumed directly or mixed into beverages, while powder can be added to smoothies, coffee, or baked goods,” Dr. Sajic says. If you would prefer not to mix collagen with your food or drink, you can always take a capsule. However, Dr. Sajic notes that depending on the capsule, it might not be absorbed as efficiently as other forms of collagen. \n“For most people, collagen should be taken once daily,” Dr. Sajic says. “Dosage can range from 2.5 to 15 grams daily, depending on the individual’s age, health, and specific skin or hair concerns.” And as with anything, patience and consistency is key, so make sure that you keep track of your collagen intake. “It may take several weeks, if not three to four months, for you to start noticing the benefits of collagen supplements,” Dr. Sajic adds.\nDr. Dusan Sajic is a board-certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist, the director of the Derma Skin Institute, and the creator of  Sajic Skin.\nShannon Augustine, NP is a is a board certified nurse practitioner and self-proclaimed expert injector at  SkinSpirit.\nAs a leading publisher of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty content, ELLE.com is committed to highlighting the best products in various categories by personally testing the latest and most innovative products, interviewing countless experts, and vetting customer-loved items.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe hair of your dreams awaits.\nIf frizz didn't exist, many of us would be happy campers. Sometimes, battling frizz can feel like a full-time job, especially when factors like humidity work against you, and buying a plethora of products to ward off frizz sometimes doesn't seem worth the trouble. Sure, the market is brimming with several quick fixes that can momentarily smooth down flyaways, like hair oils or leave-in conditioners. But odds are, if you’ve been battling frizz your whole life, you’ve heard something about keratin.\nKeratin treatments are an in-salon service that reduces frizz and adds shine to your hair; they can be pricey, and when done incorrectly, potentially damaging. However, whether you opt for a salon treatment or not, you can still get the smoothing, healing, and repairing benefits of keratin right in your shower. “If you’ve got frizzy locks and are afraid to take the leap and get a full-on keratin treatment at the salon, then a keratin shampoo is a great way to start,” says Clayton Hawkins, Los Angeles-based celebrity hairstylist who counts Olivia Rodrigo and Dove Cameron as clients. Ahead, find the 13 best keratin shampoos that can alleviate frizz.\nGetting a keratin treatment will make you feel like you're on top of the world. However, maintaining your treatment to prolong that feeling comes with work, specifically a proper at-home hair routine.

The natural extracts in the cleanser include biotin and keratin, which work in tandem to stimulate hair growth.\nSize: 8 fl. oz.Sulfate-free: Yes\nAmazon rating: 4.2/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I purchased this at the recommendation of my hairstylist, who swears by it! The shampoo doesn't foam up as much as others, but I did notice a difference in my hair thickness and strength. Will continue to use, as hair turnover takes time to really see the full impact.”\nThis keratin-infused product prevents breakage and works to repair all the signs of heat damage.

I used to have to wash my hair every day, now I can go two or three days in between washes.”\nKeranique’s keratin amino complex reaches the cortex of the hair while strengthening the hair’s surface. After continued use, your hair should appear and feel fuller, thicker, and stronger.\nSize: 8 fl. oz.Sulfate-free: Yes\nAmazon rating: 4.4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “Love this stuff! It's great for my thin hair.”\nThis Keratin Complex shampoo provides a gentle cleanse to color-treated hair.

If you already have a keratin treatment, “Keratin shampoos help protect your investment by prolonging the smoothness of the cuticle,” says Perteet.\nEven if you have un-treated hair, keratin shampoos can still help keep frizz at bay. “If you have frizzy/coarse hair texture, keratin shampoo is a great option to help smooth your hair,” says Rasmussen. “Over time it creates a coating on the hair that will help fill in the pores in your hair to make it smooth and shiny.”\nAs a leading publisher of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty content, ELLE.com is committed to highlighting the best products in various categories by personally testing the latest and most innovative products, interviewing countless experts, and vetting customer-loved items.

That said, breakage, thinning, and dryness are inevitable. \nEvery story begins the same way: You notice your hair has been breaking off more than usual and immediately log on to Amazon to secure a bottle of the best hair growth vitamins or hair growth shampoos. Thankfully, there are several additional hair care treatments that encourage growth, give limp strands more volume, and fortify hair bonds to stop further breaking.\nBecause hair loss is such a sore spot and insecurity for many, the internet is brimming with products that make lofty promises to give you the luscious, full mane of your dreams. That's why we decided to help cut through the noise to find the ones that are actually worth your coins. We pored over dozens of customer feedback to find 17 of the top-reviewed hair thickening products that will blow you away.\nScalp care is the best care for restoring your hair. Vegamour's serum contains rich antioxidants to minimize breakage and shedding that leads to excessive hair loss.\nSize: 1 fl oz \nAmazon star rating: 4.1/5\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I started with the brow serum and it worked so well that I had to try the serum for my thinning hair. I didn’t tell anyone that I was using it, but when my grandma told me that she wishes she had thick hair like mine I figured that was the best testimonial it could get, because I have never had thick hair! And I’m only 3/4 of the way through my first bottle! I’m truly grateful for this stuff!”\nTopical remedies can aid in hair restoration, but why not work directly at the source? Nutrafol's supplements are packed with a bevy of good-for-you vitamins to boost health and overall hair growth.\nSize: 120 capsules\nAmazon star rating: 4.3/5 \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I’ve used other top-of-the-line hair support products for 15 years but nothing compares to this. I’d lost almost 1/2 of my hair after covid and this made my hair grow back freaky fast and healthy! It’s super soft, shiny and thick again. I’m going to take this exclusively from now on & not bother with the others.”\nA TikTok fave, this serum from The Ordinary uses ingredients like Procapil (commonly used in hair growth products) and Baicapil to reboot hair density and increase blood flow in the scalp.\nSize: 2 oz\nSephora star rating: 3.9/5\nA Sephora reviewer said: “I got this for my mom because she started losing her hair after local radiation and her hair has never looked better! She is so happy with it and her hairline is so much fuller now.”\nInstead of massaging a sticky serum into your hair, Oribe's Serene Scalp Thickening Hair Treatment is a spray formula that addresses hair thinning and loss from the root. The treatment conditions, nourishes, and restores with just a few sprays.\nSize: 4.2 fl oz \nSephora star rating: 3.9/5\nA Sephora reviewer said: “I expected this to either make my hair greasy or frizzy. When it worked great the first time I expected it to just last one day max. Then I thought ‘I’m ok, it’ll just last from wash to wash; not be cumulative.’ But my hair was fuller even when you just washed & dried without using the spray. And my thin, fine, color treated hair loves it! If you’re thinking of trying it Definitely do! I Highly Recommend this spray!!”\nThis treatment is all about helping your hair, well, flourish. The lightweight formula restores balance and strengthens the hair from the scalp to promote regrowth.\nSize: 4 fl oz\nSephora star rating: 4.9/5\nA Sephora reviewer said: “I love this product for my thin hair! It gives some volume and it makes my hair look healthy! I use it every night, dry or wet and it doesn’t leave any grease unlike other thickening products. I also love the smell, it is light and fresh. I doesn’t irritate my scalp or make it drier. I just hope I can see changes for some hair growth, maybe if I continue to use it consistently.”\nYou've likely heard all of TikTok praise Mielle Organic's viral Rosemary Mint oil. Stimulating the scalp with a minty-fresh sensation, this oil softens and strengthens weak, brittle hair. \nSize: 2 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.6/5\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I recently lost my edges due to low iron and braiding. After bringing my blood level up, I wanted to try something to grow my hair back. Within 2 months I noticed a change in my edges. My hairline is fuller. This is a MUST buy. My edges were very thin and braiding them made it worse. But using this changed my hairline life. It leaves a soothing feeling.”\nSometimes, instant results are what you need. Nioxin's Styling Thickening Gel allows your hair to appear thicker no matter what style you choose. \nSize: 5.1 fl oz\nUlta star rating: 4.3/5\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “I've been using this product for almost 10 years, since the last time I transitioned back to natural waves. It mixes so well with curl products and other stylers, and it's good whether you leave your hair to air dry or heat style. It's so versatile and easy to use. Recommend!”\nLiving Proof makes it easy to fluff and volumize your hair instantly. This texture spray doesn't leave behind a crunchy mess and keeps the hair full of body and bounce.\nSize: 7.5 fl oz\nSephora star rating: 4.5/5\nA Sephora reviewer said: “My all-time favorite. I’m on my 4th bottle and the bottle itself lasts forever. I have bleached processed hair (balayage) and curl it practically everyday. I’ve noticed such a difference when I stopped using it bc I ran out. People notice the volume. It doesn’t weigh my hair down or make it feel like it has residue.”\nThis powerhouse product detangles, softens, and hydrates the hair, among other things. The MVP of the formula is Emblica Technology, which plumps lifeless, dull strands and brings them back to life. \nSize: 6.7 fl oz\nUlts star rating: 4.2/5\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “I have long hair down past my butt and it still gave my hair a good amount of lift and body. It is pretty darn pricey but already it works. It smells good and is easy to use. I'm going to try it again and curl my hair and see how it works with that.”\nHere's a shampoo that breaks down the gunk, oil, and dirt that threaten your hair daily to reveal refreshed, bouncy hair. Even better, it's safe for those with color, whether a bad DIY job or professionally treated. \nSize: 8.5 fl oz \nUlta star rating: 4/5\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “I have thin, flat hair, tends toward greasy. This is a great shampoo for fullness and volume. Yes, you still need to style with volumizing products if you want major lift, but this is a great everyday (or every 3 days in my case) shampoo. It is not moisturizing — it is thickening. If you want moisture, use a moisturizing shampoo.”\nTreat your scalp to a boost of caffeine, ginger root, and arginine, all working together to build resistance and strengthen to prevent further breakage or shedding. \nSize: 3.04 fl oz\nSephora rating: 3.9/5\nA Sephora reviewer said: “This product has been amazing for me. I’ve noticed a lot less shedding and my hair feels stronger. My scalp feels great. I apply it at night before bed, and I haven’t noticed too much of a crunchy feeling or residue. I daresay that my roots look thicker with new growth! I’ve been using the system with shampoo, conditioner, and the blow dry primer. I’ve always struggled with fine hair, but lately my shedding and texture has been a concern. I highly recommend this serum!”\nIf your hair needs more shine, growth, and strength, and less breakage and thinning, the antidote could be found in this Amazon best-seller. Massage this scalp serum into your hair to boost moisture (not too much or it can get really oily) and manageability. \nSize: 4 fl oz \nAmazon star rating: 4.2/5\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “So far this product is helping with my hair thinning around my face for hair loss. I have new hair growth coming up. Looking a lot better. Good product so far.”\nWhen your hair is already feeling lifeless, the last thing you need is heavy products weighing down your hair even more. Good thing this Kristin Ess spray has a lightweight formula that imparts shine and volumizes the hair, perfect for bombshell blowouts. \nSize: 8.45 fl oz \nUlta star rating: 4.1/5\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “Highly Recommend. I've used this for about 2 months now and I'm in Love. Works Great!! I will spray this in layers under my hair right before blow drying then using my diffuser high heat, low blow, pumps up my roots to give so much volume that lasts all day.”\nRestore your hair's density with this top-rated shampoo powered by biotin, rosemary, and aloe to stimulate the scalp and soften the hair.\nSize: 14 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.3/5\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I have an extremely sensitive scalp! Almost everything breaks me out. This has been a godsend. It has a pleasant scent, easy to use pump, and creates a decent amount of leather. The price is great too. I highly recommend this product for anyone that sugfers skin irritation.”\nThe key to a voluminous blowout Farrah Fawcett would be proud of is this volumizer by Color Wow. It doubles as a heat protectant, so you can apply it ahead of heat styling for big, bouncy curls. \nSize: 6.5 fl oz \nAmazon star rating: 4/5\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I was pretty skeptical but this actually does work. Pleasantly surprised. Would recommend. A bit pricey but worth the splurge.”\nGive your scalp an intense treatment that fuses peppermint, tea tree oil, and vitamin b5 to stimulate the scalp and encourage growth.  \nSize: 4.23 fl oz\nUlta star rating: 4.7/5\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “Thanks to age and medications my hair started to fall out more than normal. Thin, flat and weak looking was my new daily norm and I was devastated!! On a whim I decided to try the Intensive Spray and my hair is happy again!! After 2 weeks my hair looks full and I have a lot less breakage! It's a great option to have!”\nDefine curls, tame frizz, and add volume with just a few pumps of R+Co's Thickening Foam. This formula is made with a cocktail of vitamin E, fruit extracts, and aloe leaf for extra nourishment.\nSize: 5 oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.2/5\nWhat people are saying: “Gives so much volume to my thin curly hair. Smells delicious. I just reordered so I wouldn’t run out. I will be a lifelong customer as long as the product doesn’t change a thing.”\nNerisha is the beauty commerce editor at ELLE.com, covering all things beauty (and fashion and music).

{"title": "Our Favorite Fragrances Will Have You Smelling Like A Dream", "date": "2023-09-30 22:32:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nMeet your new signature scent. \nWhen you meet someone, your fragrance is the first thing to introduce you before words leave your mouth. What do you want your scent to say? Are you a burst of energy fueled by bright citrus and fruits? Or maybe you like to be mysterious with sultry tonka beans and woods tickling the noses of every passerby.\nA signature scent is also deeply personal; it can evoke particular memories, elicit a sense of comfort or nostalgia, and even help tell the world about your unique personality. Plus, fragrances can smell quite different on different skin types, which makes finding the best perfumes for women a personalized experience. \n“Fragrance is about the way it makes you feel,” explains Joan Tanis, national training and events director at Maison Francis Kurkjian. “Wearing a scent that works with your specific body chemistry can also enhance your mood and even change behaviors. Fragrance encourages the release of endorphins, which makes us feel good.”\nIf you’re not sure exactly where to start on your scent journey, don’t fret. We’ve scoured customer reviews and tested dozens of buzzy formulas to bring you some of the most exciting perfumes. From summer-centric lavender perfumes to mature vanilla and rich gender-fluid scents, we made it easy to uncover timeless classics or intriguingly unconventional blends—no matter your preference. And the best part? You can order a few samples to compare and contrast your favorites while still deciding, or go all-in on a full-size bottle that doubles as décor once you’ve nailed down your signature fragrance.Also worth noting: Many of these brands offer some amazing perfume gift sets, so you can treat your loved ones to the magical experience of (hopefully) finding their new go-to scents, too. \nSmells like: A sunny Italian vacation \nKey notes: Mandarin, neroli, orange blossom, jasmine, myrrh, musks \nSummer doesn’t seem too far away when you have this scent on hand. Orange Smoke smells exactly like its name—a toasty, citrus scent that's as sweet as it is smoky. \n“If I could bottle up what my vacation on the Amalfi Coast smelled like, it would be eerily similar to Orange Smoke by Dries Van Noten. The mandarin, orange blossom, and neroli notes are warmed up under the sun and deepened with musks to create a bright and warm aroma.”—Nerisha Penrose, ELLE.com beauty commerce editor\nSmells like: Salty citrus\nKey notes: Salted Lemon, pink pepper, musks\nA little bit spicy, citrusy, and woodsy all in one, this super-affordable fragrance has the depth of a much pricier top-shelf perfume. The scent leans neither too masculine nor feminine, meaning it’s one your BF might just be tempted to use, too. \n“I’ve always been a sucker for men’s cologne, but have never actually added any to my routine because I don’t want to smell like a full-on dude.  However, this Le Monde Gourmand scent strikes the perfect balance. Described by the brand as evoking the ‘comforting embrace of an oversized hoodie stolen from your crush,’ it has an effortlessly musky scent without being too rich or overpowering. It’s so good, in fact, I love to spritz it on every few hours for a fresh whiff.”— S.P.  \nSmells like: Creamy woods\nKey notes: Almond, coffee, bergamot lemon; jasmine, orange blossom, tonka bean, cacao, vanilla, sandalwood, patchouli and cedar\nStarting bright and surprising with whiffs of jasmine, this perfume soon turns dark and seductive with traces of coffee and cocoa. A must-have for any wild night in or out. \nAn Amazon reviewer says: “The bottle is what immediately caught my attention, but after I sampled it, I needed to have it. It goes very well with my natural scent; it’s warm and sweet, yet sexy. It’s perfect for everyday wear as well as special occasions.”\nSmells like: Soft, tangy florals\nKey notes: Grapefruit, rose accord\nA fruity, floral fragrance as traditionally feminine as its color, this is a non-fussy pick for day wear.\n“Of all the perfumes I’ve tried over the years, Chanel's Chance has remained a constant in my lineup. It’s lighter and more modern than the brand’s iconic N°5 scent, yet is still just as effortlessly classic and long-lasting. In fact, I’ve found it to be such a universal crowd-pleaser that even an Uber driver once asked me what I was wearing.”—S.P.\nSmells like: Marshmallows and ice cream\nKey notes: Lavender blossom, juicy pear, bergamot, coconut, vanilla orchid, woods, cashmere \nEven if your name isn’t Ari, you can still smell like the superstar with this flirty, feminine perfume. With sweet floral and fruity scents of lavender blossom, pear, coconut, and vanilla, this is a bright, young fragrance, in the best way.\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “That’s it. Steamy cotton candy. I smell like a sexy cavity. Ten out of 10.”\nSmells like: A floral boutique\nKey notes: Jasmine, rose essence, chypre accord\nWith ambassador Zendaya as its leading lady, Lancome’s Idole already has a lot going for it. But with its burst of fresh florals—rose and jasmine, in particular—this makes for a fully feminine, but never overpowering, scent.\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “Beautiful scent of flowers that lasts on your clothes and wherever you spray it on yourself for well over a day! Plus, you only need a little bit, because it most certainly goes a long way.”\nSmells like: Honeyed florals\nKey notes: Ylang ylang, Damascus rose, jasmine\nThere’s a reason you see this iconic bottle in practically every magazine you’ve ever opened. It’s a classic, and the fruity, floral ingredients never weigh down the luscious elegance of the ylang-ylang, jasmine, pear, melon, peach, and lily. \nA Sephora reviewer says: “Lovely floral scent, not too warm or heavy but still has good lasting power. Would recommended this to all ages and seems appropriate for both day and night. Gorgeous bottle.”\nSmells like: Florals deep in the woods\nKey notes: violet leaves, jasmine, vetiver.\nCreated by the brand that brought us the chicest, most enviable lingerie in the market, the perfumes by La Perla are just as desirable. This scent is citrusy enough to invoke a bold, wide-awake feeling, but countered with dark notes of neroli, too.\nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “Very beautiful, fruity violet perfume. This smells like a rich French woman. Oozes elegance, and the bottle is just oh-my-god stunning.”\nSmells like: Early summer morning by a beach\nKey notes: Bergamot, pink pepper, primofiore lemon, neroli oil\nEven if you don’t live near the coast, this effervescent summer perfume will instantly transport to warm, sandy shores with notes of bergamot, coconut milk, and aquatic-inspired transluzone. Also, what’s not to love about its striking apothecary-style bottle? \nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “Love this scent, takes me to holiday in my head in one spritz. All the best bits—sun cream, salty skin, fruity cocktails, and tropical flowers. Delicious. The scent really lasts well, too. Great for every day!”\nSmells like: Spicy amber\nKey notes: Jasmine, saffron, cedarwood, ambergris accord \nBaccarat Rouge 540 is another woodsy scent with a sweeter edge. That first whiff is sweet, then it evolves into spicy, earthy notes of jasmine, cedar, and saffron.\n“This perfume is a guaranteed conversation starter. The distinct smell either evokes the response of 'Ahh, I love 540,' amongst knowing individuals or 'What is that smell?!' to those that are about to be introduced to the reigning king of the perfume occult. It seems more genderless at first spritz, but then dries down to a sweet, woody, sexy aroma.” — Danielle James, Beauty Director, ELLE.com \nSmells like: Freshly squeeze berries over florals\nKey notes: Schisandra berry, mulberry, lily of the valley, plum blossom, honeysuckle, white amber, sandalwood, musk\nDrawing inspiration from the Korean word songari, which means an array of flowers or fruit on a single stem, this enticing fragrance is at once familiar and unexpected. Top notes of mulberry and Korea-native Schisandra berry open up to plum blossom and honeysuckle, followed by subtly grounding base notes of amber and sandalwood.\n“Elorea’s genderless perfumes are quickly becoming some of my new favorites. The burgeoning K-beauty brand looks to nature and its founders’ shared heritage to create some undeniably divine scents, like the soft yet not overly sweet Inflorescence. If you’re unsure which Elorea perfumes will best suit you, I also love that the label offers a discovery set, which comes with a voucher of equal value that can be applied to any purchase of a full-sized scent.”—Sam Peters, ELLE.com contributor\nSmells like: Sugary florals\nKey notes: Cattleya orchid, freesia, centifolia rose\nIt’s all in the name, folks: This perfume is like spritzing on the feeling of a sunset soirée in a romantic palace garden. With orchid, patchouli, tea leaf, jasmine and rose, wearing Flowerbomb is the next best thing to carrying a bouquet wherever you go.\nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “Flowerbomb, in my opinion, has to be the most beautiful and comforting fragrance ever created. Sweet-soft-romantic-powdery. It’s heaven in a bottle.”\nSmells like: Spicy florals\nKey notes: Black Coffee, white flowers, vanilla\nFor those who crave a little danger in their dress-up, this sexy concoction smelling of coffee, vanilla, and pear is a feast for the senses. A little smooth, a little edgy, this is a fantastic fragrance for evening wear.\nA Sephora reviewer says: “One of my favorite scents. Very mature but not like an old lady scent. It’s sophisticated and warm. I wear this year-round but suggest wearing it in the winter.”\nSmells like: Fancy flowers\nKey notes: Calypso orchid, mandarin, Bulgarian rose, almond milk, ylang ylang, iris, white musks, sandalwood\nBuckle up tight because this fragrance takes you on a ride. The yin-yang scent composition unfurls a delicate composition of sensual citrus and florals, then comes the dip: warm almond milk, sandalwood, and white musk.\n“As someone with over 100 fragrances, my signature scent changes daily. However, I almost always begin most of my scent layers with Yin Transformation, which bursts with creamy florals that feel like a balmy spring morning.” — NP\nSmells like: Spices and woods\nKey notes: Davana, tonka beans, coffee, labdanum, agarwood, sandalwood\nAnother fragrance that owes its influences to a city—in this case, bustling Mumbai—this perfume contains notes of davana, tonka bean, coffee, and sandalwood, to name a few. It’s a rich and slightly spicy perfume that’s perfect for the chilly winter months ahead.\nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “I generally find Byredo’s combinations to be impressive, unusual, and long-lasting. Mumbai Noise is no exception—it has terrific staying power. I love the woody and spicy notes, but it’s not too dark or heavy. The davana definitely lifts the blend! This is up there with my favorite, Bal d’Afrique!”\nSmells like: Dark, powdery fruits \nKey notes: blackcurrant, musk blonde wood\nA classic in the Armani collection, Sì is the ideal bottle for anyone pining for an earthy scent that doesn’t smell like, well, earth. With rose and freesia mellowing out this seductive fragrance, it’s a great transition perfume from day to evening.\n“When I heard rumors that this was Rihanna's original 'signature scent,' I had to try it. And now I see exactly why everyone says she smells so good. This perfume is the perfect scent to take you from summer into autumn.” — Danielle James \nSmells like: Luxurious after-shave\nKey notes: Peppermint, geranium, patchouli\nFor a slightly more masculine, aftershave-inspired perfume, this minty fragrance is fresh and delightful. Along with mint, it has notes of geranium and patchouli for a complicated but delectable fragrance. \nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “Praise for this scent with not a single flower petal in sight. It makes me think of a classy wizard who relishes a good gin. It’s mystic and unusual, and I’m here for it.”\nSmells like: Fresh-out-of-water peonies\nKey notes: Black pepper, raspberry accord, peony accord, geranium, freesia accord, Turkish rose, patchouli, musk\nIf all you want for your birthday is a bushel of peonies, this perfume should be a runner-up. It’s a beautiful floral fragrance with notes of raspberry, geranium, Turkish rose, and peony. Basically a wearable bouquet.\nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “This is a lovely perfume with so many enticing scents–uplifting citrus, woodiness, and unusual florals. I found this to be really lovely, with good staying power.”\nSmells like: First bloom of spring flowers\nKey notes: Bergamot, lychee, peach, jasmine, peony, orange blossom, moss, musk\nThis luxurious and fruity perfume is like summer in a bottle. Featuring unique traces of lychee, peony, orange blossom, and peach, with a little musk mixed in for good measure, this is like a well-made cocktail—worth the extra cost. \nA Saks Fifth Avenue reviewer says: “As a perfume hoarder, I can say that I have nothing like it in my collection, and it smells amazing! It’s a citrusy floral that settles in very beautifully.”\nSmells like: Peppery florals\nKey notes: Pink pepper, iris, ambrette\nThe whole point of this perfume is that it smells like the best version of you. That is, a you that showers with expensive body wash, and that inspires people to come up to you gushing, “What are you wearing?” It contains bright notes of pink pepper, warm amber, and a hint of fresh iris.\nA Glossier reviewer says: “I agree, it is a slightly more mature scent, but it’s such an elegant soft smell that I even put it on before bed and after showering. Definitely my new go-to. :) A few of my friends have bought it after smelling it on me at work. It’s such a unique but familiar scent at the same time. I love, love, love this perfume.”\nLauren Puckett-Pope is a staff culture writer at ELLE, where she primarily covers film, television and books.

{"title": "The Best Looks From Paris Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2024", "date": "2023-09-30 16:36:00", "text": "The fashion month calendar culminates in the City of Lights.\nA pioneer in sustainable fashion, Stella McCartney transported her guests to Stella’s Sustainable Market to showcase her spring 2024 collection. Among the 21 stalls at the Marché Saxe-Brutueil, guests could see up-close the responsible fabrics featured in the collection, which was made using 95 percent conscious materials. Drawing inspiration from her own closet as well as her father’s, the designer created a collection that resulted in tailored suits paired with ruffled tuxedo shirts, hand-crocheted dresses featuring mirrored discs (which were made using a seaweed-based yarn), and the new Frayme bag, which was crafted using an alternative leather made of grape byproduct from Veuve Clicquot’s harvest. It’s innovative, sustainable, and incredibly chic—but what else could you expect from McCartney?—Dale Arden Chong, senior fashion commerce editor\nCoperni may be known for bringing technology to the runway—be it in the form of robot dogs or spray-on dresses. This time, however, the tech was less about what you see and more about what you hear, as the label explored the realm of sound for its latest collection. One model donned a leather jacket studded with speakers, while others wore AI pins made in partnership with Humane. Of course, one cannot ignore the most Instagrammable moment from the show: the Discman Swipe bags, which are sure to be a must-have item come spring.—Dale Arden Chong, senior fashion commerce editor\nWednesday Addams would love Alessandra Rich’s spring/summer 2024 collection. With a color palette of mostly black and some silver, white, and blush tones thrown in, Rich proves that you don’t have to wear pastels as soon as Daylight Savings comes around. Silky bloomers, polka dots, and balloon sleeves are staples of the brand, but there’s an extra darkness to this collection that gives it an edge. It’s almost haunted in a way, or something you might find on the chicest ghost ever. High-shine black fabrics look like lacquer, which are mixed with lace and sheer fabric or thigh-high stay-ups. Some looks are tailored and structured. Some looks have ruffles and tweed while others have leather and velvet. It’s an elevated darkness, both sexy and demur, both businesswoman and vintage Barbie. The woman who wears this collection knows the power of her femininity, but also of her own mystery.—Madison Rexroat, fashion & accessories assistant\nInspired by the English countryside, her own dance history, and the coinciding launch of her eponymous fragrance line, Victoria Beckham’s spring/summer 2024 collection showed an elegant balance of feminine and masculine dressing. Blazers over knee-length shorts, styled with brogues and knee-high socks, paid homage to country sport culture, while sheer and silk gowns with stitched-on bosoms cascaded down the runway. Knit bodysuits with oversized sweaters—or sweaters with plunging wire necklines—added a sense of leisure to the collection. Edges of shorts and dresses were scalloped and field jackets were styled sans (visible) pants with just the slightest cinch at the waist—after all, femininity isn’t exclusively held to lace and bows all the time. The collection was trendy in a way that still felt luxurious. Different looks could easily work as staples or statement pieces and stand the test of time, because despite fitting in with today’s vision of fashion, most pieces are subtle twists on traditional practicality, which is as about as English as anything.—Madison Rexroat, fashion & accessories assistant\nHaving spent nearly a century immersed in the couture realm, Schiaparelli’s foray into the “real world” of fashion naturally sparked some skepticism. However, for the maison’s second-ever ready-to-wear collection, designer Daniel Roseberry defied expectations, seamlessly channeling the brand’s eccentric, surrealist DNA into a markedly wearable assortment of looks. Familiar, everyday garments were reinterpreted through Elsa Schiaparelli’s whimsical lens, materializing in a swath of exaggerated volumes, oddball embellishments, and collars that billowed around models’ necks like tulip petals. And of course, in true Schiaparelli fashion, the accessories were the centerpieces. Among oversized gold cuffs and sunglasses with their own sets of eyelashes, the pièce de résistance was a giant lobster necklace, nodding to Elsa’s iconic 1937 collaboration with Salvador Dalí. In this beautiful marriage of the ready-to-wear and couture worlds, Roseberry raised the question: must we always keep these two spheres separate? — Elena Plumb, freelance fashion assistant\nWith her spring/summer 2024 collection, Isabel Marant proved that just because the season is (apparently) all about lightness, it doesn’t mean you can’t have a dark side, too. Romantic embroidered sheer dresses and oversized jackets brought the bohemian sensibility true to Marant’s brand, while slouchy tweed-like sweaters were styled with leather hot pants, a trend we’ve seen from more than one brand for next season. Low-rise trousers, cargos, and even boiler suits displayed another trend for the season, while flouncy printed dresses and catsuits with cutouts made the collection all Marant’s own. There were paillette skirts and dresses and embroidered two-tone denim, floor length cargo jackets and draped leather dresses. It’s a collection for travelers and partygoers, just as much as it is for homebodies and daydreamers.—Madison Rexroat, fashion & accessories assistant\nIt was the final curtain of Gabriela Hearst’s formative tenure at Chloé, and boy did she deliver. Her farewell collection exuded all of the elegance, confidence, and femininity that define the iconic French house, but also stayed true to the aesthetics and values that distinguish her as a designer. Her championship of sustainability was subtly referenced through a botanical theme, which translated into bunches of ruffles unfurling like vines and draped chiffon panels stemming from models’ chests like flowers in bloom. And with an almost entirely black and white palette, punctuated by occasional bursts of yellow, coral, and silver, the focus remained on the inventive, yet wearable silhouettes that Hearst has come to master. Instead of bidding a tearful adieu, she danced off the runway alongside one of Brazil’s premiere samba schools, showing her audience that this was not a moment to mourn—it was a moment to celebrate the indelible mark she left on the brand.—Elena Plumb, freelance fashion assistant \nThe Best Looks From Milan Fashion Week SS24\nAll the Best Looks From London Fashion Week SS24\nWilly Chavarria Brings Sex Appeal to NYC\nBruceGlen Brought Body Positivity to NYFW\nThe Best Looks From New York Fashion Week SS24\nBrandon Maxwell Presents Dynamic Minimalism\nGabriela Hearst Designs for Chic Women\nTory Burch Hosted Her Own Night at the Museum \nCollina Strada Was an End-Of-Summer Night’s Dream\nI Went to the Kate Spade Show With Ease (Sort Of)\nRalph Lauren Brought His Home to NYFW\nAll The Best Fall/Winter 2023 Couture Looks \nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "The 25 Best Ulta Products ELLE Editors Are Obsessed With", "date": "2023-09-30 01:19:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nFrom a lash-boosting mascara to ultra-hydrating moisturizer.\nWalking into an Ulta store or browsing its online catalogs makes me feel like a kid in a candy store. With thousands of makeup, skincare, haircare, and fragrance products, the popular beauty retailer nearly always has what I’m looking for—plus a few extra impulse purchases I can’t resist adding to my cart. \nAnd while some may think of Ulta as Sephora’s less sophisticated younger sister, don’t be fooled. Alongside its wide selection of budget-friendly and drugstore favorites (hello to this TikTok-viral Maybelline mascara!), they also carry hundreds of luxury beauty products from coveted labels like Pat McGrath Labs, Chanel, Lancome, and Dior. Moral of the story: Whether you’re looking to save a few dollars as student loan payments return or are in the mood to do some major retail therapy, Ulta is the one-stop shop to satisfy any beauty lover’s cravings.\nAnother perk I’d like to mention is that Ulta has a fantastic loyalty program. Similar to Sephora’s program, you can earn points for every dollar you spend and get exclusive gifts and discounts depending on your membership tier. However, Ulta offers some additional benefits like two times the points during your birthday month; your points go a bit farther here (500 points can be redeemed for $17.50, while at Sephora, 500 points get you $10 off.) Although you do have to spend at least $25 to get free shipping at Ulta, depending on your membership level, it’s not that hard to qualify for, given the sheer abundance of goodies you’ll likely want to stock up on.\nI could easily wax poetic about Ulta, but let’s go shopping, shall we? Ahead, I’ve shared a few of my beauty staples and tapped discerning ELLE editors for their must-have finds available at Ulta. Add these gems to your lineup, we promise you won’t regret it.\n“As a serial lipstick dater, I have a hard time committing to just one formula. Urban Decay’s Vice Lip Bond has me recently testing out the whole monogamy thing because quite frankly, this product is incredible. The shade range is the stuff of my vibrant dreams (looking at you, Solo Player!), and one swipe can hold up for a jam-packed day.” —Bianca Rodriguez, Fashion & Luxury Commerce Manager \n“I can’t count the amount of sunscreens I’ve tested over the years, but of all of them, this one is unbeatable. Not only does it effectively protect my skin from UVA/UVB rays, but the formula is also unmatched. It never leaves a white cast, creamily blends into the skin, and best of all, is non-comedogenic, so it never causes a breakout.”—Tatjana Freund, Fashion & Luxury Commerce Editor\n“I have lots of hair, but the strands are soft and fine. Too much product and it can really weigh down my 4B/4C curls. This curl cream not only smells divine, but is also lightweight and defines my curls. I have low porosity hair. However, with this curl cream, I don’t have to work too hard to get my hair to absorb the product. Highly recommend for my low-porosity sisters!”—Danielle James, ELLE.com Digital Beauty Director\n“You can never have too much blush. However, this pigmented duo palette from Juvia’s Place delivers insane color payoff with just one swipe. The duo comes with a light and deep shade of blush so you can layer each on top of one other or give them their own time to shine.”—Nerisha Penrose, ELLE.com Beauty Commerce Editor\n“I will give you one little truth of the beauty industry: When it comes to mascara, drugstore ones are just as good as luxury ones. I know this, yet when I saw my friend Claire with the kind of long, fluttery eyelashes you only see on babies or straight men who don’t need them, I thought the answer had to be a luxury brand. It was this—and when I tried it for myself, I understood why. My lashes are fine and point straight down, but this made them longer, fuller, and thicker in just a few coats.”—Kathleen Hou, ELLE Beauty Director\nMy combo skin is an annoying amalgam of contradictions—shine here, flaky patches there!—but Fresh’s deep hydration cream has become my go-to moisturizer for a fix-all remedy. My skin instantly soaks up this rich formula, yet isn’t left feeling greasy or sticky in the slightest. I love that it not only provides long-lasting hydration with a blend of hyaluronic acids, but also soothes redness from my uncouth prodding via rose extract. And to top it all off, it smells like an actual floral bouquet.\n“Meeting Donni Davy, Euphoria’s lead makeup artist, and her line of cosmetics last year quite possibly changed me. Half Magic’s hues pack a punch, and this eye paint and eyeliner combo product is no different. I’ll opt for this weekly in place of my good ol’ black eyeliner when I want a pop of color. The results always make me smile.”—BR\n“T3’s Airebrush Duo was my go-to for quickly transforming my curls into a sleek blowout. However, this newer version is the only tool that’s good enough to make me set it down for the first time in three years. The larger, oval-shaped barrel still adds volume to the hair, but it allows me to cut down my styling time.”—TF\n“Founder Alicia Yoon grew up with eczema and has spent years explaining what a ‘skin barrier’ was before I even knew it was a thing. For my friends with hypersensitive skin and who definitely can’t use a retinol but still want something effective, I always suggest a Peach & Lily product—specifically this serum. I’ve been through at least three of these serums because it is a steady product that helps to consistently brighten skin and moisturize.”—KH\n“The amount of Thigh Rescue’s I own is frankly borderline embarrassing. Yet, if a product is going to grant world peace—a.k.a. no irritating chafing for my thighs in hot humid months—why wouldn’t I keep this in every handbag I own?”—BR\n“Of all of Chanel’s products, this multi-use stick is criminally underrated and by far my favorite. I use the shade 'Transparent' to add a natural-looking dewy highlight at the top of my cheeks. For an even bolder look, you can layer on a powder highlighter for a budge-proof gleam. If you prefer even more glow, the pinkier shades work great as blush.”—TF\n“My primer aversion was reversed after just one use of the E.L.F Cosmetics Power Grip Primer. This bestseller and TikTok-favorite keeps my makeup stuck for hours. My trick is to use this primer when I’m wearing matte products to impart a natural, healthy shine, as matte formulas can make me look powdery and flat.”—NP\nEllis Brooklyn’s Salt Eau de Parfum reminds me that summer isn’t just a season, it’s a mentality. This warm, slightly floral, slightly salty scent is like nostalgia in a bottle for me when NYC winters turn frightening.\n“Do I need another palette? No. Did I buy this with my own money? Absolutely. The palette contains a universal highlighter and four shimmery eyeshadows that together look like the top of an ancient statue. The green shadow is my go-to shade, and the highlighter and eyeshadows are buildable. I bought it as a collector’s item, but I’ll need to purchase another one because I’ve been using the palette so frequently!”—DJ\n“I have scraped jars of Hanahana beauty with my fingernails, wiping every crevice clean like a dog trying to get every bit of peanut butter out of a jar. I generally find moisturizing my body a chore, but when this sits on my vanity, I suddenly find myself very motivated. It combines the scent of a calm-inducing lavender and the rich, but not greasy touch of this shea butter. When I’ve coated my whole body in this, I feel like a shiny, slippery, well-moisturized dolphin.”—KH\n“For my unruly brows, nothing works as effectively as the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow gel. As far as basics go, this one will never leave my side. It completely tames my brow hairs, even in horrible New York humidity. I can’t tell you how many tubes I’ve gone through.\"—TF\n“Not to be dramatic, but I truly believe every New Yorker (or just general over-populated city-goer) needs this serum in their welcome bag. The key is in the kombucha, which provides serious protection against harsh climates all day. The difference in my skin compared to some friends who haven’t made the switch is quite noticeable (but let’s keep that secret between us).” —BR\n“All I’ve wanted to do recently is put glitter on my eyelids with the enthusiasm of a kindergartener discovering shiny objects for the first time. This ‘glitter puck’ makes my eyes gleam like they’ve been lightly dusted with fairy dust. Donni Davy is a glitter connoisseur and always coming up with a new shade or shape of glitter that I haven’t seen before.” —KH\n“There’s been a lot of hype on the Internet about the Dream Coat Supernatural Spray, and I’m here to confirm it. I never thought a single hair product could make such a difference in my blowout routine. Not only does it dramatically cut down on styling time, but it also keeps humidity at bay so that I can style less throughout the week. Even on my curly, dry hair, a blowout with this spray gives me a sleek, shiny look that lasts.”—TF\n“One of the best tube mascaras on the market! I often have trouble with product settling underneath my eyes (I have long bottom lashes). The wand allows me to paint them perfectly with minimal mess.”—DJ\nSam Peters is a Senior Commerce Editor at Hearst covering fashion, beauty and lifestyle.

{"title": "10 Biotin Shampoos For Fuller, Voluminous Hair", "date": "2023-09-29 21:38:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nDo biotin shampoos really work? A dermatologist weighs in.  \nNot all of us have the luck of being born with Cindy Crawford’s luscious locks. Most of us must work harder to achieve the voluminous hair we dream of. Of course, an easy fix may be to “just get extensions,” but it’s not as simple as it seems. Extensions often weigh down your scalp and, even worse, cause permanent hair damage. Here's where biotin shampoos come in. \n“Biotin is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin (vitamin B7) that has important roles in cellular metabolism and signaling,” New York-based board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Tiffany Libby, tells ELLE.com. Simply put, biotin has long been touted for its hair-strengthening properties. “It is used in biotin shampoos as it is believed to strengthen hair follicles and increase scalp circulation and hair density. While there is limited clinical data that points to the use of oral or topical biotin for promoting hair and nail growth in healthy patients, some patients find it helpful in helping to thicken and strengthen hair,” she explains. \nThe shower is where your hair gets all the attention it’s craving. If you are someone who has been bleaching and coloring your hair since the beginning of time, your hair probably needs some extra TLC. For biotin shampoo to give you the results you desire, you must keep an eye out for some key ingredients that support your hair in every way, such as vitamins and natural oils—both promoting hair growth. Luckily, we polled experts and perused dozens of customer reviews to find the eight best biotin shampoos to start your hair care journey.  \nPutting your trust in shampoo when experiencing hair loss is quite the gamble. Honeydew’s Biotin Shampoo is one that won’t let you down. This Amazon bestseller features natural oils, including coconut oil, as well as vitamins, biotin, and keratin that thoroughly cleanse the scalp to create a clean slate for new growth to sprout. \nSize: 8 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.4/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “This product saved my long hair. I started using it after I experienced some hair loss. After using it the first time, my hair stopped falling out. I will continue to use this shampoo and conditioner. I highly recommend for people losing their hair.”\nIn this shampoo, biotin is supported by vitamin B3 and pea spout extract to enrich the hair and scalp with nutrients and encourage blood circulation for growth.\nSize: 8 fl oz\nWalmart rating: 4.6/5 stars\n“I’ve been using this shampoo (and the conditioner) for about six weeks. I have curly hair and haven’t gotten a trim, so I don’t know if my hair has grown. However, I have noticed less hair falling out when I wash and brush my tresses. I don’t love how my strands feel after I use just the shampoo—it feels slightly rubbery; however, after using the corresponding conditioner, my hair returns to its soft state.”—Danielle James, Beauty Director ELLE.com \nMielle Organic’s Rosemary Mint Oil isn’t the only product in the line that deserves the hype. Before you even get to the oil step, the Rosemary Mint Shampoo is a godsend for those looking to repair breakage-prone and brittle hair over time. It is a slow-burner, so don’t expect immediate results, but rest assured your hair is in good hands. \nSize: 12 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.6/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I have been using this product for years and have always thought it has helped my hair tremendously. The scent is amazing. I pair this shampoo with the hair mask and it truly does wonders!!! For reference, I have 3B curly hair.”\nNutrafol Root Purifier Shampoo is made for anyone looking to strengthen their locks in just a matter of two weeks. It is formulated to clean hair from the root, without causing damage and stripping the scalp of its natural oils. The main ingredient, Vegan protein, is used to replenish moisture and build the nutrients you need for hair growth.\nSize: 8.1 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.3/5 stars\n\"Because of my zig zag hair pattern, breakage can happen frequently with my hair. I started using Nutrafol to strengthen my hair strands in hopes of less shedding and more length retention. I've used it for  four months now, about 3 times a month and I actually see a difference. The only reason I'm not using it more frequently is because I'm always testing other products. Nevertheless, it has a prime spot in my coveted shower caddy.\"Danielle James, Beauty Director ELLE.com\nThis R+Co shampoo is focused on nourishment as much as it encourages growth. Your hair is coated in a rich formula that includes coconut oil, vitamin b5, and biotin, which imparts a healthy shine and fluffy bounce.\nSize: 8.5 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.4/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “Probably my favorite shampoo of all time ever. I have fine, straight hair, and this shampoo gives my hair life and bounce. It’s magical!!!!”\nWith over 7,000 ratings, this Amazon bestseller has built a community of fans for the enviable results it offers. Biotin and collagen are the MVPs of this composition for strengthening and boosting the hair’s health. \nSize: 13 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.6/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I’ve definitely seen a positive change in my hair growth after using this shampoo for just a couple of weeks! No more chunks of hair falling out anymore, thankfully. Definitely recommend.”\nGorgeous results aside, color or chemical treatments aren’t always our best friends. However, if your hair struggles to find its strength, this Pureology shampoo is the best friend you never knew you needed. Found in this mix is keravis, a powerful compound used to fortify every strand to prevent further breakage or damage. \nSize: 9 fl oz \nAmazon star rating: 4.7/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “This may be the best hair product out there. I’ve tried many, both cheap and expensive. This one is expensive, but if you value your hair and can afford it, try this out. It’s great.”\nGRO Revitalizing Shampoo can transform your hair from dullness to shine. The product is used to minimize shedding and increase the appearance of density. It is safe for everyday use to give your hair the body it desires.\nSize: 8 fl oz\nVegamour star rating: 4.7/5 starsA Vegamour reviewer said: “This may be the best hair product out there. I’ve tried many, both cheap and expensive. This one is expensive, but if you value your hair and can afford it, try this out. It’s great.”\nIf you need a holy grail staple in your beauty cabinet, the Ouai Fine Hair Shampoo should be one of them. This color-safe shampoo makes your four or five-day-old hair feel clean while providing hydration to your curls and coils. The main ingredient, Chia Seed Oil, helps increase the appearance of thickness and volume. The Ouai Fine Hair Shampoo pretty much does it all.\nSize: 10 fl oz\nSephora star rating: 4.7/5 starsA Sephora reviewer said: “I’ve tried almost all of the top shampoo/conditioners that Sephora offers and this has by far been the best for my fine hair! I’ve gotten so many compliments on how healthy my hair looks since I started using it. Beautiful scent and formula. Holy grail for sure!!”\nDry, brittle hair is no challenge for L’oreal’s Inforcer shampoo. This shampoo cleanses the hair without stripping it of the nutrients it needs to remain defensive against external threats and contains biotin and vitamins to stimulate growth.\nSize: 16.9 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.5/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “Best price for the quality and less than a salon markup for daily shampoo.”\nUsing biotin shampoo alone isn’t nearly as effective as having a full-fledged, biotin-rich routine. “Some patients have reported hair growth and stronger hair, along with reduced hair loss, but shampoos as a delivery method for ingredients may not be ideal as they are lathered onto the scalp and hair, and rinsed off shortly afterward,” Dr. Tiffany Libby explains. After shampoo and conditioning, Dr. Libby advises using other topical biotin products elsewhere in your routine. Enter: hair serums.\n“If there is interest in using topical biotin, I would recommend a leave-on daily treatment, like SpoiledChild A22 Biotin Boost Hair + Scalp Serum, formulated with rosemary oil, caffeine, and niacinamide, and has demonstrated hair growth benefits. It is an elegant, lightweight formulation in an easy-to-use spray that is fast-absorbing and residue-free, and does not weigh hair down while it is working on the scalp,” she explains. \n“You can use a biotin shampoo as often as you need to shampoo your hair,” Dr. Libby says.\nWhile biotin has been known for encouraging growth, Dr. Libby advises looking for products that contain “other ingredients that help cleanse the scalp and remove residue, and ingredients that support hair growth like caffeine and rosemary oil, and prevent hair loss like saw palmetto extract,” she says.\nDr. Tiffany Libby, NYC-based double board-certified dermatologist who specializes in cosmetic and laser dermatology\nNerisha Penrose is the Beauty Commerce Editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "The 13 Best Root Touch-Ups to Buy You Time Between Salon Visits", "date": "2023-09-29 20:38:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nFor every hair type, texture, and color. \nHair color trends come and go–red hair is particularly hot right now–but even when grown-in roots are trending (as they currently are), there’s still a camp that wants their hair to remain one shade. As a fake blonde with dark roots, I get it. As I approach the two-month mark after a blonde-ing sesh and my brunette base starts to creep down my strands, it’s all I can see when I look in the mirror. But going to the salon every eight weeks just isn’t in the cards for me. That’s where the best root touch-up products come in. \nIf you don’t have a balayage dye job or something similar that’s meant to be root-heavy, “A root touch-up product is a good way to help your color last longer in between salon visits,” explains Samantha Denis, a former hair colorist and founder of haircare brand, allyoos. “You’d use a root touch-up product when you're not quite ready to see your colorist, but your roots are starting to show and you start noticing a line of demarcation.” Beyond covering grays or other root growth, root touch-ups can also be used to play around with your hair color in a quick, temporary way in lieu of going for a major color change or daring chop. Say, you have natural blonde hair but want to try the smudge-y root trend without actually dyeing it, simply use a root touch-up in a darker shade to achieve the look. \nWhatever your reason for using a root touch-up might be, there’s a product for you. I’ve rounded up some of my personal favorites, along with top-reviewed products. Pro colorists Denis and balayage expert Abby Haliti also weighed in to share their thoughts on these 13 root touch-ups.  From brush-on powders and crayons to sprays and even temporary dyes, here, find the formula that will best suit your hair needs.\nLooking for a more permanent option that you don’t have to worry about rinsing or sweating away? “This option offers a higher level of saturation, resulting in a deeper and more comprehensive coverage,” says Haliti. “Additionally, it features a more liquid base and lower levels of ammonia, making it an ideal choice for those seeking even greater depth of color.” Available in 15 shades, this DIY coloring kit has everything you need to cover your roots in as little as ten minutes and will last you several weeks. We especially love the mess-free brush for an easy application. \nAmazon rating: 4.4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I’ve never done my own hair. I had no time to get it done before a big trip overseas; I used one box of this before leaving and it worked perfectly. I was shocked at my own ability to ‘erase’ the grays and not spoil my natural hair color around it. During the trip, I repeated with less fear and perfect again. Please use this if you can’t get to your salon. I promise it works.”\nFor a waterproof option that's “a quick and easy solution for covering up hair,” according to Haliti, try Tarte’s Dab & Go Hair Concealer. The cream-to-powder formula is easy to apply thanks to its sponge applicator that allows you to dab and go as the name implies. Similar to the brand’s face makeup products, this formula is made with Amazonian clay for seamless blending. It also taps scalp and hair-loving oils including argan, grapeseed, and castor for moisturizing benefits. All you have to do is press the applicator into the lid to dispense concealer, then dab the formula onto your roots or areas of thinning for buildable coverage.\nTarte rating: 4.3/5 stars\nA Tarte reviewer says: “Extremely handy product! Now I have no stress due to breaking through gray hair or lack of density at the temples. Very convenient to use! The release form is beyond praise.”\nIf you’re traveling or going to an event where you’re worried that you may need a root touch-up on the go, this is the product for you. “This has a really nice, velvety formula that is easy to apply, spread, and smudge into your root area,” says Denis. “It’ll almost feel like you’re using makeup on your hair. They have great coverage and wash out well, which is important because you don’t want to block your real root touch-up from penetrating when you finally do head back to the salon.” Note: there are only two shades to choose from as they're mostly intended for blending and covering grays. \nSephora rating: 3.8/5 stars\nA Sephora reviewer says: “This product is great for a quick fix... especially when I need to tie my hair up. It stays on well and doesn't come off in my hands if I touch my hair.”\nIf you’ve ever DIYed a dye job, you know that it can get messy. You might expect the same out of a root cover-up product, and while some of them might not be the neatest to apply, that’s not the case with this targeted mist. “The spray-on application of this product makes it incredibly easy to use, allowing you to quickly and accurately apply it to your desired area,” says Haliti. It also comes in nine different shades to effectively blend in with a range of hair colors.\nTarget rating: 4/5 stars\nA Target reviewer says: “I absolutely love this product. The coverage is amazing with such a light coat. The color blend is perfect. It last all day. I wish these products were less transferable, but it’s way better than other brands I’ve tried. This is my new must have.”\nEssentially like an eye shadow, but for your hair, root touch-up powders are a staple in most hair stylists’ kits—and not just because they have a lot of clients who color their manes. Although this powder is great for covering grays, it can also be used directly on your scalp in your part, at your temples, or in other areas of sparseness as a hack to help your hair appear thicker and fuller. With the accompanying brush, it’s easier to apply exactly where you want it, rather than using a messy aerosol. You could also apply it with your fingers if you were really in a pinch. \nSephora rating: 4/5 stars\nA Sephora reviewer says: “This product is amazing, it covers my gray hair a lot and is perfect for a touch-up. The best thing is I don’t have to color my hair every three to four weeks to cover my grays.”\nEfficient, yes. Effective, yes. Pricey, also yes–you need to purchase the spray gun in order to dispense the formula and each refillable pod will cost you $39. But if you’re a makeup lover, you can use this airbrush system for a number of other things from foundation and blush to body makeup– which is why I own the airbrush gun and just had to purchase the root touch-up pod. Thankfully, the pods are full of more concentrated liquid and the gun dispenses it into a fine mist, so you don’t need to use too much product at a time. In fact, each pod can last up to 120 uses, so if you’re going to be using this kit a lot, it’s a more justifiable purchase. My favorite part is the root touch-up doesn’t weigh hair down, leave it looking matte or greasy, nor leave it feeling sticky or gunked up. There are eight shades to choose from, even a pure white and gray hue should you want to amp up your platinum or lightened color.  \nTEMPTU rating: 4.5/5 stars\nA TEMPTU reviewer says: “This root touch-up stays on for days when I skip washing. It’s nice because I don’t have to apply hair spray. It washes out with the next wash and I start over. I am able to extend my salon color treatment from every four weeks to every seven or eight weeks because 0f this product.”\nI have a love-hate relationship with my blonde hair. I swore I would never go all the way to the root with my highlights because my hair grows way too fast (a good thing, I know!), but alas, I have gone blonder and blonder. Now that my highlights start closer to the scalp, root growth is a real problem for me. But this little brush-on product is my permanent solution. Formulated by celebrity colorist Justin Anderson, the heat-activated product is packed with hydrogen peroxide, lemon juice, and purple pigments to lighten and brighten for a fresh blonde effect when I need it. I simply apply it to areas that need a little boost, then blow dry to activate the formula. \nUlta rating: 3.3/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer says: “I’m shocked this works so well. I’ve had natural light blonde hair for 41 years, then it started fading. My roots were getting a little darker, a little gray/silver. I want my blonde hair, but I’m not willing to go to the salon every six weeks to keep it up. This product is AMAZING! I brush it into my wet hair, blow dry, and instant highlights. I’m a huge fan.”\nSimilar to the brand’s other styling products, the R+Co Bright Shadows Root Touch-Up spray has a lovely uplifting scent called Rosy Eyed, which is comprised of bergamot, wild fig, and tonka beans. It comes in seven shades and feels more like a styling product than a root touch-up. Plus, it’s pretty enough to display on your vanity. Furthermore, it’s formulated with good-for-hair ingredients like biotin and pearl extract, which enhance shine. \nDermstore rating: 4/5 stars\nA Dermstore reviewer says: “Looking at my roots is frustrating because my hair grows rapidly. I have long hair, so root touch-ups and refresh coloring is a time-consuming process for me. I prolong as much as possible to ensure my hair’s strength and health. Finding Bright Shadows Root Touch-Up Spray from R+Co was the best treasure. I’m so thankful I found this spray. It covers everything and holds the color until I wash my hair. I haven’t experienced anything horrible with this spray, it truly doesn’t transfer to clothes, people etc. It stays on the hair. The easy spray is quick and manageable. So happy!”\nSpecifically formulated for gray coverage, this full-pigment stick features a crayon side and a sponge side. The cream-to-powder crayon is wax-free, so it won’t feel waxy or clog the hair follicle and is easy rinse out when you’re ready. The real beauty of this product is its sponge, however, which allows for easy blending and the most realistic-looking gray coverage.\nUlta rating: 4.2/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer says: “I was on the fence about buying a product to cover my gray patchiness. I was looking for something easy and hassle-free. I am 50-something and get little white/gray patches near my temples that are very noticeable. This product covered them with ease with a very light touch and was so easy to color on. The price was right, too. This product surpassed my expectations. I will re-order when the time comes to replenish. Don’t think about it, just give this one a shot. It won’t disappoint!”\nOK, you caught me, this isn’t technically a root touch-up product, but that doesn’t mean it can’t double as one. If you’ve ever experienced greasy hair, you know that it makes strands look darker. Enter: This dry shampoo for light-colored hair that nixes grease and brightens just slightly for a cleaner, more vibrant-looking mane. I swear by this even when my hair isn’t greasy, because it allows me to buy some extra time before I need a more serious root-concealing product. The formula comes in a version for dark tones as well. \nSephora rating: 4.6/5 stars\nA Sephora reviewer says: “I have very fine, thin, light blond hair. This is the first dry shampoo I’ve ever repurchased, and I’ve tried them all. I will be sticking with this one for sure.”\nMadison Reed is known for their at-home hair color products, phenomenal customer service, and helpful tutorials and video consultations to help you navigate the process (the latter being a game-changer for me during quarantine) And chances are, if you're covering gray hairs on your head, you might see a few sprouting throughout your brows, too. This root concealer powder works for covering both, complete with a handy dual-ended tool featuring a mini spoolie and brush to make covering brow hairs a breeze. Even if grays aren’t your issue, you can use this as a brow or scalp fill-in product to achieve fuller-looking brows and hair. \nUlta rating: 4.7/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer says: “I’ve been using another brand of root touch up powder and thought I’d try this since I use Madison Reed hair color. This color was suggested for my hair, and it matches perfectly! I was using another eyebrow powder, but this one is perfect. So happy I ordered it!”\nFor color-boosting and styling all in one, the Clairol Root Touch-Up Spray is a good choice. It offers volumizing benefits so that your hair is left looking full and freshly colored. We like this one for covering grays in particular versus dark root growth. Because it’s a two-in-one product, it’s a great option for travel to maximize space in your toiletry bag.\nAmazon rating: 4.1/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “My hair is thin, so I try to stretch out my color as long as possible. When the roots start showing gray, I can get a few more days by using this. It’s a bit of a learning curve to use it without getting it all over your forehead, but when used as intended it’s great!”\nThis portable root touch-up powder comes in ten flexible shades but is especially great for redheads, as there’s a few shades of red to choose from. And if you’re a bottle redhead, you know that your color fades fast, so it can be helpful to add a little extra boost in between salon visits. Its small size makes it easy to travel with and the sponge applicator is perfect for dipping into the powder and applying to roots.\nAmazon rating: 4.4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer say: “This product is awesome! I have some thinning at the top of my head near my forehead, and it covers my scalp perfectly. You would never know. Plus, it also covers the gray, and gives you a little more time before it’s time to have it colored. I highly recommend this product. I will never be without it, and it lasts a very long time.”\n“Root touch-up products are specially formulated to help cover up or blend in new hair growth at the roots between salon visits,” says Haliti. “These products are designed to temporarily conceal gray hairs or visible roots, providing a quick and convenient solution for maintaining a polished look.” They come in spray, stick, and powder form, along with some permanent formulations.\nAccording to Denis, “the best way to choose your color is to ask your colorist if they recommend a root touch-up product for you. If you are browsing and come across one, the best way to match on your own would be to do a strand test and see if it blends into the rest of your strands after smudging and blending it in a bit with your fingers or a brush,” she adds. \nThe answer is that it really depends on what type of root touch-up product you’re using. Naturally, the best way to apply each formula is by following the usage directions. If you’re using a stick, Haliti advises “drawing it onto your root area, then using your fingers to smudge and blend it in.” If you’re using a spray, generally, you should hold the can about six inches from your head, then spray. You can distribute the product and allow it to settle into strands by brushing it through with a bristle brush. Meanwhile, powders tend to come with an application tool like a brush, sponge, or spoolie to apply the product directly to your roots.\nNo matter which type of product you’re using, though, “start with clean, dry hair and section your hair before applying the product according to the instructions,\" says Denis. “Then, blend it in and style as desired.” \nIn most cases, root touch-ups are just a temporary solution, so they’ll “last until you wash your hair,” says Denis, who adds that “a good formula will wash out easily with shampoo.” But, if you’re using a permanent touch-up like the L’Oréal Magic Root Rescue, then you’ll buy yourself a bit more time.  \n“All shades can probably get away with using some form of root touch-up, but it might be harder to match blonde and red shades since they vary so much,” says Denis. Blondes and reds can be cool, warm, or somewhere in between, so “darker shades will be the easiest to blend and match,” Denis adds. Some brands might not even offer red shades at all, so red-haired folks may also need to do a little more legwork to find a good match. \n“The frequency of root touch-ups varies based on factors like hair growth rate, desired coverage, and personal preference,” explains Haliti. “Darker hair colors may require more frequent touch-ups due to noticeable regrowth, while lighter hair colors may have longer intervals between touch-ups.”\nSamantha Denis is the founder of allyoos and former hair stylist, colorist, and product developer.\nAbby Haliti is a celebrity colorist and a master of the French Balayage technique.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nBack to school, back to reality, back to fall fashion! \nWe can’t help but think of fall as September rolls around. The energy is fresh, fashion month is upon us, and with that, a slew of new fashion drops, collaborations, and special moments that you won’t want to miss, like John Hardy’s reimagined New York store, Swarovski’s latest assortment of lab-grown diamonds, and more. Keep checking back for all the latest and greatest in fashion news. \nWho: John Hardy\nWhat: Reimagined New York store\nWhere: 118 Prince Street, New York City\nWhy: John Hardy’s new direction under Reed Krakoff is positively refreshing, with a bold new take on the classic woven pieces fans of the brand know and love. To commemorate this change, the Soho store has been renovated and given a breath of new life, with a bold marigold and yellow color palette and Balinese artwork. The two new collections, Spear and Surf, are available to purchase, plus a tea bar in the back for when you need a quick refresher. “I wanted to honor the essence of John Hardy’s foundational designs, fusing the brand’s rich Balinese heritage with a contemporary vision,” Krakoff exclusively tells ELLE.com. “The reimagination of our flagship store was conceived through the same perspective. Our goal was to create an immersive environment that offers our clients the best of the new brand vision as well as the enduring legacy of craftsmanship that has always defined our brand.” \nWho: Luar and Emcee\nWhat: Ana bag collection\nWhere: Exclusively online at emceestudios.com\nWhy: For the uninitiated, Emcee is a unique e-commerce site that harnesses the power of content creators to partner with brands and expand the way we shop in 2023. It makes sense, then, why it co-sponsored Luar’s knockout runway show at NYFW, and subsequently asked Raul Lopez and three Emcee creators to collaborate on the brand’s signature Ana bag. Uniekue (@uniekue), Valerie Zhang (@valslooks), and Anna Molinari (@annamolinstinct), pictured here, all brought their creative expressions to life by riffing on Lopez’s design.\nWho: Veronica de Piante\nWhat: Fall collection \nWhere: Exclusively online at net-a-porter.com \nWhy: Following the initial launch of her debut collection in fall 2022, designer Veronica de Piante garnered a swath of critical acclaim, including a nod from Net-a-Porter, who called her “a name to know.” The luxury retailer is now doubling down on this claim, announcing they will be the designer’s exclusive retail partner. The 10-piece offering showcases de Piante’s range, spotlighting expertly tailored trousers, a leather trench coats, and a beautifully draped georgette gown. One notable standout: a duchess silk jacket trimmed with her signature embroidery, hand-sewn by Palestinian and Syrian artists in Jordan in an effort to foster economic independence among refugees. \nWho: Monica Rich Kosann and Gracie Wiener\nWhat: The MRK x Ironic Boat and Tote collection\nWhere: Online at monicarichkosann.com\nWhy: Monica Rich Kosann has partnered with Gracie Wiener of @ironicboatandtote, known for popularizing unexpected monograms on classic L.L.Bean tote bags, on a capsule collection of six internet-y phrases (IYKYK, subtle, yikes, LOL) engraved on pendant necklaces in sterling silver and 18K yellow gold. “I live for personalized pieces that are playful and fun, so it’s been a dream to transform a timeless modern heirloom into something a tad cheeky and unexpected—IYKYK,” Wiener says in a press release. (We know.)\nWho: The SIL and The Beverly Hills Hotel\nWhat: Capsule collection and residency\nWhere: Exclusively online at thesilshop.com and at The Beverly Hills Hotel later this month\nWhy: Editor-loved e-commerce site The SIL, founded by Natalie Bloomingdale as a platform for independent designers creating one-of-a-kind pieces (it’s an acronym for Stuff I Love), has partnered with The Beverly Hills Hotel on an exclusive capsule that pays tribute its legendary original owner, Margaret J.

{"title": "The 16 Best Diffusers for Curly Hair", "date": "2023-09-29 15:13:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nHello, volume.\nIf you have thick, curly hair, you probably already know that you need one of the best diffusers for curly hair in your routine. Because if you’ve ever tried air drying your curls, you already know that it can take forever and leave a lot to be desired as far as the finished result. Think: lack of definition, bounce, and less volume. If you want to achieve a bouncy blowout–big, ’90s hair is back–or accentuate your natural texture without all the frizz, the best diffusers for curly hair can make a big difference. \n“A blow dryer diffuser directs the airflow, so it does not disturb the curl pattern,” explains Todd Faul, senior cosmetology educator at Aveda Arts & Sciences Institutes-Dallas. “Diffusers can be used on hair that has been permed to enhance the curl, or on naturally curly hair to enhance your God-given curls.” \nAs you begin your journey to find your diffuser match, it isn’t always as simple as picking up the most affordable or prettiest option. Not every diffuser will fit every hair dryer, so that’s something to look out for. If you’re not crazy about your current hair dryer, now may be the time to purchase a dryer and diffuser combo so that you know that they’re compatible. It’s also key to have your goals in mind. Looking for extra volume? More definition? Those factors can help guide you toward the right diffuser. \nWe tapped top hair stylists for their favorite diffusers, scoured customer reviews, and included a few options we’ve tested and love to find the best diffusers on the market. Whatever your curl wishes are, here are the 16 best diffusers for curly hair that really wowed us.\nIf you want to add volume but keep definition, this diffuser is gentle enough to do both. The hand-like tool gently cups hair, instead of disturbing it, so you can get the best of both worlds. Want to see if it will fit your hairdryer? See specs and measurements here. \nAmazon rating: 4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I love, love, love, LOVE this diffuser! The fingers slip into areas of my hair around my head in ways that a traditional diffuser cannot. For example, I can slide it *into* the curls instead of just scrunching them. It gives me great lift at the roots.”\nFor curls that look just as good as what you can get in a salon, try the GHD diffuser attachment. It makes quick work of even long, thick curls, without using too much heat. This diffuser can be used with the GHD Helios dryer, or their Air Professional dryer.\nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “As a hairstylist, I ordered this diffuser for the purpose of working with naturally curly hair. This nozzle fit perfectly on my blow dryer and stays put until I detach it. It is strong and sturdy so it will last for many years to come.”\nIf you’re searching for a new tool that does it all, consider this one. This hair dryer comes with a diffuser, a smoothing attachment, and even some hair clips to make the process easy. Many Amazon reviewers noted its reasonable price, but decent blow drying and diffusing skills that stand up to more expensive competitors.\nAmazon rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I really like the Revlon Drying Power blower in white, and the color is simply gorgeous. It comes with both an acrylic or plastic nozzle and a diffuser, which is a great plus. I also appreciate the hair clips and cooling button included. Another positive is that it’s not heavy to hold, and the heat it provides is just right for my hair drying needs.”\nIf you’re lucky enough to have long, curly hair, then you know that drying those curls can take a ton of time. This diffuser paired with the T3 AireLuxe dryer can quickly dry a ton of hair without leaving behind any damp spots. The T3 dryer is one of our favorites because it dries hair quickly, and adding this diffuser is chef’s kiss for enhancing any wave pattern.\nAmazon rating: 4.4/5 stars \nAn expert reviewer says: “I absolutely swear by my T3 blow dryer, in part because it means I can use this diffuser. I swear this cuts my drying time in half, and my curls always come out defined and voluminous.” –Tatjana Freund \n“The best diffuser for adding volume, and the most economical, is the Conair Infiniti pro,” says cosmetology educator Todd Faul. “It is lightweight with lots of power and works great to enhance your curls with the diffuser attachment.” It touts ceramic technology for faster drying and less damage, plus the set comes with another attachment for creating sleek blowouts as.\nAmazon rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I have had the orange version for about 16 years and it’s still going strong! I bought a second one in burgundy for my vacation house. Works just as great. I have curly hair and use the diffuser daily. My curls are beautiful and bouncy and it doesn’t dry my hair out.”\nIf you’re looking for a diffuser that's no muss, no fuss, then look no further. This diffuser is made of heat-resistant silicone, and it can fold down, making it easy to store and travel with. Plus, the silicone barrel fits on almost every hair dryer, so you don’t need to buy a new one. If you don’t use a diffuser often, rest assured this is a great purchase as it doesn’t take up too much room.\nRevolve rating: 4.2/5 stars\nAn expert reviewer says: “When I travel, trying to decide which hair products to bring is always the hardest part of packing. For my curls, a diffuser is absolutely essential, but most are so bulky. I love that this tool collapses so I can easily pack it use it with hotel hair dryers.” –Tatjana Freund, Fashion & Luxury Commerce Editor\nIf you’re trying to speed up the drying process, opt for a diffuser like this one. It has 360-degree airflow, meaning your hair will dry evenly. It’s also very large, so you can scoop up a big bundle of curls and dry them super fast. Note: This diffuser doesn’t fit all hair dryers! It has a 1.8-inch nozzle diameter, so it will only fit dryers that have the same measurement.\nAmazon rating: 4.3/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I have long, very thick hair, and I can’t believe how much hair I can get inside this thing!! Wish I would have gotten this a long time ago!”\nLooking to invest in your haircare? Dyson is considered one of the leaders in hair tools, and their Supersonic Dryer is worth the hefty price tag. Not only does it come with a magnetic diffuser (this tiny detail is a game changer–it makes each attachment feel super sturdy when it’s on), but it comes with a comb attachment, concentrated nozzle for straightening, a flyaway tool, and more. \nSephora rating: 4/5 stars\nAn expert reviewer says: “At first, I thought that the dryer was too powerful, but once I learned how to use it, there was no going back. And all of the attachments are so fun to play around with and really work. I find that the best combo for a smooth, yet bouncy curl look is to use the diffuser on the lengths of towel-dried hair and then the smoothing nozzle on top to minimize frizziness and flyaways.”—Lisa DeSantis, ELLE.com contributor \nIf you’re packing your bags to go on vacay, don’t stress if your hairdryer can’t fit. This collapsible diffuser fits on almost every hair dryer on the market, including those dryers that hotels have, so you can keep styling on the go.\nRizoz Curls rating: 4.7/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer says: “With the help of this diffuser, my curls look amazing!”\nLooking for a hair dryer that meets all of your curls’ wishes? This baby packs a punch with anti-frizz technology, three heat settings and a cold shot, and a huge diffuser head. If you’re looking for shiny, healthy curls that are defined with tons of volume, look no further. \nUlta rating: 4.5/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer says: “I’ve always had an issue with frizz, and this diffuser one million percent removed 99 percent of it! Highly recommend to any one who’s trying to love their curls cause I know it’s a lot of work. Curl Smith Diffuser will change your life! I have low-med porosity hair, mainly 3B curl pattern.”\nFrom Tracee Ellis Ross’ curl-specific brand, this blow dryer took two years to get right and features four attachments including a diffuser that offers much more than meets the eye. Its prongs are spaced out to provide proper ventilation to heat curls evenly for shaping and setting. For a customized blowout that’s tailor-made to your unique curls, there are three heat and two speed settings to choose from. You can read ELLE’s full review of Pattern for more information.\nUlta rating: 4.2/5 stars\nAn expert reviewer says: “I love that Pattern’s heat system has an attachment for all, well, hair patterns and textures.” –Nerisha Penrose, ELLE.com Beauty Commerce Editor\n Whether you’re traveling, sharing a hair dryer, or simply on a budget, this fabric diffuser can be tightened onto your classic blow dryer to create a diffusing effect. “The sock diffuser will fit on pretty much all hair dryers,” says Faul. “Made from a lightweight, heat-resistant fabric instead of plastic like most diffusers, it’s perfect for people that travel as it is easy to pack in your suitcase and will fit on any hair dryer that is provided by the hotel that you’re staying at.”\nAmazon rating: 3.2/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “This little diffuser is perfect. The picture doesn’t show the elastic strap that holds it to the dryer, but it does have one. My other diffusers leave me with lots of frizz or constantly pop off the dryer during use. I now keep this one permanently attached to my dryer. I have lots of curly 3A hair and this product dries it without frizz and lots of shine. A truly great product for curly hair!”\nSearching for a bit more bounce? That’s what the Drybar diffuser is best at. It helps lift curls off the scalp, giving you tons of volume without adding frizz. Plus, while this diffuser works with Drybar’s hair dryers, it also fits most other blow dryers, too! The proof is in the pudding.\nUlta rating: 4/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer says: “My hair dryer worked fine, but I needed a diffuser attachment. This one fits my Rusk CTC hair dryer perfectly, and it actually dries my hair faster than the one that came with my blow dryer. I’d recommend!”\nThis tool was created to help accentuate your natural texture. It’s great for people with wavy hair who are looking to keep a natural bend in their hair. This dryer and diffuser are super lightweight, which means your styling routine can stop being your workout routine, too.\nAmazon rating: 4.2/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “The best method for my own head of curls is to wash it as normal, put a small amount of leave-in conditioner on my hair to maintain moisture, and finger twist with Mop Top custard. After finger-twisting, I just gently diffuse with this dryer upside down first, then left and right before finally upright, until hair is dry.”\nThis brand has taken notes and created the diffuser of our dreams. Not only does this fit almost every hair dryer on the market thanks to some clever design, but it also has a huge barrel, so even people with the thickest hair can style and dry their hair quickly.\nAmazon rating: 4.4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I love that this diffuser is adjustable to fit on many hair blowers. It works well and I’ve had no issues with anything melting or overheating.”\nWhether you’re looking to rock your natural texture or give yourself a sleek blowout, this hair dryer and attachments can make all your hair dreams come true. With a diffuser, smoothing attachment, and comb attachment, you’ll never need to step foot in a salon again.\nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars\n An Amazon reviewer says:“No frills, but it had everything I needed with the cool setting being perfect and the absolute best part was how crazy lightweight it is!”\n “Diffusers essentially diffuse the air coming out of the dryer, so it reduces the velocity and spreads it out further, which is great for mimicking air-drying,” says David Lopez, New York-based celebrity hairstylist and curl expert. While a traditional blow dryer pushes air out and causes frizz, a diffuser will just gently dry hair without any friction. \n“I would say anyone who wants to mimic air-drying, or perhaps encourage some volume in their natural waves or curls, and of course, someone with curly hair,” says Lopez. Diffusers are great for anyone who wants to add a bit more volume to their styles as well. “Even people with straight hair can use a diffuser,” adds Faul. “They will be surprised to see how much body and wave they can get out of diffusing their hair.”\n“First, I just really rotate the diffuser around the head and around the hair, without touching or manipulating the hair at all until a cast starts to form from the product that you use,” says Lopez. “Then, once a cast starts to form and you want to start building volume, you can tilt your head side-to-side or flip upside down gently and then encourage some volume and some more curl.”\n“Wait until your hair is completely dry before you start cupping it to encourage the curl,” says Lopez. “The more you touch your hair while it’s drying, the more you are going to encourage frizz. So, I always tell people to let the hair dry first to at least 85 to 90 percent, basically almost completely dry, before you start cupping it and encouraging volume, so you don’t have as much frizz.”\nTatjana Freund is Hearst's Fashion & Luxury Commerce Editor, covering beauty, fashion and more across multiple brands.

{"title": "15 Best Drugstore Retinol Products That Are Just as Effective as Expensive Ones", "date": "2023-09-29 14:35:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nAsk anyone you know: The best part about visiting your local drugstore is the versatility of snagging your everyday essentials, preventative medicine, and beauty staples in a swipe. Our introduction to beauty likely began in the sprawling aisles of our drugstores, from affordable cleansers and moisturizers to mascaras and eyeliners—if you need it, the drugstore likely has it. This also includes retinol—a topical ingredient used to increase skin rejuvenation and address texture, among other issues—that was traditionally prescribed by dermatologists but is now offered over the counter at drugstores for a fraction of the price, in formulas that treat the body and skin. “Retinol is a vitamin A derivative that regulates skin cell turnover, helping to address skin tone and texture. It works to help unclog the pores, prevent breakouts, and improve the appearance of hyperpigmentation and discoloration while also helping to improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles,” says Dr. Marisa Garshick, board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology: Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Cornell New York Presbyterian Medical Center. \nChances are you’ve seen a few drugstore retinol products but had doubts about their effectiveness and cost. Allow these 15 best drugstore retinol products to change your mind. We polled several dermatologists and online customer feedback to find the best drugstore retinol formulas money can buy. Your skin (and wallet) will thank you. \nThere’s no need to second guess if you're using too little or too much retinol each week. With RoC's retinol capsules, you’ll give your skin the right amount every time. Each capsule has retinol and antioxidants to address fine lines and wrinkles.\nKey ingredients: Retinol, antioxidants\nSize: 30 capsules\nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars \nOur expert says: “These retinol capsules also contain antioxidants and ceramides, so they help to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles without irritating the skin. The capsule design makes them especially good for on the go.”—Dr. Marisa Garshick, \nIf you prefer a multipurpose product, Netrogena’s Regenerating Cream uses retinol to reverse signs of aging and hyaluronic acid to hydrate and plump the skin to avoid irritation. \nKey ingredients: Retinol, hyaluronic acid\nSize: 1.7 fl oz\nUlta rating: 4.3 fl oz \nOur expert says: “This is a great retinol option, especially for beginners, as not only does it provide retinol benefits but it also contains hyaluronic acid to help boost moisture, improving overall tolerability.”—Dr. Garshick\nMaintenance and prevention are vital when it comes to fighting acne scars. The Differin Gel helps to do both by penetrating the pores to reduce breakouts and diminishing the appearance of existing scars. \nKey ingredients: Adapalene \nSize: 0.5 fl oz \nAmazon rating: 4.5 fl oz\nOur expert says: “Containing adapalene, a prescription retinoid now available over-the-counter, this [gel] can be a great option for someone dealing with breakouts and blemishes.  By helping to regulate skin cell turnover, it helps to prevent clogged pores and is especially good for those with oily skin,” says Dr. Garshick. Fellow dermatologist Dr. Brendan Camp is also a fan of the over-the-counter gel. “The active ingredient in Differin is adapalene, which is a retinoid. It used to be available only by prescription but is now available over the counter. Primarily marketed as an acne treatment, products with adapalene can address concerns like fine lines, wrinkles, and dark spots,” he says. \nAnother RoC drugstore gem, this formula was designed to improve the lines and wrinkles that emerge under your eye, as well as dark circles that may form over time.  \nKey ingredients: Retinol, minerals\nSize: 0.5 fl oz\nOur expert says: “This retinol eye cream is gentle enough to use on the skin around the eyes and helps tackle concerns like crow’s feet, dark circles, and puffiness.”—Dr. Brendan Camp \nTry this Olay hydrating, retinol-infused body wash if you’re troubled with bacne. In addition to retinol, Olay’s Nighttime Body Wash is formulated with vitamin B3 to refresh and renew your skin so it's left feeling soft and supple. \nKey ingredients: Retinol, vitamin B3\nSize: 20 fl oz  \nTarget rating: 4.6/5 stars\nOur expert says: “I'll admit it: TikTok made me do it. As someone who constantly breaks out on my chest and back, I was desperate for a formula that would clear my body acne fast. Olay’s retinol body wash not only helped to reduce my breakouts, but I believe its hydrating formula is the reason so many people have complimented me on how soft and clear my skin looks.”—Nerisha Penrose, ELLE.com beauty commerce editor  \nIf you’re a beginner looking for an affordable entry to retinol, drugstore favorite CeraVe has you covered. Along with encapsulated retinol to brighten and improve texture, this serum also has hyaluronic acid and ceramides, so you’re not left with an irritated, damaged skin barrier.\nKey ingredients: Retinol, hyaluronic acid, ceramides\nSize: 1 fl oz\nOur expert says: “This retinol serum is formulated as an encapsulated retinol to reduce the appearance of fine lines and dullness. It also incorporates niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and ceramides to strengthen the skin barrier and deliver all-day hydration as it is formulated with MVE technology,” says Dr. Garshick. Dr. Brendan Camp loves this serum for its hydrating properties. “Made with hyaluronic acid to boost hydration, niacinamide to calm skin, and ceramides to improve moisture, this retinol serum helps address premature signs of aging,” he adds. \nAs the name suggests, Versed Press Restart helps give your skin a second (or third, or fourth?) chance at renewal. Using bakuchiol, a retinol alternative, this serum smooths texture; chlorophyll is also in its make-up to enrich the skin with a boost of oxygen. \nKey ingredients: Bakuchiol, chlorophyll \nSize: 1 fl oz\nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “It is helpful in smoothing out rough patches, as I’m in my mid seventies and have some skin issues.” \nThe antidote for a lifted, smoothed, soft face is found in this bottle. L’Oréal Paris’ Pure Retinol Night Serum works to gradually erase those pesky fine lines and wrinkles so you can maintain a more youthful appearance. \nKey ingredient: Retinol\nSize: 1 fl oz\nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “This is hands down the best retinol I’ve ever used! My skin is much more smooth and glowing! I keep a very simple routine and this is my magic serum! I recommend this always for OTC retinol.”\nSmall but mighty, this concentrate primarily focuses on refining the look of pores and delaying any signs of aging with a formula that fuses retinol with peptides for extra cushion.\nKey ingredients: Retinol, peptides\nSize: 1 fl oz\nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars\nOur expert says: “This retinol treatment is formulated with a retinol optimizer encapsulation system to enhance medication delivery and optimize effects.”—Dr. Brendan Camp\nHow can one treatment target so many common skin care woes? The La Roche-Posay Effaclar Adapalene Gel attacks breakouts—the main culprit of dark spots and deep scarring—head-on by helping unclog pores and prevent new acne.\nKey ingredient: Adapalene \nSize: 1.6 fl oz \nUlta rating: 4.5/5 stars \nAn Ulta reviewer said: “Honestly this product is great and has helped cleared my acne scars so much and I barely break out, this is one of my favorites and I definitely recommend getting it!!”\nAs you catch your Zzz, this gentle serum soothes and smoothes the skin to reveal a brighter, youthful-looking appearance over time.\nKey ingredients: Retinyl linoleate, hyaluronic acid \nSize: 1 fl oz\nUlta rating: 4.5/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “I’m consistently surprised at how much better my skin looks the morning after I use this serum. I also love the consistency and how nicely it soaks up into your skin without leaving it feeling sticky/tacky. You’re able to apply other serums/moisturizer over it without that annoying “pilling” of product. I’m struggling with hormonal acne as I turn 30 and this stuff is the only thing that keeps it at bay. There is an instant improvement overnight, every single time. As with all retinols, this will cause some irritation when not introduced to your skin slowly. But it is completely worth it for the results you get.”\nWhen using retinol, the key to protecting your skin is to sandwich it with a hydrating moisturizer as a protective barrier. Good thing Eucerin did the hard work for you. The anti-wrinkle cream gradually fades wrinkles with pro-retinol and nourishes the skin with vitamin E and macadamia nut oil. \nKey ingredients: Pro-retinol, vitamin E, macadamia nut oil\nSize: 1.7 fl oz\nAmazon rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I’ve used this, along with other Eucerin skin products, for several years. After removing makeup at night and cleaning my face, applying this cream is my gift to my face. It has a pleasant scent and a rich texture. The cream easily absorbs into my face and neck, where it can work its magic all night long. Reasonably priced, there’s no excuse for not using this anti-wrinkle cream.\nYou can’t talk about staple drugstore skin care without mentioning Olay. The Regenerist Retinol24 Night Moisturizer is the superhero your routine has been missing; its powers include brightening, lifting, and firming, in addition to wrinkle and pore reduction.\nKey ingredients: Retinol, vitamin B3\nSize: 1.7 fl oz \nUlta rating: 4.5/5 stars\nOur expert says: “Olay Regenerist Retinol24 Night Moisturizer is my favorite drugstore brand retinol for many reasons. It contains a blend of their proprietary retinoid complex, niacinamide, and amino peptides that help revive and rejuvenate the skin. It penetrates deep into the skin surface to address many concerns, including fine lines and wrinkles, smoothness, brightness, firming, dark spots, and pores. It also hydrates the skin and helps to maintain the natural skin barrier.”—Dr. Lauren Penzi\nYou can always count on E.L.F for your makeup needs, but the brand also has your skin care covered. Featuring a blend of retinol, antioxidants, and hyaluronic acid, this serum plumps and hydrates the skin while improving texture. \nKey ingredients: Retinol, hyaluronic acid \nSize: 2.15 fl oz \nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “The serum has a lightweight, non-greasy texture that glides smoothly onto the skin. I appreciate that it doesn’t leave a sticky residue or cause any discomfort upon application. It’s also fragrance-free, which is a plus for those with sensitive skin. I’ve been using the e.l.f. SKIN Youth Boosting Advanced Night Retinoid Serum for about eight weeks now, and I’ve noticed some positive changes in my skin. My complexion appears smoother, and fine lines around my eyes and mouth have become less noticeable. I did experience some mild peeling and sensitivity during the first two weeks, but it subsided as my skin adjusted to the retinoid.”\nWrinkles, scars, and crepey skin don’t only appear on the face—the body gets its fair share, too. Thanks to this firming cream from Advanced Clinicals, your body can be as smooth and blemish-free as your face. \nKey ingredients: Retinol, ferulic acid, green tea, aloe vera \nSize: 16 fl oz \nAmazon rating: 4.4/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I was skeptical at first but after using this product I have to admit it works. I have extremely dry skin on my legs and after using the lotion for less than a week my skin looks so much better. You’d never know there was a problem. I definitely recommend it for others.”\nWhile drugstore retinol products may have great benefits, Dr. Marisa Garshick says not all formulas are made equally. \n“Retinol may exist in different concentrations, which may impact both efficacy and tolerability. However, some retinols may also be combined with other ingredients to help maximize benefits and enhance tolerability. Additionally, prescription retinoids tend to be more effective than over-the-counter retinols, but ultimately it comes down to tolerability,” she explains. If over-the-counter products aren’t yielding the results you desire, Dr. Garshick advises visiting a dermatologist for a more effective treatment plan. \n“When considering a drugstore retinol, it is important to not only look for a brand and product that is backed by clinical studies, but also to consider the type of retinol, the concentration and any other ingredients in the formulation, such as ceramides, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid to help minimize irritation,” Dr. Garshick offers. \nDr. Marisa Garshick is a board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology: Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Cornell New York Presbyterian Medical Center. \nDr. Brendan Camp is a double board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology: Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery.\nDr. Lauren Penzi is a board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology: Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery.\nNerisha is the beauty commerce editor at ELLE.com, covering all things beauty (and fashion and music).

{"title": "23 Best Candle Gift Sets to Start ﻿Your Collection", "date": "2023-09-28 19:07:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nAn aroma for every mood. \nThere are candle lovers, and then there’s me—a candle collector, hoarder, and obsessive. Like flowers and candies, candle gift sets have always been the go-to for lazy, last-minute shoppers whenever popular holidays or birthdays roll around. You can't just buy any candle you see , no matter how gorgeous the packaging—candles can be very deceiving. \nReceiving a candle as a gift can sometimes elicit eye rolls and scoffs, especially when you’re unsure what brands provide the best throw (how strong and far a particular candle's aroma can spread) or what notes the receiver favors. As a self-professed candle connoisseur, I’m here to lend a helping hand. I'm not ashamed to admit I house a treasure trove of candles in a closet—from mini to jumbo and everything in between—that span every budget and mood, collected over the years. From designer faves like Diptyque and Le Labo to Nest and Forvr Mood's fan-favorite scents, here are the 23 absolute best candle gift sets that will make you everyone’s favorite gift-giver. \nScent notes: (Gris) floral, woods; (30 Montaigne) spicy, oriental\nWhat’s included: Gris Dior full size and travel size, scented bar soap, body cream, candle snuffer, candle\nIf your palette leans spicy some days, lean into Dior’s Gris gift set, which comes with a full-sized and travel-sized Gris Dior fragrance, soap, body cream, snuffer, and the 30 Montaigne scented candle. \nScent notes: (Cookie Coma) almond, brown sugar, cinnamon, Tahitian vanilla; (To Live & Pine) Tangerine, winterberry, sparkling mint, musk; (Sneaky Link) grapefruit, lime, apple; (Cabin Fever) fig, peach, mango, tart lemon, vanilla\nWhat’s included: (4) candles\nForvr Mood candles have a throw that fills up any space before you even light the candle. Each candle has a distinct smell that matches its name, such as standouts like Cookie Coma—a sticky, gourmand cocktail of almond, vanilla, and cinnamon—or Sneaky Link, a sultry blend of citrus and sweet musks. \nScent notes: lavender, balsam, citrus, black amber\nWhat’s included: Candle and lid \nHere’s an unassuming candle that doubles as an earthy lavender-basil candle when it’s lit, and an accessories holder when the wax is finally all dried out.\nScent notes: (Midnight Currant) redcurrant, cypress, blackberry; (Woodland Spruce) oakwood, vetiver, golden amber; (White Maple Bourbon) aged bourbon, maple, vanilla bean\nWhat’s included: (3) mini candles\nThe smell of the fall or winter seasons is almost always gourmand-centered. However, Lafco's limited-edition candle set gives the colder months a new aroma, from woods drenched with sticky sweetness to spicy fruits.\nScent notes: Blackcurrant, lemon, cyclamen, pine\nWhat’s included: (2) candles, candle holder, wick trimmer\nEnvelope your space with this Amazon best-selling candle set that's built to last. The star of this gift set is the muted pink candle holder that can be filled with the two refillable candles enclosed in the package, or used to hold brushes and other tiny accessories dancing around your vanity.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nLust-worthy designs for any type of lifestyle.\nLingerie brands have come a long way since the days of ultra-push-up bras and bows on panties. Not to say those can’t be fun, but there’s so much more nuance to what can be sexy these days (and thank God—and Rihanna—for that). From ultra-sexy to minimalistic to just pure fun, there’s a lingerie style out there for every woman, and for every version of you that you want to be. Some days you want to be bright and bold, and others, you’d rather throw on something sleek and classic. No one feels the same every day, and whether someone sees it or not, what you wear under your clothes should reflect how you feel.\nWhether you’re wearing lingerie for yourself or as a special surprise, out on the town or lounging at home, you’ll want to feel comfortable and confident. That’s where these brands come in. Not only will they make you feel great, but you’ll look great too (priority #1 and priority #2).

You feel so cute!” \nFor those who are serious about their lingerie (and bondage and everything in between), Coco de Mer is the brand for you. The designs are provocative, yet chic.

{"title": "Stop Hurting Your Shoulders and Switch to These Backpacks", "date": "2023-09-28 15:45:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n“On the fence? Don’t be. You need this. Just BUY IT.”\nEveryone knows I love backpacks. It’s a moot point by now. I would stop talking about it if I could, but now I’ve turned myself into an expert, so if you’re wondering about the best backpacks for women, I’m your girl. \nFor postural, sartorial, and practical reasons, a backpack is the way to go. Emphasis on postural. A leather tote is appealing, but a beautiful posture is hard to beat. Whether you plan to use it as a work bag, laptop bag, carry-on backpack or gym bag, there’s no limit to how you can make the most of a new option. \nI scouted out which backpacks on the market have both the style and function you need and also tapped my fellow editors for their personal recommendations to bring you this list of the 16 best backpacks for women. See them all below.\nWhen shopping for a backpack, you often have to make a choice to go with a non-designer one that focuses on function or a fashionable one that might lack practicality. I love that Vivienne Westwood collaborated with bag brand Eastpak to bring you the best of both worlds.  \nColors: Planet Print \nMaterial: Recycled polyester \nDimensions: Height: 15.35 inches; width: 14.57 inches; depth: 7.87 inches  \nLunch packers, I admire you deeply. Senior editor Alyssa Bailey recommends this style. “I walk to work and am regularly going to events for my job,” she says. “I needed a bag that could fit my laptop, a salad, and sometimes a change of shoes while looking fashionable. This one is it! Comfy, roomy but amazingly compact, Modern Picnic’s backpack has shown me I don’t have to give up style to have an actually good work backpack.”\nColors: Black, Cream, Black Croc \nMaterial: Vegan leather \nDimensions: Height: 14.25 inches x width: 11.5 inches x depth: 6 inches\nI know of at least three people at ELLE who use this bag—myself included. “Some bags seem to weigh even more than my laptop does, but this MZ Wallace backpack is feather light,” says Sara Austin, executive editor.  “I also appreciate the luggage sleeve that slips easily over my carry-on handle when I’m traveling.”\nColors: Black, Dahlia Camo, Dawn, Magnet, Silver Blue \nMaterials: Sustainable textile, leather trim \nDimensions: Height: 16.5 inches x width: 12.2 inches x depth: 6.9 inches\nWhether you’re hitting Fright Night at Six Flags, Olivia Rodrigo’s GUTS tour, or you’re just into the transparent bag trend, this one’s for you. \nColors: 8 options \nMaterial: PVC \nDimensions: Height: 12 inches; width: 11 inches; depth: 6 inches \nCustomer review: “Good bag. I bought it for a football game but ended up using it for work or running errands. Good size. Not too big or too small. I spilled mac and cheese it the other day and it wiped out super easy.”\n“As a firm believer in backpacks for work, this Calpak bag is the one I get complimented on the most,” ELLE social media editor Carine Lavache tells me. “It’s chic, comes in a variety of colors, and has plenty of pockets to keep your things organized.”\nColors: 21 options \nMaterial: Faux leather, polyester \nDimensions: Height: 15.5 inches x width: 11.5 inches x depth: 4.5 inches\nA classic fail-safe. These packs last forever and seem to match any outfit, which makes them great for dressing up or down. \nColors: 27 options \nMaterial: Vinylon \nDimensions: Height: 14.5 inches; width: 10.25 inches; depth: inches \nCustomer review: “I got this to use on our family vacation, and I was so happy I did. It is lightweight and fits all I need for a day on the go with my family. The only thing that I would change would be larger water bottle pockets.”\nThis bag is ultra functional and very affordable while maintaining a sleek, versatile style. It’s also available in a 17.3-inch size. \nColors: 6 options\nMaterial: N/A \nDimensions: Height: 17.3 inches; width: 11.4 inches; depth: 6.1 inches \nCustomer review: “I searched high and low, expensive and cheap and this bag is almost perfect!”\nThis backpack comes with a pacifier pouch, smell-proof bag for soiled clothes, a portable changing pad, AND a silicone teething ring. But even still, many reviewers say they don’t even use this as a diaper bag. It’s just an all-around good bag. \nColors: Grey, Black, Navy \nMaterial: Nylon twill, vegan leather \nDimensions: Height: 15 inches; width: 12 inches; depth: 7.7 inches \nCustomer review: “On the fence? Don’t be. You need this. Just BUY IT....I truly do 100% recommend this!”\nYou can’t go wrong with Dagne Dover. Every item I’ve tried has been super high quality, and customers love that this backpack comes in various sizes.  \nColors: 6 options\nMaterial: Neoprene, REPREVE \nDimensions: Height: 13 inches; width: 9.5 inches; depth: 5 inches (for small size) \nCustomer review: “Great backpack! Comfortable and has a lot of space and useful pockets/features. I use it for school, work, and traveling, and it’s great for all of these functions. It’s also stylish and really soft.”\nThe bottom of this backpack is a cooler, making it perfect for packing summit beers on your next hike or hard seltzers on your next trip to the beach. Or, you know, your packed lunch on a daily basis. \nColors: Grey, Brown, Black \nMaterial: Polyester \nDimensions: Height: 17.8 inches; width: 12.5 inches; depth: 8 inches \nCustomer review: “When I received it, I liked it so much I had to get one for my husband as well! The insulated bottom is huge! My husband packs two one-liter water bottles, snacks, his lunch and an energy drink/pop daily. The top backpack part is a little smaller since it has the cooler on the bottom, but still holds so much. The bag is incredibly durable and lightweight also.”\nIf you don’t need a high capacity bag that can house your laptop and other bulky items, this smaller sling is a great style. \nColors: Black \nMaterial: Leather, cotton \nDimensions: N/A\nCustomer review: “Love the size! Strap is adjustable which is great since I’m short:) Beautiful leather too! A definite must have!”\nI did not expect to want to purchase (yet another) backpack while researching for this story, but here I am. \nColors: Brown \nMaterial: Polyurethane, polyester \nDimensions: Height: 11 inches; width: 9.8 inches; depth: 8.3 inches \nPersonally, my mom’s hand-me-down leather bags are some of my favorite—and highest quality—possessions. This option will age like fine wine. \nColors: English Saddle \nMaterial: Leather \nDimensions: Height: 15.5 inches; width: 11.4 inches; depth: 4.75 inches \nCustomer review: “The sizing and style is perfect. Simple yet extremely spacious. I use it for work, school, and everything in between. It houses my 13 in. MacBook along with other books, hydroflask, and misc. items perfectly. Price is quite hefty but you really get what you're paying for.”\nThis little brown number reminds me of something Aunt Becky from Full House would wear. And I’m into that. \nColors: Cocoa\nMaterial: Faux leather \nDimensions: Height: 10 inches; width: 9.5 inches; depth: 4.5 inches \nCan you ever go wrong with Prada? Simply put, no. The external pockets on this are a total bonus. \nColors: Black, Light Blue, Desert Beige \nMaterial: Nylon\nDimensions: Height: 11 inches; width: 9.2 inches; depth: 4.7 inches \nAs someone who tends to carry a collapsible reusable shopping bag, I’m very interested in getting one of these for myself.

{"title": "These 22 Designer Tote Bags Do It All With Style to Spare", "date": "2023-09-27 21:30:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe results are in: You deserve to treat yourself. \nHere at ELLE, we believe in tote bags—of any variety, really, but especially in designer tote bags. As modern-day working girlbosses women, we can only do it all and have it all if we quite literally “have it all” on hand. Any bag I purchase needs to serve as my work bag, gym, lunch, diaper, and shopping bag simultaneously. Translation: It has to have space. Totes are great for this, and to prove my point, I spoke with Blake Geffen, CEO and co-founder of Vivrelle, a designer bag rental service, to get a non-partisan take on which totes are really all that. \nAn avid tote user herself (she’s a mother of three),  Geffen confirms that a designer tote is a great investment option for anyone looking to start—or expand—a high-end collection. As for what to look for in a tote, durability is definitely key. “Both designer and non-designer bags should always be judged by the quality–from fabrics and construction to the stitching and zippers, buckles, etc.,” she says. “Our tote bags are constantly in motion, so it’s important that the one you’re using can endure your day-to-day comings and goings.” \nYou should also take lifestyle and occasion into consideration. Are you more into canvas totes or leather ones? “Compartments and zipper pockets are also qualities I’m always looking for, though may be less important to others. Depending on the setting, shoppers may also want to consider fabrics and strap styles...While the trend cycle shifts quickly, nothing is more fashionable than owning your own unique sense of style. So, choosing a handbag that’s true to you is by far the most important factor when looking for your next bag!”\nI took Geffen’s expertise, fellow ELLE editor recommendations, size, style, and features into account to bring you a list of the 22 best designer tote bags to shop now. \nThe gold chain isn’t just for aesthetics—it adjusts to make the strap however long as you’d like. And the ultra squishy handle is like a built-in stress ball.  \nColors: 6 options\nMaterial: Lambskin \nDimensions: Height: 9.4 inches; width: 11.4 inches; depth: 4.1 inches \nELLE readers love this Bottega Veneta Andiamo. Any bag that has been spotted on the likes of Michelle Yeoh, RM of BTS, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, and Jacob Elordi is an automatic thumbs up from me. \nColors: 7 options \nMaterial: Lambskin\nDimensions: Height: 7.9 inches; width: 9.8 inches; depth: 3.9 inches\n“I like to consider the medium Telfar Shopping Tote my ludicrously capacious bag,” says beauty commerce editor Nerisha Penrose. “The beauty (and versatility) of Telfar’s popular Shopping Tote is that it can be whatever the hell you want it to be...It houses all 12 of my nude lip glosses, my Macbook, a Tupperware packed with a home-cooked meal, and a collection of ketchup packets (who loves dry fries, anyway?).”\nColors: 40 options \nMaterial: Polyurethane, polyester  \nDimensions: Height: 11.25 inches; width: 15 inches; depth: 5 inches\nThis next recommendation comes from ELLE’s own digital deputy editor Claire Stern. “This perfectly sized carryall by one of my favorite Scandi brands, Little Liffner, has fast become my new go-to. It’s sleek and minimalist enough for after-work commitments and perfectly practical for daytime.”\nColors: 7 options \nMaterial: Cow suede, cotton \nDimensions: Height: 7.8 inches; width: 7 inches; depth: 7 inches\nWhat’s better than one iconic Tory Burch bag? A doubled version. \nColors: Pine Bark \nMaterial: Leather, suede, cotton \nDimensions: Height: 11.8 inches; width: 12.4 inches; depth: 6.1 inches\nLike the love child of your favorite tote and your favorite vase. There’s certainly something to be said about self-supporting bags. \nColors: Mushroom or Black \nMaterial: Cow leather, Polyurethane\nDimensions: Height: 23.5 inches; width: 16.3 inches; depth: 7.4 inches\nGet ready to see big bows—a lot of them. I predict they’ll be popping up on designer clothes and accessories everywhere next season.\nColors: Boss Suede, Black Leather, Ecru Suede, or Light Denim \nMaterial: Calf leather (varies by style) \nDimensions: Height: 29 inches; width: 17 inches; depth: 6 inches\nOld Celines will never go out of style. I borrowed one to use during fashion month and was amazed at how spacious and practical it was. Would recommend. \nColors: Neutral \nMaterial: Cowhide leather \nDimensions: Height: 13 inches; width: 12.25 inches; depth: 6.75 inches\nThis otherwise standard black tote is spiced up a bit by the oversized gold buckle on the strap. \nColors: Black \nMaterial: Leather, faux suede \nDimensions: Height: 13 inches; width: 11.75 inches; depth: 5.25 inches\nDoesn’t this A.L.C. bag look pillowy soft? \nColors: Burnt Umber \nMaterial: Faux leather \nDimensions: Height: 15.75 inches; width: 15.75 inches; depth: 4.75 inches\nWhat? I’ve got nothing to hide. Flaunt your belongings in a sexy mesh bag. \nColors: Black \nMaterial: Mesh, patent leather \nDimensions: Height: 21.5 inches; width: 14 inches\nSlouchy bags, embellishments, and metallics are three trends that I saw a ton of this fashion month. \nColors: 6 options \nMaterial: Calf leather, silver plated brass (varies by style) \nDimensions: Height: 20 inches; width: 20.5 inches; depth: 13 inches\nIt’s always nice when totes have multiple handles or adjustable straps. Rock this one on your shoulder, the crook of your elbow, or in your hand. \nColors: Salmon Pink \nMaterial: Faux leather, twill \nDimensions: Height: 13 inches; width: 18 inches; depth: 6.25 inches\nQuilted bags are having a moment, and I can’t stop thinking about this Prada rendition, which comes in various sizes.  \nColors: Black \nMaterial: Leather \nDimensions: Height: 10.6 inches; width: 12.2 inches; depth: 5.1 inches\nGeffen cites the Neverfull as one of the most popular designer tote styles at Vivrelle. With a name like Neverfull, it’s no surprise.  \nColors: Brown Monogram\nMaterial: Cowhide leather \nDimensions: Height: 11.4 inches; width: 12.6 inches; depth: 6.7 inches\nThis is yet another customer favorite. Whether you actually fill it with books is up to you, but it is in the name.... \nColors: Ecru and Pink Toile de Jouy Embroidery \nDimensions: Height: 11 inches; width: 14 inches; depth: 6.5 inches \nBoth Geffen and Stern love this bag from Saint Laurent. “It may not be great for my back, but this tote bag holds my MacBook Air perfectly and has a pouch for miscellaneous belongings (keys, phone, AirPods),” Stern says. \nColors: Black \nMaterial: Leather \nDimensions: Height: 16 inches; width: 13 inches; depth: 5 inches  \nSwap your tired old work bag for this party-ready option from Rabanne that looks straight out of Studio 54 (or the Renaissance tour). \nColor: Silver \nMaterial: Mesh aluminum, leather \nDimensions: Height: 39 inches; width: 34 inches; depth: 2 inches \nFrom the front, this might look like your average tote. But from the side, it’s got room in spades. If you’re looking for a wearable storage unit, this is the one for you. \nColors: Black, Mushroom, or Burgundy \nMaterial: Leather \nDimensions: Height: 15 inches; width: 21 inches; depth: 9 inches \nThis is 2023’s high fashion version of a Mary Poppins bag. \nColors: Brown \nMaterial: Leather \nDimensions: Height: 14.6 inches; width: 22 inches; depth: 5.9 inches \nMeg is the Associate Fashion Commerce Editor at ELLE.com where she researches trends, tests products, and looks for answers to all your burning questions.

{"title": "15 Comfortable, Office-Appropriate Pants to Get You Through the Workday", "date": "2023-09-27 17:23:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nBecause being comfortable and cute at work is a must.\nNow that going into the office is officially normal (for most), it’s only fair that your work attire is equally comfortable and stylish. We just spent three years wearing pajamas 24/7, and, speaking for myself, I have become quite accustomed to the comfy lifestyle. Dressing for the office has been a struggle for me lately. Sometimes denim just rides up too high, and I’m constantly too cold in dresses or skirts. Although we’ve gotten used to the dress-down format, dressing up doesn’t  have to be super complicated. From the best dress shoes to ELLE editors’s go-to laptop bags, we’ve got all the help you need to commute to the office in style. Worry about your spreadsheets and scheduling, and leave the fashion bit to us.\nHere, find 15 of the most comfortable work pants to shop now.\nThese straight-leg pants are affordable and extremely cool.
