He won a Grammy Award in 1985 for producing Silverstein’s “Where the Sidewalk Ends” and received another Grammy nom two years later for his work on another Silverstein children’s album, “A Light in the Attic.”\n\n\tBorn in New York on Dec. 13, 1938, Haffkine contracted polio when he was 12, leaving him paralyzed for two years.

(1971), starring Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Harris.\n\n\tHaffkine recommended that Dr. Hook be used in Harry Kellerman, but for that to happen, the New Jersey band had to have a record deal. After the musicians did an impromptu live showcase in Davis’ office and were signed, Dr. Hook performed the Silverstein-written songs “Bunky and Lucille” and “Last Morning” in the movie.\n\n\tHaffkine also produced Silverstein’s 1972 music comedy album Freakin’ at the Freakers’ Ball, with Dr. Hook handling the title track, and recorded the quirky Silverstein song “Do You Want to Boogie or Do You Don’t” that year as well.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHaffkine and his wife of 37 years, Sydney, moved to Mexico several years ago.

{"title": "‘Totally Killer’ Review: Kiernan Shipka in a Fun-Enough Time-Traveling ’80s Slasher Flick", "date": "2023-10-06 00:02:36", "text": "Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nNahnatchka Khan directs Blumhouse's horror-comedy about a Gen Z teen who accidentally time-travels to the 1980s, where she tries to stop a serial killer's spree before it ever begins.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\tAngie Han\n\nTelevision Critic\n\n\tThe easiest way to describe Totally Killer is by listing all the other movies it calls to mind. Plot-wise, it’s a Back to the Future-style time travel adventure crossed with a Halloween-inspired slasher, all cast in a Scream-lite sense of self-awareness; tonally, its mashup of comedy and horror lands in the same general area as The Final Girls or the Happy Death Day movies.\n\n\tIf it its ingredients feel familiar, however, the script (by David Matalon, Sasha Perl-Raver and Jen D’Angelo) injects them with just enough heart and humor to keep them from feeling stale. Totally Killer may not be destined to become a classic in its own right.

Johnson, Liana Liberato, Kelcey Mawema, Nathaniel Appiah and Jonathan Potts, Randall Park, Julie Bowen\nDirector: Nahnatchka Khan\nScreenwriters: David Matalon, Sasha Perl-Raver, Jen D'Angelo\n\n\tIts unwitting Marty McFly is Jamie (Kiernan Shipka), a stereotypically rebellious teenager whose stereotypically overprotective parents (Julie Bowen and Lochlyn Munro) have more reason than most to be paranoid: 35 years ago, when they were still in high school, three of their friends were murdered in a single week. Their worst fears are realized when the still-unidentified Sweet Sixteen Killer returns to claim another victim on Halloween 2022. As he sets his sights on Jamie, she takes shelter in a time machine that hurls her back to 1987, via some endearingly chintzy graphics.\n\n\tThe unplanned journey inevitably sets up a clash of Gen Z and Gen X sensibilities, and Totally Killer plays out most of the expected beats. Jamie groans at the formerly racist school mascot, cringes at the overtly misogynistic language of her parents’ generation, coughs at the omnipresent clouds of cigarette smoke. There are a few clever subversions, like when Jamie unknowingly scarfs half a dozen pot brownies, only to find herself totally unaffected because “’80s weed sucks.” And the requisite Q&A about the future takes a wry ’20s turn when Jamie explains that no, the machines do not end up killing us all a la Terminator or RoboCop — “they more just rip apart the fabric of our society through dance videos on TikTok.”\n\n\tNone of its observations about the generational divide are really sharp enough to draw blood, however. This is neither a Gen Z satire like Bodies Bodies Bodies nor a Gen X nostalgia trip like Stranger Things. The film is more about actual blood. Though Jamie spends her stay in 1987 trying to stop the killings before they happen, largely by trying to befriend the victims so she can persuade them to make different choices, she’s more successful at changing the details of the murders than preventing them altogether. Totally Killer could probably stand to be a bit gorier, given its R rating, but its spurts of violence are paced at a brisk enough clip to keep a viewer engaged throughout its 103 minutes.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tMeanwhile, its time-travel shenanigans are played with a cheerful light touch. In the present, Jamie’s tech-whiz best friend, Amelia (Kelcey Mawema), works on fixing the time machine so Jamie can come home; in the past, Amelia’s even more brilliant future mother, Lauren (Troy L. Johnson), does the same. Both are surprisingly blasé about the whole affair. “You don’t start trying to invent time travel without considering the possibility that people from the future wil need your help,” Lauren shrugs when Jamie expresses surprise at how well she’s taking all of this. As with most time travel movies, the plot mechanics work best if you don’t think about them too hard, especially toward the end. They hang together just well enough while it matters to add an extra jolt of urgency to Jamie’s timeline-altering quest.\n\n\tAnd, sometimes, an extra tinge of poignancy. Totally Killer isn’t an especially emotional movie. To the contrary, everyone in its version of the 1980s is so unmoved even by the shocking events unfolding within it that the one time a guy weeps over his girlfriend’s death, a newscaster deems the display “fascinating.” But it locates a beating heart in the evolving bond between Jamie and Pam (Olivia Holt), her mother’s younger self. The pair aren’t exactly buddies to start. Jamie’s horrified to discover that Pam is an archetypal mean girl who thinks it “hilarious” to trick a social outcast into believing a popular boy likes her. (Carrie would have existed by this point, but maybe Pam never watched it?) For her part, Pam is understandably weirded out by the stranger barging into her friends’ lives out of nowhere, bearing bizarre warnings about impending doom.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tBut the adventure puts Jamie in the position of trying to protect the very same person whose protection she’ll shrug off 35 years later, and in doing so forces her to see Pam in a new light. Shipka is charming as a thoroughly modern heroine who can slip between baseball-bat-toting badassery and heart-on-sleeve sincerity — and though Pam’s response to the latter is to scoff that “nobody wants to hear you talk about how much you love your mom,” Holt shades her with just enough vulnerability that we can see the caring woman she’ll become underneath the queen-bitch teen she is currently. \n\n\tTheir nascent friendship makes Totally Killer easy to root for, even when its jokes don’t land as sharply as they could or its kills fail to leave a memorable impression. It also makes the film feel surprisingly wholesome, despite all the bloodletting and the horny teen hookups and the seemingly endless supply of weed and beer. It might even make you, by the end of it all, want to call your mom and tell her that you love her.\nDistributor: Amazon Studios\nProduction companies: Blumhouse Television, Divide/Conquer, Fierce Baby Productions\nCast: Kiernan Shipka, Olivia Holt, Charlie Gillespie, Lochlyn Munro, Troy L.

Under the guise of cracking Wineman’s back, Fuller “pressed his penis against plaintiff’s buttocks” and held it there so “plaintiff could feel it through the fabric” of his pants,” the lawsuit states.\n\n\tWineman also says Fuller’s “preoccupation with masturbation permeated everything.” The complaint claims that Fuller “frequently brought up his penis,” whether it was “reading material that gave him erections,” actors that he “masturbated so much to” or “adult/child power dynamics in stories that he was ‘wanking it to.'”\n\n\tThe allegedly hostile work environment extended to “relentless verbal harassment and casual bullying,” the lawsuit says. Wineman alleges that Fuller often berated him until he cried and retaliated against him by sabotaging shots, heckling interviewees and ignoring him for weeks at a time. The complaint adds that Fuller “made discriminatory comments targeting groups that crew and interviewees belonged to, plaintiff included, frequently proclaiming his hatred of all gay men.”\n\n\tThe complaint alleges quid pro quo sexual harassment, retaliation, harassment and hostile work environment and negligent hiring, among other claims.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nUnique expertise on how the law impacts Hollywood pros, projects and processes\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}
{"title": "‘Pet Sematary: Bloodlines’ Filmmaker Lindsey Anderson Beer Talks Her Prequel to Stephen King’s Classic Novel and Tarantino’s ‘Star Trek’", "date": "2023-10-05 23:10:05", "text": "Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nThe screenwriter-turned-director boasts a lengthy list of IP involvement, including 'Trek' — which afforded her a front row seat to Tarantino expounding for 20 minutes straight about what his R-rated movie could be.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy \n\n\tBrian Davids\n\nWriter\n\n\tGuillermo Del Toro often says that a filmography is actually a biography for the filmmaker involved, but in the case of Lindsey Anderson Beer, her filmography doesn’t come close to telling her story.\n\n\tBeer is currently making her feature directorial debut with Pet Sematary: Bloodlines, a prequel to Stephen King’s classic horror novel Pet Sematary (1983) that explores Jud Crandall’s (Jackson White) backstory and finally defines the Timmy Baterman (Jack Mulhern) story that has only been alluded to in various on-screen adaptations. The Paramount+ film originally began as a prequel to 2019’s Pet Sematary, however, once Beer came on board to write and direct, Bloodlines instead morphed into a prequel to King’s book.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllen Burstyn on Why Her Career Is Busier Than Ever: \"Everybody Else Who Could Play Those Parts Has Already Died\"\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tLifestyle\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSia Drops Signature Wig for Beauty Event to Debut Facelift and Honor Plastic Surgeon: \"He Is Incredible\"\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“I was actually not trying to tailor it to the 2019 film. In my head, it’s a prequel to the book,” Beer tells The Hollywood Reporter. “I was just trying to do my own thing, and the book, to me, is what was sacred. So I just treated that as my North Star.”\n\nBloodlines may be Beer’s first directorial outing, but she’s been a prolific screenwriter for nearly a decade now. She’s worked on a staggering list of franchises as either a screenwriter or a member of a writers’ room in order to develop long-term plans or cinematic universes for some of those properties. Her filmography may not reflect her wide variety of experiences, but that partial list of IP includes: Transformers, Star Trek, Fast and Furious, the Godzilla-led MonsterVerse, The Wizard of the Oz, Pacific Rim, Sleepy Hollow, Sony’s Spider-Man Universe, Bambi and Hello Kitty.\n\n\tOne of Beer’s most memorable moments as a working screenwriter took place in Quentin Tarantino’s writers’ room for his now-defunct R-rated Star Trek film. \n\n\t“There was a funny moment where [Tarantino] just stopped in the middle of that room and turned to me and said, ‘Lindsey, you’re really good at this,’” Beer recalls. “And getting that compliment from somebody whose career I admire so much meant a lot, obviously.”\n\n\tBelow, during a conversation with THR that took place prior to the end of the WGA strike, Beer also reflects on how much the Transformers writers’ room impacted her career, before addressing the entertainment industry’s current existential crisis at length.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo you have a fun name, and the name of your production company, Lab Brew, implies that you’re well aware of that. Do you think that type of childhood nameplay was the first domino to fall en route to you eventually becoming a writer? Was that the first writing muscle you developed?\n\n\tThat is a really good question that I have honestly thought about, and I wasn’t teased for my last name the way you would think I was. I really wasn’t. The worst of it was guys bringing me to high school parties and being like, “I brought the beer!” That isn’t very traumatic, but it probably did help instill at least an appreciation for comedy and writing.\n\nWhat was the actual path to becoming a screenwriter? It wasn’t a direct line from what I understand.\n\n\tWell, it wasn’t a direct line and not because of an intention. As a child, I always wanted to be a director, and I separately wanted to be a novelist. I had no real interest in being a screenwriter, partly because I didn’t know they existed when I was a kid. But I knew that I loved science fiction and that it would probably be my focus. And so in college, I studied neuroscience and robotics as a backdrop to what I hoped would be a great science fiction career. And then I went on to New York where I thought I would start writing my first novel in addition to taking some filmmaking classes. I ended up in branding and marketing for some large companies to support myself at the time, and then I found myself not actually pursuing the creative arts and getting lost in New York life. And then I had a big life event that made me refocus my efforts. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSo I moved to L.A. I drove across the country with my sister, and I started writing as many scripts as I could. I’m a fast writer, so it was a lot. I then networked as much as I could with any assistant that I could and just got my scripts out there. I was pretty shameless. I got an IMDbPro account, and I just started cold-emailing production companies with loglines and scripts. They say they won’t read things on their websites, but they actually do. And through all of this effort, I got my stuff read and things just swelled from there. So I had always wanted to be a director, but until the last couple of years, there wasn’t that much openness to women directing. I couldn’t get people to let me direct my own stuff.\n\nGender is a huge factor without question, but I’ve heard so many stories of now-prominent filmmakers having to sell their early scripts for a more experienced director to bring to life. The powers that be want experience, but they aren’t willing to dole it out.\n\n\tYeah, there’s certainly a rite of passage that you have to go through. I have been making movies since I was maybe nine or ten years old, and I’m also a little bit of a compulsive photographer. So I felt like I was able to take that love of visual language and translate it into world building, and that became a valuable skill on the writing side. But I for sure needed to pay those dues, earn that trust and goodwill and build up the right relationships to be able to direct.\n\nYour filmography is not an accurate representation of your career because you’ve been involved in the development of so many big movies. I tried to organize all of those properties, and I became overwhelmed rather quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t(Laughs.)\n\nSo what got the ball rolling on this type of work? What got you in the rotation? \n\n\tHonestly, it was a surprise to me. I came to L.A. wanting Tarantino’s career. I really thought I was going to be on the indie writer-director path, and it just became one thing after another. There were a few coincidences, and a lot of it had to do with my background in robotics and people needing someone with expertise in areas that I had and that lending itself to larger sci-fi projects like Transformers. The genesis of the bigger franchises was a general meeting, and I had written this kind of [Guillermo] Del Toro, darker story about an undead robot. And the person who read it said, “I really feel like if you turn this more into a [Tim] Burton film, there’s a home for it at Disney.” So I rewrote it to be much lighter family fare, and then we gave it to Disney. They didn’t want to buy it, but it did lead to Disney hiring me for a different family film, which was my first big foray into fantasy adventure.\n\n\tOff of that, I got a job at Warner Bros. doing The Wizard of Oz, and off of that, out of happenstance, I had a general meeting with Akiva Goldsman’s company. His executive called Akiva in at one point, and it came up that I had a background in studying artificial intelligence and robotics. And Akiva just so happened to be putting together the Transformers writers’ room at the time and he said, “Would you ever be interested in writing a Transformers film?” And I said, “Absolutely.” So it just kind of happened that I was put in that room, and it began the trend of doing writers’ rooms for big franchises.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThat Transformers writers’ room wasn’t a “let’s break one Transformers story” kind of a room. They said, “Everybody involved here can pitch their own Transformers movie. We can make 12 movies. This is a cinematic universe.” The only thing that was predetermined was that Steven Spielberg really wanted to do a Bumblebee movie and this Amblin-esque thing. And since I’d been writing family movies, everybody thought that I would take that one. And I weighed that, because, clearly, if Spielberg is behind that one and it’s the only one he has an idea for, then that’s the one that’s going to get made. But I was so hungry to move into something that felt a little bit more in line with what I was going for originally, which was a little bit more intense.\n\n\tAnd so I decided, “No, I don’t want to take that one. I just want to pitch the most epic fucking Transformers movie that I can think of, even knowing that it probably won’t get made. But hopefully the right people will hear it and they’ll see that I can do that.” So that’s what I did. I pitched the biggest, darkest, most epic thing I could think of, and I was so excited by it. Paramount and the producers were, too, so that room ignited a great relationship with the producers that ended up producing this movie, Pet Sematary: Bloodlines. It also ignited a great relationship with Paramount, and word spread that I was good at cracking IP. So I started being put in all these writers’ rooms, but I also started being asked to help people crack IP, including Star Trek, which started as the Tarantino writers’ room. Tarantino wanted to do a Star Trek room, which was the most fun room I’ve ever done.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWe got in there and he started with, “So what are your guys’ ideas for a movie?” and I think I went first. So he listened to us patiently and just kind of nodded his head, and then he took out his notebook and started talking for 20 minutes with lines of dialogue and passionate ideas that he’d already written. It wasn’t really a story yet; they were just random thoughts he had on a movie, but it was so passionate and so wonderful. And I laughed to myself and thought, “Well, why didn’t we start with that?” There was a funny moment where he just stopped in the middle of that room and turned to me and said, “Lindsey, you’re really good at this.” And getting that compliment from somebody whose career I admire so much meant a lot, obviously. \n\n\tSo that room was also the beginning of a very strong relationship with Bad Robot, and I’ve been brought in a few times on different iterations of Trek, most recently on Star Trek 4. And so Transformers, Star Trek, Di Bonaventura Pictures, Bad Robot and Paramount are the confluence of how all of this came together in terms of me directing Pet Sematary. I was at the point in my career where I had written a bunch of things, and I just felt that I had reached a point where I couldn’t write without directing anymore. \n\n\tSo I said that to my agents and they said, “Well, let’s set some meetings with producers you have strong relationships with.” And one of those was Mark Vahradian who said, “I have to produce whatever you want to direct.” A couple of weeks later, he called and said, “Would you ever be interested in Pet Sematary?” And I said, “Absolutely. It’s my favorite Stephen King book.” I also happened to be writing Star Trek 4 at the time for Paramount, and so I had a good thing with them, although they probably weren’t super happy that I was looking at another project at the same time.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tBut the triangulation of those relationships that led me to Pet Sematary, and I had developed a really good shorthand with Paramount and the same producers from Transformers. We were very aligned in terms of character-driven storytelling, even if it was big IP. So it all just came together and happened really quickly. I was hired in March [2021], and I turned around two drafts a week for several months until we were greenlit in May and prepping in June.\n\nWhat makes some of these big movies so difficult to crack? \n\n\tWhat makes them difficult to crack is that they’re often made by committee, as opposed to an auteur. With something like Barbie or Nolan’s Batmans, if you entrust that IP to somebody with a strong point of view, you’re in much better shape, as opposed to when you try to design these stories by committee and you make the IP the only stars of that. The normal development process of writer after writer after writer assumes that there is an objective best way to tell a story, which is just inherently false. A story is, by nature, subjective, and you just need a strong subjective point of view and to trust in that storyteller and invest in that point of view. So that’s why a writers’ room with a showrunner works, but not just a random feature writers’ room. So I think it gets broken just because there are too many cooks in the kitchen and nobody trusts someone to lead, unless it’s somebody like Christopher Nolan.\n\nAs a fan of King’s book, how would you describe your relationship to Mary Lambert’s Pet Sematary (1989), as well as the rest of King’s work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPet Sematary was the first Stephen King book that I read when I was about nine years old. I saw it on the library shelf, and as a big animal lover, I was tricked by pets. So I stayed up all night and read it, cover to cover, and I loved it. And then I ended up sneaking a copy of the movie from a family friend’s library and made my sister watch it. She hated it, I loved it and I just kept re-watching it. So it definitely ignited a lifelong love of Stephen King, and from there, I read literally everything that he’s written.\n\nPieces of the Timmy Baterman story already existed, but in general, was it daunting to invent lore and backstory within King’s world?\n\n\tNot daunting, no. It was really fun. I love that stuff. I re-read the book maybe 20 times while writing the script and just looked for little phrases and threads. There’s so much mythology in there that’s hinted at but not fully explained. So, as a fan, there’s stuff that I’d always wanted answers to, and I found it really satisfying and fun to pull on those threads and try to weave them together.\n\nYou had the tricky task of teaching a younger Jud Crandall a lifelong lesson about the Pet Sematary, all while knowing that he later defies that lesson with the Creed family. Was it difficult to reconcile those two points?\n\n\tI was actually hoping to reconcile it and answer that question, and there were cuts of this movie that maybe did it more explicitly. The book basically suggests that this evil targeted Jud as an older man because he had encountered Timmy and fought the evil as a younger man. So the more desperate or weak or feeble-minded you are, the more this evil force can get in your head. So Jud had fought this off for most of his life, but as he got a little older and a little more forgetful, it whispered to him and convinced him to tell Louis Creed about the burial ground.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project originally started as a prequel to the 2019 reimagining, but it sounds like you approached this as more of a prequel to the book. Is that correct?\n\n\tI was actually not trying to tailor it to the 2019 film. In my head, it’s a prequel to the book. [2019’s writer] Jeff Buhler was the writer on Bloodlines before I came aboard, so I have no idea where conversations started with him and the producers. Perhaps they talked about it more specifically as a prequel to the 2019 movie, but in my mind, so much of the mythology is kind of rewritten. I was just trying to do my own thing, and the book, to me, is what was sacred. So I just treated that as my North Star.\n\nBased on what you’ve said so far about Tarantino, it now makes further sense why you cast Pam Grier in Bloodlines. Was it quite a thrill to rub elbows with her on set?\n\n\tPam’s roles in exploitation films in the ‘70s and also Tarantino’s Jackie Brown are why I wanted to cast her in this movie, and she was the first-and-only person I went to for the role. As badass as you might think Pam Grier is, you are wrong: she is more badass than that in real life. She constantly had me laughing on set, and has the most amazing stories. She’s less the type to rub elbows and more the type to put you in a headlock. She was actually on the set of the first Pet Sematary, visiting Mary Lambert, so this was a long time coming for her. She loves Stephen King, and if anyone is listening, she’d love a role in the Shining universe.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did you decide on your style, both on the screen and on the set?\n\n\tIn terms of my aesthetic style, I can’t say how I arrived on it because I think that just comes inherently. I love so many movies from Tarantino and Fincher and Director Park [Chan-wook] and surrealist stuff that feels very extreme and full of contrasts. I wanted to imbue the film with a lot of the things that I’m drawn to in my photography, which are strange angles, super close-ups and also super wides that feel a little graphical. I’m always drawn to contradictions and contrasts. This movie has this beautiful small town during a time period that we think of as a little idyllic. It’s also a hippie time. So I wanted to subvert that beauty and show a lot of ugliness. Those two contrasts, both visually and thematically, were very interesting to me.\n\n\tAs far as my directing style, as a human, I believe in being very grateful and being very kind to everybody. I don’t believe that directing requires ruling by fear or condescension. It’s incredibly important to keep people motivated and inspired and happy. I did seek out advice in terms of just management and process on set, and J.J. Abrams was particularly helpful and kind and generous with his recommendations on how to handle on-set logistics and politics. He’s somebody who’s just an incredibly generous person in general, and I had been working with him very closely on the Star Trek stuff at the same time. Honestly, he was the only person I talked to at length about advice. So I just tried to follow my heart in terms of being a human being and extending that on set, and not changing who I am just because it’s a work setting.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat surprised you the most about your first go-round as director? \n\n\tHow energizing it was. I’d only heard how exhausting and terrible it is. I mean, I was working 18 to 20 hour days on this for three years, and I definitely collapsed the day I finished the film. I felt like shit. But for those three years I felt so energized. Even on the longest and toughest days, I just felt grateful and happy and excited and inspired.\n\nOddly enough, I brought up your name in my very first THR interview five-and-a-half years ago. It was with Emily Carmichael for Pacific Rim: Uprising, and I noticed at the time that there were at least a half-dozen female screenwriters working on huge tentpoles. So, from your vantage point, have circumstances improved at all for female screenwriters and directors these last five years? \n\n\tThe statistics say not really, which is really unsettling. I also worked on Pacific Rim with Emily, who’s great. By the way, I met two of my closest friends in the business in the Transformers writers’ room, Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Christina Hodson, and they’ve all gone on to do amazing things. By them being more visible, I hope it not only encourages studios and networks to hire more women, but also encourages more women to fight hard to be in those positions. But it’s really scary to me. There was a little bit of a bump right after the Me Too movement. There was a marginal bump in the number of female writers and directors hired, but then it fell off again. So I don’t know exactly what to attribute it to, but it is really disheartening. I won’t name names, but it’s also really disheartening when you look at the female filmmakers who’ve made amazing films and haven’t been rewarded with lifelong careers the way that a lot of men are who’ve made much lesser films.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe industry is in a state of disarray to say the least. Given your background in AI, what’s your take on that issue and the strike? [Writer’s Note: This interview took place before the end of the WGA strike.]\n\n\tI hope there is a swift resolution that is beneficial to all. I know some people see AI as an interesting tool, but I myself see it as a cheat. I would never use AI to help me write a script, no more than I would say, “Hey, writer’s assistant, write half the script for me and then I’ll take credit for it.” (Laughs.) To me, it’s disingenuous and really contrary to the artistic process.\n\nOne minute, they’re saying that they don’t value you enough to give you the contract that you want, but the next minute, they’ll make it known that they apparently do value you enough to have AI scan all of your work. It’s contradictory.\n\n\tIt is. I was just reading an article last night about how CEO jobs are actually the jobs that AI are most adept at replacing, and I can see that because it’s all about optimization. So what’s going on in Hollywood is really just a microcosm for what’s going on everywhere, which is that CEOs everywhere are overpaid compared to the employees that work under them. And there’s a devaluation of not just creative work, but work everywhere and that needs to be addressed.\n\nAnd of all this just compounds the uphill battle that underrepresented writers and directors are already facing.\n\n\tThe critical issues of diversity, AI and the strike are actually all intertwined in that this industry faces an existential crisis unless we prioritize and value the contributions of artists and their authentic experiences. Can AI write a competent script? Yes, it probably can – if not now, very soon. A friend recently typed into ChatGPT, “Give me a new season of a [long-running TV show I won’t name],” and in seconds, not minutes, it spewed out a convincing season arc that would have taken a writers’ room weeks to months to come up with. These were just summaries, not full scripts. I’m sure the ChatGPT scripts of today would be filled with oddities and errors that a human would have to revise and make sense of, but in a few years, undoubtedly the scripts will be serviceable. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThis efficiency cannot replace the sheer magic of a writers’ room, where writers treat the story-breaking process like therapy and infuse their real-life, relatable experiences. Contributors are moved to laughter or tears in the room, as audiences then are in turn when watching these real-life moments infused into shows. We need more realness and humanity in our stories, not less. Our industry cannot survive on “serviceable” content. Competent, coherent-enough plot lines aren’t enough to capture audience attention for long. We have seen what has happened to the film industry and what IP-driven studio filmmaking by committee has given us: the near-death of an industry, and viewer fatigue even for what once was the most shiny of IP. \n\n\tWhat has been the shining hope this summer? Barbie and Oppenheimer. Two movies that were filmmaker-driven, with very specific and authentic points of view. Movies that were not and could not have been made by committee. I have no doubt that there are men who could have written and directed a very funny Barbie movie, but it wouldn’t have been the phenomenon that was Barbie, because Greta Gerwig tapped into her authentic experience as a woman navigating the patriarchy in a way that made women all over the world laugh and cry. Just as only someone with an authentic Black POV could give us the genius that is Get Out. \n\n\tWhen studios value and trust in creatives, magic can happen. This is why we need more female and diverse filmmakers and writers. When an artist can tap into their experiences in a real way, rather than regurgitate things they’ve seen on screen, audiences can feel it. If we start giving liberties to a more diverse set of artists to tell their human, diverse stories, people will tune in. Stories will feel different and engaging, and touch us in ways we can’t explain. Audiences will show up because something will have been created that looks like a delightful surprise, something they haven’t seen before. Cinema will be saved by original stories or original takes on IP, from creatives from a wide array of backgrounds and experiences. Replacing human writers with AI, even if feasible, would not just mean the death of writers; I believe it would mean the ultimate death of the industry.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you say what was supposed to be next?\n\n\tI can’t say too much about all the stuff in my life, but I turned in the first draft of Sleepy Hollow before the strike started. It’s something that I’m writing, directing and producing, and I’m excited to get back to that after the strike is over.\n\n\t***Pet Sematary: Bloodlines debuts October 6th on Paramount+.

An animal, a savage, subhuman,” is what Playboy magazine made of him in an October 1971 profile.\n\n\tLate NFL Films co-founder Steve Sabol once called Butkus his favorite NFL player, saying, “To me, his career was the most sustained work of devastation ever committed, anywhere, anytime. … Remember how he used to tackle? If anything were hanging out — whether it was your chinstrap, elbow pad, shoulder pad, shoe — it would be ripped off. He mauled and tore ball carriers apart.”\n\n\tChicago through and through, Butkus was born in the city and went to Chicago Vocational High School before starring at the University of Illinois. The Bears retired his No. 51 in 1994.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/BxVt7EfV9Q\n\n\tAfter hanging up his helmet, Butkus displayed a flair for comedy in his Miller Lite commercials, often appearing along another former NFL scruncher, Bubba Smith, where they tried to pass themselves off as refined gentlemen who play polo and tennis and attend the opera.\n\n\tWhen it came to acting, “I was worried about making a mistake, because people would say, ‘He’s just a football player,’ so I was harder on myself to do it right,” he told the Chicago Tribune in 1998. “Then I learned from the Miller Lite commercials. ‘Who cares if you blow a line?’ It doesn’t matter if you do it in one take or 100 takes, if I can do it better each time.\n\n\t“The end result is what people see. Working with Bubba, I was able to add things with facial gestures and stuff. … I could play off him and add something. It didn’t matter if I got the laugh.”\n\n\tThe youngest of nine children in a Lithuanian-American family, Richard Marvin Butkus was born on Dec. 9, 1942. His father was an electrician, and his mother worked in a laundry. Raised on the South Side of town, he rooted for the old Chicago Cardinals and added muscle by moving furniture with his four older brothers.\n\n\tButkus played fullback and linebacker in high school, making 70 percent of his team’s tackles, then led the Fighting Illini to a Rose Bowl victory over Washington in 1964 as a junior.\n\n\tIn an Oct. 12, 1964, cover story for Sports Illustrated, Dan Jenkins kicked off his piece about him: “If every college football team had a linebacker like Dick Butkus of Illinois, all fullbacks soon would be three feet tall and sing soprano. Dick Butkus is a special kind of brute whose particular talent is mashing runners into curious shapes.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe Bears selected him with the No. 3 pick in the 1965 NFL Draft, then signed him for less money than the Denver Broncos of the rival American Football League were offering — Butkus wanted to play in Chicago.\n\n\tAs a rookie, he was named to the All-NFL first team (the first of six times) and made the Pro Bowl for the first of eight straight seasons. He finished his career with an NFL record 27 opponents’ fumble recoveries, many coming as the result of his jarring hits, and ESPN named him the 70th greatest athlete of the 20th century.\n\n\t“When I went out on the field to warm up, I would manufacture things to make me mad,” he once said. “If someone on the other team was laughing, I’d pretend he was laughing at me or the Bears. It always worked for me.”\n\n\tWhile he was still playing, Butkus appeared in a commercial for Prestone antifreeze on the first-ever Monday Night Football telecast in 1970 and showed up in Brian’s Song, the acclaimed 1971 ABC telefilm about his doomed teammate, running back Brian Piccolo.\n\n\tButkus said he fought the “dumb jock” stereotype in Hollywood with the help of actor friends like Larry Hagman and Tom Poston.\n\n\tIn addition to the Miller Lite spots, Blue Thunder and Half Nelson, he and Smith also were paired on episodes of Coach and MacGyver; in a 1978 TV movie, Superdome; and in the 1990 sequel Gremlins 2: The New Batch.\n\n\tBefitting a real actor, Butkus did a spaghetti Western, Cipolla Colt (1975), and his home in Malibu is on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHe also received high marks for playing Brom Bones in a 1980 telefilm adaptation of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and appeared in other movies like Mother, Jugs & Speed (1976), Gus (1976), Johnny Dangerously (1984), Necessary Roughness (1991) and Any Given Sunday (1999).\n\n\tHis TV résumé also included episodes of Emergency!, Police Story, The Rockford Files, Growing Pains, Wonder Woman, Magnum, P.I. and Night Court.\n\n\tButkus replaced the fired Jimmy “The Greek” Snyder as a studio analyst for CBS’ The NFL Today in 1988 (he worked two seasons at that), was a WrestleMania referee and called Bears games on the radio.\n\n\tHe married his high school sweetheart, Helen Essenberg, in 1963, and they had three children, Ricky, Matt and Nikki.\n\n\tIn one of his last public appearances, he was at the Bears’ season-opener, a Sept. 10 loss to the Green Bay Packers at Soldier Field.\n\n\tIn another Sports Illustrated story, this one by Rick Telander in 2004, Butkus spelled out the difference between football and acting for him.\n\n\t“Football for me was never work,” he said. “If you love something, it’s not work. … But if acting were my real true love, I’d be honing my craft, wouldn’t I, over at some shitty theater?”\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}
