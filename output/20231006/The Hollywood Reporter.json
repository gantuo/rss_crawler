Mailbag\n\n\tWhy don’t streamers want to reveal ratings? And if broadcast shows are so popular on streaming, why don’t the platforms actually make broadcast shows themselves?\n\n2. October TV preview\n\n\tThe broadcast fare that typically returns in late September/early October is MIA as this month’s picks range from Loki, Frasier and spooky fare.\n\n3. Cancellation round-up\n\n\tThis week, a favorite of TV’s Top 5 — Max’s Sort Of — revealed it was wrapping its run after three seasons. Elsewhere, Paramount+ axed its iCarly revival. With that in mind, we review some of the big cancellations and shows/seasons that were outright scrapped during the past few months that we neglected to discuss because, well, the WGA strike took priority. And what’s more, this speaks to the larger trend of industry-wide contraction that began well before Hollywood’s labor unrest. Some of these were tied to the broadcast upfronts back in May, others happened more recently amid wholesale changes that came as a result of scaled back budgets and new priorities at networks and streamers. \n\n4. Best TV of the 21st Century\n\nTHR TV critics Angie Han and Robyn Bahr join the show this week to discuss how they — and Dan, of course — selected the best 50 TV shows of the 21st century. As it turns out, Mad Men was an easy pick for No. 1 but the rest of the list required hours of debate and discussion. Plus why shows like Friends didn’t make the cut.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Critic’s Corner\n\n\tAs usual, we end with Dan’s thoughts on this week’s new and returning series. In this episode, he weighs in on Loki, Our Flag Means Death, Bargain, Found and more.\n\n\tHear it all now on TV’s Top 5. Be sure to subscribe to the podcast to never miss an episode.

But there are plans to build seven studio stages that would provide a total of 150,000 square-foot of space (the biggest stage coming in at 30,000 square-feet), plus a further 90,000 square-feet of workshop and office space, with construction work set to start in spring 2024 and full completion anticipated by July 2025. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tLifestyle\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKilian Paris Closes Out Paris Fashion Week With Star-Studded, \"Smoking Hot\" Soirée\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tMovies\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWalt Disney Animation Studios' Jennifer Lee Talks 'Frozen 3,' 'Wish' and Relying on 'Cinderella' as an Escape When She Was Bullied in School\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe development — which Dunleavy says will cost “tens of millions of dollars” — would make Tara Studios Ireland’s largest facility for film and TV productions (a title currently held by Troy Studios, which boasts 100,000 square-foot across four stages and was the home of Apple TV+ sci-fi series Foundation).\n\n\tThe project is being fronted Dunleavy and veteran film financier John Gleeson, who heads up the Dublin office of Saffery, with the two hoping to tap into the significant demand for stage space in Ireland. The country has has long been a destination for major shoots that have taken advantage of its locations — recent significant productions include Cocaine Bear, Vikings: Valhalla, The Banshees of Inisherin and Bad Sisters — but has lacked in studio facilities.\n\n\t“The most recent projection is that around one million square feet of stage space is needed, and currently there’s about a quarter of a million,” explains Dunleavy.\n\n\tFinding the location for Tara Studios — named after a nearby hill — took Dunleavy and Gleeson around two years, with a key factor being its proximity to Dublin, to airports, and also to four- and five-star hotels for crews. Dunleavy also notes that there’s “complete privacy” on the estate, which isn’t visible from the road, offering the seclusion to build a backlot away from prying eyes.\n\n\tAnd in taking over Borleagh Manor — which went up for sale in 2020 and contains walled gardens and a stable yard alongside a grand manor house — Dunleavy and Gleeson have also tapped into a slice of Hollywood folklore, with the 18th-century estate once owned by 1950s matinee idol star Richard Greene, best known for playing the lead in British TV series The Adventures of Robin Hood. It’s said that Greene hosted the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Cary Grant and Richard Burton there. \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“There are lots of reports of Hollywood celebrities turning up at the house and enjoying dinners,” notes Dunleavy, who adds that they’ve honored its film connections by putting various images of its former owner on display. \n\n\tThe opening of Tara Studios comes at an anxious time for the industry, with streamers pulling back from the major spending on content that had driven so much of the demand for studio space and the actors strike having brought many productions to a standstill. But Dunleavy says he has little concern about attracting interest in his new venture.\n\n\t“I thin the global demand for new content has continued to rise. There have been a couple of obvious impacts, but the consumption of new material in the pandemic has got people in the habit of watching more, and the ebb and flow of larger projects versus smaller projects has been a factor in TV for decades,” he says. “I don’t think that would cause me any concern. Particular players will be up and down at any particular moment in time.”\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

But she claims Derulo repeatedly pressured her to drink and have sex with him, alleging there was an “explicit demand for sex-in-exchange-for-success.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tNews\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Black Keys, Jason Derulo to Perform at NFL TikTok Tailgate Ahead of Super Bowl\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tNews\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJason Derulo Exits CAA for UTA (Exclusive)\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAmong many claims, the lawsuit alleges that at one point Derulo told Gibson that if she wanted to be successful in “this business” she “would be required to partake in ‘goat skin and fish scales,’ which is a Haitian reference to conducting sex rituals, sacrificing a goat, goat blood and doing cocaine.'” The lawsuit claims that “the manner and timing of such a statement meant that Derulo was demanding sexual acts from [Gibson] in order for Derulo to fulfill his role as her mentor, supervisor and musical collaborator.”\n\n\tIn the complaint, Gibson alleges that Derulo would often schedule late night (9 p.m. to 2 a.m.) studio sessions and repeatedly invite her to drinks. The lawsuit claims Derulo “constantly pressured [Gibson] to drink with him despite [Gibson] repeatedly expressing she’s not a drinker. As a pretext, Derulo would “assure” [Gibson] he would arrange for an Uber to take her home.”\n\n\tIn another incident, the lawsuit claims that during a late-night recording session, Derulo again asked Gibson to have a drink with him. Gibson “reluctantly” agreed to have a drink with Derulo, but she was given “inappropriately large amounts of alcohol,” the suit says. “After this session, where [Gibson] declined to drink and have sex with Derulo, the offer to arrange for [Gibson] to get to and from Derulo’s studio ceased,” the complaint says.\n\n\tThe lawsuit says Derulo eventually stopped responding to Gibson’s messages and that in September 2022 she was dropped by Future History and Atlantic. \n\n\tAlong with Derulo and Future History, the complaint lists Atlantic Records (which has a joint venture with Future History), Derulo’s manager Frank Harris and RCA Records as defendants.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an interview Wednesday with NBC News, Gibson said the whole situation was “very heartbreaking.” “I have anxiety; I’m traumatized. I’ve dealt with inhumane work situations.… I’m at this point where I’m back to zero and I have nothing,” Gibson said. \n\n\tOn Thursday night, in a clip posted to Instagram, Derulo addressed the allegations without going into the specifics of Gibson’s claims. \n\n\t“I wouldn’t normally comment but these claims are completely false and hurtful,” Derulo said in a statement posted to his Instagram. “I stand against all forms of harassment and I remain supportive of anybody following their dreams.”\n\n\tHe added, “I’ve always strived to live my life in a positively impactful way, and that’s why I sit here before you deeply offended, by these defamatory claims. God bless.”\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nSubscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form."}

(1971), starring Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Harris.\n\n\tHaffkine recommended that Dr. Hook be used in Harry Kellerman, but for that to happen, the New Jersey band had to have a record deal. After the musicians did an impromptu live showcase in Davis’ office and were signed, Dr. Hook performed the Silverstein-written songs “Bunky and Lucille” and “Last Morning” in the movie.\n\n\tHaffkine also produced Silverstein’s 1972 music comedy album Freakin’ at the Freakers’ Ball, with Dr. Hook handling the title track, and recorded the quirky Silverstein song “Do You Want to Boogie or Do You Don’t” that year as well.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tHaffkine and his wife of 37 years, Sydney, moved to Mexico several years ago.
