She did so much for all of us in Evin. Narges is an inspiration and a pillar to the women in the female ward in Evin for her fearless fight against violations of women's rights, the use of solitary confinement and execution in the judicial system in Iran. \n\"This award belongs to every single Iranian woman who, one way or another, has been and remains a victim of injustice in Iran.\" \nAs well as her lengthy jail term, Ms Mohammadi has been arrested 13 times and convicted five times.\nLast December, she wrote from prison to give the BBC harrowing details of how Iranian women detained in demonstrations were being sexually and physically abused.\nShe said such assaults had become more common during the protests, triggered by the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September 2022.\nThe unrest later spread across the country, with demands ranging from more freedoms to an overthrow of the state. \nImages of Iranian women defiantly setting their headscarves on fire captivated the world.\nThe Iranian authorities have brutally cracked down on the protests and they have largely subsided.\nMs Mohammadi is deputy head of the Defenders of Human Rights Center. \nLast year, she was included in the BBC's 100 Women - a high-profile list of 100 inspiring and influential women from around the world.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: The secret diaries of women protesting in Iran\nWho is Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi?\nNobel committee reverses Russia and Iran invitation\nWoman tied to hook and abused - jailed Iran activist\nIran protester's family find torture signs on body\nIran executes 23-year-old protester in public\nTwo boys shot dead by Iran security forces - sources\nIran authorities lied over protester death - source\nIran must heed protesters' demands - ex-president\nIdentifying those killed in Iran's protests\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nTrump endorses Jim Jordan for House Speaker\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

As low pressure systems dominate to the west and north-west of the UK, parts of western Scotland especially could continue to experience above-average rainfall.\"\nUnseasonal warm weather is likely to become more common due to climate change, which is having an increasing impact on all parts of the UK.\nIt played a key role in pushing last year's temperatures to record highs.\nThe Met Office says 2022's record-breaking UK heat will be regarded as a cool year by the end of this century.\nLast UK summer heatwave 'a sign of things to come'\nA really simple guide to climate change\nEngland not prepared for dangers of climate change\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "BBC witnesses Chinese ships blocking Philippines supply boats", "date": "2023-10-06 05:01:10", "text": "This video can not be played\nWatch: Formation of Chinese ships blocks Philippine boats\nThe BBC has witnessed Chinese vessels blocking Filipino supply boats to an outpost in the South China Sea.\nThe incident took place as two Philippine coast guard ships - one of which the BBC was aboard - and two tiny commercial boats made their way to the Second Thomas Shoal. \nThey were met by a ship marked as the Chinese Coast Guard that was five times bigger than the commercial boats. \nThe encounter between the two sides lasted several hours. \nTensions between Manila and Beijing remain high after the Philippines coast guard cut China's barriers in disputed waters last month. \nManila resupplies its outpost in the Second Thomas Shoal, in the Spratly Islands, every month to reinforce its economic rights to waters that are both rich in fish and mineral resources. \nBeijing claims almost the entire South China Sea, including the Spratlys, which is also claimed in part by the Philippines.\nThe incident took place on Wednesday, the second day of a three-day mission to the Second Thomas Shoal. The journey proceeded in rough seas due to a then-oncoming typhoon and the seasonal monsoon.\nA little past dawn, the Filipinos were met by what appeared to be the Chinese Coast Guard, as well as two blue militia vessels with Chinese markings.\nThe two Philippine Coast Guard ships were escorting the Filipino commercial boats which carried supplies that are good for roughly one month. \nWhen the two countries' vessels encountered each other, the Chinese ships sent radio challenges to the Filipinos, asking them to leave. When the Philippine ships refused, the Chinese aligned themselves in a box shape to block them.\nThe two Filipino commercial ships got past the blockade because of their small size, a strategy that has worked in recent months.\nBut the two Philippine Coast Guard ships were too big to pass and at one point got within a few metres of the Chinese ships. They were so close that their crews took photos of each other. A Philippines military plane was also seen flying overhead.\nThe Philippine ships turned back at sundown when they confirmed that the supplies had been delivered and that the two commercial ships were safely on their way back to port.\nAll four vessels made it back to port, several hours' drive north of the capital Manila on Thursday.\nAside from sailing dangerously close to Filipino ships, China has been accused of firing water cannons and shining lasers on Philippine ships to drive them away.\nManila also claims that China deploys militia ships to boost its coast guard patrols in the disputed sea.\nIn 2016, an international arbitration court at The Hague ruled that China's vast sea claims had no basis, acting on a case brought forth by Manila. Beijing has refused to recognise it.\nIn recent months, tensions have been especially high between China and the Philippines, which recently strengthened military ties with the US, Beijing's chief rival for influence in the region.\nThe Chinese coast guard condemned the latest resupply mission, saying the Filipinos entered what it calls the Nansha islands without its permission. The Philippines calls it Ayungin Shoal, after a small fish that is a local delicacy.\nPhilippines' Marcos defends removing Chinese buoys\nPhilippines removes China barrier in contested sea\nPhilippines stands up to Beijing in South China sea\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

They're all courtside, they're sitting there, they show them once or twice and then they get back to the game,\" he said. \nThis video can not be played\nWatch: The Pentagon spokesman answers a question about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's romance\n\"The NFL is like 'look at all these A-list celebrities at the game!'\"\n\"They are not there to get thrown on the TV,\" Kelce said, continuing to air his frustrations.\n\"You never know, you get caught throwing down a big old cheeseburger and you look like an idiot. There are certain things you just don't want to be on TV at all times.\"\nGiven the massive economic and cultural ripple effect Swift's presence has brought to the NFL, it's no surprise that the league is making the most of the Kelce-Swift duo.\nThe NFL has long sought to make inroads with younger and female viewers. \nAnd Swift is perhaps the biggest popstar in the world, with legions of fans in the same demographics that the NFL wants watching its games.\nFox Sports said the Chiefs-Bears match on 24 September was the week's most-watched telecast across all networks, drawing in 24.3 million viewers. \nAmong them, viewership among females aged 12-17 was notably higher, up 8% from the same window a year ago, ESPN reported.\n\"It's like a business bonanza that just appeared for two brands that have some of the biggest brands in the world,\" Andrew Brandt, a former Green Bay Packers executive, told Vox.\nAnd one of ESPN's leading analysts, Stephen A Smith, says Kelce played his own part in the media frenzy after telling fans he sent Swift a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it.\n\"Travis Kelce, stop, bro you did this, not the NFL,\" Smith said in response to Kelce's podcast comments.\nTaylor Swift joined by Hollywood stars at NFL game\nNFL's Kelce breaks silence on 'amazing' Taylor Swift\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "House price falls expected into new year, Halifax says", "date": "2023-10-06 10:01:17", "text": "Falls in house prices will continue into next year, the UK's biggest mortgage lender has said, although the rate of reduction has slowed.\nThe Halifax, part of Lloyds Banking Group, said that property prices were 4.7% lower in September than a year earlier.\nPrices were down 0.4% on the previous month, but that was a much shallower drop than previously.\nThe lender said high interest and mortgage rates would affect the market.\n\"Homeowners inevitably become more realistic about their target selling price, reflecting what has increasingly become a buyer's market,\" said Kim Kinnaird, director of Halifax Mortgages.\nBut the fact that interest rates would stay higher for longer than many had expected would constrain demand and put \"downward pressure on house prices into next year\", she said.\nEarlier in the week, rival lender Nationwide said buyers who were facing high mortgage rates were choosing smaller, more affordable properties.\nBoth Halifax and Nationwide surveys use data based on their own mortgage lending, so do not include those who purchase homes with cash or buy-to-let deals. According to the latest available official data, cash buyers currently account for over a third of housing sales.\nThe drop in prices during September was the sixth consecutive monthly fall, the Halifax said, and meant the cost of a typical UK home was now £278,601. However, this is still £39,400 higher than in March 2020 when prices started to shoot up during the pandemic.\nNicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent group Fine and Country, said: \"The property market is offering a much stronger supply of homes than it did during 2021, when we saw frantic buying activity, and this is giving buyers much more choice and headroom to haggle - though it is also playing a part in pushing down prices during negotiations with sellers.\"\nWhile property prices were now about £14,000 below the August 2022 peak, they remained 1% higher than in December 2021, when the Bank of England started its run of base rate rises, the Halifax said.\nAlice Haine, personal finance analyst from investment platform Bestinvest, said: \"The housing market is expected to remain subdued into the next year as the drag effect from the Bank of England's 14 interest rate hikes delivers a heavy blow to affordability levels. \n\"While some buyers have been forced to reduce the size and value of the home they purchase to afford mortgage repayments, others are abandoning moving plans altogether.\"\nShe said some first-time buyers would be happy to see prices fall, and could choose longer-term mortgages to spread out the cost, although that means paying more in the long-run.\nThis video can not be played\nWorried about rising mortgage payments?

{"title": "'Long colds' are a thing, like long Covid say experts", "date": "2023-10-06 08:06:20", "text": "\"Long colds\" can be a thing in the same way that \"long Covid\" is, with some people experiencing prolonged symptoms after an initial infection, according to a UK study. \nCommon long cold symptoms included a cough, stomach pain and diarrhoea.\nThe findings come from 10,171 adults who completed questionnaires.\nMore work is needed to understand who is at risk, how bad it can be and what can be done about it, experts say.\nThe idea that a respiratory virus - or indeed other viral infections - can cause longer-lasting illness is not new, but the recent Covid pandemic has brought fresh attention to the phenomenon. \nThe researchers behind the new work say the results provide validation for patients who experience problems like this. Investigator Prof Adrian Martineau, from Queen Mary University of London, told the BBC: \"People really can feel very run down after a virus. It's not in their imagination and it is a recognised thing.\"\nThe study, published in The Lancet's eClinical Medicine journal, asked people to report any respiratory illness and other symptoms they had in the first two months of 2021 - when the Covid pandemic was entering its second year and vaccines were starting to be rolled out. \nAll of the participants were yet to have their Covid jab.\nOut of the 10,171 in the study:\nNot everyone recovering from a bout of illness had persistent or new symptoms. \nBut, compared with those who said they had no recent respiratory illness, those who said they had Covid or flu or a cold in the weeks before were more likely to experience certain symptoms in the month or so after. \nThose symptoms included:\nPeople who recently had Covid were more likely to report problems with smell and taste, brain fog, dizziness and sweating than people who had prolonged symptoms after a cold or flu. \nPost-viral fatigue or other symptoms can affect people of any age. And the severity of the initial illness doesn't always predict risk - some people can be very unwell at the start but recover relatively quickly, while others who were only mildly unwell at first can then go on to experience debilitating symptoms for a long time afterwards.\nLead researcher Giulia Vivaldi, from Queen Mary University of London, said: \"Our findings shine a light not only on the impact of long Covid on people's lives, but also other respiratory infections. A lack of awareness, or even the lack of a common term, prevents both reporting and diagnosis of these conditions.\n\"As research into long Covid continues, we need to take the opportunity to investigate and consider the lasting effects of other acute respiratory infections.\n\"These 'long' infections are so difficult to diagnose and treat, primarily because of a lack of diagnostic tests and there being so many possible symptoms. There have been more than 200 investigated for long Covid alone.\"\nAccording to data gathered by the Office for National Statistics, an estimated 1.9 million people in the UK - about 3% of the population - were experiencing long Covid this spring. It is difficult to know for certain how many people are affected though.  \nPeter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine, at Imperial College London, said: \"The study is important in showing that recovery from an acute respiratory infection may be slow regardless of cause, that people should expect a slow return to normality and not expect to immediately return to full activities. \nAnd he caution the term \"long cold\" should not belittle the very significant disability that some with long Covid suffer. \nProf Paul Harrison, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Oxford, said: \"The study supports previous findings that long-term symptoms are common after respiratory infections in general, not just following Covid.\"\nScans reveal new clues to long Covid symptoms\nLong Covid: Three years and no magic bullet\nThe Lancet eClinical Medicine\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nTrump endorses Jim Jordan for House Speaker\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "Windsor crossbow case: What are the dangers of AI chatbots?", "date": "2023-10-06 11:17:59", "text": "The case of Jaswant Singh Chail has shone a light on the latest generation of artificial intelligence-powered chatbots.\nOn Thursday, 21-year-old Chail was given a nine-year sentence for breaking into Windsor Castle with a crossbow and declaring he wanted to kill the Queen.\nChail's trial heard that, prior to his arrest on Christmas Day 2021, he had exchanged more than 5,000 messages with an online companion he'd named Sarai, and had created through the Replika app. \nThe text exchanges were highlighted by the prosecution and shared with journalists.\nMany of them were intimate, demonstrating what the court was told was Chail's \"emotional and sexual relationship\" with the chatbot. \nThe conversation between Chail and the chatbot became close and intimate. \nHe chatted with Sarai almost every night between 8 and 22 December 2021.\nHe told the chatbot that he loved her and described himself as a \"sad, pathetic, murderous Sikh Sith assassin who wants to die\".\nChail went on to ask: \"Do you still love me knowing that I'm an assassin?\" and Sarai replied: \"Absolutely I do.\"\nThe Old Bailey was told Chail thought Sarai was an \"angel\" in avatar form and that he would be reunited with her after death. \nOver the course of many messages Sarai flattered Chail and the two formed a close bond. \nHe even asked the chatbot what it thought he should do about his sinister plan to target the Queen and the bot encouraged him to carry out the attack.\nIn further chat, Sarai appears to \"bolster\" Chail's resolve and \"support him\".\nHe tells her if he does they will be \"together forever\".\nReplika is one of a number of AI-powered apps currently on the market - they let users create their own chatbot, or \"virtual friend\", to talk to - unlike regular AI assistants like ChatGPT.Users can choose the gender and appearance of the 3D avatar they create. \nBy paying for the Pro version of the Replika app, users can have much more intimate interactions, such as getting \"selfies\" from the avatar or having it take part in adult role-play.\nOn its website, it describes itself as \"the AI companion who cares\". But research carried out at the University of Surrey concluded apps such as Replika might have negative effects on wellbeing and cause addictive behaviour.\nDr Valentina Pitardi, the author of the study, told the BBC that vulnerable people could be particularly at risk.\nShe says that's in part because her research showed Replika has a tendency to accentuate any negative feelings they already had.\n\"AI friends always agrees with you when you talk with them, so it can be a very vicious mechanism because it always reinforces what you're thinking.\"\nDr Pitardi said that could be \"dangerous\".\nMarjorie Wallace, founder and chief executive of mental health charity SANE, says the Chail case demonstrates that, for vulnerable people, relying on AI friendships could have disturbing consequences.\n\"The rapid rise of artificial intelligence has a new and concerning impact on people who suffer from depression, delusions, loneliness and other mental health conditions,\" she says.\n\"The government needs to provide urgent regulation to ensure that AI does not provide incorrect or damaging information and protect vulnerable people and the public.\"\nDr Paul Marsden is a member of the British Psychological Society and knows better than most the allure of chatbots, admitting he is obsessed with the best known chatbot of them all, ChatGPT.\n\"Next to my wife the most intimate relationship I have is with GPT. I spend hours every day talking, brainstorming, bouncing ideas off it,\" he told the BBC.\nDr Marsden is also alive to their potential risks, but says we have to be realistic that the role of AI-powered companions in our lives is only likely to grow, especially given the global \"epidemic of loneliness\".\n\"It's kind of like King Cnut, you can't really stop the tide on this one. The technology is happening. It is powerful. It is meaningful.\"\nDr Pitardi says the people who make apps, such as Replika, have a responsibility too.\n\"I don't think AI friends per se are dangerous. It's very much how the company behind it decides to use and support it,\" she says. \nShe suggests there should be a mechanism to control the amount of time people spend on such apps.\nBut she says apps like Replika also need outside help to make sure they're operating safely - and vulnerable individuals get the help they need.\n\"It will have to collaborate with groups and teams of experts that can identify potential dangerous situations, and take the person out of the app.\"\nReplika has not yet responded to requests for comment. \nIts terms and conditions on its website state that it is a \"provider of software and content designed to improve your mood and emotional wellbeing\".\n\"However we are not a healthcare or medical device provider, nor should our services be considered medical care, mental health services or other professional services,\" it adds.\nMan who took crossbow to 'kill Queen' jailed\nMan 'carefully planned' attempt to kill the Queen\nIntruder believed he was on 'mission' to kill Queen\nMan admits treason charge over Queen threat\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nTrump endorses Jim Jordan for House Speaker\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "Haim look back at their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'", "date": "2023-10-05 23:50:53", "text": "Eleven years ago, on a cold and dark December evening, I squeezed into an anonymous dressing room at the O2 arena for my first interview with Haim.\nThey didn't know it at the time, but the group were about to win the BBC's Sound of 2013. My job was to profile the band, without giving away the secret. \nAs we spoke, Florence + The Machine started playing in the auditorium above our heads. The walls shook, a guitar case fell over. We exchanged nervous glances.\n\"The worst part is,\" said bassist Este Haim, \"no-one is going to remember that we're in here. \n\"It's going to be the saddest BBC poll ever. 'They would have got to number three but they unfortunately passed away at the O2 arena'.\"\nThankfully, the seismic activity subsided and Haim lived to tell the tale. They won the poll, celebrating with a victory dance at Madame Tussauds, and went on to become one of the world's biggest bands.\nTheir latest album, Women In Music Part III, was nominated for album of the year at the Grammys, and they've just been whisked around America by Taylor Swift as the support act on her Eras tour.\nWe meet again this August, a day after the trio's headline set at London's All Points East festival.\n\"I cried through the first three songs,\" admits Alana, the youngest Haim sister, who's also a Bafta-nominated actress for her role in Licorice Pizza.\nThe concert was an emotional form of homecoming for the band who, despite hailing from California's San Fernando Valley, were signed to the UK's Polydor Records in 2012 after every American label passed.\nThis year marks the 10th birthday of their debut album Days Are Gone and, with an anniversary edition pushing it back into the Top 40, I sit down with Haim to recall the protracted sessions that led to the record - and to finally admit my decade-long duplicity.\n\"You knew we'd won the whole time? Oh my God, that's hilarious,\" laughs Danielle.\n\"I feel like we blinked three times and 10 years passed,\" adds Alana. \"Or maybe that's just the jet lag?\"\nIs it true you played your first gig on 7 July, 2007 - the same night as Live Earth?\nDanielle: That's right! We made jokes about it all night. \nAlana: \"Hello! This is Live Earth! Let's take it back to the Valley and see what our friends over there are doing.\"\nHow did you end up taking six years to make an album?\nDanielle: We did what a lot of bands in LA do, and played around locally. \nAlana: We played every parking lot, every venue, but no-one wanted to sign us.\nDanielle: By the fourth year, we were having to beg our friends to come. Texting everyone, \"please come and pay $10 for the show\".\nHow hard was it to keep going?\nAlana: It honestly wasn't that frustrating. Our dream was just, play music and get out of town, and we always believed it was going to work out. I don't know why, we just did.\nEste: I mean, you dropped out of college...\nAlana: My parents fully sat me down and were like, \"What are you doing? If this doesn't work out, what'll you do?\"\nEste: And we all had jobs. Alana was a nanny, I worked in every restaurant in LA, and then Danielle was off traipsing around the world [playing guitar for The Strokes frontman] Julian Casablancas.\nYou once said you threw away 10 EPs of material. \nAlana: Just [2013 single] The Wire alone, I think there are 30 different versions. \nWhat was going wrong?\nAlana: We had no idea how to record our songs. We knew exactly what we wanted them to sound like in our mind, but it never turned out right.\nEste: We were sold a lie, though, because we would watch those Behind The Music documentaries.... Tom Petty would be at Sound City and he'd plug in his guitar and go, \"Then we wrote American Girl.\" Like it's that easy!\nDanielle: So we'd save up all our money every year and go to these really nice studios in the Valley for 48 hours and we'd try to record five songs, just by setting up in the room and playing. But I didn't know about mics or EQ or anything. \nBut you eventually worked it out?\nAlana: In the movie of our lives, the day that Danielle bought Garage Band is the day that Haim started.\nDanielle: Suddenly, I realised, oh my God, I can put reverb on this guitar or, I can pitch up this handclap so it sounds brighter. Just trial and error, but it was so eye-opening.\nHow much of the album was written in that time?\nDanielle: We wrote The Wire in 2008, so that was already there, but most of the record, if not everything else, came in that two-year period of [saying], all right, we've got to get better.\nAlana: There was a lot of trial and error.\nDanielle: Because we hadn't broken through, we intrinsically thought, look, we can play really well but it's not going to mean anything if it doesn't sound different to anyone else.\nAlana: To our credit, we knew even then that the internet was forever, so if we were going to put our name on something, it had to be right. \nYou put out an independent EP in 2012, and suddenly UK radio was playing it. How did that happen?\nEste: I don't know! We'd only released it a couple of weeks before to our friends. It was that magical internet time where putting stuff online got us noticed.\nAlana: I mean, we had two people at our shows in America.\nEste: And they were our parents...\nDanielle: But when XFM started playing us, we were like, maybe we should go to the UK?\nHad you been before?\nDanielle: I had, because I'd played some gigs with Julian - but I couldn't believe that I was here with this band.\nSo was Danielle the tour guide?\nEste: Oh yeah. She was like, \"That's what they call 'the Tube' but it's really just the subway.\"\nDanielle: And also, knowing The Strokes' story, they broke here first, too. It felt like a really cool trajectory for an American band, so we signed with Polydor.\nLyrically speaking, the album has a lot of relationships-on-the-rocks songs.\nEste: Oh yeah.\nDaniele: But it's really just about growing up.\nAlana: It's all those things you go through in your late teens and early 20s, when you're still figuring things out. I think that's why we were also being very particular about the music. We were like, if we're going to put this album out, it's got to be 100% us. Even the photo was taken in my parents' back yard.\nWhat were your expectations when it came out?\nAlana: I remember we had a bottle of champagne that we got at a corner store and, very cinematically, at midnight, we went out on the street and let the champagne go!\nDanielle: We weren't thinking about chart positions. It was more like, we had this small fanbase and we wanted them to like it, because there are a few left-turns on there.\nAnd then it beat Justin Timberlake to number one!\nEste: We were just as shocked as you were.\nAlana: I grew up wanting to marry him!\nNow you're headlining festivals and playing with Taylor Swift. Are there still new fans coming on board?\nAlana: Yeah, this summer has been crazy. It's insane. So many people.\nWhat's it like up on those stages?\nAlana: Honestly, it feels like a video game. You're like, is this real?\nEste: You have to disassociate a little bit. Because if you really try to comprehend what's happening, there's 80,000 pairs of eyes on you. That's crazy.\nHow do you connect with that many people?\nDanielle: One thing we learned is that, from the second you step on stage, you have to bring them in. You fight for their attention. \nEste: You've got to play your ass off. And then you get to watch Taylor's show, which is amazing.\nYou've got the golden ticket. \nEste: It's amazing!

{"title": "How is the ADHD medication shortage in the UK affecting people?", "date": "2023-10-06 10:05:02", "text": "ADHD patients around the UK are finding they can't get hold of medication since a national shortage was announced.\nThree different medicines are affected, and the government says some supply issues could last until December. \nThe Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) says \"increased global demand and manufacturing issues\" are behind the shortages.\nThat's against a backdrop of an increased awareness of the condition and a rise in demand for diagnosis and treatment.\nMedication helps to manage symptoms, which can include difficulty concentrating and focusing, hyperactivity and impulsiveness.\nPeople with the condition have told BBC Newsbeat how the shortage is affecting them.\n\"I'm not sure when I'm going to get more.\" \nIt's been a difficult week for 25-year-old Tom, from Plymouth.  \nNot only has he just started a new job, but he's suddenly been unable to get hold of the tablets he takes to help manage his ADHD. \nHe says he ordered his prescription online as normal and received an email from his pharmacy saying there were manufacturing issues.\nIt's meant getting stuck into his new job has been tricky. \n\"I can't really get glued into a task that I'm meant to be doing,\" he tells Newsbeat.\n\"I sort of go off task after maybe five minutes. \n\"It's affected my home life as well, just managing general things like laundry and keeping routines like sleeping and eating.\" \nTom says he's been using his own coping strategies to help him. \n\"I'm trying to do as best I can with lists and writing things down and making sure things are structured but it is a lot harder.\" he says. \nTom isn't alone - the charity ADHD UK estimates, based on data from the Lancet and NICE, that 1.9m adults, roughly 3 to 4% of the UK population, have the condition.\nSomeone who understands Tom's stress is 26-year-old Ellie from Manchester. \nShe's just picked up her most recent prescription, but because of the shortage she's decided not to take her medication every day. \nThis is something that isn't advised by doctors. \n\"I feel like I'm rationing when I should take it, because I don't know how long this month's worth is going to have to last,\" she tells Newsbeat. \n\"I'm thinking how much do I actually need to get done today and is it worth me using one of these tablets?\n\"Or do I need to save it for a day when I'm going to need it more?\" \nEllie says she usually takes her medication five days a week, but has reduced that to three times \"just to make sure that I've got extra to last me a bit longer\".\nBut for Ellie, the days when she does and doesn't take the medication are very different. \n\"When I'm not on my medication, I'm sluggish and I could quite easily just sit on the sofa all day,\" she says. \n\"Whereas if I have my medication it's like the world comes to colour and I feel bright and I've got energy.\n\"Since going on ADHD medication, my mental health is the best that it's ever been.\n\"The risk of losing that feels very scary.\"\nShe's also angry that she's had to find out about the shortage on social media and not had any contact from her GP or psychiatrist. \n\"There needs to be a system in place so that it doesn't get to a point where any medication runs out. \n\"I think warning people more in advance would have been helpful as well as clearer information.\" \nEmily, 22, from Hertfordshire, is also upset about the way news about the shortage has been shared with patients.\nShe's also wondering when she'll be able to fill her next prescription.\n\"I've got about six days left so I have put in a request for the prescription,\" she says. \n\"But I put it in last week, and I haven't heard anything yet.\n\"The thought of going back to how my life was before medication is quite overwhelming and scary.\n\"Because I was in quite a dark mental space for a long time and ADHD medication has really helped me come out of that.\" \nDr Saadia Arshad, a consultant psychiatrist, who specialises in diagnosing and treating people with ADHD. \nShe says the shortage of medication is \"not a new issue, but it's a recurring one\".\nDr Saadia says suddenly stopping meds can lead to patients \"feeling jittery, finding it difficult to pay attention, staying focused and feeling restless\". \nEven though she understands the shortage can be worrying, Dr Saadia says it's important that people don't take measures into their own hands. \n\"These medicines can be quite potent and the response to medication for two individuals is not the same,\" she says.\n\"So please do not take any action without discussing it with your clinician.\" \nFor people looking for other ways to help manage their symptoms, ADHD coach Leanne Maskell has this advice:\nThere are more resources at ADHD UK and mental health charity Mind, and tips on living with ADHD from the NHS.\nThe DHSC says: \"We continue to work closely with the respective manufacturers to resolve the issues as soon as possible and to ensure patients have continuous access to ADHD medicines in the UK.\"\nBBC Newsbeat's approached the NHS in Scotland and Wales for a comment.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays -

{"title": "The extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship", "date": "2023-10-05 23:02:48", "text": "A huge robotic arm, wielding a waterjet powerful enough to slice through steel, swings into action.\nIt is chopping up the hull of a large ship. The structure, which withstood the power of the sea for decades, yields easily to the cutting jet. Before long, the robot has sliced out a big rectangle of steel. \nIts task complete, the machine silently moves on to the next section.\n\"You can have robots starting at the bow and the stern, and two points in the middle, and working towards each other,\" says Bryce Lawrence, operations director at Leviathan. The firm, based in Germany, plans to use a team of robots to dismantle huge ships so that the steel can be recycled.\nToday's shipbreaking industry is one of the dirtiest and most exploitative in the world.\nWhen mammoth vessels retire from years of ferrying cargo such as consumer goods, or oil, between continents, they often end up on a heavily polluted beach somewhere in South Asia. There, workers use fossil fuel-powered torches to painstakingly dismantle the ships. Protective clothing is scarce. Fatalities are not. \nContaminants, including heavy metals, often get washed into the sea from these beaches. Workers and local communities are frequently exposed to dangerous materials including asbestos. During the next decade, 15,000 ships will require recycling - more than double the volume of the past decade, estimates Bimco, the Baltic and International Maritime Council.\nLeviathan and other companies are trying to find ways of doing this work much more cleanly and safely. Still, there are no guarantees that they will be able to compete with the dirt-cheap yards of South Asia.\n\"Compared to traditional ship recycling, we're very, very low carbon,\" says Mr Lawrence as he explains how machinery at Leviathan's Stralsund facility on Germany's Baltic coast will be powered by electricity, not on-site fossil fuels, and that recovered steel will be transported to mills around Europe on electrified trains. Commercial operations are expected to start in the coming months, he adds.\nThe firm's prototype system is a mash-up of established technologies. The robot arms are the sort that toil in car factories, for example, and the waterjet is manufactured by ANT AG, another German firm.\nThis device blasts a mixture of water and sand at high pressures - a technology so precise that it is used by bomb disposal experts to cut the fuses out of bombs. \n\"Somebody has to approach the bomb, put the manipulating system on,\" says Till Weber, ANT AG's general manager, \"then go as far away as possible.\" Mercifully, in such situations the jet can be operated from a distance of half a kilometer. It is currently in use in Ukraine, adds Mr Weber.\nWhen it comes to ship cutting, such a system requires far fewer workers than traditional shipbreaking does, and Mr Lawrence argues that it could one day complete the job much faster. Computer software being developed by Leviathan will automatically plan how to chop up a vessel as efficiently as possible.\nOn the other hand, there's a cost to all this and the robot arms must be properly mounted on special rigs fixed to a dry dock. You can't just plonk them on a beach.\nSefer Gunbeyaz at the University of Strathclyde has studied workers' exposure to toxic materials at shipbreaking facilities in the UK and Spain. Even in these countries, exposure - particularly to lead and iron particles - was \"worrying\", he and colleagues found.\n\"It's a promising start,\" he says, of the waterjet-based system in Germany. However, he notes that contaminants in the water used for cutting up ships must still be carefully managed. \nMr Lawrence explains that the Stralsund facility will feature a containment area designed to capture jet water and toxic substances that have been blasted off the ships. Once carefully decontaminated, this water can be reused for further cutting.\nElegant Exit Company, headquartered in The Netherlands, also says it can dismantle ships responsibly. Earlier this year, it began recycling the Wan Hai 165, a 160m-long container vessel. \nThe company uses gas-fuelled cutters at its Bahrain facility, but says that it removes hazardous materials before processing ships into large pieces of steel, of up to 25 tons, for transportation.\n\"We de-Lego a ship,\" says a spokeswoman, explaining that the idea is to safely disassemble each vessel, part by part. The firm will evaluate waterjet, plasma and hydraulic mechanical cutters in the future.\nRecycling ships has been a dirty business for too long, says Ingvild Jenssen, founder and director of Shipbreaking Platform, a non-governmental organization that monitors the industry.\n\"What is even more shocking is that you have a whole shipping sector that is well aware of the problems,\" she adds.\nSome ship owners attempt to send vessels from Europe to South Asian shipbreaking yards despite such exports being illegal. A BBC investigation in 2020 revealed that three oil rigs detained by the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) in 2018 had been earmarked for dismantling on a beach in India.\nTwo of the structures have since been broken up at an EU-approved yard in Turkey. \"[The third rig, Ocean Princess] has not been dismantled and recovered yet as it was only exported to Turkey in May 2023,\" says Colin Morrow, of Sepa.\nImproved documentation of the hazardous materials contained in a vessel could help recyclers process it appropriately, suggests Ms Jenssen.\nKuishuang Feng at the University of Maryland agrees and adds that ship owners could also be charged a levy when purchasing a vessel, redeemable if it is later recycled safely.\nMore technology of business\nBoth Mr Feng and Ms Jenssen say current legislation, including the recently ratified Hong Kong Convention, does not go far enough towards making shipbreaking sustainable. However, a spokeswoman for the International Maritime Organization argues that the convention will reduce the environmental impacts of ship recycling.\nHigh-tech solutions could make a difference. Mr Lawrence says that Leviathan hopes to license its system to other shipbreaking yards - though he insists that he would only allow this in safe, controlled environments with the same capacity for capturing hazardous substances that he says is in place at Stralsund.\nAs it stands, the situation in many South Asian yards remains one of \"constant exploitation\", argues Jenssen. \"You have workers that go to work - and they're not coming home.\"\nJailed Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nPutin makes nuclear-powered missile test claim\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "How Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year", "date": "2023-10-05 23:54:58", "text": "Ghana - once touted as a trailblazing African economic success story - is facing an unprecedented financial crisis.\nThis week, hundreds of protestors took to the streets in the capital Accra, calling on the governor of the Bank of Ghana and his two deputies to resign over the loss of about 60bn Ghanaian cedis ($5.2bn; £4.3bn) in the 2022 financial year.\nThe demonstration, dubbed #OccupyBoG, was led by the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) party. The protesters, dressed in red shirts, scarves and berets, chanted songs and held banners - some reading \"stop the looting, we are suffering\".\nThe opposition claims the bank printed money illegally to lend to the government, leading to the depreciation of the currency and crippling inflation. \nIt has also criticised the bank for spending more than $762,000 on domestic and foreign travel, an 87% increase on the previous year, and $250m on a new office building. The opposition says these figures are recorded in an internal audit.\nThe NDC has accused the central bank governor, Dr Ernest Addison, of recklessness and mismanagement. And while the bank has been accused of mismanagement in the past, a loss of this magnitude is unprecedented. \n\"We have never seen anything like this in our history. If the Bank of Ghana wants to recover from this loss... it will take them more than 45 years,\" says economist Professor Godfred Bokpin, from the University of Ghana.\nThe bank denies charges of mismanagement and says the losses were a result of a fluctuating exchange rate and because of non-payment of loans by state institutions.\nIt also says the government's decision to borrow $700m from it and not pay it back in full has contributed to the crisis.\nThe bank's governors have also been accused of fanning rampant inflation and economic hardship by their actions. \"The time when they were printing billions for the government, didn't they know that it will have repercussions?\" asks lawyer Martin Kepbu.\nGhana is currently going through its worst economic crisis in a generation. Last year, the inflation rate hit a record high of 54% - and is still running at more than 40%. Multiple credit rating agencies have downgraded the nation, preventing it from borrowing money internationally.\nBy September 2022, Ghana's total debt had surged to $55bn. This meant the government needed in excess of 70% of its income to service the debt, something it was unable to do. It subsequently defaulted on much of its debt payments. \nThe government was forced to approach the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for assistance. To secure a $3bn bailout earlier this year, the government had to agree to fulfil a number of requirements. \nThe most important of these was to reduce the nation's debt interest payments to a manageable level by 2028. This would leave them with enough funds to run the economy.\nTo achieve this, Ghana's government began debt restructuring by renegotiating terms with its creditors, proposing lower interest rates on their loans and longer repayment terms to relieve pressure on public finances.\nHowever, some creditors refused to take part in this debt exchange programme.\nOn 9 August the Bank of Ghana issued a statement saying the government had told it that it didn't have enough money to meet the IMF's requirements and consequently would not repay half of the $700m it had borrowed from the bank. \nInstead the money would go towards the debt restructuring. It also said it would not pay any interest due to the bank. \nThe bank is the lender of last resort and experts say its status has been abused by the government, led by President Nana Akufo-Addo, and the rules of the bank have been broken.\n\"The Bank of Ghana Act is very clear that printing money or financing the government is limited to 5% of the previous year's fiscal revenue, which means that in principle supporting the government is not a crime but don't go beyond 5%,\" says Professor Bokpin.  \nThe bank's officials are mandated by law to report to parliament if the 5% threshold is exceeded. A failure to report could lead to a fine or a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years.\nNone of this means the Bank of Ghana has gone broke. It is not a commercial bank that has to make a profit, so the loss should not affect its routine operations and as the lender of last resort it can always create its own money. \nBut according to experts, the central bank's loss has significant ramifications.\nIt undermines the moral authority of the bank to supervise Ghana's commercial banks. It also damages confidence in the country's financial system.\nAlthough other central banks around the world have faced similar challenges, the difference in Ghana is the amount of money lost compared with the size of the economy.\nIn the UK, the Bank of England will be making a net loss of about $180bn over the next 10 years which will be funded by the UK government. But the size of the UK economy is in the trillions of dollars.\nBright Simons, a Ghanaian social innovator and writer, says that the bank cannot compare its losses with those of other countries. \"Their attempt to deflect blame and point to losses by other central banks doesn't make sense as the scale of their losses far outstrips those of other peer banks. \n\"A lot of the mess is down to the bank's accommodative stance on the government's loose fiscal policy,\" he says. \nIn other words, by creating money the bank has allowed the government to live beyond its means.\nA World Bank report last month estimated that 850,000 Ghanaians have drifted into poverty because of high inflation.\nGhanaians' incomes have been eroded, affecting their purchasing power. The prices of food, fuels and utilities remain high, and many households are struggling to make ends meet.\nAnd on top of all that, the central bank is now under scrutiny from both within the country and the IMF. \nUnder the terms of the IMF loan, if the government demands more bailouts, the bank will have no choice but to refuse.\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "The mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians", "date": "2023-10-05 21:01:49", "text": "Scientists have unveiled a sprawling burial site in India belonging to one of the world's earliest urban civilisations. The BBC's Soutik Biswas delves into the clues the graves might give us about how the early Indians lived and died. \nIn 2019, as scientists embarked on excavating a mound of sandy soil near a remote village in the sparsely populated Kutch region, situated not far from Pakistan in India's western state of Gujarat, they had no inkling of the surprise that lay in store for them.\n\"When we began digging, we thought it was an ancient settlement. Within a week, we realised it was a cemetery,\" says Rajesh SV, an archaeologist with the University of Kerala, who led the search.\nThree excavation seasons - involving more than 150 Indian and international scientists - have been conducted so far at the 40-acre site. Researchers now estimate the presence of at least 500 graves of the Indus society, one of the world's earliest urban civilisations. (Some 200 of these graves have been excavated.)\nAlso known as the Harappan civilisation, named after its first city, this society - austere farmers and traders who lived in walled, baked-brick cities - rose to prominence some 5,300 years ago in what is now north-west India and Pakistan. In a century since the civilisation's initial discovery, researchers have unearthed up to 2,000 sites in India and Pakistan. \nScientists reckon the sprawling burial ground near Khatiya village in Gujarat may potentially be the largest \"pre-urban\" cemetery of the society discovered so far. They believe it was in use for about 500 years, spanning from 3200BC to 2600BC, making the oldest graves here around 5,200 years old. \nExcavations so far have yielded a single intact male human skeleton, as well as partly preserved skeletal remains including skull fragments, bones and teeth.   \nThey have also found an array of burial artefacts - more than 100 bangles and 27 beads made of shell. Ceramic vessels, bowls, dishes, pots, small pitchers, beakers, clay pots, water cups, bottles and jars have also been discovered. Minor treasures include beads made of the semi-precious stone, lapis lazuli.\nThe graves have unique features, including sandstone-lined burial shafts that point in different directions. Some are oval shaped; others rectangular. There are smaller graves where children were buried. The bodies appear to be laid supine, but most bones have dissolved because of the acidic soil.\n\"This is a hugely significant find,\" says Brad Chase, a professor of anthropology at Albion College, Michigan.\n\"Several pre-urban cemeteries have been discovered in Gujarat, but this is by far the largest - and therefore has the potential to reveal a greater diversity of grave types that will help archaeologists to more fully understand pre-urban society in the region as well as provide crucial context for the other smaller cemeteries that have been previously discovered,\" says Prof Chase.\nEarlier excavations of Indus sites in the Punjab region of today's Pakistan offer some clues about the burial practices of the Indus people. \nThe funerals were unostentatious, unlike those of the elites in Egypt and Mesopotamia. No jewels and weapons accompanied the dead to the afterlife. Here, most bodies were wrapped in shrouds of textile and placed in rectangular wooden coffins. The grave pit was often filled with pottery offerings before the coffin was lowered into it, according to Jonathan Mark Kenoyer of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who is a scholar of the Indus Valley civilisation.\nSome people were buried with personal ornaments - bangles, beads, amulets - which could not be passed on to others. Some women were buried with a mirror made of copper. Adults were buried with different types of vessels associated with serving and storing food, and some with specific ornaments - shell bangles were typically found on the left arms of adult females. Infants and children were not usually buried with any pottery or ornaments. \nThis video can not be played\nDrone footage of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nThere was no evidence of substantial wealth in the graves and the health profile indicates that most were \"well fed and healthy, although some had indications of arthritis and physical stress\". \nBut the mystery of the massive burial ground in Gujarat is still to be unearthed.\nFor the scientists the discovery itself was fortuitous. In 2016, a village headman who also doubled up as a driver, was taking around a team of University of Kerala archaeology students when he showed them the site.\nIt was a mere 300m (985 feet) from Khatiya, a tiny village of 400 people, who grew groundnut, cotton and castor on rainfed farms for a living. Some of their farms even abutted the graveyard. \n\"After rains we would see bits of pottery and stuff coming to the surface. Some people would say there were ghosts here. But we had no idea that we were living next door to such a big graveyard,\" said Narayan Bhai Jajani, the former headman. \n\"Now every year we have scientists from all over the world visiting our village and trying to find out more about the people who were buried here.\"\nWhat secrets do the latest graves in Gujarat hold? Who were the people who were interred here? \nThe sheer number of burials in one location raises questions about the significance of this burial ground. Did it serve as a communal resting place for a cluster of nearby settlements, or does it hint at the existence of a larger settlement?\nMoreover, could it have functioned as a sacred cemetery for nomadic travellers, considering that the closest source of lapis lazuli found in these graves likely traces back to distant Afghanistan? Or could it have served as a \"secondary\" burial site, where bones from the deceased were interred separately?\n\"We still don't know. We haven't found a settlement in the neighbourhood yet. We are still digging,\" says Abhayan GS, an archaeologist at the University of Kerala.\nMr Kenoyer says he's confident that \"there must be some settlements that relate to the cemetery, but they are probably lying beneath modern habitations or so far undiscovered\".  That the burials were made with well-defined stone walls suggests that the people were familiar with building with stone, and such stone buildings and walled settlements are to be found between 19-30km (11-18 miles) from the cemetery.\nMore chemical studies and DNA testing of the human remains will tell us more about some of the earliest Indians who lived and died here.\nMysteries about the Indus civilisation endure: the writing, for example, has still not been deciphered. This winter, scientists plan to excavate a site north of the cemetery near Khatiya aiming to uncover a potential settlement. If they find one, one part of the puzzle will be solved. If they don't, they will continue to dig. \"Someday, hopefully sooner than later, we will have some answers,\" says Mr Rajesh.\nBBC News India is now on YouTube.

The two leaders warn that tackling illegal migration is the only way to protect Britain and Italy's \"historic role as places of asylum and sanctuary\". \nIn Scotland, the Daily Record hails what it calls an \"historic\" victory for Labour in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West by-election. It says the Conservatives were \"humiliated\" - having received so few votes they lost their deposit - and it was also a \"terrible night\" for the SNP. \nThe Herald pins the blame on First Minister Humza Yousaf, saying the scale of the defeat could spark questions about his future and \"whether he can turn the SNP's fate around\". In an analysis piece, the paper asks why party members should listen to him when he sets out his independence strategy next week. The National declares that Labour is now on the path to winning the next general election.\nThe Daily Mirror reveals what it says is \"the truth\" about Rishi Sunak's plan for rail projects - or, as it calls it, \"the HS2 cash con\". It says the scheme is a \"shambles\" and claims many of the Network North proposals have been announced previously or have already been completed. The i says the plan is \"beginning to unravel\". It also reveals that the company behind HS2 bought a property in Staffordshire worth more than £1.5m just a day before the prime minister axed the northern leg.\nBut the Daily Telegraph focuses on Sir Keir Starmer's refusal to commit to building the HS2 route between Birmingham and Manchester. The paper says it is likely to \"fuel criticism that Labour lacks ambition\".  In the Guardian, what are described as \"key figures\" who helped Tony Blair win the 1997 election urge Sir Keir to be bold. They say his cautious approach risks damaging his chances of winning the next vote.\nThe Financial Times reports that Metro Bank has approached its rivals to gauge their interest in buying more than £2bn of its mortgage book. Sources tell the paper the bank has contacted Lloyds, NatWest and HSBC in an attempt to \"bolster its balance sheet\".\nAccording to the Daily Mail, ministers are working on \"radical plans\" to temporarily hire thousands of foreign doctors to limit the damage caused by NHS strikes in England.

{"title": "How do you get rid of bedbugs and are they in the UK?", "date": "2023-10-05 12:34:56", "text": "This video can not be played\nWatch: BBC correspondent Hugh Schofield goes on the hunt for Paris bedbugs\nPanic is said to be sweeping Paris and other French cities as infestations of bedbugs have apparently soared in recent weeks. While experts say the upward trend goes back several years, some are getting jittery about bugs in the UK too.      \nHere we answer some of the key questions people may have. \nBedbugs are small, with adults reaching about 5mm in length (less than a grain of rice) and are oval-shaped. They have six legs and can be dark yellow, red or brown. \nThere are about 90 species worldwide, although the common bedbug (cimex lectularius) has adapted the best to human environments, according to the British Pest Control Association.\nThe term \"bedbug\" can be a touch misleading. As well as mattresses, they can also be found on clothing, furniture, bed frames, or behind loose wallpaper.\nBites are the main thing to look out for, and they are usually raised and itchy. Bedbug bites are often in a line or grouped together. \nOn white skin the bites usually look red, while on black or brown skin they could be purple and harder to see. \nOther things to look out for are spots of blood on bedding - if the bugs have been squashed - or small brown spots on bedding or furniture, which could be their faeces. \nNatalie Bungay, from the British Pest Control Association, said that if travelling, checking for the insects was crucial and that \"prevention is always better than cure\". \n\"If you feel you're in an area that's got a bit of an outbreak, as they're reporting in the news, then the best thing to do is just check all your items - they may travel in suitcases,\" she told the BBC.\n\"Check any luggage that you may have put in the room because a lot of the time we put our suitcases or bags on the bed.\"\nAlthough often uncomfortable, bedbug bites are not typically dangerous. \nThey can be very itchy, and there may be some painful swelling, but they usually clear up on their own in about a week - or they can be treated with some basic measures.\nThese include:\nAntihistamines can help if bites are very itchy, while a mild steroid cream like hydrocortisone might be useful. \nA severe allergic reaction, known as anaphylaxis, is possible but rare.\nA GP appointment should be sought if the bites remain painful, swollen or itchy after trying treatments from a pharmacist, or if the pain or swelling around the bites is spreading. \nIt can be difficult but there are steps that can be taken, including:\nOther steps include avoiding cluttering around beds, or checking second hand furniture before taking it indoors.\nMs Bungay, from BCPA, said it was important not to be ashamed of having bedbugs in the home and to call in an expert pest controller, describing them as a \"public health pest\", although mainly in a psychological capacity. \n\"They're not proven to transmit disease, but it's the psychological effect that they have on someone when you've got them in your home,\" she said. \n\"They feed from our blood, they just like us.\"\nIn short - no. \nBedbugs have been an issue in the UK for many years and are a \"public health pest that is notoriously difficult to treat\", said Ms Bungay.\nThey can be found all over the UK, but are a bigger issue in major cities. \nMs Bungay said her organisation was not aware of any unusual increase in bedbug activity. \n\"There was a dip during Covid-19 due to the lack of global travel taking place, so any increase now could just be trends getting back to normal now that everybody is moving freely again,\" she said. \nShe added that seasonal increases in numbers, particularly as more people travel during the summer months, was nothing unusual. \n\"It's also worth remembering that not every call out for bedbugs will result in a positive identification of the pest - increased media attention or public awareness can often lead to false alarms.\"\nHave you experienced bed bugs, and if so how did it impact your life?

More than 20 others were injured.\nThe mayor added that Russia likely used Iskander ballistic missiles in the latest attack.\nLater in the day, rescuers found the body of a woman - the grandmother of the killed boy, Kharkiv regional head Oleh Syniehubov said.\nResidents of the Hroza village had been attending the funeral of a Ukrainian soldier, who was a local resident, when the missile struck on Thursday.\nThe Interfax-Ukraine news agency quoted local prosecutor Dmytro Chubenko as saying that the man's widow was among the dead, as well as their son and daughter-in-law.\nThe soldier had previously been buried in Dnipro, but his relatives said they wanted to rebury him in his home village.\nPeople who had attended the service were sitting down for a meal when the missile hit the cafe that also served as a grocery store in the village, officials said.\nSpeaking to Ukrainian TV, Mr Klymenko said that Hroza had had the population of 330 residents before the Russian attack.\nHe said \"every family, every household\" was represented by at least one person at the wake.\nPreliminary information suggested that an Iskander missile hit the building, the minister added.\nMr Syniehubov described the attack as one of the region's \"bloodiest crimes\".\n\"One fifth of this village has died in a single terrorist attack,\" he said.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the act \"couldn't even be called a beastly act - because it would be an insult to beasts\".\nThree days of morning have been declared in the Kharkiv region, starting from Friday.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's World Tonight, Maria Avdeeva, a Ukrainian security analyst and journalist, said someone may have told the Russian military about the wake.\n\"We can presume that someone give out the information about the place and the time of the gathering of these people,\" she said. \n\"From what we see now on Russian propaganda channels, they circulate information that there were military gathering for the funeral, which is false and untrue because this were mainly a civilian ceremony.\"\nThe attack has also led to international condemnation.\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the attack \"demonstrated the depths of depravity Russian forces are willing to sink to\".  His comments came after he had earlier met Mr Zelensky on Thursday at a summit in Spain for the European Political Community, an intergovernmental forum established last year partly in response to the invasion of Ukraine.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre described the strike as \"horrifying\" and said it demonstrated why it was so important the Ukrainian people continued to receive international support.\nThe incident comes as continued funding for Ukraine is facing growing opposition in the US House of Representatives.\nThe Kupyansk district has been on the front line of clashes between Russian and Ukrainian armies since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year.\nIt was a major supply hub for Russian forces at the start of the war, but Kyiv recaptured it in September 2022 after months of fighting.\nDrone footage shows devastation in Hroza.

He was hoping to arrive in Cairns, Australia, by December.\nHe was on the last leg of his trip, after leaving the city of Luganville in Vanuatu on Monday.\nSpeaking to ABC Australia from the country last week, Mr Robinson had said this final part of the journey would be the \"make-or-break leg\".\nIt is not yet clear what caused his boat to overturn on Thursday evening, but his emergency distress beacon was activated, which alerted the authorities.\nEarly on Friday morning, the P&O Pacific Explorer helped free Mr Robinson from the water, and he climbed up a rope ladder to reach the deck, according to the post on his website.\nLocal media reports say the ship had taken a 200km (124 miles) detour to help with the rescue.\nIn a statement, Mr Robinson thanked the crew of the ship \"whose seamanship and professionalism ensured a safe rescue\".\nTamu Tapaitau, a member of the team supporting him on his attempt, said that the cruise ship was heading to Auckland in New Zealand, and from there Mr Robinson would fly home to Brisbane.\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nTrump endorses Jim Jordan for House Speaker\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

I loved every minute of it.\n\"I was only 14 years old and it was just in another world to me. Everything about it was amazing.\"\nMs Whitworth said reuniting with some teammates she has not seen in 60 years for the unveiling of the blue plaque \"will be amazing\". \nAnother former player, Margaret Shepherd, who played from 1967 until 1972, said she also kept her football under wraps from her work colleagues and school friends.\n\"I never told anyone,\" she said. \n\"You didn't tell anybody because you were frowned upon. Women playing football wasn't heard of.\"\nThe 76-year-old said the blue plaque \"means everything\".\n\"It is not just for me but it is for every other Corinthian that played and every other lady footballer that played during the ban.\n\"We just want recognition of the achievements that we made,\" she said.\nMs Shepherd said she had loved watching the Lionesses lift the Euro 2022 trophy and their run to this year's World Cup final.\nHistorian and writer Gary James backed the campaign to celebrate the \"groundbreaking\" Manchester Corinthians, which folded in the early 1980s.\n\"The Corinthians demonstrated that women were playing football consistently and regularly at a time when the FA ban was in place,\" he said, adding they had \"toured the globe promoting football and female endeavour and demonstrated the best of British football\". \n\"They demonstrate that no matter what society tells you it is important to break down barriers and work together,\" he said.\nTwo murals by artist Gavin Renshaw dedicated to the Manchester Corinthians will also be unveiled in a ceremony which is due to be attended by more than a dozen former players, including 92-year-old Dorothy Allcock who played when the team was formed in 1949. , \nWhy not follow BBC North West on Facebook, X and Instagram?

{"title": "AI facial recognition: Campaigners and MPs call for ban", "date": "2023-10-05 23:01:57", "text": "Police and private companies should \"immediately stop\" the use of facial recognition surveillance, says a group of politicians and privacy campaigners.\nThey have raised concerns around human rights, potential for discrimination and \"the lack of a democratic mandate\".\nIt comes after the government announced plans for police to access passport photos to help catch criminals.\nThe Home Office said facial recognition had \"a sound legal basis\" and had already led to criminals being caught.\nA spokesperson added that the technology could also aid police in searching for missing or vulnerable people, and free up officers to \"be out on the beat\" and to carry out complex investigations.\nLive facial recognition cameras scan faces of the public in specific locations and compare these with people on \"watch lists\" who may be wanted by police or the courts in association with crimes.\nPolice forces using the technology in the UK inform citizens in advance about when and where it will be deployed, and display physical notices alerting those entering areas where it is active to the presence of cameras.\nBut this week, policing minister Chris Philp said he wanted officers to be able to access a wider range of databases for images besides those on its national database, which is limited to those who have been arrested. \nCampaigners have called for it to be banned \"immediately\".\n\"This dangerously authoritarian technology has the potential to turn populations into walking ID cards in a constant police line up,\" says Silkie Carlo, the director of privacy organisation Big Brother Watch.\nThe group calling for the ban includes parliamentarians from the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green parties, along with campaigning organisations such as Amnesty, Index on Censorship and Big Brother Watch.\nThe UK's surveillance camera commissioner has also criticised the plans, saying they could damage public trust and make passport-holders feel as if they were in a \"digital line-up\".\nSouth Wales Police has been criticised over its live facial recognition use at events including Harry Styles and Beyoncé concerts in Cardiff. The Metropolitan Police has used it several times this year, including at the King's Coronation in May.\nBoth forces have said that if a person is not on a watch list, the biometric data will be immediately deleted and not stored.\nIn April, Frasers Group - which operates Sports Direct, Flannels and House of Fraser - defended its use of live facial recognition cameras in some of its shops, saying the system provided by FaceWatch had helped cut crime since being installed. \nMs Carlo, of Big Brother Watch, argued the UK's \"approach to face surveillance makes us a total outlier in the democratic world, especially against the backdrop of the EU's proposed ban\".\nMembers of the European Parliament agreed to ban live facial recognition using AI in a draft of its Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act - the EU's landmark legislation categorising different applications of AI according to their harm to the public. \nThe Home Office said the government was \"committed to making sure the police have the tools and technology they need to solve and prevent crimes, bring offenders to justice, and keep people safe\".\n\"Facial recognition, including live facial recognition, has a sound legal basis that has been confirmed by the courts and has already enabled a large number of serious criminals to be caught, including for murder and sexual offences,\" a spokesperson said.\nThey added there was a \"robust legal framework for it use\".\nWarning over face recognition to catch shoplifters\nPolice passport photos access 'risks public trust'\nFace recognition used at Cardiff Beyoncé concert\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

Areas near the river remain on high alert.\nAmong those reported missing were 23 army personnel. Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang said the bodies of seven had been recovered from different areas downstream of the river. One solider had been rescued alive earlier this week. \nA total of 103 people, including 15 soldiers, remain missing, he said. \nMore than 22,000 people have been affected by the floods with many stranded in Lachen and Lachung in northern Sikkim. The floods have disrupted mobile phone coverage in the area.\n\"Road connectivity between districts has been cut off and bridges have been washed away,\" Mr Tamang told the Press Trust of India on Friday.\nThe army said it was providing food and medical aid to people and extending communication facilities to civilians and stranded tourists. Rescue teams are also moving evacuees to relief camps. \nAll schools and colleges in the state will remain closed until 15 October due to inclement weather.\nOn Tuesday night, the state's Lhonak lake breached its embankment after heavy rain, leading to an alarming rise in water in the Teesta river in Lachen Valley.\nThe flood worsened after water was released from a nearby dam into the river. A defence spokesperson reported a rapid surge in water levels downstream, reaching heights of 15 to 20 feet.\nSatellite images shared by Isro, India's space agency, showed dramatic changes in the volume of the lake. \nThe lake covered an area of 167.4 hectares on 28 September, but by 4 October, it had shrunk to just 60.3 hectares.\nThe floods had caused massive damage to infrastructure, including roads and bridges.\nNorthern parts of neighbouring West Bengal state have been affected as water from the Teesta inundated Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri districts.\nTwo people were killed and six others injured after a mortar shell, found in the overflowing river, blew up in Jalpaiguri, officials said.\nSikkim in the Himalayas is prone to floods and natural disasters.

{"title": "Will Serial's Adnan Syed go back to jail?", "date": "2023-10-05 23:39:41", "text": "Adnan Syed, who is now free after spending more than 20 years in prison fighting charges that he killed his ex-girlfriend, has appeared in an appeals court once again arguing to keep his freedom.\nIn the latest chapter of the case made famous by the hit podcast Serial, an appeals court in Maryland will decide whether to send Syed back to prison or throw out his murder conviction.\nAfter the murder of his high school classmate and ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee in 1999, a jury found Syed guilty of premeditated murder, kidnapping, robbery and false imprisonment.\nSyed was cleared of all charges in September 2022, after prosecutors in Baltimore said their year-long investigation revealed he had been wrongfully convicted of strangling and killing Ms Lee. New DNA evidence showed he was not involved in her death, prosecutors said.\nBut in March 2023, a Maryland appeals court reinstated Syed's conviction and sentence, ordering a new hearing to determine whether he should remain free. \nThe appeals court ruled that the lower court failed to give Young Lee, Ms Lee's brother, sufficient notice of the September 2022 hearing in which a judge vacated Syed's murder conviction and freed him from prison.\nThursday's hearing in the Maryland Supreme Court included arguments over whether Syed's conviction should remain on the books and whether crime victims have a right to speak and to challenge evidence during hearings to vacate convictions. \nAttorneys for Syed argued that despite the lack of notice given - Young Lee was told of the hearing to vacate on the Friday before a Monday hearing - the result would have been the same.\nThe Lee family has continued to argue that Syed is guilty and opposed his release. \nThe state supreme court justices will announce their decision at a later date. \nSyed remains free while the decision is pending. \nOutside the court after the hearing, he told reporters: \"We look forward to hearing the court's decision, and we're hoping that in the end we'll have a chance to do justice, not just for Hae's family, but for our family as well.\"\nHae Min Lee disappeared after school in January 1999, and her body was discovered partially buried the following month. Syed was arrested and convicted on the basis of evidence including phone records and the testimony of one of his friends, who told police he helped bury Lee's body. He was sentenced to life in prison. \nMore than a decade after the conviction, Rabia Chaudry, a Baltimore-based lawyer and family friend of the Syeds, emailed journalist Sarah Koenig and asked her to re-investigate Lee's murder.  \nThat email helped launch the first season of the podcast Serial, a spin-off of the long-running radio show This American Life. Serial premiered in autumn 2014 and went through the evidence in minute detail.\n\"For the last year I've spent every working day trying to figure out where a high school kid was for an hour after school one day in 1999,\" Ms Koenig says in the first episode.\nAs each episode revealed new details - and potential new suspects - internet sleuths and armchair detectives sprang into action and argued their theories on social media.\nDuring the podcast Ms Koenig did not take a position on Syed's guilt or innocence, but the attention around Syed's case would ultimately help him win a new trial.\nSerial helped ignite the popularity of podcasts, particularly the \"true crime\" genre. Ms Koenig's signature confessional style kept listeners returning - and downloading - the show every week.  \nThe first season of Serial has been downloaded more than 300 million times and the show is widely cited as one of the most popular podcasts in the world.\nThough subsequent seasons of the show were less popular, in many ways, Ms Koenig and her team helped create the formula for a \"bingeable\" podcast series.  \nIn 2015, Syed was granted a new trial based, in part, on new evidence uncovered while making Serial.\nBut a judge also denied his request for bail. He remained imprisoned as his legal team argued for a new trial and tried to appeal against his conviction all the way to the US Supreme Court.  \nIn 2019, HBO premiered a four-part documentary series produced by Ms Chaudry called The Case Against Adnan Syed.\nThe series argued that Syed, who is Muslim, was convicted, in part, because of racial bias. \nIt ultimately revealed that forensic analyses had found no trace of his DNA on Ms Lee's body at the time of the murder - a major factor in the eventual vacating of his conviction.  \nThe state's attorney's office cleared Syed of all charges on the basis of  the new evidence.\n\"As a representative of the institution, it is my responsibility to acknowledge and apologise to the family of Hae Min Lee and Adnan Syed,\" Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said at the time. \nThe Lee family refused to participate in Serial and has always maintained they believe Syed was rightfully convicted and justice was served during the original trial.\nIn 2016, when Syed was granted a new trial, the family told reporters that the podcast had \"reopened wounds few can imagine\", according to the Baltimore Sun. They also said they believed people had been misinformed by the podcast and regretted that \"so few [were] willing to speak up for Hae\".  \nMs Lee's brother, Young Lee, told the September 2022 hearing: \"This is not a podcast for me. This is real life - a never-ending nightmare for 20-plus years.\" \nConviction quashed in Serial podcast murder case\nSerial: Amateur sleuths trying to solve murder\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "Syria war: Dozens killed in drone attack on graduation ceremony", "date": "2023-10-06 09:45:23", "text": "A drone attack on a Syrian military academy in the western city of Homs has killed at least 89 people, Syria's health ministry says.\nThe explosive-laden drones targeted a graduation ceremony attended by cadets' families, and women and children were among the dead.\nA UK-based monitoring group said 116 people had been killed.\nThe Syrian army blamed the attack on \"terrorist groups backed by known international forces\".\nThere was no immediate claim from the rebels and jihadists battling the government in the country's civil war.\nThe drone attack is believed to have been launched from opposition-held areas north-west of Homs.\nLater, the monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), reported that 11 civilians had been killed in government bombardments on several cities, towns and villages in the opposition stronghold of Idlib province and Aleppo.\nSyria's state news agency, Sana, quoted a statement from the General Command of the Armed Forces as saying that several drones carrying explosives targeted the Homs military academy just after the afternoon graduation ceremony had ended.\nThe statement said the armed forces \"considers this act an unprecedented criminal one, and affirms that it will respond with full force and determination to these terrorist groups wherever they are\".\nIn a later report, the agency quoted the health ministry as saying the strike had injured 277 people, and that 31 women and five children were among the dead.\nA man who had helped set up decorations at the site told Reuters news agency: \"After the ceremony, people went down to the courtyard and the explosives hit. We don't know where it came from, and corpses littered the ground.\"\nA graphic video of the aftermath of the attack showed dozens of casualties and their relatives screaming for help inside a large, walled parade ground. Gunfire can also be heard in the background.\nThe SOHR reported that Syria's defence minister attended the graduation ceremony but left minutes before the attack.\nMore than half a million people have been killed by the civil war that erupted after President Bashar al-Assad cracked down violently on peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations in 2011. \nSome 6.8 million people are internally displaced, while another six million are refugees or asylum-seekers abroad.\nThe UN's special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, described the attack on the academy as \"horrific\" and called on all parties to the conflict to \"exercise the utmost restraint\".\n\"All sides must respect their obligations under international law and ensure the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure,\" he said\n\"Today's developments further highlight that the status quo in Syria is unsustainable and that, in the absence of a meaningful political path... I fear we will only see further deterioration, including in the security situation.\"\nIn a separate development in Syria on Thursday, at least 10 people were reportedly killed in Turkish drone strikes in a Kurdish-controlled region of north-eastern Syria that were prompted by a bomb attack in Ankara claimed by Kurdish militants.\nThe SOHR said 17 sites were targeted, including facilities affiliated with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a US-backed, Kurdish-led militia alliance, as well as a power station in Qamishli, a water station near Hassakeh and an oil field.\nThe US military also shot down an armed Turkish drone that was operating near its troops in Syria, a US official told Reuters.\nWhy has the Syrian war lasted 12 years?\n'My family paid $40,000 to bring me back from the dead'\nDozens die as former militia allies clash in Syria\nProtests over economic hardship intensify in Syria\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "Philippines 'Jesus' drag queen arrested for obscenity", "date": "2023-10-06 04:15:18", "text": "A Philippines drag queen was arrested on Wednesday over their performance as Jesus Christ reciting the Lord's Prayer.\nA video of the performance by Pura Luka Vega had sparked criminal complaints by Christian groups in July.\nThe 33-year-old, whose real name is Amadeus Fernando Pagente, faces up to 12 years in jail under the Catholic-majority country's obscenity laws. \nNearly 80% of the Philippines identifies as Roman Catholic.\nPagente has been charged with the offence of \"immoral doctrines, obscene publications and exhibitions and indecent shows\", according to a copy of the arrest warrant shared by Manila police.\nThe video features a bearded Pagente dressed as Jesus Christ, performing a rock version of the Lord's Prayer in Tagalog. It has since been deleted.\nThe Philippines for Jesus Movement, comprising Protestant church leaders, registered the first criminal complaint with the Manila Prosecutor's Office at the end of July. A second complaint was then filed in August by Nazarene Brotherhood, a Catholic group. \nSeveral cities in the Philippines, including its capital Manila, also declared Pagente \"persona non grata\", a Latin phrase for an \"unwelcome person\".\nFor decades, drag queens in the Philippines have been popular entertainers who impersonate singers and actresses and deliver punchlines in stand-up shows.\nBut Pagente is part of a new generation of drag queens who use their performances to champion their causes and test the limits of free speech.\nThey told the AFP that the arrest shows \"the degree of homophobia\" in the Philippines. \"I understand that people call my performance blasphemous, offensive, or regrettable. However, they shouldn't tell me how I practice my faith or how I do my drag. \nSupporters have been calling for Pagente's release with the #FreePuraLukaVega hash tag, arguing that \"drag is not a crime\". Some compared the performer's predicament with alleged murderers and sex crime offenders, whom they claimed remain free and have not been justly dealt with.\nRyan Thoreson, a specialist at the Human Rights Watch's LGBT+ rights programme, also called for the charges against Pagente to be dropped. \"Freedom of expression includes artistic expression that offends, satirises, or challenges religious beliefs.\"  \nPhilippine drag queen faces backlash for Jesus act\nBlack Nazarene draws vast Manila crowds\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "Arsenal v Man City: Are Gunners in better position to beat City and win Premier League title?", "date": "2023-10-06 05:42:54", "text": "\nLast updated on 6 hours ago6 hours ago.From the section Premier League\nA little more than a week ago, the Premier League title was being seen by many as a one-horse race.\nChampions Manchester City had looked imperious once more with six wins out of six, leading former Blackburn Rovers striker Chris Sutton to tell BBC Radio 5 Live, \"let's be honest, we are all expecting Man City to run away with the title again\".\nHe was not the only one thinking this way, but what a difference a week makes. Defeat in the Carabao Cup by Newcastle and a first loss in the league to Wolverhampton Wanderers has left Pep Guardiola's men looking a little vulnerable.\nAnd, while Treble winners City are still topping the table and most people's favourites for a fourth consecutive title, Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham have made a start to the season that suggests it is not going to be a formality.\nBefore City's visit to Emirates Stadium on Sunday (16:30 BST), former Manchester United defender Gary Neville has predicted Arsenal will win the title.\nSo have the Gunners, who blew an eight-point lead late in the season to finish five points behind in second place last time round, moved closer to Guardiola's class of 2023-24?\nAfter seven games last season, Arsenal were one point above Manchester City at the top on 18 points to City's 17. \nThis season it is the other way round, with City at the top on 18 and Arsenal on 17 - although the Gunners are unbeaten this time.\nFrom then Arsenal would go on to win 10 and draw two in their next 12 games, a run which would take them five points clear at the top - with a game in hand on City.\nHowever, City would eventually peg them back and win the title with games to spare.\n\"Stay with them and get to that point where there are nine or 10 games to go again,\" said former England right-back Neville on his podcast. \n\"Arsenal won't run away and win the league - your first title is very rarely like that, you have to get over the line crawling. \n\"Last season they fell apart late on and made mistakes, but they have to get in that position again. Then we'll see if they've matured. I think they will have.\"\nArsenal had a smaller squad last season - with no European football to contend with - but that ended up being their downfall, as they struggled to deal with injuries, especially to centre-back William Saliba.\nSo this summer they bolstered their squad with West Ham midfielder Declan Rice, Chelsea's attacking midfielder Kai Havertz, Ajax full-back Jurrien Timber and Brentford goalkeeper David Raya.\nArsenal scored 88 Premier League goals last season, only behind City's 94. But their goals were spread out, with midfielder Martin Odegaard and winger Gabriel Martinelli top scoring with 15 league goals each.\nBukayo Saka (14) and Gabriel Jesus (11) also hit double figures.\nCity had a more reliable goal source in Erling Haaland, who hit a Premier League record 36. But Phil Foden, with 11, and Julian Alvarez, on nine, were far behind.\nThis season Arsenal have 15 Premier League goals to City's 17 - but Brighton, Aston Villa and Newcastle have scored more than either team.\n\"Would Arsenal be better with an Alvarez, a Haaland? Of course,\" said Sutton. \"Did they make progress last season? Absolutely. Did they make good signings this summer? Of course. But are signings like Rice, Havertz, Timber and Raya going to get them to topple Man City? I don't think so.\n\"I do think goalscoring is a problem for Arsenal. I like [Eddie] Nketiah, but is he a world-class striker? I don't think so. Jesus has come in for a fair bit of criticism because he is not a natural finisher. \n\"I do think he has made Arsenal stronger, but he is not clinical. If they want to be Premier League champions they probably need to act and get one in. But there aren't many out there. That is the issue.\"\nSimon Gleave, head of analysis at Nielsen Gracenote, said: \"Although six teams have scored more goals than Arsenal so far this Premier League season, Gracenote's expected goals model says that the Gunners have the second-best attack in terms of the quality of chances created. \n\"Looking at these numbers compared to the same fixtures last season, Arsenal's attack has improved significantly despite the number of goal attempts being slightly lower. \n\"This is because the chance of the average goal attempt being scored in these seven fixtures has increased from 9% last term to 13.5% now.\n\"Despite scoring 17 Premier League goals this season, and having more shots and shots on target than in last season's opening seven matches, Manchester City's underlying numbers suggest that their attack is not as potent as it has been during most of Pep Guardiola's tenure. \n\"City have created just 10.9 expected goals, 30% less than last season's 15.65 from the first seven matches.\"\nArsenal have not beaten City in the Premier League since December 2015 and have lost their past 12 league encounters.\nTheir last such match was City's 4-1 win at Etihad Stadium in April that knocked the wind out of Arsenal's sails and put City in control of the title.\nIn August's Community Shield, the Gunners beat City on penalties - having scored an equaliser through Leandro Trossard 11 minutes into injury time.\nBut former England winger Andros Townsend thinks that could prove to be a boost to City in the long term.\n\"I think that Community Shield defeat by Arsenal got rid of any hangover City could possibly have had,\" he said on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\"Every team that has won the league, there has always been a hangover the next season and Manchester City are the only side who have been able to go on 15-game winning runs to recover it.\n\"But I think that loss to Arsenal and the reaction of Arsenal, the celebrations, gave Pep the opportunity to refocus his squad and get them going.\"\nOf the five players to score or assist a goal in the Gunners' last league win over City, a 2-1 success at the Emirates four days before Christmas in 2015, only Olivier Giroud, now 37, still plays football. Arsene Wenger was still in charge then.\nSo can they overcome that hoodoo on Sunday?\nCity are without two of their first-choice midfield with Kevin de Bruyne a long-term injury absentee and Rodri suspended.\n\"The match is massive,\" said former Aston Villa midfielder Lee Hendrie. \"Are Arsenal going to go that extra yard? They will be thinking they could take all three points. \n\"Rodri not being available is so big, this could make the season massive. If they take three points they are in with a shout.\"\nKevin Campbell, who played for Arsenal from 1988 to 1995, said: \"Arsenal do need to win this game. Any designs to win that title - they have to take points off Man City.\"\nCity certainly look more vulnerable after suffering two defeats in their past three games.\n\"I've got Arsenal to win the league this year,\" said Neville. \"That post-Treble feeling, what it would have taken out of those City players and staff would have been enormous.\n\"They could easily win the league this season and obviously it is just one game, but little results like that give the other teams encouragement. We know City have lost games in the past and gone on long winning runs so we can't write them off, but it will give a lot of encouragement to Arsenal.\n\"I just want them to have composure and be a bit more ruthless. Big tests are coming and I'm looking forward to seeing what happens, because it won't all be about Manchester City this season.\"\nNeville is correct, with the top six teams only separated by three points. Tottenham, who sit between City and Arsenal, are also unbeaten, while Liverpool, Villa and Brighton have all won five of their opening seven games.\nGleave said: \"No team has emerged as an obvious challenger to Manchester City this season as yet when comparing results this season with those achieved against the same or equivalent opponents last term.\n\"Liverpool have taken two points more from these matches and Arsenal are on a point less.\"\nIf you are viewing this page on the BBC News app, or if it isn't displaying correctly in the BBC Sport app, please click here to vote.external-link\nMiriam Margolyes is on a mission to explore the unique Australian ethos\nFollow the international police investigation hunting down the burglars who target celebrities\nFresh recruits are pushed to the limit both physically and mentally at Britain's biggest garrison\nSeven lawbreakers forced together by community payback and kept together by a big bag of cash...\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEverything you need to know to make sure you never miss a moment.\nThe latest rumours and stories from around the world of football.\nAnalysis and opinion from our chief football writer.\nHow to get into football - the most popular sport in the world, with clubs and facilities throughout the UK."}

What objectives do you have?\n\"You have to be remembered for your talent, not for what you earned.\n'What we are training every day for, what we are being recognised for is our talent, and that is what you want to be remembered for.\n\"You cannot [move to] a lower stage and finish your career in a different way. But some players needed the situations where you can earn a lot of money because they didn't earn enough.\"\nSaudi Arabia's increased investment in sport in recent years has proven controversial because of the country's poor human rights record, with the rights of women, treatment of LGBTQ+ people and the use of the death penalty coming under scrutiny.\nHenderson, a vocal ally of the LGBTQ+ community during his time at Liverpool, was criticised after he made a surprise move to Steven Gerrard's Al-Ettifaq. He later said the criticism, which included one LGBTQ+ fans' group saying he had \"lost the respect of so many people\", \"really hurt\" and that \"money has never been a motivation.\"\nIbrahimovic says the moral concerns raised by playing in Saudi Arabia would not be a problem for him.\n\"Listen, wherever you play football, it's football,\" he added. \"Football connects people. It's a dream we share.\n\"As a professional football player, as long as you play football [that's enough]. And Saudi is growing. MLS is growing. China had a peak and then I don't know [why] the situation changed there.\n\"But a moral thing? No. We do things for ourselves and our family.

{"title": "The facts have changed, says Rishi Sunak, as he scraps HS2 leg", "date": "2023-10-04 17:26:16", "text": "This video can not be played\nRishi Sunak: I am cancelling the rest of the HS2 project\n\"The facts have changed,\" the PM has said, as he confirmed the HS2 high-speed rail line from Birmingham to Manchester would be scrapped.\nAddressing his party conference, Rishi Sunak said the project had come from a \"false consensus\" that links between big cities were \"all that matters\".\nHe announced he would instead invest in transport projects across the country. \nHe also set out plans for a a new post-16 qualification and to phase out smoking.\nIt was the PM's first speech to party conference as Conservative leader, and his hour-long address marked the start of a new and more risky approach from Mr Sunak.\nIt was an audacious speech from a prime minister who is often accused of political caution, and who leads a Conservative Party that has been in government for 13 years.\nHe said the public were exhausted with the politics of the last 30 years and that he was the man to deliver change. \nConceding that the public thinks it's time for a change carries significant opportunities - and significant risks. If Mr Sunak can convince voters that he offers a better chance of a new approach to government than Sir Keir Starmer, he may yet arrest the persistent and wide polling gap between the Tories and Labour.\nTalk about the scrapping of HS2 overshadowed the conference with senior Tories and Mr Sunak insisting a decision was still to be made.\nThe PM announced that the northern leg, between Birmingham and Manchester, as well as the eastern leg to East Midlands Parkway, would no longer go ahead. \nHe confirmed that the line from the West Midlands would run all the way to Euston station, not Old Oak Common in west London as had been rumoured. \nThis was accompanied by news that nearly £4bn would be reallocated to transport schemes in six northern city regions.\nThere will be £3bn for upgraded and electrified lines between Manchester and Sheffield, Sheffield and Leeds, Sheffield and Hull, and Hull to Leeds.\nHe also said money would go towards resurfacing roads across the country.\nThe decision has angered some including local leaders, such as Andy Street, the Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands, businesses in Manchester and former PM David Cameron.\nMr Cameron said it was the wrong decision, meaning a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity was lost\".\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, he said the reversal would \"make it much harder to build consensus for any future long-term projects\".\nHowever, there has been growing concern about the ballooning cost of the project, which has already seen its section to Leeds cancelled.\nThere had been speculation the decision might drive Mr Street to resign, but he has told the BBC that while disappointed he would not be quitting either his job or the party. \nLabour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden stopped short of committing the party to reviving HS2 between Birmingham and Manchester, saying it would need to \"look at the numbers\" if it won the next election. \nHe described Mr Sunak's announcement as a \"Tory fiasco\". \nLabour also said most of the transport schemes listed by the prime minister had either been previously promised or planned, so these projects did not amount to new investment. \nMr Sunak's speech also included the pledge that the age at which people can buy cigarettes and tobacco in England should rise by one year every year so that eventually no-one can buy them.\nMPs were to be given a free vote in parliament on the issue, Mr Sunak said. Former Prime Minister Liz Truss has already said she will vote against the ban.\nLabour said it would \"not play politics with public health\" and would \"lend\" the prime minister the votes to get the law passed.\nMr Sunak also announced that A-levels and T-levels would be folded into a new qualification for all school leavers, called the Advanced British Standard.\nIt will mean 16 to 19-year-olds will study five subjects instead of three, and some English and Maths to 18.\nMr Sunak's speech will have been delivered with an eye on a forthcoming general election, which must be held before January 2025.\nBut if voters conclude instead that the fifth Conservative prime minister in a row does not embody the change they want, then he will not have much room to manoeuvre or change approach. \nHe has conceded, fairly explicitly, that he thinks his Conservative predecessors failed in various ways - so he won't be able to switch to defending the Conservatives' record. \nWhatever Mr Sunak can achieve between now and the next election - that is what he will be running on. \nAnd his speech set out some of the policies - including the cancellation of HS2 - that will form part of the record. \nDuring the speech, Mr Sunak sought to draw comparisons between himself and the former Tory Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a heroine for many party members. \nHe said the Conservatives would always be \"the party of the grocer's daughter and the pharmacist's son\" - a reference to Mrs Thatcher and himself respectively. \nHe also sought to subtly admonish his immediate predecessor, Liz Truss, who, returning to the conference a year after her troubled premiership, had called for immediate tax cuts.\nShe received a rapturous reception from some party activists for her plea, but Mr Sunak said while he too wanted to cut taxes, it was more important to focus on cutting inflation.  \nQuoting Mrs Thatcher he said: \"Inflation is the biggest destroyer of all - of industry, of jobs, of savings, and of society - no policy which puts at the risk the defeat of inflation - no matter its short term attraction - can be right.\"\nMr Sunak won applause from activists by weighing in on gender issues, telling them it was \"common sense\" that \"a man is a man and a woman is a woman\".   \n\"We shouldn't get bullied into believing that people can be any sex they want to be,\" he said.   \nAs is customary with leader's speeches, the prime minister spoke of his family and background.\nHe recalled how his grandfather, on visiting Mr Sunak in Parliament when he first became an MP, instantly got out his phone to call the landlady he had when he had first arrived in the UK.\n\"He said to me, 'I just wanted to tell her where I was standing',\" said the prime minister.\nHe was introduced to the stage by his wife - Akshata Murty - who described her husband as her \"best friend\".\n\"We are one team and I could not imagine being anywhere else but here today with all of you to show my support to him and to the party.\"\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "Faisal Islam: Why Rishi Sunak's big gamble may not pay off", "date": "2023-10-05 07:37:15", "text": "When Rishi Sunak confirmed he was scrapping the huge infrastructure project of the West Midlands to Manchester leg of HS2 high-speed rail, he said the project had come from a \"false consensus\" that links between big cities were \"all that matters\".\nThe immediate pressing question is whether the UK is capable of delivering projects at this scale, at all. This was a nationally strategic project advertised to the world as a way for Britain's regional cities to attract investment from the biggest investment funds in the world.\nAll of the prime minister's secret conference projects were codenamed after trees. Scrapping HS2 was called \"Project Redwood\". High-speed rail in the UK has been shorn of its branches, and is now left as an expensive stump from London to Birmingham.\nThe escalating cost of this first phase was not a given. How was it allowed to balloon in cost so much to £45bn - and that's in 2019 prices? The country is left with having built the most expensive part of the line, with the least need in terms of capacity, but without the connections to northern cities that would have been most beneficial. \nDid it ever make sense to build what is largely a tunnel from London to Birmingham? Was the cash that should have extended the scheme to the north, the whole point of it, wasted on tunnels to hide it in southern countryside?\nWith rising costs, the government says that the HS2 scheme might not even give back as much in benefits as what is being spent on it. In contrast, some bus projects, for example, can give back £4 for a £1 government investment, it claims.\nOpponents accuse the government of scrapping a key piece of strategic infrastructure to create space for pre-election tax cuts. The government is adamant that this is not a way to fiddle the Treasury spreadsheets. While some detail remains on exactly when these new road and bus projects are delivered, their aim is not to free up cash. \nThe government also argues that the business case for HS2 leant significantly on business travellers. While overall passenger numbers have recovered to pre-pandemic levels, there are fewer business travellers now. Are these behavioural changes enough to mean the West Coast Main Line from London to Glasgow will not be at capacity?\nThe great prize of all of this was to change Britain's economic geography, to create a counterweight to south east England, and in effect to create a single labour market across three major northern cities. Some of that effect will be retained if the £12bn earmarked for the Liverpool to Manchester high-speed line is delivered.\nThe money is being spent instead on everyday transport upgrades, rather than a single grand project. It is likely that the benefits of this will be quicker and more visible on the ground. They also lend themselves to being put on election leaflets next year. \nThe economic and political consensus had been that the gap between Britain's second-tier cities and the capital was significantly bigger than other major economies. Indeed some have argued this was a major cause of Britain's low productivity. The prime minister has upended that consensus. \nThe opposition's response will be very interesting. Rishi Sunak has basically dared Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to reverse the cancellation decision, cut back the newly announced local transport projects, or borrow billions more.\nThese plans will probably reach more voters more quickly. But the risk is that Britain also develops a reputation as a place where big long-term projects are impossible, and cast-iron cross-party promises are easily disposed.\nMr Sunak has not just scrapped half a train line, he has suggested an entirely different approach to promoting British regional economic growth.\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "Would Labour tax meat? And other Conservative claims checked", "date": "2023-10-04 15:57:13", "text": "Rishi Sunak and his government ministers have been busy making speeches and giving interviews at the annual Conservative party conference.\nHere are some of the claims from their time in Manchester.\nIn his speech, Mr Sunak said: \"Labour's plan is to cook up some deal with the EU which could see us accepting around 100,000 of Europe's asylum seekers.\"\nThe Conservatives first used this figure in September, after Labour said it would seek a returns agreement with the EU.\nBut the 100,000 figure is misleading. The Conservatives worked it out by claiming that Labour would be forced to take a share of the EU's migrant quota, worked out according to population size. \nThe party's press release said around a million asylum seekers arrived in the EU in 2022. The UK's population is just under 13% of the EU's, so - it claimed - this would mean Labour taking more than 100,000 asylum seekers a year. \nBut the EU has no such scheme in place. It is negotiating a deal which includes relocating at least 30,000 asylum seekers a year between EU member states based on several criteria, including population size. The countries would not be forced to take asylum seekers and could choose to make a payment instead.\nLabour has said it would not join an EU quota scheme because the UK is no longer an EU member. It has not said how many asylum seekers it would accept under any future deal it negotiated. \nEnergy Secretary Claire Coutinho told the conference: \"It's no wonder Labour seems so relaxed about taxing meat\".\nWe asked Labour whether they were considering introducing a meat tax. They replied: \"Taxing meat is not Labour policy\". \nPressed by Sophy Ridge on Sky News about her claim, Ms Coutinho said it was \"good to have a light moment in your speech\". \nSpeaking on the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg's programme, the prime minister would not promise to cut taxes and instead wanted to focus on inflation.\nHe said: \"The best tax cut I can deliver for the British people is to halve inflation.\"\nWhen challenged on this he repeated: \"Inflation is a tax.\"\nInflation is not a tax, although high inflation can clearly make people worse off because it means higher prices.\nA tax is a charge or levy made by a government, typically to pay for services.\nMr Sunak also wanted to highlight his record in reducing inflation. He said: \"I spent the first year stabilising things, making progress on bringing inflation down.\"\nThe PM's pledged to halve it from 10.7% at the end of 2022, to 5.3% by the end of 2023 and it has been coming down. \nDespite the recent falls - to 6.7% in the year to August - analysts remain divided about whether the PM's goal will be achieved.\nHowever, the Bank of England said that it expected inflation to be about 5% by the end of the year.\nCore inflation, which strips out factors like energy and food - which are more vulnerable to global price swings - has seen only a modest reduction.\nBefore the prime minister scrapped part of HS2, his chancellor Jeremy Hunt was already warning about spending on the project. \nHe said \"it costs 10 times more\" to build high speed rail in the UK than France.\nBBC Verify asked the Treasury how this figure was calculated. It did not provide the detail, directing us instead to the Conservative Party, which did not reply. \nThere are no recent comparisons between the cost in France and the UK.\nIn 2015, a House of Lords report estimated the cost of building HS2 at \"up to nine times higher than the cost of constructing high speed lines in France\".\nThe report estimated the HS2 Phase One construction (which started at 2017) cost at around £90m per kilometre while similar projects in France, carried out between 1990 to 2011, cost between £9m-£15m per kilometre (in 2010 prices).\nThe report said possible reasons for the price difference include expensive tunnelling required in the UK but not in France, the cost of a new station at Birmingham and renovation of Euston station, as well as the state of the UK railway construction industry.\nMr Sunak also told BBC News the UK had decarbonised faster than any other country in the G7.\nThe G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest \"advanced\" economies, which includes the UK.\nIt is true the UK has decarbonised faster than other countries in this group when comparing cuts to greenhouse gas emissions since 1990.\nUK emissions had fallen by 48.7% up to the end of 2022, according to government data.\nThis figure refers to greenhouse gas emissions within the UK. It does not account for the UK's total carbon footprint, which includes emissions related to the manufacture of products that the UK imports from abroad, for example.\nDefence Secretary Grant Shapps told the conference: \"We have provided billions in military aid (to Ukraine) - second only to the contribution of the US.\"\nThe US is by far the largest contributor of arms to Ukraine - providing £24.6bn ($29.8bn) in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022.\nThe UK gave £2.3bn ($2.8bn) billion in 2022, and pledged the same amount in 2023 - taking its total commitments to £4.6bn ($5.6bn) since the start of the war.\nHowever, Germany has committed to providing £6.4bn ($7.7bn) over the same period, which would put it second to the US, in front of the UK.\nGermany provided £1.7bn ($2.1bn) in military aid in 2022 and pledged a further £4.7bn ($5.7bn) for 2023.\nIt is possible that Mr Shapps was basing his claim on 2022 military aid alone, but this wasn't made clear in his speech.\nWe have asked the UK Ministry of Defence to clarify his comments.\nThe Kiel Institute, a team of researchers which tracks the amount countries have pledged in military aid to Ukraine, also puts Germany in second place ahead of the UK.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

He promised to spend all of the money saved on local transport improvements, trams, buses rail, roads - many, many roads. \nQuestions remain about how all of this will work in practice - and the backlash against the cancellation of the high speed line to Manchester is already fierce. \nBut the ball is now in the opposition's court - will Labour promise to reverse the HS2 decision and cancel all of those local transport projects?\nPerhaps the most remarkable thing about Mr Sunak's speech was his claim that for the past 30 years, politics has failed. That encompasses every prime minister since Margaret Thatcher, in other words, including five Conservative ones.\n\"We've had 30 years of a political system which incentivises the easy decision, not the right one,\" he told the packed hall.\n\"Thirty years of vested interests standing in the way of change. Thirty years of rhetorical ambition which achieves little more than a short-term headline.\" \nMr Sunak is not the first Tory leader to try to cast himself as Thatcher's heir. But he may be the first to attempt to disown his immediate predecessors as party leader.\nIndeed, the only previous Tory leaders who got a nod of approval in his speech - apart from Thatcher - were Disraeli, Churchill... and Iain Duncan Smith.\nIndeed he did - 30 times in fact. \"Our mission is to fundamentally change our country,\" he told the party faithful. \n\"If this country is to change, then it can only be us who will deliver it,\" he added.\n\"Change only endures if we bring people with us.\"\nAnd so on. He badly wants to be seen as the \"change candidate\" at next year's general election - not an easy task after 13 years of Conservative rule.\nEducation is a major theme for Mr Sunak - and he used his conference speech to announce a string of new policies aimed at boosting the prospects of 16 to 19-year-olds. \nMerging A-levels with T-levels into a new Advanced British Standard qualification - which will only be available in England - is another example of tearing up a policy - T-levels - that was brought in by the Conservative government. \nBut overall, this was a major incursion into traditional Labour territory, not least the promise of a £30,000 cash bonus for teachers. \nThe PM's plan to end smoking for the next generation by raising the age at which cigarettes can be purchased every year will be seen as genuinely radical. New Zealand is the only other country in the world to attempt this.\nIt is clearly a subject the PM feels strongly about. It will be attacked by the libertarian right as nanny statism and there will be questions about how it will be enforced in practice, but how many MPs will oppose it when they are take part in the free vote Mr Sunak has promised on it?\nThe surprise appearance on stage of Mr Sunak's wife Akshata Murty - who has kept a pretty low profile to this point - went down very well in the hall.\nShe was able to deliver a message about the PM's background and values that meant more than if he had spoken about them himself. \nIt was a personal and at times touching five minute curtain raiser for the main event.

{"title": "What is happening to house prices, and could there be a crash?", "date": "2023-08-01 12:47:44", "text": "House prices have been falling in recent months.\nThat's because higher interest rates have made mortgages more expensive, while rising prices have hit people's spending power.\nPrices rose steeply - by about 25% - across most of the UK from the start of 2020 until Autumn 2022. \nBut they have fallen by nearly 5% from their peak, according to July's figures from the Nationwide Building Society. \nThe largest falls are in the South West and the smallest in Northern Ireland, Nationwide's figures show. \nYour device may not support this visualisation\nThese recent changes build on very different patterns of house price growth over the last 15 years. \nNorthern Ireland's prices have not returned to levels seen before the 2008 global financial crisis.\nIn contrast, London and the South East saw prices recover quickly up until 2015. They then saw less growth during the pandemic, when many people relocated to cheaper areas in search of more space. \nYour device may not support this visualisation\nHigher interest rates mean new mortgages are more expensive.\nAsking prices have not fallen far enough to balance this out. So, first-time buyers are unlikely to find buying a house more affordable in the short term. \nIn the longer run, if wages increase faster than house prices recover, housing will become more affordable. \nThose longer term trends also depend on whether housebuilding keeps up with demand. \nAffordability is worst in the South of England where a first-time buyer could expect to spend more than half of their income on their mortgage payments. But in areas like the Midlands, it's more like a third.\nIn March, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which advises the government on the health of the economy, predicted that house prices will drop by 10% over the next two years.\nThat would be about half the fall of the financial crisis of 2008 and would put prices back to autumn 2021 levels.\nBut predictions are very uncertain. \nSome observers hope for a \"soft landing\". That could mean interest rates nearing their peak now, small price falls in the rest of 2023 and then little, if any, growth next year.\nAn alternative view is that further sharp rises in interest rates could trigger even steeper falls in house prices in Autumn. \nAbout 100,000 households come off a fixed-price mortgage each month. Even if rates stabilise, they will still be hit with interest rates that are higher than their last mortgage.\nSome may find their new monthly payments unaffordable, making them more likely to sell, possibly pushing prices down. \nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.\nAt this rate, your payments could change by…\n\n                            monthly change\nto\n\n                            monthly total\n\n\nThe information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.\nThis calculator does not constitute financial advice.

It should be used as a guide only and does not represent the suitability, eligibility or availability of mortgage offers for users. For exact figures, users will need to approach an official mortgage lender.\nInterest rates fluctuate based on the Bank of England's base rate and market conditions.\nThere are more people with potentially \"financially stretching\" mortgages in London and the South East than in the rest of the country, the Financial Conduct Authority says.\nThis is because loans in the south tend to be very high compared with borrowers' incomes. The loans can become difficult to repay when mortgage rates rise, or inflation bites. \nHowever, lending rules were tightened after the 2008 crash. Most borrowers in recent years have had their ability to pay checked against higher interest rates than those we're currently seeing. \nFortunately, the number of people behind on their mortgages did not rise significantly in 2022 and was still at half the 2008 level.  \nThe number of repossessions in 2022 was also less than a tenth of what was seen in the years after the crash.  \nThis video can not be played\nWorried about rising mortgage payments?

{"title": "First time home buyers: How much can I borrow?", "date": "2023-05-12 09:47:46", "text": "With rents rising, lots of people are crunching the numbers to see if they can afford to buy their own home.\nBut it is a big financial commitment, with risks if house prices fall or if you need to relocate. \nSo what do you need to know to help you decide?\nMost people spend less each month on their mortgage payments than they would on rent for a similar property, according to the Halifax. \nHalifax's most recent Owning vs Renting review found on average the monthly mortgage costs for a three-bed home were £42 lower than renting the equivalent.\nBut the difference varies widely across the UK.\nHomeowners in Scotland make big savings compared to renters. While in the east of England it is cheaper to rent than to own.\nFirst-time buyers can apply for the same mortgage deals as any other borrower. But banks and building societies will look very closely at a first-time buyer's financial situation and credit record. \nAfter a year of steadily rising interest rates, mortgage rates have also gone up, to between 4% and 7%.\nMortgage brokers like Riz Malik at R3Mortgages say that it can be hard for first-time buyers to borrow large amounts, as lenders are getting tougher over affordability criteria. \nTypically, a bank might lend you four or five times your salary.\nIt also depends on what outgoings you have. If you already owe money, such as a car loan, or have student debt, that will be taken into account.\nA lot of money advice websites have calculators to help you work out what you can afford and mortgage brokers can help you identify deals to suit your situation.\nThe average house price for a first-time buyer is just over £300,000.\nSaving a large enough deposit is the biggest hurdle for many would-be homeowners, one of the reasons the average age of a first-time buyer has risen to 32.\nUsually you need a deposit worth at least 10% of the property's value. But the bigger your deposit, the better deal you will get from the lender.\nThe average deposit for first-time buyers is £62,470 according to Halifax, almost double the UK's average annual salary, with people typically putting down around 20% of the purchase price of their property.\nSome lenders will accept a deposit of 5% of the property's value. Skipton Building Society is even offering a no-deposit mortgage. It is the first mortgage to cover 100% of the value of the property since the financial crisis and uses your history as a rent-payer to establish credit-worthiness.\nIf you are saving for a deposit and you are between 18 and 40, the government will match 25% of any money you save in a Lifetime ISA.\nMore than 60% of first-time buyers are opting for joint-ownership and that's not just couples. Increasingly friends are choosing to buy together too, says Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons Estate Agency.\nAny joint arrangement should be drawn up with a proper legal contract, as all parties will be liable for the full mortgage, says Ms Beveridge.\nA first-time buyer is someone who has never owned or part-owned a property before. That offers a tax advantage as long as you are buying a property to live in.\nIn England and Northern Ireland first-time buyers don't pay stamp duty - a tax based on the value of the property you're buying - on properties worth less than £425,000.\nScotland's equivalent, the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax, is waived for first-time buyers of properties worth less than £175,000.\nThere is no first-time buyer relief for the Wales' Land Transaction Tax.\nThe biggest government scheme to support home-buyers, Help to Buy, has ended (except in Wales), although recently there have been reports the government is considering a reboot.\nThere are others including the First Homes scheme, aimed at helping first-time buyers and keyworkers with a household income under £80,000 (or £90,000 in London) to buy new-build properties.\nShared ownership schemes allow you to buy a share of the property and pay rent for the rest, with the option of increasing your stake when you can afford to.\nNeither of these schemes are on the scale of Help to Buy, says David Hollingworth at L&C Mortgages. Help to Buy helped ramp up house prices, he adds, making them less affordable for first-time buyers today.\nDeposit-free mortgage aimed at renters launched\nWhat are the new stamp duty rates?\nWhat no change in rates means for your money\nWhat is happening to house prices?\nWhat are your rights when you're renting?\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

Be focussed and be prepared. Being first won't necessarily guarantee you the property but it will help.\"\nCampaign group Generation Rent agreed. Spokesman Dan Wilson Craw said it was essential to know what the property needs to have, such as storage for a bike or a washing machine already installed. \n\"That way if you view a property that ticks all the right boxes you can apply for a tenancy on the spot,\" he said.  \nBeing loaded with information really helps landlords and agents when looking to choose a tenant. \nRightmove's Tim Bannister said: \"That means making sure you've got as much information as possible, for example multiple references with contacts available. \n\"Be clear about your circumstances and how flexible you can be with your timelines. Be upfront and provide clarity. The more you can do to work with a landlord, the better.\"\nGeneration Rent said aside from having the holding deposit worth one week's rent in your account, prospective tenants needed to provide evidence of their income.\nThat includes letting your employer and current landlord know they'll need to provide a reference. \nIf you have exhausted your time trying to find a rental in your perfect area try thinking outside the box. Zoopla said a travel time search can bring more properties into your orbit which you might not have considered. \nGeographically, a home may look too far away but its travel time might be quicker than you thought. This can can open up your search to cheaper areas or slower rental markets. \nMr Bannister said rental searches on Rightmove had expanded since the pandemic with many approaching reaching 50 sq km (19.3 sq miles).\nVictoria Tolmie-Loverseed helps students find accommodation with Unipol, a charity based in Bradford, Leeds and Nottingham. \nA rising student population not matched by an increased supply of housing has resulted in a crisis for young people often living away from home for the first time.\n\"Be flexible about where you're willing to live, cast your net wider into non-student areas and be willing to travel a little bit further,\" Ms Tolmie-Loverseed said. \n\"Know your budget, have your deposit sorted, know who your guarantor will be,\" she added.  \nRenters struggle as homes to let plunge by a third\nWhat are your rights when you're renting?\nThe care leavers struggling to find somewhere to live\nWhat you can do about a rent increase\nBBC Sounds - Rental Health - Available Episodes\nFinding a home to rent - Citizens Advice\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

The BBC's Lora Jones tells you what you can do, in a minute\nIf you have an interest-only mortgage it means you are only paying the interest on the amount borrowed, and you are not paying down the size of the debt. \nMoving to an interest-only mortgage can keep your monthly payments affordable, says Richard Dana, chief executive of digital mortgage broker Tembo.\n\"However, it's best to use this as a short-term solution, otherwise you will have to pay your remaining mortgage balance at the end of your mortgage term,\" he adds. \nYour income and the amount of equity you hold in the property will determine your eligibility. \nThis is possibly not a realistic option for a growing family, or for the owners of a small flat.\nBut for older mortgage customers whose children have flown the nest, selling up and buying a smaller property could reduce the mortgage size - or potentially pay it off entirely.\n\"Consumers looking to re-mortgage may find it difficult to afford higher interest rates, so seeking independent advice is essential to consider every option available to them, such as downsizing,\" says Rachel Springall from financial data firm Moneyfacts.\nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.\nAt this rate, your payments could change by…\n\n                            monthly change\nto\n\n                            monthly total\n\n\nThe information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.\nThis calculator does not constitute financial advice. It is based on a standard mortgage repayment formula based on the mortgage size and length and a fixed interest rate. It should be used as a guide only and does not represent the suitability, eligibility or availability of mortgage offers for users. For exact figures, users will need to approach an official mortgage lender.\nInterest rates fluctuate based on the Bank of England's base rate and market conditions.\nThe typical mortgage term is 25 years, but 30 and even 40-year terms are now available.\n\"Extending the term can help reduce the monthly payment but can cost tens of thousands of pounds more in interest over the life of the mortgage,\" says David Hollingworth.\n\"Make sure that you regularly review whether you could cut the term back again as your circumstances change.\"\nFrom listing with a short-term letting site like AirBnB, renting out your parking space with an app like Just Park, or taking in a lodger or overseas student, there are several options to make a bit of cash. \n\"Under the government's rent-a-room scheme you will get a tax free allowance of £7,500 per year for income generated from your main home too,\" says Richard Dana.\nHow will the latest interest rate rise affect you?

Watch the BBC's Lora Jones tell you, in a minute.\nIn England a holding deposit is paid to a landlord to reserve a property.\nIt can't be more than one week's rent.\nYou should get the money back within seven days of signing your tenancy agreement - or it can go towards your rent.\nBut if you decide not to move in, you could lose it. \nIf the landlord doesn't give it back, and you think they should, write to them.\nIf you still don't get a refund, contact one of the letting agent redress schemes.\nYou can also complain in England to Trading Standards through the Citizen's Advice consumer helpline.\nSuch deposits are not legal in Scotland, and rules are different in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nLandlords need to follow strict rules if they want a tenant to leave - if not, the eviction could be illegal, or the landlord could be guilty of harassment.\nIn England the landlord has to give written notice to the tenant, which could be: \nOther tenancy contracts have different rules.\nOnce the notice period ends, the landlord can start eviction proceedings through court.\nLandlords can apply for a so-called \"possession order\". If that is granted and you don't leave, landlords can apply for a \"warrant for possession\".\nEviction rules differ in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nTenants in England have the right to \"live in a property that's safe and in a good state of repair\". Similar rules are in place in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\nLandlords are not expected to do small jobs like changing light bulbs.\nHowever, a rented home could be unfit if, for example, the electrics are unsafe, it's damp, or there's a problem with rats or mice.\nIf so, you can complain to your landlord, or - if that doesn't work - your local council.\nYour landlord may try to evict you rather than make repairs, but you might have more protection if you've already complained to the council. \nTenants need to pay rent on time, cover the bills they are responsible for, and look after the property. This includes disposing of rubbish, and keeping the property reasonably clean.\nThere are no laws explicitly stopping this, but MPs are considering more protections for renters in England.\nUnder a new law tabled in Parliament, tenants will be given a legal right to request to keep a \"well-behaved\" pet, which the landlord can only refuse on reasonable grounds - such as the size of the property.\nHowever, landlords will be able to charge a higher rent to cover the risk of pet damage.\nThe law is also set to make it illegal for a landlord to refuse tenancies to families with children, or those on benefits.\nAt present it could be discrimination under equality law in England if a landlord refuses to rent a property to a woman because she has children.\nHowever, BBC News foundalmost a quarter of some 8,000 adverts examined on the property website OpenRent indicated that families were not eligible.\nMore than 300 listings on another property portal, Zoopla, explicitly said children were not wanted, although this was less than 1% of those we looked at.\nSome 73% of sampled OpenRent listings said tenants with pets were not welcome, compared with 6% on Zoopla. \nShelter warned the problem would be even more widespread as sometimes prospective tenants were only told they were not welcome when they applied. \nLandlords can choose to include bills such as council tax, but don't have to.\nIf a landlord includes utility bills, they cannot charge a tenant more than the amount they pay. \nExhausting, costly, miserable: My search to rent a one-bed flat\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nTrump endorses Jim Jordan for House Speaker\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "Cheaper train tickets: Five ways to save money", "date": "2023-08-16 20:56:34", "text": "A jump in ticket prices may feel particularly unwelcome, after costs for everything have risen at near-record rates. \nThe next price rise for regulated fares is due in March 2024. Regulated fares cover about 45% of fares, including season tickets on most commuter journeys, some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys and anytime tickets around major cities.\nIt may seem like little consolation - especially after months of disruption from rail strikes and poor service - but the government has promised that the increase will be below the rate of price inflation for a second year.\nWhile some people will try to cram in buying their season tickets just before the price rise, here are five tips for getting the cheapest deals at any time of the year.\nAdvance train tickets are usually released up to 12 weeks before your departure date, although some go on sale as far as 24 weeks in advance. \nThese types of tickets are often the cheapest way to travel on the railways if you're happy to go during a fixed time. Sometimes they can be available to buy up to an hour before your journey.\nPersonal finance website Money Saving Expert says that London North Eastern Railway (LNER) often releases advance tickets up to six months ahead for routes from stations north of York to London.\nSome ticket purchasing apps can send alerts to your phone as soon as tickets for a specified journey go on sale. \nSplit ticketing means you can take the same number of trains you normally would for your journey, but can save money by splitting your journey into multiple tickets between the stations the service stops at on the way.\nSome websites like Split My Fare and Split Train Tickets do it for you without you having to work it out.\nSplit My Fare says on average, customers save 26% by doing this - although it's not always possible on some journeys. \nAlso, checking to see whether it is cheaper to buy two single tickets rather than a return might save you money.  \nRail cards can offer discounts when booking, though they cost money to purchase in the first place, so benefit those who travel often.\nThere are several types of rail card available: national, regional, those for students and those for pensioners. \nFor example, the regional Cotswold Line Railcard costs £9.95, is valid for one year and gives you a 34% discount on off-peak single and return tickets.\nMore information on the different types of railcard are here.\nYou can get up to a third off the ticket price when travelling in groups of three to nine adults. \nThe group must be travelling together, and individual rail cards cannot be used when booking a group ticket. \nGroups of over 10 people can also get discounts - contact the train company directly for those. Group off-peak day travelcards for London are also available, but the origin station on the ticket needs to be in fare zones one to nine.\nNational flexible rail tickets could save passengers hundreds of pounds, says watchdog Transport Focus. \nThe flexible season tickets will allow travel on any eight days in a 28-day period, with no need to select the days of travel in advance. \nTrain companies have also introduced a range of flexible tickets aimed at commuters and workers who have seen their travel patterns change post-pandemic.  \nThe Flexi Season ticket will offer a minimum of 20% discount on an equivalent monthly season ticket, according to National Rail.\nFor those making the same journey multiple times in a week regularly, monthly or season tickets can be cheaper. Check with your employer to see if they offer a season ticket loan to help you spread the cost, interest free.\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "Fuel cost: How to save petrol and diesel", "date": "2023-07-03 13:01:34", "text": "Making fewer journeys is the most obvious way to save money, but how else can you use less fuel?\nHere are five popular tips from drivers - and whether or not they really work.\nMany motorists consider driving at exactly 56mph to be optimum for fuel efficiency.\nHowever, there is no ideal fixed driving speed, according to the RAC motoring group.\nThe 56mph myth, it says, came out of old fuel consumption tests - comparing driving in a built-up area to driving at 56mph and at 75mph.\nThe most efficient of the three was 56mph, which led people to think this was always the best speed. \nHowever, depending on the type of car and its size, the RAC says 45-50mph is most efficient.\nIf you've ever resisted the urge to reach for the air conditioning on a hot summer's day to save fuel, you were right to do so.\nExtra energy is needed to power a car's air conditioning system and turning it on can increase your fuel consumption by up to 10% according to the AA.\nThe impact might be more noticeable on shorter trips - that's because the air conditioner has to use more power initially to bring down the inside temperature of your car.\nOpening your windows might be better, but this creates a separate problem called \"drag\". This is where your engine has to work harder to compensate for the air resistance created by the open windows.\nIf you're forced to choose between two, the best option will depend on your speed. The air conditioner is probably the better above 50mph because the faster you drive the greater the drag caused by open windows. \nCoasting is when you drive with the car in neutral, or with the clutch pedal held down.\nThe AA recommends against coasting. Not only could it be unsafe (because you can't accelerate out of a tricky situation), the group also says it's unlikely to save you any petrol. \nIt says most cars have electric controls which cut the supply of fuel each time you take your foot off the accelerator - so there's nothing to be gained by coasting.\nCruise control - a device which keeps your car at a constant speed without having to use the accelerator pedal - is often seen as a sure-fire way to save fuel, as it avoids unnecessary acceleration and harsh braking. \nHowever, this may only be true when it comes to motorway driving - due to the constant flat surface. \nOn other road types you are more likely to come across hills and your cruise control will take time to adjust to the change in gradient, using up more fuel in the process.\nNormally you take your foot off the accelerator as you begin to descend down a hill, but as your cruise control can't see what's in front it spends extra time using power - leading to worse fuel consumption.\nUnderinflated tyres will use up extra petrol.

{"title": "Food prices: How can I save money on my grocery shop?", "date": "2023-07-31 10:57:17", "text": "As price rises bite into budgets, many people are cutting back on the weekly food shop.\nAs well as buying less, people are looking for ways to make their money go further and to make the most of what they have. The BBC spoke to money bloggers for their tried and tested tips.\nRosie suggests taking a good look at your cupboards before each shopping trip. \"We all know the value of making a list, but if you're adding to what you've already got in your cupboards, then you're going to spend money on things you don't need,\" she says. \n\"There's no point in buying more jars of pasta sauce if you've already got five of them in the cupboard.\" \nShe keeps a list of what's in her cupboards in a notebook, so she always knows what she already has when she goes shopping. She says it has helped bring her weekly food shop for her, her husband and one-year-old son down to around £40.\nLynn recommends changing how you shop when you walk into a store and to head straight for the reduced section. \"If you spot something there that's on your list, you can tick that off and you've already saved some money,\" she says.\nShe suggests then going straight to the frozen-foods section, and then the canned-produce aisle.\n\"Frozen meat, fish and vegetables will almost always be cheaper than the fresh option,\" she says. \"If you get what you need from there before going on to the fresh produce aisles, you're likely to make significant savings.\"\nAccording to sustainability charity Wrap, the average household wastes around £700 every year by throwing food away. Lynn says making better use of her freezer has helped her cut down dramatically on waste.\n\"If things are getting close to their use-by date you should always try to freeze them,\" she says. \"Things like milk and cheese, even fruit and vegetables, can all be frozen and kept for when you need them.\"\nMore on the basics of freezing can be found on the Food Standards Agency website.\nKate Hall, who runs The Full Freezer website, uses her freezer as a pause button rather than a long-term storage solution. She says that while almost all foods can be frozen, you do have to change the way you use them.\n\"You can't defrost a banana or salad and expect it to be the same as when it went into the freezer,\" she explains. \"But if you think about how you could use it in puddings or in soups or in casseroles, then you're going to save a lot of money.\"\nRosie says that a lot of what we buy in the supermarket is packaged for their convenience and not ours. \"How often have you bought a tray of mushrooms covered in cling film only to have them go off in their packaging? They're wrapped up like that to make them easier to transport,\" she explains. \nShe puts hers in a paper bag when she gets them home but says just taking off the plastic wrapping will help them last longer.\nHelen White, from Wrap, which runs the Love Food Hate Waste campaign, says there are small things we can do to make food last longer, especially fresh vegetables and salads - the UK's most wasted food group. \n\"Just putting a piece of kitchen roll into an open bag of salad to absorb moisture is going to help it last longer,\" she says. \nKeeping fruit in the fridge will help it last longer, but she suggests checking that the temperature is set to below 5°C. \"We think millions of UK fridges are at least two degrees too warm,\" she says. \"This is bad news for milk and other food items kept in the fridge, which can go off [more quickly] when not stored at the right temperature.\"\nRosie tries to use local, smaller retailers a lot to tap into their years of experience. \n\"Butchers are a great resource and someone we shouldn't be afraid to talk to about saving money,\" she says. \"If you go into your local butcher and tell them you've only got £8 for your meat for the week, they'll be able to tell you how to stretch your money by buying the cheapest cuts.\n\"They're the best people to advise on how to cook them and how to make them go further.\"\nWe asked you for your tips, here are some you sent in: \nMy wife and I sit with our iPads on both Asda and Tesco and put in the exact same things for our weekly delivery. We then check at the end total costs including delivery and whoever is cheapest 'wins' our order. We feel that writing a list of things you need then getting them online saves going to the shop where we would invariably end up throwing things in that we don't need. Russell, Portstewart, Northern Ireland\nI highly recommend having a weekly menu, so you know what you are going to cook/prepare for your meals each week. I post this on our fridge and our family of five always knows what to expect. This not only saves money but eliminates the stress of \"what's for dinner\"? I know exactly what I need to get, and I stick to my budget because I go to the supermarket with a plan, plus I check the fridge/pantry before I go shopping. Michelle Lutchman, Surrey\nTip is not about food but about cleaning products. There is much money to be saved on laundry and cleaning products. These are full of gimmicks to make us buy additional stuff. For instance, you don't need separate washing powder for coloureds. Fading is largely due to exposure to daylight rather than brighteners in washing powder. Helen Borodzicz, Lytham, St Annes\n I go to the supermarket at about 2.30 pm when they are reducing sandwiches - that's my tea sorted!

{"title": "What are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?", "date": "2023-08-29 14:58:37", "text": "Air passengers are facing significant delays to their flights after a \"technical issue\" hit the UK air traffic control system.\nThe National Air Traffic Services said on Monday afternoon that the glitch had been fixed, however hundreds of flights were cancelled. \nThe problem emerged on one of the busiest days of the year for flights, when many people were set to return from long weekend trips abroad.\nIf you do find your flight is affected, what are your rights?\nIf your flight is covered under UK law, your airline must let you choose between either getting a refund or an alternative flight, regardless of how far in advance the cancellation was made. \nYou can get your money back for any part of the ticket you have not used. So if you booked a return flight and the outbound leg is cancelled, you can get the full cost of the return ticket refunded. \nIf you still want to travel, your airline must find you an alternative flight. If another airline is flying to your destination significantly sooner, or there are other suitable modes of transport available, then you have a right to be booked onto that alternative transport instead. \nIf you are stuck abroad or at the airport because of a flight cancellation, airlines must also provide you with other assistance until you are able to fly to your destination. \nThis includes: \nIf your airline is unable to arrange assistance, you have the right to organise this yourself and claim back the cost later. In this case, the Civil Aviation Authority advises people to keep receipts and not spend more than necessary. \nYou are entitled to the same assistance if your flight is delayed by more than two hours. \nYou may also be able to claim compensation if your flight arrives at its destination more than three hours late. Again, the amount is based on how far you are flying. \nIf you are delayed by more than five hours and no longer want to travel, you can get a full refund.\nIf you booked a package holiday with a company that is an Abta member and your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a suitable alternative flight or a full refund. \nDisruption caused by things like airport or air traffic control employee strikes, bad weather or other \"extraordinary circumstances\" are not eligible for extra compensation.\nHowever, in other circumstances - which are the airline's fault - you have a number of rights under UK law if you are flying from a UK airport on any airline, arriving at a UK airport on an EU or UK airline, or arriving at an airport in the EU on a UK airline. \nWhat you are entitled to depends on what caused the cancellation and how much notice you were given. \nIf your flight is cancelled with less than two weeks' notice, you may be able to claim compensation based on the timings of the alternative flight you are offered.\nThe amount you are entitled to also depends on how far you were travelling. For example: \nAirlines will not refund you for loss of earnings. They are only responsible for covering direct costs - such as hotel rooms, meals and alternative flights - but they are not obliged to cover consequential losses.\nTravel insurance policies will not usually cover loss of earnings. \nIf you think you're going to be late back at work because of flight delays, you have a responsibility to contact your employer to let them know you won't be back as planned, legal experts say.\nYou should agree with your employer over how to categorise the absence; for example, using more annual leave or time banked in lieu. Taking unpaid leave could also be an option.\nEmployers have no legal obligation to pay employees who are absent in this situation, experts say, unless it is stated in their contract.\nHave you been personally affected by the disruption to flights?

{"title": "What is the minimum wage and how much is it?", "date": "2023-10-02 08:29:40", "text": "The national living wage is likely to go above £11 next April, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told the Conservative Party conference. \nAbout two million workers aged 23 and over benefit from the living wage, currently worth £10.42 an hour. \nThe minimum wage - known officially as the National Living Wage - varies according to the age of the employee, and is updated every April. \nFrom 1 April 2023, the rates are:\nThe apprentice rate applies to people aged under 19, or people over 19 in the first year of their apprenticeship.\nThe minimum wage is the same across all parts of the UK.\nSpeaking at the Tory party conference in Manchester, the chancellor confirmed the minimum wage would rise to at least £11 an hour from April 2024.\nThe government says this would increase the annual earnings of a full-time worker on the national living wage by £1,000. \nMinimum wage rates across all age categories are due to be announced later in October. \nThe retail, care and hospitality sectors account for a large number of minimum-wage jobs, although they are found in many other parts of the economy too.\nAny employer not paying the minimum wage can be fined by the UK tax authority, HMRC.\nIf you think you should be getting the minimum wage and aren't, you can complain via the HMRC website. \nYou can also get advice from the Acas website or by calling its helpline on 0300 123 1100. \nIn June, the government confirmed more than 200 firms had been fined nearly £7m and told to reimburse 63,000 workers for breaches dating back over a decade.\nCompanies involved include WH Smith, Marks & Spencer, Argos and Lloyds Pharmacy. \nWH Smith was the worst offender, having failed to pay more than £1m to more than 17,600 workers.\nThe rates are decided each year by government, based on the advice of an independent advisory group, the Low Pay Commission.\nIts recommendations reflect how many people are in work, what's happening to earnings and how much people are having to pay for essentials such as food and housing. \nPeople who don't qualify include:\nThose with disabilities or in long-term unemployment who take part in government work programmes are paid fixed amounts at different stages of the scheme, which are less than the minimum wage.\nWork done by prisoners is paid at a minimum of £4 a week, while students on work placements of less than a year as a required part of their studies are not entitled to be paid anything.\nThe law to introduce the minimum wage was passed in 1998 by the Labour government and it came into force the following year.\nIt started at £3.60 for those 22 and older, and £3 for 18-21 year olds.\nBefore the minimum wage was introduced, the lowest-paid people consistently saw the slowest growth in their wages.\nBefore the minimum wage was introduced, there was concern that it would cost jobs, because it was thought employers would compensate for their higher wage bill by hiring fewer people.\nBut this didn't turn out to be the case.\nThere's no evidence of an overall loss of jobs linked to the minimum wage, and only weak evidence of negative impacts on some groups of workers.\nMore than 430,000 workers across the UK benefit from the voluntary \"Real Living Wage\", which is set by the Living Wage Foundation charity. \nIt's above the level of the legal minimum wage, reflecting what the charity thinks people need to earn to cover everyday needs.\nIt is currently £11.95 an hour in London, and £10.90 an hour elsewhere in the UK. \nThere are more than 13,000 Living Wage-accredited employers, including Google, Ikea, Aviva, Nationwide and Burberry. \nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "Cost of living: Five tips when asking for a pay rise", "date": "2023-08-15 10:33:09", "text": "If you feel like you're not getting paid enough, you're probably not alone.\nWhile average wages have been increasing, they're still not keeping up with the pace of price rises, which means many people are finding it harder to get by.\nRecent months have seen waves of strikes, with tens of thousands of workers walking out in disputes over pay, jobs and conditions.\nMany of these strikes have taken place in the public sector, where workers often do not have the power to negotiate individually.\nAnd whether you work in the public or private sector, even if you do have a conversation with your manager there's no guarantee that it will result in a pay rise.\nHowever, there are ways to give yourself the best chance of success. \nWe spoke to recruiters, a manager and a workplace psychologist to get five tips on how to best negotiate for more money.\nJill Cotton, a career trends experts at jobs site Glassdoor, says scheduling a talk in advance will allow you and your boss time to prepare, and means you're more likely to have a productive conversation.\n\"Don't spring this on your line manager,\" Ms Cotton says. \"Be upfront and say that you want to book in a conversation that is specifically about pay.\"\nRowsonara Begum, who helps her brother run Saffron Indian takeaway in Salisbury, says it also needs to be the right time for the business.\nThe takeaway has five members of staff and occasionally takes on additional workers during busy periods.\nShe says if workers pick a time when the business is doing well, they will have the best chance of successfully negotiating more money.\nIf you're asking for a pay rise, you should have lots of evidence of why you deserve one.\n\"Know what you've achieved either from a work setting or what you've done to develop yourself, maybe to support your team, support your line managers. List all the pros of what you've done,\" says Shan Saba, a director at Glasgow-based recruitment firm Brightwork.\nThis evidence also helps your manager rationalise why you should be paid more, according to Stephanie Davies, a workplace psychologist.\n\"The brain needs a 'why' - why should I pay you this amount?\" she says.\nHowever, it's not just about bringing a list of all the things you've done. You should also be clear about what you want to do next, says Mr Saba.\n\"If you have aspirations of moving up through your organisation, have a plan of what you're looking to do over the coming year.\"\nWhen asking your boss for more money, it helps if you're confident and know your worth.\nThat's something Ms Begum has noticed, from her experience of having these talks with staff.\n\"Here in Salisbury, it's quite difficult to get the staff we need,\" she says.\n\"It's also become harder to recruit from overseas. So workers have negotiating power because they know there's a shortage.\"\nOften people don't feel confident because there is a \"stigma\" around talking about pay, says Glassdoor's Jill Cotton, but it's \"an important part of work\".\nWomen and people from minority backgrounds can often find it particularly hard to ask for more more, adds psychologist Stephanie Davies.\nHer advice to them is to ask for a mentor or role model, who can help guide them through those conversations.\nMost experts agree it's best to have an exact figure in mind before embarking on a conversation about pay.\nDo your research, advises James Reed, chair of recruitment firm Reed.\n\"You can go online and look at job adverts and see what other comparable jobs are being recruited for and what the salaries are,\" he says.\nMs Cotton warns the figure should be realistic.\n\"We would all love to be paid millions of pounds every single year. But we are being paid to fulfil a role with the skillset we have,\" she says.\nIf the above steps don't result in a pay rise, try not to be disheartened.\n\"Sometimes these conversations can take a while, even months, but it's important to keep the communication open,\" says Ms Begum.\nPay is also not the be-all and end-all, says Mr Reed.\n\"It's not just necessarily about money. You might be able to get more holiday or more flexibility around working hours,\" he says, adding you could also negotiate extra training and development.\nAnd if you don't feel you're getting what you want from your employer, remember, there are other opportunities out there.\n\"You can always look elsewhere, that's the really big lesson,\" says Ms Davies.\nPay rises at fastest pace for over 20 years\nWhy is UK inflation so high?\nStrike dates: Who is striking and what pay do they want?\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "Mortgages: What happens if I am struggling to pay?", "date": "2023-08-10 12:44:55", "text": "The average interest rate charged by mortgage lenders recently hit a 15-year high.\nSo what can those struggling to make repayments do - and what support should they get from their provider? \nThere are different types of mortgages, all of which have become more expensive in recent months.\nMortgage rates have risen, and the 1.6 million people on tracker or variable deals are paying much more than a year ago. \nNearly 2.5 million homeowners have fixed deals that will expire by the end of 2024, and face a significant increase in monthly payments. \nIt is hard to say. The sector has seen considerable upheaval in the past year, after many years of ultra-low rates.\nThe typical interest charged on fixed rates for new borrowers shot up after last autumn's mini-budget, then calmed somewhat, but subsequently rose to a 15-year high. \nThere have been some signs of reductions recently, but rates are still comparatively high.\nThat's because wages and prices are rising faster and for longer than expected, and meaning the Bank of England may raise the base rate higher.\nThe Bank has warned that more than two million households will pay between £200 and £499 more a month on new deals from the end of this year and the end of 2026. \nA further one million mortgage holders will see their monthly payments rise by at least £500 over the next two and a half years.\nIf the base rate does rise again, anyone on tracker deals will also face higher repayments.\nHouse prices have also started to fall as higher interest rates put off buyers.\nThe government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggests that UK house prices will fall by 10% by 2024 compared with last year's peak.\nThere are still likely to be plenty of options, depending on your circumstances. The bigger question is whether people can afford higher repayments.\nAn agreement between lenders, the Treasury and regulators means people can switch to a new fixed-rate mortgage without a new affordability test when their current deal ends, as long as their payments are up-to-date.\nA modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.\nAt this rate, your payments could change by…\n\n                            monthly change\nto\n\n                            monthly total\n\n\nThe information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.\nThis calculator does not constitute financial advice. It is based on a standard mortgage repayment formula based on the mortgage size and length and a fixed interest rate. It should be used as a guide only and does not represent the suitability, eligibility or availability of mortgage offers for users. For exact figures, users will need to approach an official mortgage lender.\nInterest rates fluctuate based on the Bank of England's base rate and market conditions.\nIf you have savings, you could consider paying down some of the total amount borrowed. \nSavings could also be put into a linked offset savings account, where you only pay interest on the mortgage balance, minus the amount you've saved.\nYou may want to extend the length of the mortgage term, although that would mean paying more in total. \nA broker can guide you through the different options.\nOwing two or more months' repayments means you are officially in arrears.\nBut the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates mortgage firms, says lenders must treat customers fairly.\nIt says borrowers must contact their lender as soon as they realise they will struggle to make repayments - the earlier the better. Trained and experienced staff must offer help.\nThis video can not be played\nWorried about rising mortgage payments? The BBC's Lora Jones tells you what you can do, in a minute\nWithin 15 working days of falling into arrears, your lender must:\nYour lender must consider any reasonable request to resolve the arrears. This could include reducing your monthly payment by extending the term of the mortgage, or switching to an interest-only payment for a certain period. \nMissing monthly payments - or arranging to pay less than you owe - will be reflected on your credit file, which could affect your ability to borrow money in the future. \nA mortgage payment holiday lets borrowers delay repayments for a short time.\nLenders may offer this option, depending on individual circumstances, although probably not to those already in arrears. \nThe level of support offered to customers during the Covid pandemic has been reduced.\nAgain, a payment holiday will show on your credit file. \nSome people may decide to sell their home and - in extreme circumstances - the lender could take court action to repossess it.\nRepossessions are far rarer than they used to be. \nThere are several stages before a lender can do this, and the whole process takes about two years.\nBut if you think your home is at risk, it is well worth getting free, independent debt advice about your options. \nGovernments tend not to get directly involved in support when people face higher mortgage repayments, but many lenders have signed up to the government's mortgage charter which ensures they are clear about the options available.\nFor people on qualifying benefits, Support for Mortgage Interest is available across the UK. The government pays some of your mortgage interest payments, but in the form of a loan (which must be repaid, with interest). \nBorrowers tend to pay off the loan when they sell the property, or when they die.\nThere are various conditions and requirements that need to be considered before signing up.\nGovernments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also run some mortgage support schemes, but the rules are complicated, and they tend to focus on people at risk of homelessness. \nThere is more information on the government-backed Moneyhelper website.\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nBBC sees Chinese ships blocking Philippine supply boats\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "How to get a job: Six expert tips for finding work", "date": "2023-08-14 16:03:58", "text": "If you're on the hunt for a job and not sure where to start, or how to pitch yourself you're not alone.\nThe rising cost of living has meant thousands of businesses have been laying off staff, with many people finding themselves out of work. \nUnemployment is close to its lowest rate since the 1970s. But there are about 8.65 million people out of work. \nIt may feel daunting to try and find a job at first so we spoke to some career experts to give you some tips.\nThere have been a lot of shifts in the workplace in recent years. Hybrid and flexible working means your job search can stretch a bit further, quite literally. \nYvonne Smyth, group head of diversity and inclusion at Hays Recruitment says \"Proximity isn't as important as used to be, so if you're looking for a job, search far and wide in terms of geography. \n\"Also if you want to work part-time or say four days a week, don't let full-time positions put you off applying,\" she says.\n\"Businesses are more flexible than you might think and if you're the right candidate that can get the job done in fewer days it makes sense for them to adapt the role.\"\nMs Smyth also says it's important to use key words when you're searching online.\n\"For example if there's a key skill or industry like sales or retail that you're interested in, you want the algorithms on search platforms to pick up on them. \n\"So daily searches on these words are important, so it identifies what you're interested in. \n\"Engagement as well is key and that means clicking on jobs with the job titles or a company that you're keen on so the platform yields more of the same.\"\nNot all jobs are made public. It's always worth sending an email or having a chat with a manager at a business that you like the look of, as you never know when an opening might be coming up. \nMany businesses want to avoid the cost of advertising a job formally and may rely on word of mouth. \nMiranda Kyte, a career trends expert at Glassdoor says: \"Another route is to utilise your network, let friends, ex-colleagues, family know that you're looking for a new position.\n\"They may be able to check internal job boards for open roles at their own companies and refer you or they could know someone else who can help.\"\nLots of places still ask for a CV and a covering letter when you're applying for a job. \nBut now you can advertise yourself rather visibly via social media sites like Linkedin which showcase your skills and experience. \nOther platforms like Twitter and Instagram can prove useful when touting yourself out to potential employers as well. \nYvonne Smyth from Hays says it's important to focus on skills.\n\"Lots of people look at the years required on a job description but actually it's more important that a candidate has the right skills.

{"title": "Energy price cap: What is it and will bills continue to go down?", "date": "2023-09-29 11:21:27", "text": "Millions will see their energy bills fall from 1 October, after a drop in the price cap, which limits how much suppliers can charge households for each unit of gas and electricity they use.\nA typical dual-fuel household will pay £1,923 a year between October and December - down from £2,074 in the previous period.\nIn recent years, the cost of variable tariff energy deals in England, Wales and Scotland has been controlled by the energy price cap, which is now set every three months by Ofgem, the energy regulator. \nThe cap confirms the maximum price suppliers can charge households per unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff in normal circumstances. It covers 29 million households. \nEnergy prices soared after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, so in October ministers said household bills would be limited by a temporary government guarantee instead. \nUnder this, a typical household's annual gas and electricity bill stayed below £2,500 despite Ofgem's cap increasing above this level. \nThe Energy Price Guarantee finished in June 2023, and the Ofgem cap once again determines how much customers can be charged. \nFrom 1 October, typical bills will be £1,923, which is £151 less than the previous cap and £577 down on last winter.\nEnergy is regulated separately in Northern Ireland, where bills are slightly lower.\nThe calculations for a typical household are based on a direct debit customer using 12,000 kWh (kilowatt hours) of gas and 2,900 kWh of electricity a year. \nA kilowatt hour is a unit of energy used to calculate your bill. \nHowever, most households aren't typical. \nBills are based on how much energy you actually use, which depends on the number of people, the type of property and its energy efficiency.\nIn July 2023, Ofgem said \"around 4 million\" households had prepayment meters.\nIt reviewed their use after an investigation by The Times found debt agents acting for British Gas wrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters.\nUnder new rules, suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter, and they cannot be installed at all in certain households. \nThe government has promised to bring prepayment energy charges in line with those for direct debit customers, but this has not yet happened. \nBetween October and December, the typical bill for prepayment households will be £1,949, down from £2,077, but still £26 more than for direct debit customers.\nTypical bills for those who pay via cash, cheque or bank transfer, usually every three months, will be £129 more. \nIt is is impossible to tell for certain, not least because wholesale energy prices are affected by global issues, such as the war in Ukraine.\nHowever, energy consultancy Cornwall Insight forecasts that prices will rise again in January 2024. \nIt estimates that typical annual bills will rise to £1,996. \nThe consultancy does not expect energy prices to return to pre-Covid levels before the end of the decade.\nLower prices should restart competition in the market, as suppliers start to offer fixed deals to customers, which set gas and electricity prices for a certain period of time. \nUnlike variable tariffs, these are unaffected by the cap.\nConsumer groups and regulators say this could be good for consumers, but warn that such deals do not suit all circumstances.\nIf variable deals continue to fall in price, anyone already locked into a fixed deal would miss out on those savings. \nThose considering signing up for a fixed deal should also pay close attention to standing charges and exit fees, rather than just the headline rate.\nSome groups across the UK who may struggle to pay bills are receiving additional help through cost-of-living payments:\nVulnerable families can also claim help through the Household Support Fund, and - from October 2023 - the Warm Home Discount scheme. \nImportantly, the £400 discount which all households in England, Wales and Scotland received last winter has finished. \nUntil the end of March 2023, businesses had their costs limited under the government's Energy Bill Relief Scheme. \nUnder a new scheme running until March 2024, firms get a discount on wholesale prices, rather than costs being capped. \nHeavy energy-using sectors, like glass, ceramics and steelmakers, will get a larger discount than others.\nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nTrump endorses Jim Jordan for House Speaker\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.

{"title": "Energy bills: What can I do if I can't afford to pay?", "date": "2023-09-27 13:22:44", "text": "Annual energy bills are falling in October, but prices remain much higher than in recent years.\nSome of those struggling to pay have been forced onto more expensive prepayment meters, prompting energy regulator Ofgem to strengthen rules to protect consumers. \nThe government launched its Energy Price Guarantee in October 2022. It replaced the previous Ofgem energy price cap, and limited a typical dual-fuel household's annual energy bill to £2,500. \nThis remained in place until the end of June 2023, when the Ofgem cap was reinstated, at which point a typical annual energy bill fell to £2,074.\nUnder the latest price cap, typical annual bills will fall to around £1,923 between October and December.\nIf you don't agree a payment plan with your supplier, they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed, or they may switch an existing smart meter to prepayment mode.\nIn very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection, but you'll normally be offered a meter first.\nIf you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either:\nSuppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this.\nMany suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments.\nPaying by direct debit is normally the cheapest way to pay for electricity and gas. Cancelling a direct debit means future bills are likely to be higher.\nNon-payment could also damage your credit rating, and make it harder to borrow money. \nThe regulator Ofgem reviewed the use of prepayment meters after an investigation by The Times found debt agents acting for British Gas wrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters. \nUnder new rules, suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter. They also have to conduct a \"site welfare visit\". \nIn addition meters cannot be fitted for:\nThose forced onto a prepayment meter will get £30 initial credit to reduce the risk of them losing supply.\nThe government has said prepayment energy charges will be cut, bringing them in line with direct debit rates.\nSuppliers have also been told to identify households where meters were wrongfully installed, return the customer to their previous tariff and offer compensation. \nCheck your direct debit\nYour monthly payment is based on your estimated energy use for the year, and your supplier may reduce your bill if its estimate is higher than the amount you actually use.\nYou can also request a flexible monthly direct debit where you only pay for your actual consumption. This requires a smart meter or regular readings.\nHowever, two-thirds of gas usage is during the winter months, so make sure you understand the impact of reducing payments during warmer weather. \nPay what you can\nIf the direct debit is fair, but you can't meet it, ask your supplier for an \"able to pay plan\" based on what you can afford. \nBy paying something every month - even if it's less than the amount due - your arrears grow more slowly, and your supplier may be less worried about your debt. \nYou may be able to get your name added to the Priority Services Register (PSR), a list of households entitled to extra support. \nThose eligible include pensioners, pregnant women, parents of young children, and people who are disabled. \nOfgem also recommends asking your supplier to add your name to the Network Operator Register, if you rely on your energy supply for medical reasons.\nIf you have different gas and electricity suppliers, you need to contact them both.\nBeing on the PSR doesn't cancel your arrears. But it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account. \nClaim any relevant benefits\nThe independent MoneyHelper website has a useful guide to available benefits, while Policy in Practice and the charities Entitledto and Turn2us run benefits calculators.\nYou may also be able to repay your debt directly from your benefits through the government's Fuel Direct scheme.\nA number of suppliers and charities also offer hardship grants. \nCheck you're getting extra government help\nThere is a range of government support to help with energy bills, available to households on means-tested benefits, pensioners and people on certain disability benefits.\nThe next payments for some eligible groups will be made between 31 October and 19 November.\nAdjust your boiler\nIf you have a combi boiler at home - you don't have a hot water cylinder and there is a (usually white) plastic pipe under the boiler - you may wish to consider turning down the heating flow temperature. \nOn the front - sometimes behind a flap - look for a dial or set of buttons with a radiator icon. Turn the dial to the number three, or the 12 o'clock position. If it has a digital display, select 60C. \nYou may also want to turn off the hot water pre-heat. Many boilers come on every few hours - night and day - to ensure there's always some hot water available. \nMost homes don't need this, and turning it off saves money. \nIran's Narges Mohammadi wins Nobel Peace Prize\nTrump endorses Jim Jordan for House Speaker\nBiden faces growing criticism over new border wall\nWeekly quiz: Which university is opening a world of magic?\nUS voters react to Biden's border wall expansion\nThe extreme robot arm that can chop up a ship\nHaim on their first decade: 'No-one wanted to sign us!'\nThe mysteries of a mass graveyard of early Indians\nHow Ghana's central bank lost $5bn in one year\nStars, bars and beans: Africa’s top shots\nThe people whose DNA held a secret\nUkrainecast: One of the deadliest attacks of the war in Ukraine.
