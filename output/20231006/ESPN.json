{"title": "Fields, Moore break out as Bears snap 14-game losing streak", "date": "2023-10-06 13:40:05", "text": "DJ Moore tallies eight receptions, 230 yards and three touchdowns in the Bears' victory over the Commanders. (1:10)\nLANDOVER, Md. -- Justin Fields and the Chicago Bears put on a first-half show against the Washington Commanders in a 40-20 win at FedEx Field on Thursday.\nFields threw for three touchdowns in the opening two quarters -- two to DJ Moore and one to Cole Kmet -- to help the Bears to a 27-3 lead at halftime.\nThe Commanders opened the second half with a touchdown on their first drive, but the deficit proved too big as the Bears held on to snap a franchise-worst 14-game losing streak that dated back to last season.\nThe win moved Chicago to 1-4 on the season. Washington dropped to 2-3 with the loss.\nThe Bears had enough of the negativity, of the outside noise, of the heartbreak they had endured for 11 straight months. On a short week with no time to waste on distractions, Chicago ended its 14-game losing streak and beat the Commanders on the road.\nLast week, Fields felt the Bears' offense was finally beginning to show its identity. After a lightning-fast start and third-quarter lull, Chicago showed it could finally put away an opponent and leave nothing in doubt in the final minutes of the game.\nOne week after giving up 21 points en route to a devastating loss, the Bears' 20-point win is tied for the fourth largest in NFL history by a team entering on a double-digit losing streak.\nBuy/sell a breakout performance: DJ Moore found the end zone on two of Chicago's five scoring drives in the first half. His Randy Moss-like catch over Commanders cornerback Kendall Fuller and first-half stat line (five catches, 137 yards, 2 TDs ) helped the Bears build a 24-point lead going into the half and even had LeBron James marveling at the receiver's explosiveness on X. Moore's fourth-quarter touchdown -- his third of the game -- put the game away for Chicago on a night when he notched the second-most receiving yards in a game (230) by a Bears receiver.\nEncouraging trend: The Bears sacked Commanders QB Sam Howell five times -- which is great considering the team had only two sacks in its four previous games -- but two of those were generated by linebacker T.J. Edwards and cornerback Greg Stroman Jr. (who also recorded the team's first interception of the season against a starting quarterback). Chicago remains committed to pressuring with its four down linemen, but the line didn't break through until Yannick Ngakoue brought down Howell on second-and-9 in the fourth quarter. DeMarcus Walker and Rasheem Green recorded two more sacks late.\nQB breakdown: Fields became the first Bears quarterback to throw for three or more touchdowns in back-to-back games since the 1970 merger. He built upon his three good quarters against the Denver Broncos and has completed 43 of 64 pass attempts for 617 yards, eight touchdowns and one interception in his past two games, complete with a 131.2 passer rating. Most importantly, Fields didn't let a slow start to the second half hinder him from putting the game away when he found Moore for a 56-yard touchdown with 4:18 to play.\nNext game: vs. Minnesota Vikings (1 p.m. ET, Oct. 15)\nThe Commanders' defense was supposed to provide a foundation while their offense matured. Instead, the defense sabotaged yet another game.\nThe Commanders allowed at least 30 points for a fourth consecutive game in losing to the Chicago Bears 40-20 on Thursday night. The Commanders (2-3) have lost three consecutive games, including their past two home games by a combined 77-23 score.\nIt's one thing to lose at home to Buffalo; it's another to lose at home to previously winless Chicago. Considering the Commanders have a young quarterback in Howell, the defense needed to provide a lot more. Instead, it gives up big plays and has not caused a turnover in the past two games.\nThe defense talked all offseason and summer about starting fast, knowing that the unit added only one new starter in linebacker Cody Barton, in addition to first-round corner Emmanuel Forbes. But the Commanders have been bad. Thursday, they allowed an offense that ranked 21st entering the game in both points and yards to score a season-high 40 points and gain 451 yards. Washington needs to make it work with this group. It had a chance to gain momentum with upcoming games at Atlanta and the New York Giants. Instead the team exits this game with many questions about its defense -- and its future.\nTroubling trend: Washington's defense continues to allow too many big plays. The Commanders entered having allowed 13 plays of 25 yards or more, tied for worst in the NFL. Then they allowed three more in the first half alone Thursday night en route to a 27-3 deficit. A huge culprit has been a secondary that has looked inconsistent. Rookie Emmanuel Forbes, who was benched in the second half, has struggled mightily allowing big plays. There were, once more, big gaps in coverage that Fields exploited.\nTroubling trend, part 2: Poor pass protection. This has been another season-long problem as Howell was sacked five more times, giving him 29 for the season. The Bears, who entered with two sacks in four games, applied consistent pressure with four-man rushes and blitzes. Some of the problems stem from Howell needing to progress through his reads quicker. But the line has been too inconsistent in this area and needs to provide more help for a quarterback who now has six starts to his résumé.\nQB breakdown: Howell's growth remains pivotal to the franchise's future. Howell showed, once more, that he's a resilient and tough quarterback. After a rough first half -- 9-for-13, 71 yards and an interception -- he threw for 298 yards in the second half. He moved well in the pocket, was patient with underneath throws, and though the Commanders lost, he continued to show he can be developed. Speeding up his progressions and learning to protect himself from hits should be points of emphasis going forward.\nNext game: at Atlanta Falcons (1 p.m. ET, Oct. 15)"}
{"title": "Magic calls out Commanders after loss: No 'fire'", "date": "2023-10-06 13:29:20", "text": "DJ Moore tallies eight receptions, 230 yards and three touchdowns in the Bears' victory over the Commanders. (1:10)\nLANDOVER, Md. -- Washington Commanders limited partner Magic Johnson delivered harsh criticism of his new team following a 20-point loss to the Chicago Bears on Thursday night.\nAfter the Commanders lost 40-20 to the previously winless Bears, Johnson tweeted in part that \"the Commanders played with no intensity or fire. We didn't compete in the first half. ... It was too big of a hole to climb out of and that is why we ended up losing.\"\nTonight the Commanders played with no intensity or fire. We didn't compete in the first half and got down 27-3 heading into halftime. It was too big of a hole to climb out of and that is why we ended up losing 40-20.\nJohnson, who attended the game, is one of 20 limited partners with new owner Josh Harris. Johnson has been highly visible as part of the franchise, between charitable events and attending games.\nBut this was his first critical tweet of his new team. And the players did not disagree with his assessment. After all, Washington fell behind 27-3 at halftime.\n\"I'd probably say that's pretty fair,\" Washington receiver Terry McLaurin said.\n\"Definitely,\" defensive end Montez Sweat said. \"We came out flat.\"\nThe Bears scored on each of their five possessions in the first half, often because of missed tackles or blown coverages in the secondary. A defense that entered with two sacks recorded four. And an offense that averaged 298 yards in the first four games managed 451.\n\"We got our ass kicked,\" Washington defensive tackle Jonathan Allen said.\nWashington coach Ron Rivera said he couldn't repeat his postgame message to the players but that in short he told them, \"That's not good enough.\"\nThat's why no one in the locker room was about to reject what Johnson tweeted. However, some said there were other factors.\n\"I mean, that's perception when you're down that quick, it looks like that,\" Washington left tackle Charles Leno Jr. said. \"I'm not going to say the guys did not have any intensity or urgency coming into the game. I would definitely say it was a lack of execution early offensively; when they put up seven on the defense, we need to respond.\"\nMcLaurin said the Commanders' intentions, of course, were not to start that way. However, he said, intentions don't matter.\n\"It's what you put on the field,\" McLaurin said. \"I know we don't have a lazy bunch; I know we don't have a non-intense group of guys. That showing is not reflective of us, but that's who we are. We put that on tape. I'd say that's a pretty fair assessment [by Johnson].\"\nBoth teams were coming off difficult losses: Chicago had blown a 21-point lead at home to Denver; Washington had lost in overtime in Philadelphia. But one team was 2-2 and playing at home; the other was winless and traveling on a short week.\n\"I don't know if we thought they was about to give us the game,\" Sweat said. \"But them guys was hungry. They came out with more fire than us.\"\nJohnson has been complimentary toward the Commanders after other games. He lauded their effort against Philadelphia, saying he was proud and that he hoped that effort would be \"part of our DNA\" all season. He tweeted after a comeback win in Denver about his excitement watching the rally live.\nHowever, Thursday he opted for a different message -- one that was echoed in the locker room.\n\"When you don't get off to a fast start,\" McLaurin said, \"and a team that's hungry like that, fighting for every play, every yard and they're capitalizing, that's what can happen. The record didn't really matter. You don't come to play, that's what's going to happen to you.\""}

(2:22)\nDick Butkus, arguably the fiercest Monster of the Midway, has died at age 80, the Chicago Bears announced Thursday.\nButkus became a Bears legend and Pro Football Hall of Famer in his nine-year career, which started in 1965. The middle linebacker was a vicious tackler whose intimidating presence put some players on their heels before the ball was even snapped.\nIn a statement released through the Bears, Butkus' family said he \"died peacefully in his sleep overnight\" at his home in Malibu, California.\n\"Dick was the ultimate Bear, and one of the greatest players in NFL history,\" team chairman George McCaskey said in a statement. \"He was Chicago's son. He exuded what our great city is about and, not coincidentally, what George Halas looks for in a player: toughness, smarts, instincts, passion and leadership.\n\"He refused to accept anything less than the best from himself, or from his teammates. ... His contributions to the game he loved will live forever and we are grateful he was able to be at our home opener this year to be celebrated one last time by his many fans.\"\nDick Butkus was a legend who embodied what it means to be a Chicago Bear. Our hearts go out to his family and friends. pic.twitter.com/8UEVuuZLwi\nThe Bears took on the Commanders on Thursday night in Landover, Maryland, and a moment of silence for Butkus was held before kickoff.\nHall of Fame defensive end Deacon Jones once called Butkus a \"maniac\" and \"well-conditioned animal.\" Butkus appeared to want to send a message with every tackle.\n\"I want to just let 'em know that they've been hit, and when they get up, they don't have to look to see who it was that hit 'em,\" Butkus once told NFL Films. \"It shouldn't be any puzzle. When they come to, they got to say, 'It must've been Butkus that got me.'\"\nIn a game against the rival Green Bay Packers during the 1970 season, Butkus and teammate Willie Holman hit quarterback Bart Starr so hard Starr lost his helmet and began walking toward the wrong bench.\nSaid the Chicago Tribune: \"[Starr] looked like Oscar Bonavena after Cassius Clay [Muhammad Ali] had finished with him.\"\nHe made the Pro Bowl in eight of his nine seasons, but a chronic knee injury abruptly ended his career in 1974 at age 31.\n\"Dick Butkus was a fierce and passionate competitor who helped define the linebacker position as one of the NFL's all-time greats,\" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement Thursday. \"Dick's intuition, toughness and athleticism made him the model linebacker whose name will forever be linked to the position and the Chicago Bears.\n\"... We send our deepest condolences to the Butkus family, the Bears organization and the many fans and people he impacted throughout his life.\"\nButkus finished his career with 1,020 tackles and 22 interceptions. He was named first team All-Pro five times, won the George Halas Award in 1974 and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1979.\nHe also was named to the NFL's all-decade teams in the 1960s and 1970s and is a member of the league's 75th and 100th anniversary all-time teams.\nButkus spent his entire football career in Illinois. Born on Dec. 9, 1942, as the youngest of eight children, he grew up on the city's South Side as a fan of the Chicago Cardinals, the Bears' crosstown rivals. He played high school football for Chicago Vocational High School, earning a high school player of the year award as a junior.\nHe went on to compete in college at Illinois, where he played both center and linebacker. He helped the Fighting Illini to an 8-1-1 record and Rose Bowl victory in 1963. In his senior season, he made the All-America team and finished third in Heisman Trophy voting.\nThat led to Butkus being selected by the Bears with the third overall pick in the 1965 NFL draft. He had to fill the big shoes of Hall of Fame linebacker Bill George, but Butkus quickly showed he was up to the task. He set career highs with five interceptions and seven fumble recoveries during his rookie season.\nButkus would hit runners high, wrap them up and drive them to the ground like a rag doll. Sports Illustrated once called him \"The Most Feared Man in the Game.\"\nWhen the Detroit Lions unveiled an I-formation against the Bears at old Tigers Stadium, Butkus knocked every member of the \"I\" -- the center, quarterback, fullback and halfback -- out of the game.\nSaid teammate Ed O'Bradovich: \"Just to hit people wasn't good enough. He loved to crush people.\"\nA legend of the game & part of what makes the NFL's oldest rivalry so special. Sending our condolences to the family & friends of Dick Butkus & the entire @ChicagoBears organization 🙏 pic.twitter.com/dU7h8TtsWi\n\"I wouldn't ever go out to hurt anybody deliberately,\" Butkus once replied tongue-in-cheek when asked about his on-field reputation. \"Unless it was, you know, important... like a league game or something.\"\nButkus played for only two winning teams with the Bears, however, and never made the playoffs. He came on during the end of the George Halas era, just missing the 1963 championship season. In his final season, the Bears went 3-11.\nAfter he retired, Butkus sued the Bears for $1.6 million, contending he was provided inadequate medical care and owed the four years of salary remaining on his contract. The lawsuit was settled for $600,000, but Butkus and Halas didn't speak for five years.\nThat divide healed, however, and he became a staunch public supporter of the franchise. A year ago, he even took over the team's social media account for an evening, thrilling fans.\nThrough the Butkus Foundation, he helped establish a program at a Southern California hospital to encourage early screenings to detect heart disease. He promoted a campaign to encourage high school athletes to train and eat well and avoid performance-enhancing drugs.\nThe foundation oversees the Butkus Award, established in 1985 to honor college football's best linebacker. It was expanded in 2008 to include pros and high school players.\n\"Dick had a gruff manner, and maybe that kept some people from approaching him, but he actually had a soft touch,\" McCaskey, who is Halas' grandson, said in his statement. \"His legacy and philanthropy included a mission of ridding performance enhancing drugs from sports and promoting heart health.\"\nMany people knew Butkus more for his appearances in films -- such as \"Brian's Song\" in 1971 and \"The Longest Yard\" in 1974 -- and on television (\"My Two Dads\" and \"Hang Time\") after his playing days. He became a well-known pitchman in commercials. His Miller Lite commercials with Bubba Smith, in which they played off their menacing reputations, were especially well-known.\nButkus also was a sports broadcaster, even serving as a color analyst on Bears games.\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame lowered its flags to half-staff in Butkus' honor.\n\"Playing in an era when middle linebacker became one of the game's glamour positions -- and several of Dick's contemporaries also would end up in the Pro Football Hall of Fame -- his name most often was cited first as the epitome of what it took to excel at the highest level,\" Hall of Fame president Jim Porter said in a statement.\nButkus is survived by his wife, Helen, and children Ricky, Matt and Nikki. Nephew Luke Butkus has coached in college and the NFL, including time with the Bears.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}

(0:32)\nBATON ROUGE, La. -- LSU Tigers star Angel Reese is well aware much was made about the closing moments of the women's basketball national championship game in April. LSU had sealed the program's first NCAA title, and Reese gave wrestling star John Cena's \"You can't see me\" hand motion toward Iowa Hawkeyes star Caitlin Clark, then motioned to her ring finger.\nClark said after LSU's 102-85 victory in Dallas that she didn't really notice, but that she didn't think that Reese had done anything wrong. Clark said enthusiasm, emotion and even some trash-talking are a normal part of competitive sports, the same things she has done herself.\nThursday at LSU's media day, Reese shared similar sentiments. All eyes are on the Tigers -- they added top transfers Hailey Van Lith and Aneesah Morrow and are No. 1 in ESPN's preseason rankings -- and on Reese, the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player. She said she is ready to move forward, but did address the hoopla from April.\n\"I love Caitlin; we've been competing since we were in AAU,\" Reese said. \"It was always fun, always competitive. One day, hopefully, we could even be teammates. She is a great player, shooter, person and teammate.\n\"The world is always going to have a good girl and a bad girl. I'll take that I'm going to be the bad guy because I know I've grown women's basketball and inspired people.\"\nReese laughed when it was pointed out that \"good vs. bad\" just depended on which team fans were rooting for.\n\"Yeah, LSU loves me, but they might not like her. People can think what they think,\" Reese said. \"Me and Caitlin are cool; we've never had any issues. Just knowing I've helped grow women's basketball, and she has, too, that's all that matters.\"\nReese also spoke of the news that the WNBA announced an expansion team Thursday, and how much she wants to play in the pro league and for the U.S. senior national team someday. Like Clark, Reese is a senior but could return for a fifth college season in 2024-25 because of the COVID-19 waiver.\nReese said she isn't thinking much now about whether she will enter the 2024 or 2025 WNBA draft. She said she will talk with her family, advisers and LSU coach Kim Mulkey about that when this college season ends -- which Reese hopes will be with another NCAA title.\nThe 6-foot-3 forward averaged 23.0 points and 15.4 rebounds last season, had 34 double-doubles and has worked on her shooting range in the offseason. Morrow, a 6-1 junior forward who transferred from the DePaul Blue Demons, averaged 25.7 points and 12.2 rebounds last season. Both are eager to team up in dominating the paint this season for LSU.\n\"Angel is a competitor; I wanted to be around her every day,\" Morrow said of her decision to come to LSU. \"We are doing nothing but making each other better.\"\nAs good as the 34-2 Tigers were last season, Reese hopes they can improve. She's not just about winning games, but also winning over new fans.\n\"Women are changing the game,\" she said. \"I mean, 9.9 million people watched the [national championship] game. The feedback we've gotten, men and women reach out to us, celebrities, NBA players. Seeing we have so many people in our corner, I think that helps.\""}

Cano has been a little more hittable in the second half, especially in the final month. The Orioles are deep in left-handed relievers with Cionel Perez, Danny Coulombe and rookie DL Hall, but they're scrambling a bit from the right side aside from Cano. Tyler Wells, a starter until he was sent down to the minors in late July, is back as a reliever and could get some high-leverage moments. -- SchoenfieldTwo years removed from a 110-loss season, Baltimore punched its ticket to October -- and has much bigger things in its future.\nDavid Schoenfield »Kurkjian: From raw to really, really good »\nPassan: The Homer Hose and more »\nReady for his October close-up: Last year, when the Orioles rose from 110 losses to the edge of contention within the sport's most difficult division, it was all about Adley Rutschman. This year, as the Orioles have surged through a 100-win season, it's all about Gunnar Henderson, a lock for the AL Rookie of the Year award and a legitimate star at the age of 22. Henderson can hit, slug, run and field, but, like Rutschman, he also just seems to have this aura around him, like it's already so obvious that we're watching a generational talent. That swing is pure poetry, too. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: This is a franchise that lost 110 games just two seasons ago, making this year's rise to the top of the American League one of the most dramatic turnarounds in major league history. The Orioles have emerging young stars such as Rutschman and Henderson, plus vets such as Cedric Mullins and Anthony Santander who suffered through some terrible seasons in Baltimore. They're not flashy, but they play good defense, they run the bases well and the lineup is deeper than you might realize. Plus, root for them now when they're the shiny new thing: You might get tired of them down the road after they make the playoffs every year for the next decade. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One thing we know about the AL teams in the bracket is that if they play the Braves in the last series of the season, that will mean any questions about them that we have entering the playoffs will have been answered. In the Orioles' case, that will mean the back of the bullpen has come together but even more importantly, it would suggest that the stage hasn't been too big for the O's. And that would mean their young stars like Henderson and Rutschman are doing their thing. If that happens, all the Orioles have to do is be themselves, because they can match the Braves in terms of raw talent. -- DoolittleHouston AstrosNo. 2 seed | 90-72 | AL West champsALDS opponent: Twins (53.3% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 12.5% | Caesars odds: +500Predicted date of their last game: Nov. 3The one thing that will decide their October fate: Pitching carried the Astros to the World Series title last season -- especially the bullpen -- as they hit just .232/.302/.389 in the postseason. The pitching doesn't appear as strong this season, so the offense will have to do better. We all know what Yordan Alvarez can do but the keys are Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman. Altuve didn't have a single RBI last postseason and Bregman struggled in the 2021 playoffs, when he was battling an injury.

Nevertheless, the standout trait of the Twins has been the ability of their pitchers to dominate the strike zone. Minnesota's hurlers led the majors in strikeout percentage and ranked fourth in walk percentage. The strike zone is a dangerous place to be against the Braves: Their OPS on pitches in the zone was nearly 100 points better than that of any other team.

Both do have strikeout stuff and the ability to dominate -- when they're not walking everybody. And who sets them up? Andrew Heaney has been pitching out of the bullpen and will get key innings. Jonathan Hernandez had to relieve Chapman in a key spot in Seattle and gave up a game-losing bases-loaded double. The lack of depth also means it's imperative for the starters to give Bruce Bochy some length.

The Cardinals had basically given up on him, and so in December of 2019, the Rangers picked him up for mere cash considerations. He didn't establish himself in the major leagues until 2021, his age-28 season, but he has improved every year since with his OPS jumping from .741 to .756 to, this year, .836. As the Rangers have lifted themselves into championship contention, Garcia has emerged as one of the sport's most menacing power hitters. He also has become a lot more discerning within the strike zone. The Rangers, with that very shaky bullpen situation, are going to have to hit their way through October, and Garcia will be a big part of that. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: The Braves' offense has understandably received much of the national attention, but the Rangers aren't far behind in runs scored -- although they've benefited from a huge home-park advantage with 53 more home runs at Globe Life Field than on the road. Like the Braves, they have ridiculous depth from No. 1 to No. 9 in the lineup, with Corey Seager leading the way by putting up one of the greatest offensive seasons ever for a shortstop (other than missing 40 games). They lead the AL in average, home runs, walks, OBP and slugging. Oh, and keep an eye on 21-year-old outfielder Evan Carter, who has torn the cover off the ball since his September call-up. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Rangers bashed their way to a breakout season for much of the summer. They won 11 games by 10 or more runs, far and away more than any other team. That includes the homer-happy Braves. If the Rangers survive the AL bracket, it's almost certainly going to be because they've touched the offensive ceiling they displayed earlier in the campaign. The pitching staff, especially the bullpen, has to be better than it was for much of the post-trade-deadline part of the season. But if the Rangers win the World Series, it's going to be because Marcus Semien, Seager, Garcia and the rest are turning the scoreboard. In particular, that is their formula for beating Atlanta. -- DoolittleNational LeagueAtlanta BravesNo. 1 seed | 104-58 | NL East champsNLDS opponent: Phillies (61.5% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 21.7% | Caesars odds: +275Predicted date of their last game: Nov. 3The one thing that will decide their October fate: Suddenly there are big concerns about Atlanta's starting rotation. Max Fried missed his last couple of starts of the regular season with a blister problem. Charlie Morton has already been ruled out of the division series with a finger issue. Bryce Elder was an All-Star in the first half but saw his ERA balloon to over 5.00 in the second half. Even Spencer Strider has had some mediocre outings down the stretch and seen his MLB-leading strikeout rate drop in the final two months.

He had made it back when they returned to the postseason in 2022, but he clearly wasn't himself yet. This year, he has reached a new level. He's the NL MVP front-runner, the first member of the 40-70 club and a far more disciplined hitter than he ever has been. At 25, he is the best baseball player on the planet (non-Shohei Ohtani division). And his prowess from the leadoff spot is the biggest reason this Braves lineup has become historic. When the games matter most, Acuna can impact them with his majestic power and blazing speed and rocket arm, and he's sure to do plenty of that in October. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: The Murderer's Row Yankees of Ruth and Gehrig. The Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s. The Big Red Machine. The \"Idiot\" Red Sox of 2004. With a World Series title, the Braves have a chance to cement their place in history as one of the most fearsome lineups of all time. They dominated the regular season -- tying the single-season home run record -- with a lineup that became the first to feature four players with 35-plus home runs. They've been the team to watch all season and now that greatness will be tested in October. -- SchoenfieldWhy they are the team to beat: The offense is just too good to keep down. And while we've seen offensive powerhouses falter before in the crucible of October, the Braves' attack looks airtight. Their numbers hold up no matter how you split them up. They mash at home and on the road, against lefties and righties, against all kinds of pitch profiles. They have power at every spot in the lineup. Earlier in the season, it looked like the Braves might have become too reliant on homers for scoring, a trait that doesn't always hold up well in the playoffs. But Atlanta's offense has gradually become more varied as the season has progressed and right now appears to be without weakness. Sure, the Braves have question marks around their pitching staff, but if their offense is putting up five or more runs a game, that might not matter. -- DoolittleLos Angeles DodgersNo. 2 seed | 100-62 | NL West champsNLDS opponent: D-backs (67.4% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 19.9% | Caesars odds: +500Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 23The one thing that will decide their October fate: Sure, they'll need this patched-together starting rotation to step up, but let's face it: Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman have carried this team all season with their all-around brilliance and L.A. will be relying on those two stars to keep it going. Yes, those two have supporting offensive characters in Max Muncy and J.D. Martinez, who both topped 30 home runs, and Will Smith, but this has been the Mookie and Freddie show. It's hard to envision a path to the World Series that doesn't revolve around those two both having big October runs. -- SchoenfieldReady for his October closeup: Clayton Kershaw and Lance Lynn will be limited in their starts and the likes of Emmet Sheehan, Ryan Pepiot and Ryan Yarbrough will be used mostly to soak up the middle innings. But Bobby Miller -- the 24-year-old power right-hander, the best of an emerging young core of starting pitchers -- will essentially be counted on to be the Dodgers' ace. He has the electric stuff, and the Dodgers believe he also possesses the poise, a la Walker Buehler. Miller dominated at the outset, allowing only two runs in 23 innings through the first four starts of his major league career. He hasn't been as effective since, but he had a solid month of September. He'll need to take it to another level in October. -- GonzalezL.A.'s dominant transition yearCheck out our best Dodgers coverage from this season as they get ready for the 2023 playoffs. Inside Dodgers' pitching plan for playoffs » 5 reasons they keep winning »\nHow Mookie Betts became an infielder »\nWhy you should root for them: I get it: The Dodgers are here every year, they're a blue-blood franchise with a high payroll and you're about as tired of them as you are of the Astros. But you also have to respect what this organization has accomplished, tying an MLB record with a third straight 100-win season (a stretch that almost certainly would have been five in a row if the entire 2020 season had been played). And yet, their only World Series title during this dynastic run carries an asterisk because it came that shortened campaign with playoff games at neutral sites and the whole weirdness of that season. So, yes, there is part of me that would like the Dodgers to win a World Series in a real season, with fans in the stands, with Mookie hitting home runs, Freddie hitting doubles and maybe even Kershaw dialing up Father Time and having his best October ever. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: While the Braves might be scrambling to fill out an injury-riddled rotation, the Dodgers have been doing that all along. So there doesn't appear to be an advantage for Atlanta in starting pitching and the Dodgers' bullpen is deeper and better. If that translates to lower-scoring games than the Braves prefer, the chances of one or two performances tipping the series rise. And for all of Ronald Acuna Jr.'s spectacular play and Matt Olson's home runs, would anyone be surprised if Freeman and Betts were enough all on their own to propel the Dodgers past the Braves? Their combined brilliance this season has been breathtaking and the postseason context for both of them is by now old hat. -- DoolittlePhiladelphia PhilliesNo. 4 seed | 90-72 | NL first wild cardNLDS opponent: Braves (38.6% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 8.5% | Caesars odds: +1400Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 12The one thing that will decide their October fate: Home runs. This is true of every team, of course, that you need to hit home runs to win in the postseason, but the Phillies spent the first four months of the season not hitting enough homers. Through the end of July they were 21st in the majors in home runs, topping out at 33 in a month. Then they hit 59 in August and 46 in September to tie the Braves for the most home runs over the final two months. That team -- like the one we saw last October with Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber leading the way -- is a team that can return to the World Series. -- SchoenfieldReady for his October closeup: Phillies fans rallied behind Alec Bohm last year and watched him go from being a mess defensively to a very capable third baseman who became an integral part of a World Series team. The same is taking place with Trea Turner, who signed a $300 million contract over the offseason and struggled mightily through his first four months. He then got a supportive standing ovation from the home crowd, and went off in August and September. It's probably no coincidence. When Turner is right, he is one of the most dynamic players in the sport. We saw it early this year during the World Baseball Classic. Soon, he'll get his chance to become a true Philly legend. -- GonzalezEarly MLB free agency rankingsNow that the trade deadline has passed, Kiley McDaniel takes a look at who could get paid big this offseason. Ohtani and rest of top 10 »\nWhy you should root for them: Come on, this is a fun team. Harper is the straw that stirs the drink and he's must-watch TV in October. Schwarber had one of the wildest, weirdest seasons of all time, with a sub-.200 average but still scoring and driving in 100 runs thanks to his power and walks. Turner got red hot the final two months. Rookie Johan Rojas is electrifying and may be the best defensive center fielder in the game. The bullpen is often a high-wire act, so every Phillies game -- whether they're leading or trailing -- feels undecided until that final out. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Phillies have star power in the lineup and the collective long ball ability to go toe-to-toe with the Braves. Their outfield defense has improved with personnel changes through the season. The rotation is in much better shape than Atlanta's injury-marred group. But the most underrated aspect of the Phillies, and where they may have a decisive edge over the Braves, is the bullpen. The Phillies feature high-octane stuff, depth and balance in this area and most of the chief components (Craig Kimbrel, Gregory Soto, Jose Alvarado, Jeff Hoffman, Matt Strahm, Seranthony Domínguez) have been on point as the playoffs approach. In Rob Thomson, they have a skipper who proved last year that he knows how to deploy a bullpen in October. If the Phillies can turn a series against the Braves into a successive battle of the bullpens, look out. -- DoolittleArizona DiamondbacksNo. 6 seed | 84-78 | NL third wild cardNLDS opponent: Dodgers (32.6% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 3.8% | Caesars odds: +3300Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 12The one thing that will decide their October fate: The starting pitchers not named Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly -- but what happens after that? The only other starter with an ERA under 5.00 was Tommy Henry and he's injured. Zach Davies was actually in the rotation until he was designated for assignment just a few days before the season ended. That leaves rookies Ryne Nelson and Brandon Pfaadt, who have both been hit hard and struggled with the long ball. Pfaadt has more swing-and-miss stuff, so he's probably the No. 3 starter, but Arizona will have to find a way to win some non-Gallen/Kelly games. -- SchoenfieldHow the D-backs learned to contendWith the help of some emerging veteran leadership, Arizona doubled down on its youth carrying the load.\nJesse Rogers »Passan: Inside Carroll's rise to stardom »\nReady for his October closeup: You'd be hard-pressed to find a more electric player than Corbin Carroll, a dynamic defender and an elite hitter who also plays with his hair on fire. Carroll became the first player ever to combine 50-plus steals with 25-plus home runs and 10-plus triples in the same season. He did that as a rookie. David Cone recently said Carroll reminds him of Derek Jeter in his rookie season, largely because of their leadership qualities at a young age. One big difference: Jeter played for one of the world's most decorated franchises. Carroll, not so much. But that's what makes the playoffs so cool -- the world is about to find out just how good and fun Carroll really is. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: We mentioned the Orioles turning it around from 110 losses two seasons ago. Well, the Diamondbacks matched them that year with 110 defeats, so getting to the playoffs just two years later is a great achievement for a young, building team. In this day of rocket-armed pitchers, Gallen and Kelly are two starters who rely on movement, location and pitch selection more than pure velocity. The art of pitching is alive and well with those two. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Run, run, run. Despite the uptick in stolen bases this season, this still isn't baseball, circa 1985. To run on offense, the hitters have to get on base and get the ball in play. If that happens, the Diamondback rolled up 161 stolen bases and did so with a MLB-best 87% success rate. They can drive Sean Murphy and his pitchers crazy. But that's not the only kind of running we're talking about. Arizona's athleticism also paid off on defense as Torey Lovullo's fielders as a unit was arguably the best in the majors. Like Toronto, if Arizona's pitchers can keep the Braves' power bats in the ballpark (easier said than done), Carroll & Co. can impact games by running down balls in the gap -- Doolittle\n\n\n\nBaltimore Orioles\nNo. 1 seed | 101-61 | AL East champs\nALDS opponent: Rangers (50.2% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 12.1% | Caesars odds: +650\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 23\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Now that All-Star closer Felix Bautista is officially done for the season and will undergo Tommy John surgery, the pressure ramps up on a Baltimore bullpen that was so dominant with the late-game duo of Yennier Cano and Bautista. Cano has been a little more hittable in the second half, especially in the final month. The Orioles are deep in left-handed relievers with Cionel Perez, Danny Coulombe and rookie DL Hall, but they're scrambling a bit from the right side aside from Cano. Tyler Wells, a starter until he was sent down to the minors in late July, is back as a reliever and could get some high-leverage moments. -- Schoenfield\nTwo years removed from a 110-loss season, Baltimore punched its ticket to October -- and has much bigger things in its future.\nDavid Schoenfield »\nKurkjian: From raw to really, really good »\nPassan: The Homer Hose and more »\nReady for his October close-up: Last year, when the Orioles rose from 110 losses to the edge of contention within the sport's most difficult division, it was all about Adley Rutschman. This year, as the Orioles have surged through a 100-win season, it's all about Gunnar Henderson, a lock for the AL Rookie of the Year award and a legitimate star at the age of 22. Henderson can hit, slug, run and field, but, like Rutschman, he also just seems to have this aura around him, like it's already so obvious that we're watching a generational talent. That swing is pure poetry, too. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: This is a franchise that lost 110 games just two seasons ago, making this year's rise to the top of the American League one of the most dramatic turnarounds in major league history. The Orioles have emerging young stars such as Rutschman and Henderson, plus vets such as Cedric Mullins and Anthony Santander who suffered through some terrible seasons in Baltimore. They're not flashy, but they play good defense, they run the bases well and the lineup is deeper than you might realize. Plus, root for them now when they're the shiny new thing: You might get tired of them down the road after they make the playoffs every year for the next decade. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One thing we know about the AL teams in the bracket is that if they play the Braves in the last series of the season, that will mean any questions about them that we have entering the playoffs will have been answered. In the Orioles' case, that will mean the back of the bullpen has come together but even more importantly, it would suggest that the stage hasn't been too big for the O's. And that would mean their young stars like Henderson and Rutschman are doing their thing. If that happens, all the Orioles have to do is be themselves, because they can match the Braves in terms of raw talent. -- Doolittle\n\nHouston Astros\nNo. 2 seed | 90-72 | AL West champs\nALDS opponent: Twins (53.3% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 12.5% | Caesars odds: +500\nPredicted date of their last game: Nov. 3\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Pitching carried the Astros to the World Series title last season -- especially the bullpen -- as they hit just .232/.302/.389 in the postseason. The pitching doesn't appear as strong this season, so the offense will have to do better. We all know what Yordan Alvarez can do but the keys are Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman. Altuve didn't have a single RBI last postseason and Bregman struggled in the 2021 playoffs, when he was battling an injury. Houston needs both of them to perform this October. -- Schoenfield \nReady for his October closeup: Michael Brantley remained a major voice in the Astros' clubhouse during their run to a championship last fall, but his bat was a major void from their lineup.

Like the Braves, they have ridiculous depth from No. 1 to No. 9 in the lineup, with Corey Seager leading the way by putting up one of the greatest offensive seasons ever for a shortstop (other than missing 40 games). They lead the AL in average, home runs, walks, OBP and slugging. Oh, and keep an eye on 21-year-old outfielder Evan Carter, who has torn the cover off the ball since his September call-up. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Rangers bashed their way to a breakout season for much of the summer. They won 11 games by 10 or more runs, far and away more than any other team. That includes the homer-happy Braves. If the Rangers survive the AL bracket, it's almost certainly going to be because they've touched the offensive ceiling they displayed earlier in the campaign. The pitching staff, especially the bullpen, has to be better than it was for much of the post-trade-deadline part of the season. But if the Rangers win the World Series, it's going to be because Marcus Semien, Seager, Garcia and the rest are turning the scoreboard. In particular, that is their formula for beating Atlanta. -- Doolittle\n\nAtlanta Braves\nNo. 1 seed | 104-58 | NL East champs\nNLDS opponent: Phillies (61.5% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 21.7% | Caesars odds: +275\nPredicted date of their last game: Nov. 3\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Suddenly there are big concerns about Atlanta's starting rotation. Max Fried missed his last couple of starts of the regular season with a blister problem. Charlie Morton has already been ruled out of the division series with a finger issue. Bryce Elder was an All-Star in the first half but saw his ERA balloon to over 5.00 in the second half. Even Spencer Strider has had some mediocre outings down the stretch and seen his MLB-leading strikeout rate drop in the final two months. On top of that, the bullpen has some injury issues and had its worst month in September, which puts even more pressure on the rotation. -- Schoenfield\nCheck out our best Braves coverage from this season as they gear up to make a playoff run.\nMLB execs on how to beat Atlanta »\n Greatest lineup ever? »\nInside Acuna's return to MVP form »\nReady for his October closeup: Ronald Acuna Jr. was nursing a torn ACL when the Braves won it all in 2021. He had made it back when they returned to the postseason in 2022, but he clearly wasn't himself yet. This year, he has reached a new level. He's the NL MVP front-runner, the first member of the 40-70 club and a far more disciplined hitter than he ever has been. At 25, he is the best baseball player on the planet (non-Shohei Ohtani division). And his prowess from the leadoff spot is the biggest reason this Braves lineup has become historic. When the games matter most, Acuna can impact them with his majestic power and blazing speed and rocket arm, and he's sure to do plenty of that in October. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: The Murderer's Row Yankees of Ruth and Gehrig. The Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s. The Big Red Machine. The \"Idiot\" Red Sox of 2004. With a World Series title, the Braves have a chance to cement their place in history as one of the most fearsome lineups of all time. They dominated the regular season -- tying the single-season home run record -- with a lineup that became the first to feature four players with 35-plus home runs. They've been the team to watch all season and now that greatness will be tested in October. -- Schoenfield\nWhy they are the team to beat: The offense is just too good to keep down. And while we've seen offensive powerhouses falter before in the crucible of October, the Braves' attack looks airtight. Their numbers hold up no matter how you split them up. They mash at home and on the road, against lefties and righties, against all kinds of pitch profiles. They have power at every spot in the lineup. Earlier in the season, it looked like the Braves might have become too reliant on homers for scoring, a trait that doesn't always hold up well in the playoffs. But Atlanta's offense has gradually become more varied as the season has progressed and right now appears to be without weakness. Sure, the Braves have question marks around their pitching staff, but if their offense is putting up five or more runs a game, that might not matter. -- Doolittle\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers\nNo. 2 seed | 100-62 | NL West champs\nNLDS opponent: D-backs (67.4% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 19.9% | Caesars odds: +500\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 23\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Sure, they'll need this patched-together starting rotation to step up, but let's face it: Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman have carried this team all season with their all-around brilliance and L.A. will be relying on those two stars to keep it going. Yes, those two have supporting offensive characters in Max Muncy and J.D. Martinez, who both topped 30 home runs, and Will Smith, but this has been the Mookie and Freddie show. It's hard to envision a path to the World Series that doesn't revolve around those two both having big October runs. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Clayton Kershaw and Lance Lynn will be limited in their starts and the likes of Emmet Sheehan, Ryan Pepiot and Ryan Yarbrough will be used mostly to soak up the middle innings. But Bobby Miller -- the 24-year-old power right-hander, the best of an emerging young core of starting pitchers -- will essentially be counted on to be the Dodgers' ace. He has the electric stuff, and the Dodgers believe he also possesses the poise, a la Walker Buehler. Miller dominated at the outset, allowing only two runs in 23 innings through the first four starts of his major league career. He hasn't been as effective since, but he had a solid month of September. He'll need to take it to another level in October. -- Gonzalez\nCheck out our best Dodgers coverage from this season as they get ready for the 2023 playoffs.\n Inside Dodgers' pitching plan for playoffs »\n 5 reasons they keep winning »\nHow Mookie Betts became an infielder »\nWhy you should root for them: I get it: The Dodgers are here every year, they're a blue-blood franchise with a high payroll and you're about as tired of them as you are of the Astros. But you also have to respect what this organization has accomplished, tying an MLB record with a third straight 100-win season (a stretch that almost certainly would have been five in a row if the entire 2020 season had been played). And yet, their only World Series title during this dynastic run carries an asterisk because it came that shortened campaign with playoff games at neutral sites and the whole weirdness of that season. So, yes, there is part of me that would like the Dodgers to win a World Series in a real season, with fans in the stands, with Mookie hitting home runs, Freddie hitting doubles and maybe even Kershaw dialing up Father Time and having his best October ever. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: While the Braves might be scrambling to fill out an injury-riddled rotation, the Dodgers have been doing that all along. So there doesn't appear to be an advantage for Atlanta in starting pitching and the Dodgers' bullpen is deeper and better. If that translates to lower-scoring games than the Braves prefer, the chances of one or two performances tipping the series rise. And for all of Ronald Acuna Jr.'s spectacular play and Matt Olson's home runs, would anyone be surprised if Freeman and Betts were enough all on their own to propel the Dodgers past the Braves? Their combined brilliance this season has been breathtaking and the postseason context for both of them is by now old hat. -- Doolittle\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\nNo. 4 seed | 90-72 | NL first wild card\nNLDS opponent: Braves (38.6% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 8.5% | Caesars odds: +1400\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 12\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Home runs. This is true of every team, of course, that you need to hit home runs to win in the postseason, but the Phillies spent the first four months of the season not hitting enough homers. Through the end of July they were 21st in the majors in home runs, topping out at 33 in a month. Then they hit 59 in August and 46 in September to tie the Braves for the most home runs over the final two months. That team -- like the one we saw last October with Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber leading the way -- is a team that can return to the World Series. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Phillies fans rallied behind Alec Bohm last year and watched him go from being a mess defensively to a very capable third baseman who became an integral part of a World Series team. The same is taking place with Trea Turner, who signed a $300 million contract over the offseason and struggled mightily through his first four months. He then got a supportive standing ovation from the home crowd, and went off in August and September. It's probably no coincidence. When Turner is right, he is one of the most dynamic players in the sport. We saw it early this year during the World Baseball Classic. Soon, he'll get his chance to become a true Philly legend. -- Gonzalez\nNow that the trade deadline has passed, Kiley McDaniel takes a look at who could get paid big this offseason.\n Ohtani and rest of top 10 »\nWhy you should root for them: Come on, this is a fun team. Harper is the straw that stirs the drink and he's must-watch TV in October. Schwarber had one of the wildest, weirdest seasons of all time, with a sub-.200 average but still scoring and driving in 100 runs thanks to his power and walks. Turner got red hot the final two months. Rookie Johan Rojas is electrifying and may be the best defensive center fielder in the game. The bullpen is often a high-wire act, so every Phillies game -- whether they're leading or trailing -- feels undecided until that final out. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Phillies have star power in the lineup and the collective long ball ability to go toe-to-toe with the Braves. Their outfield defense has improved with personnel changes through the season. The rotation is in much better shape than Atlanta's injury-marred group. But the most underrated aspect of the Phillies, and where they may have a decisive edge over the Braves, is the bullpen. The Phillies feature high-octane stuff, depth and balance in this area and most of the chief components (Craig Kimbrel, Gregory Soto, Jose Alvarado, Jeff Hoffman, Matt Strahm, Seranthony Domínguez) have been on point as the playoffs approach. In Rob Thomson, they have a skipper who proved last year that he knows how to deploy a bullpen in October. If the Phillies can turn a series against the Braves into a successive battle of the bullpens, look out. -- Doolittle\n\nArizona Diamondbacks\nNo. 6 seed | 84-78 | NL third wild card\nNLDS opponent: Dodgers (32.6% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 3.8% | Caesars odds: +3300\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 12\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The starting pitchers not named Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly -- but what happens after that? The only other starter with an ERA under 5.00 was Tommy Henry and he's injured. Zach Davies was actually in the rotation until he was designated for assignment just a few days before the season ended. That leaves rookies Ryne Nelson and Brandon Pfaadt, who have both been hit hard and struggled with the long ball. Pfaadt has more swing-and-miss stuff, so he's probably the No. 3 starter, but Arizona will have to find a way to win some non-Gallen/Kelly games. -- Schoenfield\nWith the help of some emerging veteran leadership, Arizona doubled down on its youth carrying the load.\nJesse Rogers »\nPassan: Inside Carroll's rise to stardom »\nReady for his October closeup: You'd be hard-pressed to find a more electric player than Corbin Carroll, a dynamic defender and an elite hitter who also plays with his hair on fire. Carroll became the first player ever to combine 50-plus steals with 25-plus home runs and 10-plus triples in the same season. He did that as a rookie. David Cone recently said Carroll reminds him of Derek Jeter in his rookie season, largely because of their leadership qualities at a young age. One big difference: Jeter played for one of the world's most decorated franchises. Carroll, not so much. But that's what makes the playoffs so cool -- the world is about to find out just how good and fun Carroll really is. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: We mentioned the Orioles turning it around from 110 losses two seasons ago. Well, the Diamondbacks matched them that year with 110 defeats, so getting to the playoffs just two years later is a great achievement for a young, building team. In this day of rocket-armed pitchers, Gallen and Kelly are two starters who rely on movement, location and pitch selection more than pure velocity. The art of pitching is alive and well with those two. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Run, run, run. Despite the uptick in stolen bases this season, this still isn't baseball, circa 1985. To run on offense, the hitters have to get on base and get the ball in play. If that happens, the Diamondback rolled up 161 stolen bases and did so with a MLB-best 87% success rate. They can drive Sean Murphy and his pitchers crazy. But that's not the only kind of running we're talking about. Arizona's athleticism also paid off on defense as Torey Lovullo's fielders as a unit was arguably the best in the majors. Like Toronto, if Arizona's pitchers can keep the Braves' power bats in the ballpark (easier said than done), Carroll & Co. can impact games by running down balls in the gap -- Doolittle"}

Everything you want to know is here in one spot to help you get ready for a loaded weekend of NFL football.\nLet's get into the full Week 5 slate, including Josh Allen vs. Trevor Lawrence in London, a big Cowboys-Niners showdown and Patrick Mahomes taking on the Vikings. It all culminates with a \"Monday Night Football\" matchup between the Packers and the Raiders on ESPN. (Game times are Sunday unless otherwise noted.)\n\nJump to a matchup:\nJAX-BUF | HOU-ATL | CAR-DET\nTEN-IND | NYG-MIA | NO-NE\nBAL-PIT | PHI-LAR | CIN-ARI\nNYJ-DEN | KC-MIN | DAL-SF\nGB-LV\nThursday: CHI 40, WSH 20\nBye: CLE, LAC, SEA, TB\n\n9:30 a.m. ET | NFL Network | Spread: BUF -5.5 (48.5)\nStoryline to watch: While it's a Bills \"home\" game, the Jaguars are on the second of back-to-back weeks in London, which means Jacksonville has the time zone experience advantage. But the Jaguars will be challenged to slow down a Bills offense that's averaging 5.9 yards per play (fourth) while the Jaguars' defense is allowing 5.4 yards per play (22nd). -- Alaina Getzenberg\nBold prediction: QB Josh Allen will score a touchdown, and so will ... LB Josh Allen. Not a big deal if Buffalo's Allen runs for a TD -- he has 40 over his career, including two this year -- but Jacksonville's Allen has just one TD in his five-year career: a 37-yard fumble return that gave the Jaguars a 20-16 victory over Tennessee in Week 18 last season. -- Mike DiRocco\nStat to know: QB Allen had four touchdown passes last week, the 10th such game in his career. He is tied with Jim Kelly for the most in Bills franchise history. The last quarterback to throw four TD passes in consecutive games was Joe Burrow in Weeks 16-17 in 2021.\nMatchup X factor: Jaguars cornerbacks Tyson Campbell and Darious Williams. Jacksonville has a strong run defense, and if these two corners -- who both have allowed lower than average yards per coverage snap this season, according to NFL Next Gen Stats -- can slow down the Bills' passing attack, the Jaguars have a chance. -- Walder\nInjuries: Jaguars | Bills\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Jaguars' defense allows the second most fantasy points to tight ends. Rookie TE Dalton Kincaid didn't have a great game against the Dolphins, but he did catch four of five targets for 27 yards. He ran more routes and was more involved in the passing game than Dawson Knox. The stage is set for Kincaid to have a breakout performance. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: Doug Pederson is 32-23 against the spread (ATS) in his career as an underdog, including playoffs. He is 9-6 ATS as an underdog to the Bills.

Who has to step up for Bills after White's Achilles tear?\n\n1 p.m. ET | Fox | Spread: ATL -1.5 (41.5)\nStoryline to watch: Atlanta's home/road splits with Desmond Ridder at quarterback are stark -- 4-0 and completing 67.9% of his passes with four touchdowns and one interception at home, 0-4 with a 58.6% completion rate, one touchdown and two interceptions on the road. That'll be an interesting thing to watch since the Texans have allowed quarterbacks to complete passes at a high clip (71.9%) when they're on the road, although they've given up only one passing touchdown. -- Michael Rothstein\nBold prediction: The Falcons' passing attack will be held to under 110 yards and will turn the ball over multiple times. The Texans are one of six teams with more interceptions (three) than passing touchdowns allowed (two) and pressure quarterbacks on 44% of their dropbacks, the third-highest rate. Ridder has been sacked 16 times, fourth most in the NFL, and the Falcons average the fewest passing yards per game (156). -- DJ Bien-Aime\nStat to know: Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud has thrown zero interceptions in his first 151 passing attempts, the third-most passing attempts without an interception to begin a career in NFL history (Dak Prescott, 176, and Tua Tagovailoa, 152). Stroud will face Jessie Bates III, who has collected three interceptions this season (tied for the most in the NFL).\nMatchup X factor: Ridder. He has just a 29 QBR so far this season, and that's nowhere near good enough to get the Atlanta offense going. The Falcons need more from him if they are going to beat a frisky Texans squad. -- Walder\nInjuries: Texans | Falcons\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Texans' defense has done an excellent job containing wide receivers -- allowing the sixth-fewest fantasy points per game to the position. They do, however, give up the seventh-most fantasy points per game to running backs, so expect the Falcons to double down on the running game. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Falcons are 0-3 ATS in their past three games.

Stroud will continue to be mentioned as a top waiver wire pickup.\n\n1 p.m. ET | Fox | Spread: DET -10 (44)\nStoryline to watch: The Panthers are still looking for their first win of the season but will have to slow down a potent Lions offense to get it. Detroit's offense has scored at least 20 points in 13 straight games -- which is tied for the longest streak in franchise history (1995) -- and could get another boost with the return of wide receiver Jameson Williams, whose suspension for violating the NFL's gambling policy was reduced last week. Carolina's defense has allowed at least 20 points in every game this season. -- Eric Woodyard\nBold prediction: Detroit QB Jared Goff will pass for a season-high 350 yards and four touchdowns. The Panthers will tighten up their porous run defense. However, they won't be able to pressure Goff, who is going against a secondary that's missing two starters (CB Jaycee Horn, S Xavier Woods) and could be down a third if CB Donte Jackson (shoulder) doesn't play. -- David Newton\nStat to know: Lions tight end Sam LaPorta has 22 receptions this season, third among rookies and third among tight ends. With three receptions on Sunday, he will be the third tight end with 25 receptions in the first five games of his career since 1950, joining Keith Jackson (29 in 1988) and Jordan Reed (26 in 2013).\nMatchup X factor: Panthers receivers DJ Chark Jr., Jonathan Mingo and Terrace Marshall Jr. Carolina simply needs more out of its wideouts, aside from Adam Thielen, to support slow-starting QB Bryce Young. Mingo and Marshall are in the bottom five in the Receiver Tracking Metrics' overall score among wide receivers (Chark hasn't played enough to qualify). -- Walder\nInjuries: Panthers | Lions\nWhat to know for fantasy: No team this season has eclipsed 90 yards rushing against Detroit, which has held opponents to 243 total rushing yards. The Panthers could rely heavily on Hayden Hurst, Thielen and Chark on Sunday. Against tight ends, the Lions' defense gives up the fourth-most fantasy points. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: Panthers coach Frank Reich is 5-2-1 ATS in his career as at least a 6-point underdog. Read more.\nMoody's pick: Lions 30, Panthers 14\nWalder's pick: Lions 27, Panthers 17\nFPI prediction: DET, 77.1% (by an average of 10.2 points)\n\nMatchup must-reads: Why Panthers aren't panicking about Young, offense ... Reinstated from gambling suspension, is Williams finally ready to launch?  ... At 0-4, Panthers' offense, Young are failing each other ... Campbell sets realistic expectations for Williams\n\n1 p.m. ET | CBS | Spread: TEN -2 (43)\nStoryline to watch: The Titans have won five straight meetings with the Colts and six of the past seven between the clubs. The Colts' last win in the series came on Nov. 12, 2020, with long-retired Philip Rivers at QB. Additionally, the Colts have now lost seven consecutive games at home, their last win at Lucas Oil Stadium coming on Oct. 16, 2022, against the Jaguars. -- Stephen Holder\nBold prediction: WR DeAndre Hopkins will record his first 100-yard receiving game for the Titans. Hopkins' 65 yards against the Saints in Week 1 has been his best outing, but the Colts' pass defense has allowed 263.8 yards per game through four games this season. Indianapolis will be without starting CB Dallis Flowers, so Hopkins will have a prime opportunity to take advantage of the matchup against a reserve corner on one side and rookie JuJu Brents on the other. But he'll face a bigger challenge in the slot against Kenny Moore II. -- Turron Davenport\nStat to know: The Titans have scored fewer than 30 points in 22 straight games, the longest active streak in NFL and tied for longest streak in franchise history (22 straight in 1966-67).\n\n• Full schedule » | Standings »\n• Depth charts for every team »\n• Transactions » | Injuries »\n• Football Power Index »\nMore NFL coverage »\nMatchup X factor: Colts running back Jonathan Taylor. He's a true X factor in the sense that we don't know what his role will be on Sunday, but he can charge up the Colts' ground game if he plays a significant amount and is the 2021 version of himself. -- Walder\nInjuries: Titans | Colts\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Titans' defense has allowed wide receivers the ninth-most fantasy points per game this season. Michael Pittman Jr. has averaged 9.8 targets and 14.0 fantasy points per game in six career games against Tennessee. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Titans have covered five straight meetings. Read more.\nMoody's pick: Colts 24, Titans 21\nWalder's pick: Colts 20, Titans 16\nFPI prediction: TEN, 55.6% (by an average of 2 points)\n\nMatchup must-reads: Henry throws 4th career touchdown pass in Titans' win ... Richardson's poise is keeping Colts in games\n\n1 p.m. ET | Fox | Spread: MIA -11 (48.5)\nStoryline to watch: The Giants rank dead last in sacks allowed per pass attempt at 17.2%. Meanwhile, the Dolphins have generated sacks on just 6.7% of opponents' dropbacks. Dolphins players and coaches have publicly stated that Sunday is not a \"get right\" game, but Miami's defense has an opportunity to right the ship against a reeling Giants offensive line. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques\nBold prediction: The Dolphins' high-flying offense will never take off against the Giants and will be held to under 24 points. New York played its best defensive game on Monday night and is sixth in the NFL with a 51.9% pass rush win rate. It will have some success creating havoc against a Miami offensive line that will be missing left tackle Terron Armstead. -- Jordan Raanan\nStat to know: Miami QB Tua Tagovailoa ranks first in yards per attempt on throws with motion, on quick throws under 2.5 seconds and on passes between the numbers. The Giants' defense ranks 24th or worse in all of those areas this season.\nMatchup X factor: Dolphins tackle Kendall Lamm. Lamm has filled in for the injured Armstead admirably with a 96% pass block win rate. Miami needs him to keep it up to keep Tagovailoa upright. -- Walder\nInjuries: Giants | Dolphins\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Giants' opponents have rushed for the eighth-most yards per game. The Dolphins lead the league with 176.8 rushing yards per game. It's again a good week to start a Miami running back. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Giants are 0-4 ATS this season. Read more.\nMoody's pick: Dolphins 42, Giants 17\nWalder's pick: Dolphins 35, Giants 24\nFPI prediction: MIA, 87% (by an average of 15.5 points)\n\nMatchup must-reads: Giants need to do 'better job' of getting Waller involved ... Hill in the chase for Calvin Johnson's receiving record ... Neal apologizes for lashing out at booing fans\nRyan Clark raves about Mike McDaniel and the Dolphins' offense after Miami put up 70 points on Denver.\n\n1 p.m. ET | CBS | Spread: NE -1 (39)\nStoryline to watch: The Patriots rank 30th in scoring average (13.8) and the Saints (15.5) are tied for 25th. One major issue for the Patriots has been their turnover differential (minus-5), which ranks 27th in the NFL. One major issue for the Saints has been their red zone offense, which ranks last in the NFL with just four TDs in 12 trips. -- Mike Reiss\nBold prediction: The Saints will force two turnovers against the Patriots. While New Orleans' offense has struggled, the defense has been able to capitalize multiple times, getting an interception in three of four games and forcing a fumble in the one game without a pick. Patriots QB Mac Jones has thrown four interceptions this season, and the Saints are poised to get C Paulson Adebo back from injury, which could mean a prime opportunity for them. -- Katherine Terrell\nStat to know: The Patriots have the worst pass block win rate in the NFL (39.7%). And Jones is struggling throwing downfield -- he's 0-12 on passes of 25-plus yards.\nMatchup X factor: Patriots cornerback J.C. Jackson. Which Jackson will New England get: the player who was a standout for the Patriots for years or the one who was a liability for the Chargers? The variance is high here and could matter quite a bit, given the Patriots' banged-up secondary. -- Walder\nInjuries: Saints | Patriots\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Saints' defensive front allows only 103.3 rushing yards per game. There is a good chance that New England's running game will get back on track sooner than later, but it is unlikely to happen against the Saints. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: Saints coach Dennis Allen is 21-35-1 ATS in his career (.375). Out of coaches with at least 50 games in the Super Bowl era, he has the worst cover percentage.

Why it's no surprise Belichick traded for Jackson ... Saints leaned heavily on Kamara in his season debut ... O'Brien downplays Jones' struggles as 'uncharacteristic'\n\n1 p.m. ET | CBS | Spread: BAL -4 (38)\nStoryline to watch: Despite sustaining a bone bruise to his left knee against the Texans, Steelers QB Kenny Pickett says he'll be ready to play Sunday. Pickett hasn't had a great start to the season, with a 29.3 QBR through four games, ranking 29th. But in last year's Week 17 win against the Ravens, he recorded an 82.5 QBR -- his highest of the season. Bouncing back against the Ravens' defense, though, is a tall task. The Ravens have allowed opposing quarterbacks to complete just 61% of passes and they've recorded 15 sacks, second most in the NFL. -- Brooke Pryor\nBold prediction: Ravens QB Lamar Jackson will toss four touchdown passes for the first time since September 2022. The Steelers are the only team that Jackson has thrown more interceptions (six) than touchdown passes (four) against in his six-year career. But Pittsburgh has allowed eight touchdown passes this season, which is the fourth most in the league. -- Jamison Hensley\n• Early mock drafts: Miller » | Reid »\n• Ranks: Kiper » | Positional top fives »\n• QB Hot Board » | Early predictions »\n• Projected draft order » | Read more »\nStat to know: Jackson has completed 74.3% of his passes this season, the second-best percentage in the NFL. He could become the first starting QB to complete 70% of his passes in each of his team's first five games since Derek Carr in 2020.\nMatchup X factor: Ravens wide receiver Zay Flowers. The Receiver Tracking Metrics make Flowers look like a hit so far. His 77 Open Score ranks eighth among wide receivers in 2023. That's a big help to the Ravens' offense. -- Walder\nInjuries: Ravens | Steelers\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Steelers' defense has allowed some superb performances to No. 1 receivers. Davante Adams, Nico Collins, Brandon Aiyuk and Amari Cooper averaged 31.7 fantasy points against Pittsburgh. Flowers leads the Ravens with 29 targets. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Steelers are 51-29-3 ATS as underdogs under Mike Tomlin (.637), the best record in the NFL in that span. Tomlin is 43-40 outright as an underdog.

The Rams have not allowed more than 400 yards in a game this season and are allowing an average of 295.8 yards per game, which ranks ninth in the NFL. -- Sarah Barshop\nBold prediction: Rams QB Matthew Stafford will throw three touchdown passes, doubling his season total. The Eagles have yielded nine touchdowns through the air this season, third worst behind only the Broncos (13) and Bears (10). Stafford has a chance to light it up, especially if receiver Cooper Kupp (hamstring) returns to the lineup as hoped. -- Tim McManus\nStat to know: Rams rookie WR Puka Nacua has 39 receptions for 501 yards this season (both are the most through four career games in NFL history). He needs one reception and 43 receiving yards for the most through five career games.\nMatchup X factor: Kupp. It remains to be seen if and how much he'll play, but if he does, this will be our first window into the Kupp and Nacua offense. Given Nacua's breakout and Kupp's return, the Rams' offense looks much more dangerous than we thought before the season. -- Walder\nInjuries: Eagles | Rams\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Eagles' secondary has struggled this season, allowing the sixth-most passing yards per game. Find a way to insert the Rams' pass-catchers into your fantasy lineups. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: This is the 25th consecutive start in the regular season Eagles QB Jalen Hurts is favored in.

Arizona will try to keep it going against Joe Burrow, who has gotten off to poor starts all season and has been sacked eight times. -- Josh Weinfuss\nBold prediction: The Cardinals will rush for 175 yards. Cincinnati is 31st in rush defense (giving up an average of 157.0 yards per game), and Arizona is second in rushing yards per attempt (5.3). Combine those factors, and this could be a day for Arizona to make its presence felt on the ground. -- Ben Baby\nStat to know: Arizona QB Joshua Dobbs has thrown four touchdown passes and no interceptions this season. No Cardinals player has ever had five passing touchdowns and zero interceptions in his first five starts with the team since starters were first tracked in 1950.\nMatchup X factor: Bengals guards Alex Cappa and Cordell Volson. They rank 65th and 67th out of 67 qualifying guards in pass block win rate. Burrow is clearly not at 100% and needs better protection if he's going to get back on track. -- Walder\nInjuries: Bengals | Cardinals\nWhat to know for fantasy: The Bengals' defense has allowed the sixth-most rushing yards to running backs. Derrick Henry scored 24.4 fantasy points against Cincinnati's defense last week. The Bengals will now face James Conner. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: Burrow is 27-18-1 ATS in his career but is 0-3-1 ATS this season. He has failed to cover five straight regular-season games. Prior to this current streak, he had never gone longer than two straight games without a cover.

The Broncos are last, or near last, in every major statistical category on defense. Their run defense is allowing 176 yards rushing per game, while the Jets have averaged 95.5 rush yards through four games. -- Jeff Legwold\nBold prediction: Hall will score two touchdowns for his first trips to the end zone since Oct. 23, 2022, in Denver. That day, he scored on a 62-yard run but was done for the season a short time after when he tore his ACL. Hall, who no longer has playing-time limitations, should have plenty of opportunities against Denver's inviting run defense. -- Rich Cimini\n• Why the 'tush push' might get banned\n• Love's completion rate ranks last\n• O'Brien sees glimpses with Jones\n• Stroud knew Collins would be special\n• Why 0-4 Panthers aren't panicking\n• Saints look for offensive change\n• Cowboys, 49ers renew rivalry\nStat to know: The Jets rank last in third-down conversion percentage (27%) on offense this season, averaging the fewest plays per drive (4.7) in the NFL.\nMatchup X factor: Jets quarterback Zach Wilson. The player we saw in the second half against the Chiefs looked entirely different from, frankly, the rest of Wilson's career. Will he keep it up? I'm skeptical because the sample of him playing poorly is so much larger. But we'll see. Fortunately for Wilson, the Broncos' defense is a mess. -- Walder\nInjuries: Jets | Broncos\nWhat to know for fantasy: Even though the Jets' secondary is formidable, the Broncos have the best chance of attacking the defense with their running backs. The New York defense has allowed opponents to rush for the fifth-most yards per game. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: Broncos games have gone over the total in three straight and eight of the past nine games dating back to last season. Prior to that stretch, 11 of the Broncos' first 12 games last season went under.

But will they dare use it against Mahomes, who, since the start of the 2020 season, has the NFL's best QBR (89.0) against the blitz? -- Kevin Seifert\nBold prediction: Mahomes will throw for 300 yards and won't have an interception. This type of game used to be a staple for him, but not this year. He has had only one 300-yard game and one without throwing a pick. But the Vikings are 21st in opponent QBR and yards allowed and have just one interception. -- Adam Teicher\nStat to know: Vikings QB Kirk Cousins has 11 passing touchdowns this season, the most in the NFL. He has thrown multiple touchdown passes in every game this season, the second-longest streak by a Vikings player to start the season since the 1970 merger (Tommy Kramer, six straight in 1981).\nMatchup X factor: Vikings wide receiver Jordan Addison. Shut out on just a single target in last week's game, Addison needs to be a capable threat if the Vikings are going to keep up with the Chiefs' offense. -- Walder\nInjuries: Chiefs | Vikings\nWhat to know for fantasy: Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco has had the fourth-highest success rate (46%) among running backs since entering the league in 2022, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. His ability to create yards after contact and force missed tackles is also impressive. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Chiefs are 2-5 ATS in their past seven road games.

Can Jefferson catch Calvin Johnson?\n\n8:20 p.m. ET | NBC | Spread: SF -4 (45)\nStoryline to watch: It's hard to find a Week 5 game more enticing than this, as these two historically successful franchises renew their longstanding rivalry. In a game where turnovers always matter, they take on greater importance when two talented heavyweights clash. Dallas leads the league with 10 takeaways, while the Niners have just one giveaway on the season, tied with Dallas and Seattle for the fewest in the NFL. San Francisco beat Dallas in the divisional round last season in part because it was plus-1 in turnover margin. It stands to reason the outcome in this one will ride heavily again on which side takes better care of the ball. -- Nick Wagoner\nBold prediction: Niners QB Brock Purdy will have a pass intercepted. He has not had a pass picked off in his past five regular-season appearances. He was not intercepted in the win against Dallas in the divisional round, either. And he is coming off a game in which he had just one incompletion. So why will the Cowboys have a pick? That's what they do. CB DaRon Bland is coming off a game with two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown. The Cowboys have seven interceptions on the season -- only Buffalo has more (eight). At some point, Purdy has to throw one to the other team. -- Todd Archer\nStat to know: Purdy has torched man coverage, ranking in the top three in QBR, yards per attempt and touchdown-to-interception ratio since entering the NFL last season. He'll face a Cowboys defense that has played man coverage at the highest rate in the NFL since the start of last season.\nMatchup X factor: Cowboys linebacker Leighton Vander Esch. Niners coach Kyle Shanahan is notorious for targeting opposing linebackers with his offense. Dallas will need Vander Esch to be on his game. Good news for the Cowboys: He has allowed just 0.2 yards per coverage snap this season, per NFL Next Gen Stats, which is excellent. -- Walder\nInjuries: Cowboys | 49ers\nWhat to know for fantasy: This season, the 49ers are allowing only 3.9 yards per rushing attempt. This might not be RB Tony Pollard's breakout game. See Week 5 rankings. -- Moody\nBetting nugget: The Cowboys are 26-12 ATS in the past three seasons, tied with the Lions for the best record in that span. They are 13-6 ATS on the road in that span, tied with the Bengals and Cardinals for the best record.

The Raiders All-Pro receiver said it would be \"weird\" to look across the field during warmups and see those familiar gold and green helmets with the oversized \"G\" on them after spending his first eight seasons with the Packers. Now in his second year with Las Vegas, Adams needs one TD catch to surpass Antonio Brown (31) and Jimmy Graham (31) for the fourth-most TD receptions in prime-time games in NFL history, trailing Hall of Famers Jerry Rice (46), Randy Moss (44) and Terrell Owens (34). -- Paul Gutierrez\nBold prediction: Green Bay WR Romeo Doubs will have a better stat line than Adams -- if Adams plays -- on Monday night. Doubs has been compared to him by some in the Packers organization, and here's his chance to show it's a worthy comparison. Doubs' three touchdown catches are the most by a Packers receiver in the team's first four games of a season since Adams in 2018. Doubs will add to that. -- Rob Demovsky\nStat to know: Packers QB Jordan Love has thrown at least one passing touchdown in all five of his career starts.

(1:03)\nWE ALL KNOW plenty about the game now titled the Red River Showdown. And we should.\nThere might not be another college football contest that does a better job of wrapping its gloves around everything we love about the sport than when Texas and Oklahoma square off on the second weekend of October. On Saturday, they will meet at high noon on ABC, a top-12 matchup with a Big 12 inside lane on the line.\nYou want tradition? How about Bevo's 1,800-pound self, sauntering onto the sideline to watch the 1,020-pound Sooner Schooner wagon come barreling into the Cotton Bowl, pulled by land-grabbing ponies and covered in RUF/NEKS.\nYou want history? How about a game that Saturday will be played for the 119th time, a series that started seven years before the Oklahoma Territory achieved statehood. It has been played for 94 consecutive years, dating back to Oct. 19, 1929. Since 1948, it has sold out 75 times, including this year.\nYou want competition? How about a series that is led by Texas 63-50-5 but since the end of World War II has been split nearly precisely down the middle with 39 wins for the Sooners, 37 wins for the Longhorns and three ties. In fact, what is considered perhaps the most epic game in Red River Rivalry history was one of those ties. The 6-6 stalemate of 1976 ignited wild conspiracy claims of spying. It was fitting, considering President Gerald Ford, he of the Warren Commission and the pardoning of Richard Nixon, was in attendance.\nYou want symmetry? How about all of that you just read, plus a game location of Dallas because Big D was seen as the perfect Red River DMZ, located almost exactly halfway between the two campuses in Austin, Texas, and Norman, Oklahoma. And then there is that seating configuration. The Cotton Bowl is split exactly down the middle, the 50-yard line acting as a Bowie knife, evenly dividing the 92,100-seat oval into equal halves of UT burnt orange and OU crimson and cream. That leaves entire sections of hundreds of fans left sitting with their shoulders mashed and colors clashed for four hours in the Texas heat. As former Horns head coach Mack Brown once explained: \"It's not like your home crowd or your away crowd, where it's loud for you and quiet for the opponent. In this game, somebody is screaming every play.\"\nSpencer Rattler loses the football right into the hands of Texas linebacker Juwan Mitchell. Sam Ehlinger would score for the Longhorns on the ensuing drive.\nYou want a heart-stopper? Just go back and watch the highlights of this game over the past decade alone. From 2014 through 2021, the largest margin of victory was eight points and the average score over eight contests was Oklahoma 36, Texas 32. Heck, just watch that eight-point game. The 2020 contest was an anti-'76 affair that stretched into four overtimes and was played for nearly five hours before former Sooners QB Spencer Rattler -- who had been benched earlier in the game for fumbling -- threw a TD pass to Drake Stoops, son of former Sooners head coach Bob Stoops, to win the game 53-45. Or, if you want to take that question literally, you could step outside the stadium gates and directly into the Texas State Fair, the event that envelopes the Cotton Bowl and this game, and choke down a basket of deep-fried cheesy crab tater bites or a plate of deep-fried honey butter brisket swirls. My Crestor bottle started vibrating just by me typing that.\nFrom Darrell Royal and Bud Wilkinson to Billy Sims and Earl Campbell to Ricky Williams and Baker Mayfield and, yes, this weekend with Quinn Ewers versus Dillon Gabriel in a battle of undefeated College Football Playoff hopefuls, every single time these two teams have met, the stakes -- and steaks -- have been scorching hot.\nBut this year, the official framing of the game comes with some sadness. As if a famous western wear store was suddenly closing shop. The end of an era. Texas and Oklahoma's last cleated steps in a long march together as members and co-anchors of the Big 12 Conference.\nONE YEAR FROM now, this game will be played again, just as it has been every autumn since the turn of the previous century. Only from 2024 and beyond, it will be an SEC matchup. Ever since July 21, 2021, when the news broke of the schools' joint decision to break ranks with the Big 12 and reach out to the SEC, collegiate athletics has been a never-ending Jenga puzzle, pieces pulled from conferences coast-to-coast and then jammed back into any available opening in any and every manner necessary to keep the entire tower from crumbling down. So many of those moves don't make sense. What they generate in cash they seem to equally lose when it comes to the valuation of regional relevance and tradition.\nThe banks of the Red River are certainly a long way from The Swamp of Florida or the Congaree River that flows by South Carolina's Williams-Brice Stadium on its way down to Charleston. But the two states whose shared border is drawn along that Red River also snap nicely into the left side of the continuous jigsaw map that represents the footprint of the Southeastern Conference. There are no gaps, from the Atlantic Coast and Gulf of Mexico all the way into the Great Plains as they roll up into central Oklahoma.\nHowever, much more crucial than cartography is the calendar. The Red River Rivalry's streak of games played will not be stopped, unlike so many other rivalries that have at worst been completely sunk or at least been put on extended hiatus by the cold spreadsheets and shredded maps of realignment (*clears throat* ahem, Texas-Texas A&M).\nThis is not the first time this game has undergone an extreme matchup makeover. Yes, it has served as the centerpiece event of the Big 12, but only since 1996, when the conference was formed out of necessity during the first real lineup shakeup of college football's modern age. Prior to that, Oklahoma-Texas was not an in-conference matchup.\nFrom 1920 through '95, the Sooners were not a member of the Southwest Conference, a fact that would no doubt stump any younger-generation football fans at their local sports bar's trivia night. They were in the Big Eight, which had been the Big Seven, the Big Six and, in the beginning, the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association.\nTexas was a founding member of the Southwest Conference in 1915 and remained there until it collapsed in 1995 to give way to the Big 12. OU was also an OG Southwest member but left at the end of the 1919 season.\nSo, if you're scoring at home, and plenty of Sooners and Horns certainly are, then through Saturday, over 119 games played, the Red River Rivalry has been a conference showdown 33 times, five in the Southwest and 28 in the Big 12. That's only 28% of the games. The other editions of the game have been everything from a clash of independents to Southwest vs. Big 8 to SWC vs. MVIAA.\nIN OTHER WORDS, when one backs up and looks at the bigger picture, whether it be in black-and-white silver emulsion or gigapixel high resolution, the concept of OU and UT in the SEC doesn't seem all that strange, certainly when compared to the other incongruous college sports chess moves that will be taking place at the same time as theirs next fall.\nThe difference? This game -- in the minds of so many, the game -- isn't going anywhere.\n\"I don't need but maybe one or two of things in my life to still be there all the time so that I know it is still my life,\" explained Barry Switzer, who coached in 22 Red River Rivalry games, six as an Oklahoma assistant and 16 as head coach. His comments came in late summer 2021, not long after the news of the move to the SEC had broken.\n\"As long as that game is on that weekend in that place, I suppose I can make the rest of it work.\""}

(1:17)\nThe NHL is in a torch-passing mood as it enters the 2023-24 season.\nThe Vegas Golden Knights are the reigning Stanley Cup champions, having earned their first title since coming into the league in 2017 as an expansion team. The Seattle Kraken defeated the 2022 champs, the Colorado Avalanche, for their first playoff series win in their second season of existence.\nFor the first time in nine seasons, the top 10 scorers in the NHL were all under 30 years old, including Dallas Stars winger Jason Robertson and Vancouver Canucks center Elias Pettersson, both just 24 years old.\nThen there's the rookie class for this season, a remarkably deep collection of talent led by 2023 first overall pick Connor Bedard, who has lifted the Chicago Blackhawks back to relevance before ever appearing in a regular-season NHL game.\nBut not everyone is ready to let go of the torch. Veteran teams like the Boston Bruins and Pittsburgh Penguins are trying to raise the Cup again after major offseason changes. Meanwhile, the megastars in their prime on the Edmonton Oilers and Toronto Maple Leafs are desperate to finally win their first rings.\nIf you haven't kept up with the NHL in the past few months, don't fret, we've got you covered. Here's a chance to catch up on everything that has happened -- the hirings, firings, signings and even a blockbuster trade. It's all in our guide to the 2023-24 season for lapsed fans. Read up before the puck drops on opening night this Tuesday!\nHow to watch the 2023-24 NHL season on ESPN networks -- including 100 exclusive games and the out-of-market package (over 1,050 games).\nThe biggest surprise about the Golden Knights lifting the Stanley Cup might have been that it wasn't the Bruins doing it instead.\nThe 2022-23 Bruins were the most successful regular-season team in NHL history, setting league records for wins (65) and points (135) in a season. The NHL awards confirmed that they had the league's best goalie (Linus Ullmark), best coach (Jim Montgomery) and best defensive forward (Patrice Bergeron), along with a 61-goal scorer in winger David Pastrnak. They were a juggernaut offensively and defensively. The question wasn't if they would win the Stanley Cup, but how long it would take them.\nAnd then they were upset in the first round by the Florida Panthers -- who would go on to face Vegas for the Stanley Cup -- losing at home in a Game 7 overtime that left Boston fans and players in stunned silence.\nIt wasn't just a loss on the ice for the Bruins. The offseason saw Bergeron, their much celebrated No. 1 center and captain, retire after 19 seasons. Their second-best center, David Krejci, retired after 16 seasons. The Bruins had made it their mission to send both of them off as champions. Instead, they have to pick themselves up off the canvas without them.\nThey aren't the only departures from Boston: Wingers Taylor Hall, Nick Foligno, Tyler Bertuzzi and defenseman Dmitry Orlov all switched teams in the offseason, too.\nCan new captain Brad Marchand and the Bruins who remain get back to the playoffs with these lineup holes? Is their defense corps, led by Charlie McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm, and goaltending (Ullmark and Jeremy Swayman) dominant enough to contend again? It's going to be fascinating to find out.\nIf the Bruins falter, or another of last season's Eastern Conference playoff teams struggles, all eyes are on a trio of Atlantic Division teams that have been rebuilding towards getting back to the playoffs.\nThe Buffalo Sabres have garnered the most interest, having not made the playoffs since 2011. They have a newly minted star center in Tage Thompson and two great young defensemen in Rasmus Dahlin and Owen Power.\nThe Ottawa Senators also have a breakout star in forward Tim Stutzle, who joins players like Brad Tkachuk and Claude Giroux in trying to get the Sens their first playoff spot since 2017 under new owner Michael Andlauer.\nThe Detroit Red Wings, who haven't made the playoffs since 2016, hope their mix of established veterans and younger talents finally brings GM Steve Yzerman's plans into sharper focus.\nBedard, 18, is the latest generational talent who had teams, ahem, \"rearranging their rosters\" in order to maximize their draft lottery odds. Chicago had the third-best odds when it won the lottery to secure the services of Bedard, selecting No. 1 overall for the first time since drafting Patrick Kane in 2007.\nThe hockey world had anticipated Bedard's NHL arrival for years. He was granted exceptional status as a 15-year-old to play in the Western Hockey League, the first time the WHL granted such an exception. He racked up player of the year awards and led the Canadian junior team to two gold medals. Scouts have raved about the quality and accuracy of his shot, which produced 122 goals in 119 games over the past two seasons with the Regina Pats. He's unquestionably the most hyped rookie to arrive in the NHL since another Connor: Oilers star and reigning NHL MVP Connor McDavid, who was drafted in 2015.\n\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nBedard arrives during a transitional time for Chicago.\nThe Blackhawks' reputation is still on the mend after the 2021 investigation that made public the sexual assault allegations by former player Kyle Beach against the team's video coach Brad Aldrich during the 2010 season. Stan Bowman, the team's GM and president of hockey operations, and senior vice president of hockey operations Al MacIsaac both resigned in the aftermath, with current general manager Kyle Davidson taking over.\nKane and captain Jonathan Toews, the last on-ice links to the Blackhawks' three Stanley Cup championships (2010, 2013, 2015), both parted ways with the franchise last season. In July, Blackhawks owner Rocky Wirtz died at 70 years old following an illness.\nBedard's arrival has certainly helped change the vibes for the Blackhawks.\nThe team sold $5.2 million worth of tickets after winning the draft lottery. The Blackhawks tell ESPN that they expect an increase of over 17% in tickets sold and overall 26% higher revenue growth than our initial 2023-24 season projections. They've nearly doubled their full season-ticket packages sold year over year.\nChicago hasn't made the playoffs in three seasons and probably won't again in Bedard's first season -- although the Blackhawks bolstered their rebuilding lineup with familiar names like Taylor Hall, Nick Foligno and Corey Perry. But they theoretically have their next franchise player and, more importantly, a point of demarcation with the past.\nBedard is far from the only notable first-year player in the NHL this season. In a league that's all about speed, scoring and low salary cap hits, more young players than ever are breaking into the NHL early. Some other rookies to watch this season:\nLogan Cooley had announced he was returning to the University of Minnesota, but instead the No. 3 overall pick in 2022 signed with the Arizona Coyotes ... where he will still play in an NCAA arena this season, but we digress.\nCenter Adam Fantilli, 18, was selected third overall in the 2023 draft by the Columbus Blue Jackets after being projected as the second-best prospect behind Bedard all season. (No. 2 overall was Leo Carlsson of the Anaheim Ducks.) The University of Michigan product won the Hobey Baker as the best men's player in the NCAA last season.\nAnother Michigan alum is defenseman Luke Hughes, who brought some chaotic energy to the New Jersey Devils' playoff run. He's expected to be an offensive force this season on a team that features his brother, star center Jack Hughes.\nGoalie Devon Levi could be entrusted by the Sabres to lead them to their first playoff berth since 2011. He dazzled in a brief stint with them last season.\nThe Maple Leafs made winger Matthew Knies untouchable at the trade deadline last season, and for good reason: The Hobey Baker finalist from Minnesota brings offensive skill and physicality in his game.\nLogan Cooley puts moves on the defender and finds the back of the net for the score.\nKyle Dubas bet on himself as general manager of the Maple Leafs, entering last season without a contract beyond 2022-23. He seemingly won the wager, as the Leafs advanced past the opening round for the first time since 2004 by eliminating the Tampa Bay Lightning before losing to the Panthers.\n\nThis season will include 100 exclusive regular-season games across ESPN, ESPN+, Hulu and ABC.

The ask from Dubas went up, and reportedly so did the amount of power he wanted in personnel decisions. Dubas held a news conference that didn't sit well with Shanahan, saying his future in Toronto required \"a full family discussion.\" Ultimately, Shanahan decided to let Dubas walk, hiring former Calgary GM Brad Treliving as his replacement.\nDubas also made it seem like it was Toronto or bust in that news conference, saying, \"I definitely don't have it in me to go anywhere else.\" Then the Penguins came calling after they fired team president Brian Burke and general manager Ron Hextall and ... well, maybe Pittsburgh isn't like anywhere else.\nDubas was named president of hockey operations and oversaw a search for the team's next general manager before finding the perfect candidate: Kyle Dubas, who will serve in that role for the foreseeable future. The Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Penguins, tasked him with two missions: Start thinking about what the next phase of this team looks like while doing everything he can to help the team's veteran core -- Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang -- become Stanley Cup champions for a fourth time since 2009.\nHis first move was a bit of managerial magic: a three-team trade that saw him move out some of the team's cap-problematic contracts while acquiring 33-year-old San Jose defenseman Erik Karlsson, who won the Norris Trophy as the NHL's top defenseman last season. Karlsson scored 101 points in 82 games. Another season like that, and the Penguins might have one more championship push left in them.\nBesides the Karlsson trade, there were other significant trades in the offseason:\nThe Los Angeles Kings acquired center Pierre-Luc Dubois from the Winnipeg Jets in a package that included forwards Alex Iafallo and Gabriel Vilardi. A 25-year-old restricted free agent, Dubois was handed an eight-year, $68 million contract. Dubois gives the Kings one of the deepest groups at center in the West, along with Anze Kopitar and Phillip Danault.\nThe Devils, who defeated the New York Rangers for their first playoff series win since 2012, traded for winger Tyler Toffoli, who led the Calgary Flames with 34 goals last season.\nThe Avalanche acquired center Ryan Johansen from the Nashville Predators, who picked up half of his $8 million cap hit for the next two seasons to facilitate the trade.\nAfter scoring winger Alex DeBrincat made it clear that he wouldn't re-sign with the Senators, they sent him to the Red Wings in a trade that included a first-round pick and forward Dominik Kubalik.\nThe Blue Jackets added two veteran defensemen via trade, acquiring Ivan Provorov (Flyers) and Damon Severson (Devils). Severson received an eight-year, $50 million contract extension.\nThe St. Louis Blues benefited from the Philadelphia Flyers' salary dump, as they traded a sixth-round pick for center Kevin Hayes and had Philly pick up 50% of his salary for the remaining three years of the deal.\nSome interesting names ended up in even more interesting locations via free agency:\nThe NHL had a buyout window that was more active than usual. The players changing teams after having the remaining years on their contracts bought out included Jets captain Blake Wheeler, now with the Rangers; Predators center Matt Duchene, who signed with the Stars; winger Josh Bailey, who was traded to Chicago by the New York Islanders after 15 seasons, bought out by the Blackhawks, and then signed a professional tryout contract with the Senators; defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson, who was bought out by Vancouver and signed with the Panthers; and defenseman Tony DeAngelo, who now has the honor of being bought out by two different teams, with the Flyers ending his time in Philadelphia so he could rejoin the Carolina Hurricanes.\nThe Bruins saw their two big trade deadline acquisitions move on. Defenseman Dmitry Orlov signed a two-year deal with the Hurricanes, who were already stacked on defense, and Tyler Bertuzzi signed a one-year deal to play on Auston Matthews' wing with the Maple Leafs. Michael Bunting, who played with Matthews last season, signed with the Hurricanes. The Leafs also signed free agent defenseman John Klingberg to a one-year deal.\nStar center Ryan O'Reilly, who was picked up at the trade deadline by Toronto, surprised many by signing a four-year deal with the Predators.\nGoalie Joonas Korpisalo, one of the only big-name goalies available as free agency opened, inked a five-year contract with the Senators.\nWinger Alex Killorn, an essential role player on Tampa Bay's Stanley Cup teams, signed a four-year deal with the Ducks after 11 seasons with the Lightning.\nDefenseman Matt Dumba was cap-squeezed out of Minnesota and signed a one-year deal with the Coyotes.\nWinger James van Riemsdyk, defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk and winger Milan Lucic all signed with the Bruins. It's a homecoming for Lucic, who was a fan favorite during eight years in Boston (2007-15).\nWinger Vladimir Tarasenko didn't find the deal he wanted in free agency, changed agents and then inked a one-year contract with the Senators.\nAmong the players who avoided free agency by re-signing with their teams are two Golden Knights playoff heroes in forward Ivan Barbashev (five years) and goalie Adin Hill (two years); goalie Tristan Jarry, who signed a five-year deal to stay with the Penguins; defenseman Scott Mayfield (seven years), who remained with the Islanders; goalies Frederik Andersen (two years) and Antti Raanta (one year), who stayed with the Hurricanes; and defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov, who remained with the Kings on a two-year deal.\nOne name still available as the season begins: Patrick Kane, who split last season with the Blackhawks and Rangers before undergoing hip resurfacing surgery in the summer. He plans to play in 2023-24 and is waiting to see what the standings look like as the season progresses.\nMaple Leafs star Auston Matthews ended any speculation about his pending 2024 free agency by signing a four-year contract extension in August that gave him the highest annual average salary since the NHL instituted the cap: $13.25 million, topping the record Avalanche star Nathan MacKinnon set in 2022 ($12.6 million).\nOther significant contract extensions included Devils forwards Jesper Bratt (eight years, $7.875 million AAV) and Timo Meier (eight years, $8.8 million AAV); Ducks forwards Troy Terry (seven years, $7 million AAV) and Trevor Zegras (three years, $5.75 million AAV); Senators defenseman Jake Sanderson (eight years, $8.05 million AAV); Washington Capitals winger Tom Wilson (seven years, $6.5 million AAV); Red Wings winger Alex DeBrincat (four years, $7.875 million AAV); Hurricanes center Sebastian Aho (eight years, $9.75 million AAV); and Islanders goalie Ilya Sorokin (eight years, $8.25 million AAV).\nThe situation between Mike Babcock and the Columbus Blue Jackets presented an existential question for hockey fans: Is it really a coaching change if a new coach never actually makes it to training camp?\nBabcock was officially hired by the Blue Jackets in July on a two-year deal worth $4 million per season, to much fanfare from the team.\nHe had won a Stanley Cup with Detroit, two Olympic golds with Team Canada, and is 12th all-time with 700 wins. But after he was fired by the Maple Leafs in 2019, stories emerged about Babcock's mental abuse of players with the Red Wings and the Maple Leafs. His tactics would be under scrutiny as he returned to the NHL.\nOn the \"Spittin' Chiclets\" podcast in September, former NHL player and current TV analyst Paul Bissonnette claimed that Babcock asked Columbus captain Boone Jenner to show him his cellphone camera roll before displaying those photos via AirPlay on the coach's office wall.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nFormer NHL defenseman Mike Commodore, who played for Babcock and has been a long-standing critic of the coach, said he heard this behavior also occurred during Babcock's time coaching the Maple Leafs.\n\"It happened with a few other players in Columbus, too,\" Commodore said in a video posted to X. \"I don't want to use any names, but in particular [it involved] a young, very highly touted prospect.\"\nThese claims were enough to spark an NHLPA investigation of the situation, as new executive director Marty Walsh interviewed Blue Jackets players in Columbus. The NHLPA then presented its findings to the NHL, and the two entities informed the Blue Jackets. On Sept. 17, Babcock resigned as head coach of the Blue Jackets days before the start of training camp, with associate coach Pascal Vincent taking over as head coach.\n\"Upon reflection, it has become clear that continuing as head coach of the Columbus Blue Jackets was going to be too much of a distraction,\" Babcock said in a statement released by the team.\nBlue Jackets management took the blame for the debacle. \"We went through a process earlier this summer prior to hiring Mike Babcock as our head coach, but we got it wrong and that's on us,\" team president John Davidson said.\nIn other less contentious NHL coaching moves, the Capitals parted ways with Peter Laviolette, who quickly found a new gig coaching the Rangers after they fired Gerard Gallant. The Capitals hired 44-year-old Leafs assistant Spencer Carbery. The Predators hired Devils associate coach Andrew Brunette, who was a Jack Adams finalist in 2022 with Florida. Ryan Huska replaced Darryl Sutter in Calgary, while Greg Cronin took over for Dallas Eakins in Anaheim.\nThe NHL has three outdoor games scheduled for the 2023-24 season:\nThe Oilers and Flames play at Commonwealth Stadium, home of the CFL Edmonton Elks, in the Heritage Classic on Oct. 29.\nThe Kraken host the Golden Knights in the 2024 Winter Classic at T-Mobile Stadium, home the Seattle Mariners, on Jan. 1.\nMetLife Stadium -- which saw both a Taylor Swift concert and Taylor Swift, Chiefs fan, this year -- hosts another historic event in February 2024. The Devils will host the Flyers on Saturday, Feb. 17, in an outdoor night game. The Islanders will host the Rangers on Sunday, Feb. 18. The event will mark the first time four NHL teams have played outdoor games at the same venue in front of fans.\nThe 2024 NHL All-Star Weekend will be held on Feb. 2 and 3 at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto.\nThe 26-year-old Edmonton star set new career highs with 64 goals and 153 points in 82 games last season, winning the Hart Trophy as league MVP for the third time and the Pearson Award for NHLPA player of the year for a fourth time. His point total jumped by 30 and his goals by 20 year over year. No one's really sure what his ceiling is statistically.\nUnfortunately for McDavid and his superstar teammate Leon Draisaitl, the Oilers have had a ceiling in the playoffs. After losing in the conference finals last season, Edmonton fell to the Golden Knights in the second round this season. McDavid and Draisaitl have yet to play for a Stanley Cup since McDavid entered the league in 2015. Is this the year?\nWhile teams like the Avalanche, Golden Knights, Lightning, Penguins and Kings seek another championship after recently winning the Cup, other teams considered among the top contenders are seeking to end significant droughts.\nThe Hurricanes (2006), Devils (2003), Stars (1999), Rangers (1994) and Oilers (1990) all have gone well over a decade without hoisting hockey's grail, while teams like the Minnesota Wild and Panthers have never won the Cup.\nAnd then there are the Maple Leafs, seeking their first Stanley Cup win since 1967 -- a 55-season drought that's the longest in the NHL.\nFinally, Capitals star Alex Ovechkin continues his journey to break one of the most seemingly unbreakable records in sports: Wayne Gretzky's 894 career NHL goals.\nAfter tallying 42 goals in 2022-23, Ovechkin has 822 career goals at the start the season. That's 72 goals to tie and 73 goals to pass Gretzky. So while the record-breaking moment probably has to wait until at least next season, it'll be fun to see how close Ovechkin can position himself to it during 2023-24.\nUnless he decides to score 73 goals and be done with it. We're never one to underestimate Mr. Ovechkin as a goal scorer."}
{"title": "Why Lonzo Ball believes he'll play for the Chicago Bulls again", "date": "2023-10-06 13:38:59", "text": "Bulls guard Lonzo Ball talks about his rehab process and plans to play again despite a series of knee surgeries. (0:42)\nNASHVILLE -- A FEW WEEKS before the start of training camp, a Chicago Bulls executive flew to Los Angeles to check on Lonzo Ball.\nIt has been more than 20 months since Ball played in an NBA game, with three knee surgeries and a few devastating setbacks under his belt. And while what the executive observed from Ball as he completed his daily rehab process might have seemed mundane, it was notable.\nBall hasn't progressed to the point in his rehab where he has picked up a basketball, but the progress he has made, though small, gave the 2017 No. 2 overall pick the confidence to declare he will \"definitely\" play again.\n\"After the other surgeries, this one has definitely gone the best as far as [the] recovery process,\" Ball told ESPN outside the training room while the rest of the team began training camp in Nashville this week. \"The last two rehab processes I had, I was getting better and then it just hit a standstill and it started going down. And I haven't hit that yet.\"\nBall is finally getting through his rehab process -- starting on the training table, an intense stretching routine, followed by mobility and strength work -- without the lingering pain and discomfort that had plagued him since the start of 2022.\n\"Honestly, being out for as long as I've been out and all the injuries I have to deal with I think you just have to be positive,\" he said. \"First and foremost. If you lose your mind, you're going to lose the battle. So it always starts with being positive and hoping for the best.\"\nBall has been hoping for the best since Jan. 14, 2022, when he checked out of the fourth quarter of a blowout loss to the Golden State Warriors, the last time he saw action in an NBA game.\nIf and when Ball returns -- he has already been ruled out for the 2023-24 season, but is targeting a 2024-25 return -- he will have missed more than 1,000 days of action. Returning from such an absence to be a productive player is incredibly rare. Still, Ball, who will turn 26 later this month, isn't discouraged by the history or the long odds.\n\"It's motivation for me because there's been people that have been counted out,\" Ball said. \"For me, it's about getting back and doing what I want to do and love to do, which is play basketball.\"\nBALL HAS KNOWN he would play basketball professionally since at least the seventh grade.\nHis father, LaVar, made sure his three sons -- Lonzo, LiAngelo and LaMelo -- were always competing against older kids until the trio reached high school. Lonzo and LaMelo dominated high school basketball, going 35-0 at Chino Hills in 2016, winning a state title and ranking No. 1 in the nation.\nHowever, Lonzo Ball's first five NBA seasons (two with the Los Angles Lakers before being traded to the New Orleans Pelicans in 2019, then joining the Bulls via sign-and-trade in 2021) have been slowed by injuries. And while he had arthroscopic knee surgery before training camp in 2018, he has never before gone this long without playing basketball.\n\"That's been the hardest part, not being able physically to play,\" Ball said. \"It's hard for me to watch the games honestly because I know what I can do out there, and the fact that I literally can't help on the court, it's hard for me to deal with. ... But just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and knowing that if I keep getting better and putting the work in, I'll be able to play again.\"\n• Lowe: Five most intriguing players\n• Bontemps: Resetting East after big deals\n• Shelburne: The Harden-Morey feud\n• Pelton: Teams on way up and way down\n• Top second-year players to watch\n• Forecast: East | West | Champs\n• FAQ: In-season tournament | Rest rules\nBall still watches his share of basketball, especially games including his brothers (LaMelo stars for the Charlotte Hornets, and LiAngelo plays for their G League affiliate, the Greensboro Swarm), but for the most part, Ball has dealt with his time away from basketball internally, mostly leaning on his family and friends to stay grounded.\n\"He's had to go through this on his own a lot,\" Bulls guard Zach LaVine, who tore the ACL in his left knee in 2017, told ESPN. \"That's what injuries are. It's in between the ears. That's how you keep yourself going.\n\"As a friend and as a teammate, I just try to help him whenever he asks. He's a guy that doesn't ask for a lot. You can tell, he doesn't want to rely on other people.\"\nInstead, Ball has turned to hobbies off the court to fill the time basketball once occupied. He's playing video games for the first time -- some NBA 2K, but mostly Madden -- and is working on a documentary on his high school team that went 35-0. But mainly, he has started writing music again.\nBall released a few rap tracks earlier in his career and even competed on \"The Masked Singer,\" but he hadn't dropped any new music since 2020. Now, during his time away from basketball, he has found solace in music again, producing songs to fit the documentary.\n\"I like to write,\" he said. \"Whether it's in my notes, on my computer, on my iPad, I'm always writing something.\n\"It's just like a release. As far as music for sure. I get to just write about what's happened in my past and what I see with my own two eyes and just put it on paper. It helps me get stuff out.\"\nWHEN THE BULLS brought Ball in during the 2021 offseason to team up with LaVine and DeMar DeRozan, they envisioned a high-powered offense that would lead them to the top of the Eastern Conference. And for a brief moment, that's exactly what they got.\nChicago started the 2021-22 season 27-13 and led the East by a game over the Miami Heat when Ball last played. With him out of the lineup, they lost four of the next five games to drop out of first place, and slid all the way to sixth by the end of the season.\nBall first had surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee in 2022 with an initial return timeline of six to eight weeks. When his knee did not improve, he underwent a second surgery in September 2022 near the start of training camp.\nAfter an offseason of speculation, Damian Lillard was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in a blockbuster three-team deal that also sent 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton to Portland.\n• Woj: How trade got to finish line\n• Lowe: What Bucks look like with Dame\n• Pelton: Grades for Bucks, Blazers, Suns\n• Big questions after shocking deal\n• Rosters: Bucks | Blazers | Suns\nLast year, amid season-long uncertainty about whether Ball would be able to return, the Bulls battled just to reach the play-in tournament, where they fell to the eventual Eastern Conference champion Heat in the game for the eighth seed. In March, Ball underwent a cartilage transplant surgery on his left knee, which resulted in him being ruled out for all of 2023-24 as well.\n\"We all know how much we love and miss Lonzo,\" LaVine said. \"You can't replace a guy like that.\"\nAlthough the Bulls remain optimistic, sources said the organization is still unsure if Ball will ever play for them again, knowing he still has a long way to go in his rehab process. But his progress following this most recent surgery has given all parties involved reason for hope.\n\"It's good to see him in good spirits because it's never a good thing when you have somebody that's that talented and basketball is taken away from you,\" LaVine said. \"To see him working his way back, being around the team, seeing him in the weight room, seeing him on the court doing things, it's a sight for sore eyes.\"\nThe last two players to go more than 1,000 days between games are Emeka Okafor and Greg Oden, according to research by ESPN Stats & Information, and neither played even 30 games in the lone season they played after their returns.\nThe most optimistic comparison for Ball is perhaps Bill Walton, who was a two-time All-Star and NBA MVP by the time injuries forced him to miss three out of four seasons, including more than 900 days in a row at one point. Walton came back to play 245 games after missing all that time, including 80 games in 1985-86 (when he won Sixth Man of the Year honors), and played his final game at age 34.\nKlay Thompson missed two whole seasons because of knee and Achilles injuries before returning in 2021-22, then leading the NBA in 3-point field goals in 2022-23. Shaun Livingston suffered a devastating knee injury while playing for the LA Clippers in 2007, when he was 21 years old. He missed most of the next two seasons, but ended up playing 10 more seasons and winning three championships with the Warriors.\n\n\n• Sign up and play for free!\n• 10 tips to help you win your league\n• Sleepers, breakouts and busts\n• \"Do Draft\" list | \"Do Not Draft\" list\nThat's a level Ball, an All-Rookie second-team selection in 2017-18, believes he can get back to.\n\"For me, it's just putting the work in and letting the chips fall where they may,\" Ball said.\nIf Ball keeps improving without feeling discomfort, he plans to get back on a basketball court in January. Despite not being able to participate in basketball activities, he joined the team in Nashville and plans to split time rehabbing between Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\"Any step positive for him promotes a better outlook,\" DeRozan told ESPN. \"He's been the most positive a person can be through this whole process of taking away something he was so great at for these last couple years. ... Even the other day on the team plane, you realized how much we even missed him: being the DJ, playing cards, laughing, joking, talking s---. You miss that. Just to see him in rare form like that means a lot.\"\nAnd while it might come as a surprise, maintaining that positive outlook, even in the face of such an extended absence, has come naturally to Ball.\n\"That maybe sounds hard, but for me at the end of the day, I know that I'm still very blessed and I'm still better off than a lot of people in the world,\" he said. \"I can't complain about the injuries that I've had. I still have a great life. A lot of my family is healthy. Besides basketball, there's no real struggles in my life and I'm just blessed for that.\""}
{"title": "Lowe: Why the Rockets' Jalen Green might be the most important swing player in the NBA", "date": "2023-10-06 13:38:59", "text": "AS COACHES AND players trudged into the locker room at halftime of what would become yet another dispiriting loss -- one of 62 for the 2021-22 Houston Rockets, a team built to lose in its first full season since the end of the James Harden era -- they heard an unusual voice command attention.\n\"You're supposed to lead by example,\" Jalen Green, then a 19-year-old rookie and No. 2 overall draft pick, chastised one of the few veterans on the team -- a player Green and others present won't identify today. Other players and coaches had noticed that veteran playing with a halfhearted selfishness. Only Green spoke up. \"We need you to be better,\" Green continued. \"You're supposed to show us how to do this.\"\nGreen was calm and measured, witnesses recall.\n\"He did it from a place of, 'I'm seeking knowledge,'\" John Lucas, the longtime Rockets assistant coach who now works in the front office, told ESPN. \"It made Jalen a leader among the younger guys.\"\nThere was no retort, no heated back-and-forth. \"The truth has no feelings,\" Lucas said.\n\"It was about showing everyone needs to be held accountable,\" Green told ESPN.\nEighteen months later, Green is the highest draft pick and headliner of one of the NBA's deepest pools of young talent -- the product of three straight losing seasons in which the Rockets won just 59 combined games and prioritized their own first-round picks.\nIn Green, Alperen Sengun, Jabari Smith Jr., Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, and Cam Whitmore, Houston has six high-wattage prospects -- including three top-four picks in Thompson, Smith, and Green. The Rockets have surrounded them with veterans in Fred VanVleet, Dillon Brooks, Jeff Green, and Jock Landale. (They nearly snagged Brook Lopez from the Milwaukee Bucks, sources said.)\nThe veterans are around to teach habits and help the Rockets win more; Houston owes its 2024 first-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder, protected for the top four draft slots -- the first of two painful debts stemming from the Daryl Morey regime's ill-fated 2019 swap of Chris Paul for Russell Westbrook in a desperate bid to placate Harden. By the cold reality of incentives, the losing has to stop.\nMeanwhile, Houston's front office already has to look years ahead: Is it even possible to pay all six of those young guys second contracts under this new collective bargaining agreement -- even with restricted free agency still a powerful cudgel?\nIf none of those players becomes a No. 1-level superstar, can the Rockets -- loaded with picks and prospects -- win the trade wars for one, and still have enough talent leftover? Or does the talent fit so well as to compensate for the lack of that amorphous \"best player on a title team\" -- becoming (one day) one of those greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts contenders? What Green remains a low-percentage shooter who doesn't bring enough outside of points? What if the whole thing fizzles?\nRight now, Green probably represents their best chance at that superstar -- the apex ball handler. He has internal competition. Thompson has star potential. Smith surged last season, blew up in summer league, and seems poised for another leap in Year 2 on both ends. Sengun could be an All-Star-level producer on offense as soon as this season -- in part because of his promising two-man game with Green -- though Sengun has to reach a passable level on defense.\nBut Green has tantalizing scoring tools and a willingness, he and his coaches say, to lean into more of a playmaking role and to give more effort on defense. In Year 3, he now has to live the message he delivered to that would-be veteran mentor: play unselfishly, play hard, play defense -- always.\nVanVleet is the new point guard, but the Rockets still want the ball in Green's hands. (The Rockets have banished Kevin Porter Jr. from the team as he faces domestic violence charges. The basketball impact -- way down the list of what matters in the Porter case -- is that Green and the rest of Houston's young core will have more opportunities to handle the ball.)\nVanVleet's ability to work off the ball is one reason Houston's decision-makers, including new head coach Ime Udoka, preferred VanVleet over a free agency reunion with Harden.\n\"Nothing against James,\" Udoka told ESPN, \"but Fred is just a better fit. I coached James in Brooklyn. He's one of the smartest players I've ever been around. The words 'Ime doesn't want James' never came out of my mouth. It was, 'Let's look at the best fit.' If we want Jalen and the young guys to take the next steps, we need them to have the ball. As for me saying I don't want James, that was never the case. It was about fit.\"\nIt is on Green to pay off that faith by digging deeper into nonscoring aspects of the game.\n\"This is a huge year for him,\" Rafael Stone, the Rockets general manager, told ESPN. \"It's on him to really put together all the things he's worked on. You see individual games where he's locked in -- whether it's on-ball defense, help-side defense, making the right reads in the pick-and-roll. And then there are other games where he just kind of let go of the rope. He's a bucket. It's about all the little things.\"\nA lot of young lottery picks chase points. For some players and their agents, points are the best vehicle to that first big payday. But Houston's coaches are unanimous that Green can become more well-rounded in a season where winning has suddenly become a priority. And where Green ends up in three, four, five years along an unusually wide possibility of outcomes could make or break this new Houston experiment.\n\"He's growing into a pro,\" said Lucas, who worked closely with Green during his rookie season, tweaking Green's jumper and quickening the release. \"His savvy is coming. He's an absolute delight to work with.\"\nGreen said he's ready.\n\"I can contribute to winning,\" he told ESPN. \"I'm an all-around player.\"\nGREEN'S COMBINATION OF speed, burst, and leaping ability is rare even among players toward the top of the draft. During his 1-on-0 pre-draft workout with the Rockets, Green lost the ball on the way up during a layup drill, reached out in midair to snare it, and dunked with power. \"It was like, 'Holy s---, I haven't seen that one before,'\" Stone recalled. \"His athleticism popped. He has one of the highest ceilings of any player that has been drafted recently, and we are in the business of drafting for upside.\"\nOne executive from another team drafting around Green's range told his front office that Green could lead the league in scoring one day.\n\"I have never coached anyone like him,\" Brad Roznovsky, who coached Green for three years at San Joaquin Memorial High School in Fresno, California, told ESPN. \"And I never will again.\"\nAt age 20 on a rebuilding Rockets team -- facing elite defenders almost every game -- Green averaged 22 points and almost four assists. He knifed his way to six free throws per game. Some high-usage ball handlers never average that many free throws. Green was inefficient, but he is on a clear All-Star trajectory.\nAfter an offseason of speculation, Damian Lillard was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in a blockbuster three-team deal that also sent 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton to Portland.\n• Woj: How trade got to finish line\n• Lowe: What Bucks look like with Dame\n• Pelton: Grades for Bucks, Blazers, Suns\n• Big questions after shocking deal\n• Rosters: Bucks | Blazers | Suns\nRival executives often project his potential peak as similar to those of Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine, and some statistical models suggest those as decent comparisons. They are also close to Green's height (6-foot-4), a tick shorter than the big wing ball-handlers who often rule the league.\nBeal and LaVine have made five combined All-Star teams, and that number should jump. Beal made one All-NBA team. Those are objectively good outcomes, even for a much-hyped No. 2 pick with Green's scoring chops.\nBut neither has ever been the No. 1 option on a dangerous postseason team. Beal is now the third option on a contender in the Phoenix Suns. LaVine's Chicago Bulls have flatlined in mediocrity. The Rockets aren't putting any ceiling on Green yet, and they shouldn't.\nStill, there is an enormous gap between where Green is now and All-Star-level efficiency. Green shot 41.6% last season -- 33.8% on 3s, 47.1% on 2s. He converted just 55% at the rim.\nThere is low-hanging fruit to pluck. Green chucks up a lot of low-chance jumpers early in the clock when one pass or dribble would keep the offense chugging toward something better.\nGreen has taken (by a hair) more pull-up 3s than catch-and-shoot treys in his career, per NBA.com. He's capable of hitting those shots, but too many come early in possessions. Some are off-balance, over multiple defenders.\n\"There were just too many possessions where he took poor shots with three guys on him,\" Udoka said.\nAlmost one-third of Green's shots in 2022-23 were midrangers, a ton by the standards of the analytics-heavy Rockets. The team is fine with those looks late in the shot clock. They know elite defenses sometimes snuff everything else. Green hit 42% on long 2s last season, and has a knack for stopping on a dime, rising into the clouds, and generating clean on-balance looks. With more judiciousness, that percentage could climb into the high-40s.\nBut the team would like Green to bag contested pull-up 2s that come with time left to explore.\n\"What's important for Jalen is making sure he takes virtually none of those,\" Stone said. \"If that shot [a long 2] is contested, there has to be a better shot for someone else.\"\nOn some of those plays, the right pass is in front of him:\nWatch Sengun roll free then turn his palms to the sky in exasperation after Green jacks a long 2 with 12 seconds on the shot clock instead of threading the pocket pass.\nWhat's both encouraging and frustrating is that Green has those passes in his bag. When trapped, Green is happy to slip the ball to an open teammate immediately.\nThere are plenty of instances of Green making the basic pocket pass as soon as it opens:\nThen just a minute later -- as in that game against the Bulls -- Green might ignore that identical pocket pass in favor of a wayward drive, or toss it too late:\nGreen attempted shots on about 47% of his pick-and-rolls that resulted in the end of possessions -- 43rd among 174 ball handlers who ran at least 200 such plays, per Second Spectrum. Green dished assists on only 9.8% of those actions -- 163rd among that 174-player sample.\nGreen is determined to find a better pass-or-shoot balance.\n\"It's simple reads,\" Green said. \"The pocket pass to Alpie [Sengun], or if the low man helps over, hitting that shooter in the corner.\"\nGREEN SPENT MUCH of the summer in Los Angeles, training with a personal coach -- Adam Harrington, a former assistant for both the Thunder and the Nets -- and participating in 5-on-5 runs with Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and other NBA stars. Udoka watched a lot of those pickup games, including one in which Green and Smith were on the same team -- facing a squad that included both Durant and Booker.\n\"In my mind, it was Houston against Phoenix,\" Udoka said. He saw progress in Green's passing.\n\"He has the ability to make the right play,\" Udoka continued. \"You don't always see it on a young team where it's your turn, my turn, and guys are taking poor shots at times. But when the level of talent is raised around him, he makes the right reads. Now there are no excuses. I've seen you do it.\"\nObserving those pickup games, Udoka would sometimes shout for Green to set a flare screen or cut to the rim. Green has flashed some instincts to cut back door when Sengun -- a clever passer -- has the ball at the elbow. Those plays hint at a decent feel -- something that should translate to passing.\n• Lowe: Five most intriguing players\n• Bontemps: Resetting East after big deals\n• Shelburne: The Harden-Morey feud\n• Pelton: Teams on way up and way down\n• Top second-year players to watch\n• Forecast: East | West | Champs\n• FAQ: In-season tournament | Rest rules\nBut they were mere flashes. Houston's offense last season was stagnant. Porter and Green pounded the air out of the ball. On some possessions, they had to wait several seconds before a Houston big man realized he should run up to set a screen. There was no structure, no pace. Spacing was cluttered.\n\"There was a lot of standing around,\" Udoka said.\nLike a lot of young guards, Green sometimes dribbled around the arc without purpose -- bobbing and weaving in the general area of picks without going anywhere. He sometimes rushed through moves, zooming forward before really executing them -- before giving defenders a chance to take the bait.\nVanVleet should loosen spacing and allow Green to attack more off the catch -- with the floor in motion. \"We want to use him more off the ball,\" Udoka said of Green. \"We want him coming off screens and slashing. I don't know if it's natural for him, but you've seen glimpses.\"\nSpacing remains a challenge. Defenses will ignore both Brooks and Eason on the perimeter until they prove themselves as shooters; against certain Houston lineups, defenses had centers guard Eason and hang near the paint. (Eason, by the way, has a chance to be a really good two-way player. He seems to have magnets in his hands, sucking up steals and rebounds that appear out of reach. The Rockets are optimistic he can do more with the ball on offense.) With Sengun and Landale, it might be hard for Udoka to get to lineups in which Smith plays small-ball center.\nGreen oozes ballhandling craft that he is just starting to harness. He can lull defenders to sleep with languid hesitation dribbles toward picks, and then dust them by darting away from those screens. He works nasty in-and-out dribbles with either hand:\nGreen is slim, but at 6-foot-4 with his speed and leaping ability, he could develop a Westbrook-esque style of turbocharged drives through smaller point guard defenders:\nGreen can get to the rim almost at will. His approach and judgment once there has been addled. Green has a habit of flying at rim protectors without a plan and throwing up wild, flailing hope shots.\n\"You have to know where your dump-offs are,\" Udoka said. \"Jalen is used to being able to finish over anyone, but if you get separation and Joel Embiid is sitting in the paint, you can take the midranger instead of attacking him.\"\nIN OFFSEASON WORKOUTS, Harrington slowed everything down and had Green walk through the final two or three steps of every typical action over and over: planting to catch the ball running off a pick; rising for a contested layup; leaping for a pull-up 3; loading off one foot to take a Ray Allen-style leaning jumper.\n\"It was about balance,\" Green said. Harrington wanted Green to feel what each foot should be doing -- to download the body mechanics so that he is comfortable, strong, and poised in every situation.\nThat could lead to more plays where it all comes together:\nThere are not many 20-year-olds who can work all those skills -- all those changes of direction and cadence -- into one pick-and-roll. Green slithers to his right around that Sengun screen then slows down to pin his defender on his hip -- waiting for Sengun to find space. Green veers left, then back right -- finally getting Xavier Tillman to commit and unlocking that hook pass.\nGreen spent a lot of time in L.A. around Durant, watching him work and listening to Durant's advice. Durant told Green that every practice and drill should mimic game intensity.\n\"That's what stuck with me -- to really make everything game-like,\" Green said.\nThe harder work comes on defense. Green has been a pretty glaring minus on that end. Bigger opponents have bullied him, and Green has gotten lost now and then in rotation.\nBut Green can become at least an average defender. He has good length, and he seems to care. His lean frame has its advantages. Harrington developed a mantra for him: Avoid every screen.\n\"We've argued a lot,\" Lucas said about Green when the subject turned to defense. \"Jalen can guard when he wants to. He just hasn't been required to yet.\"\n(Lucas loves needling Green to get under his skin and motivate him. He sometimes asks Green where he was selected in the draft. When Green replies that he was the second pick, Lucas -- the top pick in 1976 -- boasts that he might have already been at the after party or even asleep by the time the second pick rolled around in his draft. \"He gets so mad,\" Lucas said, laughing. When Lucas finds out Green admires an opposing player -- De'Aaron Fox and Anthony Edwards, as examples -- he tells Green that if he is such a fan, Lucas can walk to the opponent locker room and ask for a pair of signed shoes.)Top stories of the week from Get exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\n\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nDefense is not optional under Udoka. \"Defense is more of a mentality,\" the coach said. \"He will be challenged a lot more.\"\nUdoka spares no one in film sessions. \"You'll get called out if you are the weak link,\" Udoka said. \"I'll call him out in front of the whole team. I'm equal opportunity in that.\"\nIt is almost impossible to overstate the mental and physical burden of being a true NBA superstar. Entire defenses are designed to stop you. They change schemes several times within quarters, trying to get in your head. Every possession involves a half-dozen small decisions, all made under pressure. You have to at least execute on defense. And you have to do it 82 times -- and then 10 or 15 or 20 more times in the postseason, when the talent is better, the coaching is more targeted, and everything is done with more urgency.\nLucas is confident. \"In another year, he will really be a professional,\" Lucas said of Green. \"Next season [2024-25], he is going to take off like Ja Morant and Devin Booker.\"\nEven optimists know how much distance lies between where Green is now and where those guys -- and Beal, even LaVine -- have reached. Perhaps it's best to approach this season with smaller goals.\n\"I want to be better for my teammates,\" Green said. \"I'm always going to be able to score. Now, it's more about contributing to my team in other ways.\""}
{"title": "This collision course was no accident: Aces and Liberty", "date": "2023-10-06 13:38:08", "text": "Monica McNutt previews the WNBA Finals between the Liberty and Aces with a comic-book style spin. (2:46)\nWhispers of the return of WNBA superteams started in late January as the 2023 free agency period opened.\nOn Jan. 28, the first domino fell. Unrestricted free agent Candace Parker announced she was headed to the Las Vegas Aces. The defending champion already was returning all of its starters from the 2022 title team -- including A'ja Wilson -- and now was adding a two-time MVP.\nOn Feb. 1, when players could officially sign contracts and offer sheets, the New York Liberty locked in Breanna Stewart in the biggest move in WNBA free agent history. Just 24 hours later, the Liberty added point guard Courtney Vandersloot. Those moves, after trading for 2021 MVP Jonquel Jones two weeks earlier, sparked immediate superteam talk.\nWith months to go before the season opened, many experts penciled in the Aces and Liberty for a WNBA Finals matchup.\nBut there were questions: How quickly would the Liberty get all the pieces put together? Could the Aces book a return trip to the championship series? The answers have been answered emphatically. After months of talk of superteams and destiny, the 2023 WNBA Finals matchup many envisioned tips off Sunday (3 p.m. ET, ABC/ESPN App).\nThe series has the potential to be epic. The Finals will feature a trio of former MVPs, five former No. 1 draft picks and two of the best point guards in the world.\nAnd now, after the longest season in league history (the WNBA expanded its regular season to 40 games this summer), the question is whether the Aces will become the first team to win back-to-back championships since the Los Angeles Sparks in 2001-02, or whether the Liberty -- the last remaining original franchise yet to win a title -- will finally get their first?\nESPN looks at how the teams match up.\n😮‍💨 these are tuff @_ajawilson22 #RaiseTheStakes pic.twitter.com/hXUo6IYFgT\nA'ja Wilson, F/C: The Aces' centerpiece since arriving in Las Vegas with the No. 1 overall draft pick in 2018, she's already a two-time MVP (and almost won her third this season) and the WNBA Defensive Player of the Year for two years running. Indisputably one of the best players in the world, she has been unstoppable in the postseason, last month becoming the first player to score at least 30 points in three consecutive playoff games. She's averaging 25.8 points, 11.2 rebounds and 3.2 blocks and shooting 59.5% in the playoffs.\nChelsea Gray, PG: Don't be fooled by Gray's draft slot; she has two titles on her resume and is known as the Point Gawd. After a knee injury cut short her senior season at Duke, she was picked 11th overall in the 2014 draft. She sat out 2014 and played just 16 MPG in 2015 for Connecticut. Gray was then traded and was a reserve on the Sparks' 2016 title team (she had a huge performance in Game 5 of the WNBA Finals). A regular starter since 2017 (when she helped lead L.A. back to the Finals), Gray signed with the Aces as a free agent in 2021. She was WNBA Finals MVP last season, when she averaged 21.7 points and 7.0 assists in the postseason.\nKelsey Plum, G: The San Antonio Stars selected Plum, the all-time NCAA Division I scoring leader, with the No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft. She has been with the team ever since, most recently signing a two-year extension in 2022. After suffering a torn Achilles and missing the 2020 season, Plum has been better than ever, with her scoring jumping more than six points per game in 2021 over her 2019 averages. She was Sixth Player of the Year in 2021 and averaged a career-best 20.2 points during the Aces' title run last season.\nJackie Young, G: ESPN's Michael Voepel wrote last month that the Aces have one of the best guard trios in WNBA history, and Young completes the puzzle. The No. 1 overall pick in 2019, Young was moved to point guard early in her WNBA career, but has flourished as a 2/wing alongside Gray. After hitting 22 total 3-pointers over her first three seasons, Young made 50 in the 2022 regular season -- when she was named the league's Most Improved Player -- and 89 in 2023. A 25% 3-point shooter in 2021, she hit 44.9% of her treys in 2023.\nKiah Stokes, C/F: Drafted by New York late in the first round of the 2015 draft, Stokes played for the Liberty for six seasons. When they waived her in July 2021, the Aces signed Stokes and she played in all 10 of their 2022 playoff games. She's averaging just 2.8 points in the postseason, but she is a perfect complement to Wilson and smartly picks her spots. And Stokes' numbers are up across the board in the playoffs, where she's averaging 27.9 minutes (vs. 19.8 in the regular season), 8.6 rebounds (vs. 5.9), 1.4 steals (vs. 0.7) and shooting 54.5% from the field (vs. 43.4%).\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE BENCH\nBad news: There isn't much of one beyond Alysha Clark. Good news: Clark was the No. 1 option off the bench this season. The 2023 Sixth Player of the Year is a relentless defender and two-time champion (she started every game of the Seattle Storm's 2018 and 2020 title runs). Over five playoff games, Clark is averaging 8.0 points, 4.0 rebounds and 20.9 minutes.\nParker (9.0 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 3.7 APG, 23.6 MPG) has been out since before the All-Star Game, after surgery for a left-foot fracture, and isn't expected to play. Riquna Williams, a key part of the Aces' 2022 championship, hasn't played for the team this season. Sidelined early with a back injury, Williams was then barred from the team following a July arrest on domestic violence charges. The charges were later dropped.\nAnd then there were two teams left standing 🏆The 2023 #WNBAFinals presented by @YouTubeTV tip-off Sunday October 8th at 3pm/ET where the top seeded @LVAces will host the @nyliberty in Game 1 Tune in on ABC pic.twitter.com/7v8HIoa1iv\nBreanna Stewart, F: She simply wins wherever she goes. Four NCAA titles at UConn. Two championships in her first five WNBA seasons. So, can Stewart -- who won this season's MVP (23.0 PPG, 9.3 RPG, 3.8 APG, 1.6 BPG, 1.5 SPG, 46.5% shooting in the regular season) in the closest three-player race ever -- lead the Liberty to new heights after making the biggest move in free agency history? The No. 1 draft pick in 2016, Stewart personifies today's positionless basketball. Like Parker before her, Stewart can do it all, whether it's bring the ball downcourt, defend with a ridiculous wing span, hit the 3 or drive inside. Keep an eye on her shooting; she struggled in the first round and semifinals.\nJonquel Jones, F/C: The Liberty's superteam status wouldn't be complete without Jones' request for a trade from the Connecticut Sun. She was hampered by injury early in the season, but that has all changed since the All-Star break. She has had a double-double in every postseason game and is averaging 16.5 points and a league-leading 12.8 rebounds in the playoffs. As ESPN's Alexa Philippou wrote last month, Jones might be the X factor in New York winning its first title.\nSabrina Ionescu, G: This is the player the Liberty envisioned when they drafted the NCAA's all-time leader in triple-doubles No. 1 overall in 2020. Last summer, Ionescu became the first player in WNBA history to tally 500 points, 200 rebounds and 200 assists in a single season, and she's even more consistent in 2023. New York's leading scorer in three of its five matchups with Las Vegas this season, Ionescu can change the game with her 3-point shooting and ability to hit clutch shots in big moments. After COVID canceled the 2020 NCAA tournament -- where Oregon would have been a No. 1 seed and among the favorites -- is this the year Ionescu wins the 'ship?\nCourtney Vandersloot, PG: One of the game's premier passers, Vandersloot has plenty of options around her in New York and led the league in assists for the seventh time in her career with 8.1 per game in the regular season. Vandersloot, who like Stewart in February signed for well below the maximum salary available so the Liberty could have room for others on the roster, knows how to navigate a team to a championship; in 2021, she and Parker teamed to bring the Chicago Sky their first. Jones, Stewart and Vandersloot -- among other WNBA stars -- combined to help Russian club team UMMC Ekaterinburg win a crown a couple of years ago. Now can they do it in the WNBA?\nBetnijah Laney, G/F: Cut by the Indiana Fever after she'd already packed for the bubble season in 2020, Laney persevered, ultimately playing for Atlanta that season and tripling her scoring average to earn Most Improved Player honors. In the 2020 offseason, the free agent and former second-round draft pick then signed a reported three-year contract with the Liberty. As pointed out by Philippou, Laney has scored at least 19 points in all five of New York's postseason wins after averaging 12.8 points in the regular season. She's also hitting 43.8% of her 3-pointers after shooting 39.2% beyond in the arc in the regular season.\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE BENCH\nEvery bench gets shorter in the postseason, but one of the biggest surprises with the Liberty is how much they've relied on their starters, all of whom played at least 37 minutes in the decisive Game 4 of the semifinals.\nThroughout the playoffs, the Liberty also have gotten 93.7% of their points from starters, per ESPN Stats & Information, which is on pace to be the fourth-highest rate in a postseason in WNBA history (minimum two games). That said, guard Marine Johannes (7.1 PPG in the regular season), forward Kayla Thornton and center Stefanie Dolson -- who was also on Chicago's 2021 title team -- have all made contributions throughout the season and made sure depth was among New York's strengths.\nThe @nyliberty are your 2023 WNBA Commissioner's Cup Champions presented by @coinbase 👏They defeated the Aces, 82-63 to take the crown for the first time in franchise history ‼️ pic.twitter.com/c6V8UXeBev\nThe Aces and Liberty met five times before the WNBA Finals:\nJune 29: at Aces 98, Liberty 81 -- The game marked the seventh consecutive win for the Aces. All five of the Las Vegas starters scored in double figures, with A'ja Wilson putting in 16 while Jackie Young and Candace Parker each added 15. Chelsea Gray had 14 points and six assists, including a few highlight-reel ones. \"They were a well-oiled machine today,\" Liberty coach Sandy Brondello said. \"We got to be more disruptive. There are areas we can look at where we can get better.\" Breanna Stewart scored 16 points and Jonquel Jones added 13 for the Liberty.\nAug. 6: at Liberty 91, Aces 61 -- Sabrina Ionescu scored 31 points, hitting six of New York's 17 3-pointers, and the Liberty held the Aces to nine points in the third quarter. \"I think the statement we made was we're a team that plays hard and when we lock in and are all on the same page defensively and offensively it's hard to stop,\" said Stewart, who added 18 of her 23 points in the second half.\nAug. 15: Liberty 82, at Aces 63 (Commissioner's Cup final) -- The Liberty are one of the WNBA's original franchises and have played for the league title four times. But they had never won hardware -- until now. \"That's why you play. You play to win,\" Stewart said. \"To be able to take advantage of these opportunities. ... You have this one game for the trophy and the money. The ability for us to lock in and see what we had right now in August is something I'm really proud of.\" Marine Johannes scored 17 points and Jones had 16 points and 15 rebounds for the Liberty.\nAug. 17: at Aces 88, Liberty 75 -- Gray had 22 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists for her second career triple-double and the Aces got their 21st straight home victory. Wilson added 21 points, Kelsey Plum had 18 points and Young finished with 16 for Las Vegas. Ionescu hit six 3-pointers and scored 22 points for New York and Stewart finished with an uncharacteristic 13 points on 3-of-15 shooting.\nAug. 28: at Liberty 94, Aces 85 -- Ionescu scored 25 points and Stewart added 20 points, 12 rebounds and 7 assists to help the Liberty beat the Aces in the final regular-season meeting between the teams. ″[We're] making sure that we're all aware that every moment matters,\" Stewart said. \"We have to make sure we don't miss opportunities ... it's the experience, it's having been in these big moments in playoff-type situations, and continuing to build off that.\"\nBecky Hammon and Sandy Brondello have their teams atop the league this season 👏 Who do you have winning the WNBA Finals? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/n4gF17brLS\nFor the first time, former WNBA players will meet in the Finals as coaches. Las Vegas' Becky Hammon made history a year ago when she became the first to win a title in her debut season as a head coach.\nFor New York, coach Sandy Brondello also has one title; her Phoenix Mercury won in 2014, and she led the team to the 2021 Finals -- only to be let go months later in early December. But within weeks, the Liberty had hired her, and less than two years later, her team is in the Finals.\nBrondello and Hammon have often been on opposite sides, but once upon a time Hammon played for Brondello in San Antonio -- which is where the Aces' franchise gets its roots.\nThe Aces are actually one of the league's original eight franchises. They started as the Utah Starzz in 1997, then relocated to San Antonio in 2002, where the team played until it relocated to Las Vegas before the 2018 season.\nAnd lastly, Hammon's playing career started in New York, and she was on the last Liberty team to reach the Finals, in 2002.\nAja Wilson is headed back to the WNBA finals and these are the vibes🤌🏼🥰 pic.twitter.com/qBFkEpCmMS\nThese two teams have been on a collision course since the Liberty made a few huge moves in the offseason to create a superteam stacked enough to compete with the reigning champion Aces.

All the reporters on our panel predicted the series to go at least four games, but they were split on which team would raise the trophy later this month."}
{"title": "WNBA trendsetters: Why Hammon, Brondello are just the start of former players as Finals coaches", "date": "2023-10-06 13:38:27", "text": "Monica McNutt previews the WNBA Finals between the Liberty and Aces with a comic-book style spin. (2:46)\nWhen the Las Vegas Aces and New York Liberty tip off the WNBA Finals on Sunday (3 p.m. ET, ABC/ESPN App), the coaching matchup between Becky Hammon and Sandy Brondello will be 26 years in the making.\nAlthough former WNBA players have coached teams to the Finals before, this is the first time in league history two of them will square off against each other in the championship series.\nAlong with Coach of the Year Stephanie White, whose Connecticut Sun lost to Brondello's Liberty in the semifinals, the success Brondello and Hammon are enjoying coaching the WNBA's highest-profile teams is reflective of the league embracing former players as coaches. After never  having more than three head-coaching spots held by former players, they've made up half of the league's 12 jobs in each of the past two seasons.\nWith the WNBA's diversity coaching initiative dramatically increasing the number of assistant coaches with playing experience in the league, Brondello and Hammon might be the first former players to square off in the Finals. They won't be the last.\n\"Since 2019,\" WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said, \"we have tripled the number of former players who are head coaches and significantly increased those in the assistant coaching ranks.\"\nBRONDELLO AND HAMMON -- who have both already won WNBA titles as coaches, Brondello with the Phoenix Mercury in 2014 and Hammon last season with Las Vegas -- previously saw their careers overlap in San Antonio. Brondello was an assistant during Hammon's first three years with the Silver Stars, and then her head coach in 2010. The same person brought both of them to San Antonio: longtime WNBA head coach Dan Hughes, an advocate for former players on the sidelines.\nStarting with his first full-time coaching job in 2000 with the Cleveland Rockers, Hughes had a former WNBA player on every one of his staffs.\n\"I knew I wanted to be a basketball coach, but I also knew that I wanted my staffs to be diverse,\" Hughes told ESPN. \"I wanted them to be different than me. That was always important to me. So I needed somebody who came in as a player and then became a coach. I always needed that. I needed that kind of mentality as part of the brain trust that I was trying to create to make good decisions.\"\nWhen Hughes joined the Silver Stars in 2005 after the Rockers folded, he received a cold call from Brondello while driving to scout a UConn-Notre Dame matchup. She informed Hughes she was retiring after a lengthy playing career in both her native Australia and the WNBA, and wanted to become a coach. Although Hughes had no prior relationship with Brondello besides coaching against her, he immediately saw her as the right fit.\n\"I did everything but hire her that moment,\" Hughes recalled. \"It was just perfect. That's exactly what I wanted ...\n\"Just the way she played the game and thought the game, I thought she would make a great coach.\"\nWith Hammon, a consummate leader during her 16-season WNBA career, the question for Hughes was never whether she could coach but whether she would choose to do so rather than pursue a career in media or outside basketball.\nIn 2013, Hammon suffered an ACL tear in her first game and spent the remainder of the season watching from the sidelines. She told Hughes at season's end she wanted to coach and asked whether he could help connect her with the NBA's San Antonio Spurs and the coach who would go on to be the winningest in league history.\n\"I went over the next day to Gregg Popovich,\" Hughes said. \"They were in the gym, him and [Spurs CEO] R.C. Buford. I said, 'How do you feel about Becky coming over?' 'Oh, we'd love to have her.' Pop said, 'Give her my phone number and give me a call.' That's kind of how that went down.\"\nAfter spending the 2013-14 season shadowing the Spurs coaching staff while rehabilitating her injury, Hammon was hired by the Spurs in 2014 as the first full-time, paid female assistant coach in the NBA upon her retirement from playing.\nHammon's journey led back to the WNBA before last season. After interviewing for NBA head-coaching jobs, Hammon chose to leave the San Antonio bench to become head coach of the Aces, who won the 2022 title and are now looking to become the first repeat WNBA champion since the Los Angeles Sparks in 2001 and 2002.\nSitting on the bench alongside Brondello, Hughes remembers feeling what he calls an \"unspoken understanding of the game\" shared with Hammon on the court.\n\"Becky and Sandy both have incredible offensive minds,\" Hughes said. \"I like putting people like that around me, to be honest with you, because I come at it defensively. That's my starting point. Players, a lot of times, are like that. There were times -- and Becky wouldn't necessarily have been privy to some of these, because she was on the floor -- Sandy would interpret what Becky was going to do to me on the bench before Becky did it.\"\nBecky Hammon's Las Vegas Aces and Sandy Brondello's New York Liberty dominated opponents and statistics in 2023. In the regular season, the teams ranked 1-2 in several categories. -- ESPN Stats & Information\nHughes, who retired from the WNBA in 2021 ranked fifth all time in coaching wins, texted with both coaches after they advanced to the Finals. He's hoping to attend Game 3 in New York, but will be torn, knowing how both coaches might feel at series' end.\n\"Mostly I'm excited for both these coaches,\" Hughes said, \"but I know the reality that one of them is going to attain an incredible moment and another one is going to have a pretty incredible loss.\"\nINEVITABLY, THE WNBA needed time to build up enough longevity for former players to go into the coaching ranks. Though a pair of superstar players retired and were immediately made head coaches in the league's early days -- with Nancy Lieberman taking over the expansion Detroit Shock in the WNBA's second season (1998) and Cynthia Cooper-Dyke coaching the Phoenix Mercury in 2001 after winning Finals MVP in each of the league's first four years -- they were outliers.\nIt wasn't until 2009, the WNBA's 13th year of existence, that former players coached against each other in a regular-season game when Jenny Boucek's Sacramento Monarchs faced Jennifer Gillom's Minnesota Lynx.\nWhen WNBA teams sought professional playing experience in the league's first decade, they often turned instead to former NBA players. Five of the league's 13 coaches to start the 2004 campaign were NBA veterans after Bill Laimbeer's Detroit Shock beat Michael Cooper's Los Angeles Sparks in the 2003 Finals.\nAs the WNBA has matured, more players, like Brondello and Hammon, have had opportunities to play full careers before moving to the sidelines, first as assistants (Hammon getting that experience in the NBA) and later as head coaches. In 2015, Brondello and White were joined by Boucek to give the WNBA a record three former players on the sidelines.\nBy 2020, however, that trend seemed to be heading the wrong direction. After Katie Smith was fired by New York, Brondello was left as the league's only former player serving as head coach. At that point, as the NBA was also seeing decreasing numbers of head coaches with playing experience, the WNBA made a subtle but important rules change.\nAs reported in March 2020 by Erica Ayala at The Athletic, the league increased the limit on assistant coaches from two to three for teams that have at least one former WNBA player as either an assistant or head coach.\nBecause teams would prefer to have larger coaching staffs, they quickly responded by hiring more former WNBA players. In 2019, seven of the league's 12 teams had a former player on staff. By 2021, that was 11 of 12, and this year, for the first time, every team has one. The total number of assistant coaches with playing experience has skyrocketed from nine in 2019 to 22 this season.\n\"This is about a pipeline of your future leaders so that the next time we have a coaching role or a general manager role or a team president role, that you have a very diverse pool to pick from,\" Engelbert said in 2021. \"So that's what our diversity initiatives are working on -- building experience, building capability so the next person up will get a job when there's an opening. You have to do that sometimes three years before the opening comes for that person to be ready now.\"\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nWhen Hughes retired, former player Noelle Quinn was elevated to replace him with the Seattle Storm. Starting with her promotion, hiring former players as head coaches became a trend. All four coaching vacancies after the 2021 season went to players with WNBA experience. Three -- Brondello, Hammon and Vanessa Nygaard with the Phoenix Mercury -- either played or coached for Hughes.\n\"I wanted the landscape, like it is now, to be reflective of former players,\" he said. \"Women who are sitting in that head-coaching position. That was important to me.\"\nIt's also notable that, after Derek Fisher was fired by the Sparks in June 2022, this was the first season since 1998 in which no former NBA player served as a WNBA head coach.\nAs compared to the NBA, the WNBA is a little behind schedule for having two former players meet as coaches in the Finals. That first happened in what the NBA considers its 20th season of existence, 1967, when Alex Hannum's Philadelphia 76ers beat Bill Sharman's San Francisco Warriors. We're also still nowhere near the peak of former players as head coaches in the NBA, which came when 22 of 27 (81.5%) to start the 1993-94 season had playing experience.\nHaving Brondello and Hammon lead their talented teams to the Finals is sure to create more opportunities for the increasing number of assistant coaches like them who have followed a typical path from playing to coaching.\n\"I think what we're starting to see,\" recently retired WNBA star Sue Bird said when Quinn was introduced as head coach in 2021, \"is the WNBA was almost too young 15 years ago to have these players with these long, successful careers where they've played in the WNBA, they've played for multiple coaches, they've played overseas, maybe they've had national team experiences, whatever the case may be. With that is just a ball of knowledge and a wealth of experience.\n\"And now we're finally starting to see those coaches become assistant coaches, become head coaches. That's the path that we've all kind of been waiting for someone to start to forge that path and now we're starting to see it. [Quinn's] just another example of that. I think it's amazing. I think we're going to see more of it. I have zero doubt about that.\""}
{"title": "Rivalry renewed: Cowboys-49ers matchup retaking its place atop the NFL", "date": "2023-10-06 12:34:02", "text": "Damien Woody details the importance of the Cowboys' matchup vs. the 49ers in a few weeks. (0:54)\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Less than an hour after the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys dispatched their Week 4 opponents, they had no desire to take the customary 24 hours to bask in their latest wins. They were already thinking about something else: each other.\nIn their locker rooms after beating the Arizona Cardinals and New England Patriots, respectively, multiple Niners and Cowboys wasted no time looking ahead to their Week 5 \"Sunday Night Football\" clash (8:20 p.m. ET, Levi's Stadium, NBC).\nAfter all, 49ers (4-0) vs. Cowboys (3-1) is not only a matchup of two of the league's best teams this season, but one of the most historically significant rivalries in NFL history. A rivalry that only recently has been brought back to life.\n\"It's an important game,\" said Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy, who was San Francisco's offensive coordinator in 2005. \"You understand the history. There is obviously a lot of tradition with this game. That's all part of it. You live to play in these kinds of games. You dream about these kinds of games. You don't want to make it bigger than what it is, but the reality is it's not just another game.\"\nTheirs is a rivalry borne not out of geography or divisional alignment but of repeated meetings in the postseason crucible.\nIt started in the 1970s, when the Cowboys won consecutive NFC Championship Games over the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 seasons and bested San Francisco in a divisional playoff game in 1972. In the 1980s, the 49ers won four Super Bowls, beating the Cowboys in the NFC Championship Game on Jan. 10, 1982, on the strength of \"The Catch\" by Dwight Clark, arguably the most memorable moment of the rivalry.\nDallas came storming back in the 1990s, knocking off the Niners in the NFC Championship Game after the 1992 and 1993 seasons on its way to two Super Bowl titles. San Francisco finally got past Dallas the next season in the NFC Championship Game on its way to its fifth (and most recent) Lombardi Trophy. The Cowboys would bounce back to win their fifth (and most recent) championship the following year.\nAnd then ... nothing.\nThe teams did not meet again in the postseason until a wild-card game on Jan. 16, 2022, a span of 9,863 days. The teams met again last season in the NFC divisional round. The 49ers won both games by a combined 13 points, reviving the rivalry and setting the stage for Sunday night.\n\"Anytime you play each other in the playoffs, it's always usually a bit bigger the next year,\" said Niners coach Kyle Shanahan, who was a ball boy for the team in the 1990s when his father, Mike, was the 49ers' offensive coordinator. \"And with that being back-to-back, it was huge. That's what I always remembered growing up ...\n\"They played in the NFC Championship all three years that I lived here. So just playing them in the playoffs two years ago kind of was reminiscent of that ... and those histories stack up just like people in your division. But usually when it's a playoff game everyone remembers it a little bit more.\"\nSunday's matchup will feature many familiar faces from their past two meetings. Besides the head coaches, star players such as linebacker Micah Parsons, quarterback Dak Prescott, defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence, guard Zack Martin and wide receiver CeeDee Lamb still dot the Cowboys roster while the Niners lean on their own galaxy of stars such as defensive end Nick Bosa, linebacker Fred Warner, running back Christian McCaffrey, offensive tackle Trent Williams and quarterback Brock Purdy.\nMost of those players were not born or were infants and toddlers for those 1990s playoff meetings, but the history of the rivalry has been ingrained and reinforced by the atmosphere surrounding the past two playoff matchups.\n\"You know prior to here, I saw it was definitely big,\" Parsons said. \"When they came down here [in the 2021 playoffs], I really saw it my rookie year and seeing it last year, how big that game was ... that impacted me that 'Oh, this is serious.'\"\nMarcus Spears explains that the Cowboys need to beat the 49ers as a confidence boost after dropping two straight playoff games to San Francisco.\nThe challenge this week for both teams is to understand how serious this meeting is without putting too much importance on it. Yes, it's only Week 5 and a loss probably won't determine each team's fate this season. But there are long-term ramifications that come with Sunday's result. Playoff seeding and home-field advantage might seem like far-off conversations, but a win Sunday night could go a long way in determining potential tiebreakers for those benchmarks.\nWhat's more, neither team has played a particularly daunting schedule to date. Dallas' opponents are 3-9 and San Francisco's 6-6 in games.\nSuffice to say, Sunday night should offer a good barometer of how far along these two expected Super Bowl contenders are.\n\"It's a huge test,\" Warner said. \"To say that it isn't would be naïve and downplaying the moment, I think. I'm excited for that moment. I know our team is excited for it.\"\nOne semi-new element is the introduction of the Sunday night lights. The 49ers and Cowboys haven't played a prime-time game against each other since November 1990. Their only other prime-time matchups came on \"Monday Night Football\" in 1977 and 1983.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nSunday's meeting will also likely break a tie in the all-time series, as the teams enter knotted at 19-19-1. In addition to their five Super Bowl titles apiece, the Niners and Dallas rank Nos. 1 and 2, respectively, all time in NFC playoff wins and conference championship game appearances.\nBut, as Cowboys owner Jerry Jones alluded to earlier this week, for as important as Sunday's meeting is, it very well could be a warmup act for a third straight playoff meeting in January. Because, as both sides are quick to remind, when you play for two of the NFL's most successful franchises, the only thing better than beating the other side is winning the whole darn thing.\n\"There's always a path in the NFC that goes through Dallas, goes through San Francisco,\" McCarthy said. \"I like to think that's what makes this sport so great, the respect you need to have for your history.\""}
{"title": "The Eagles are so good at the 'tush push' that the NFL may ban it", "date": "2023-10-06 12:34:02", "text": "Pat McAfee and crew examine the controversy around the Eagles' signature \"tush push\" play. (1:11)\nPHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia Eagles were facing a fourth-and-1 at midfield early in the second quarter Sunday, and everyone in the stadium knew what was coming before the offense even lined up.\nA capacity crowd of nearly 70,000 rose for a standing ovation, anticipating perhaps the most talked about play in the NFL.\nThe \"tush push.\"\nOr is it the \"brotherly shove?\" The nicknames vary, but the results have been remarkably consistent.\n\"It's been a good play for us,\" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. \"A really good play for us.\"\nThe play is a glorified sneak where the quarterback is pushed forward by teammates lined up behind him. It has been wildly successful for the Eagles since they made it a regular part of their offense in 2022. They have run it 37 times in the regular season, per ESPN Stats & Information, and have gotten a first down or scored a touchdown on 34 of those attempts for a success rate of 92%.\nOther teams are following suit -- there have been 36 attempts through four weeks, up from five at this point in 2022 -- with mixed results. Four teams are 0-for-1, but the overall success rate is 81%.\n\"It's not as automatic as people think, as we're seeing across the NFL,\" Sirianni said.\nThese teams attempted the most push sneak plays since the start of the 2022 season, including playoffs, through Week 4.\nIt might not be automatic for the Eagles, but it's close. And their success might explain why it has become controversial, with critics saying it's more rugby than football and should be outlawed. The rules committee will review the play in the offseason, and the league alerted officials to watch for infractions such as illegal formations and blocks. The backlash prompted the take-your-whining-and-stick-it standing ovation during Sunday's game against the Washington Commanders as Eagles fans showed their support for a play that has become part of the team's identity.\n\"Well, it's not being officiated as illegal, so we just have to prepare for it,\" Washington defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio said before the game. \"I would personally like to see it eliminated, not just because they run it better than anybody, although they do run it better than anybody. But I don't think that's a football play. I think it's a nice rugby play, and it's not what we're looking for in football.\"\nThe debate is starting to heat up. The NFL competition committee was \"split\" over whether to outlaw the play this offseason, per Atlanta Falcons president Rich McKay, who is also the chairman of the competition committee. There wasn't enough support to propose a rule change at the league meetings in March, but multiple members of the committee said they'd further analyze the play this coming offseason, when more injury-related data will be available.\nOn Monday night, two members of the New York Giants -- rookie center John Michael Schmitz and tight end Daniel Bellinger -- were hurt while executing a tush push in the first quarter of a 24-3 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, and they did not return.\n\"I think in the near future, rules might change,\" Tampa Bay Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield said. \"But for now, offenses might as well take advantage of it.\"\nThe fact that not all teams have taken advantage as successfully as the Eagles strengthens the argument that the play is less about the push and more about the men attached to the tush.\n\"There is clearly a talent to it that our guys have,\" Sirianni said. \"I get that some people are complaining about it, but stop it. Stop the play.\"\nSirianni couldn't pinpoint exactly how the quarterback push made its way into the Eagles' scheme, but he cited the goal-line sequence at the end of the 2005 classic between USC and Notre Dame as the moment the play pierced the football world's collective consciousness.\nWith the Trojans trailing by three with seven seconds left, quarterback Matt Leinart ran a sneak and was greeted by a wall of Irish defenders who appeared to have had him stopped. But Reggie Bush flew in and shoved Leinart into the end zone for the score.\nThe play -- known as the \"Bush push\" -- was against the NCAA rules at the time (although not any longer), but no flag was thrown.\nAlso in 2005, the NFL removed language from the rulebook that prohibited pushing a ball-carrier forward. But the purpose was to eliminate a tough judgment call for the referees, not to open the door for the modified QB sneak.\nThere was concern by officials that in some of the goal-line situations it was \"very hard to tell when a guy was coming in to block and when a guy was coming in to push. So we took it out,\" McKay said in March. \"We did not think it would become a strategy, and here we are.\"\nThe first Eagles tush push in ESPN's database came in Week 1 of last season against the Detroit Lions, when they snuck it on fourth-and-1 for a first down to secure a 38-35 win.\n\"I love pushin', man,\" said Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert, one of the players responsible for muscling Hurts through the line of scrimmage. \"It's fun to be back there. It's fun to see the defeat on defenses' faces before we even run the play.\"\nSome players inside the Eagles locker room are hesitant to share the intricacies of the play. \"You don't go into McDonald's and ask for the Big Mac sauce recipe,\" guard Landon Dickerson said. But the basic tenets are cut and dry.\nHurts picks a gap on either side of the center, and dives in after the snap. As soon as he meets resistance, the two players behind him rush in and begin to push Hurts forward.\nThe Eagles have one of the most savvy centers in the game in Jason Kelce, and he's surrounded by massive men in Dickerson (6-foot-6, 332 pounds), Jordan Mailata (6-8, 365 pounds), Lane Johnson (6-6, 325 pounds) and -- to a lesser extent -- Cam Jurgens (6-3, 303 pounds).\nThen there's Hurts, the former high school powerlifter who can squat 600 pounds -- a level of strength that comes in handy when you're trying to force your way through a mass of humanity.\n\"They're putting the two H-backs right behind the quarterback, and it's kind of like a rugby scrum,\" said Dan Koppen, a former New England Patriots center who helped pave the way for arguably the best QB-sneak artist of time, Tom Brady. \"And now you've got 1,500 pounds upfront. You've got a 200-250-pound quarterback [Hurts is listed at 223], and then you've got 250-400 pounds more pushing from the back.\n\"It's a really hard play to stop.\"\nOut of the 36 attempts at the push this season through Week 4, 29 have resulted in first downs, including four touchdowns.\n\"It helps having a guy like Gabe Davis or Reggie Gilliam behind you pushing the pile,\" said Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen. \"Those are two strong guys.\n\"But I think it's just kind of low man wins. If our O-line can get low, and I can get low behind them, we're going to have some success. Now if it's the other way around, not so much success.\"\nThe QB push against the Commanders that had the Lincoln Financial Field crowd on its feet didn't count. Dickerson was called for the rare offensive offside. The Eagles were penalized 5 yards and had to punt.\nKelce said the NFL had given them notice the week leading up to the Washington game that it was going to \"start looking for offensive players sneaking into the neutral zone.\" Sirianni confirmed it was a point of emphasis for officials that week. Video appears to show Dickerson's hand in line with the ball pre-snap, but Kelce said that was actually his hand, as he gets into a four-point position on QB sneaks.\n\"I think they messed this up actually,\" Kelce said on his \"New Heights\" podcast. \"But that's what happens when you go searching for things.\"\nAfter declining to bring the legality of the play to a vote in March, the competition committee sent out a memo to all 32 teams recommending that the NFL football operations department \"closely monitor\" specific techniques utilized by the offense, including illegal formations, chop blocks and personal fouls \"like spearing and use of the helmet by an offensive player in an effort to gain leverage and push the pile forward.\"\n• Why the 'tush push' might get banned\n• Love's completion rate ranks last\n• O'Brien sees glimpses with Jones\n• Stroud knew Collins would be special\n• Why 0-4 Panthers aren't panicking\n• Saints look for offensive change\n• Cowboys, 49ers renew rivalry\nOne common thought is defenses will begin taking extreme measures to halt the play now that it is gaining in popularity with a reputation of being unstoppable.\n\"My fear now is some of the linemen are going to get some knees chopped,\" New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr said. \"And soon as that happens, I'm sure there'll be a rule change.\"\nCommanders coach Ron Rivera, a member of the competition committee, indicated the QB push will be put further under the microscope this offseason.\n\"It is something that we all have to study,\" Rivera said. \"There'll be a lot of issues that'll come up. There'll be some safety issues that'll probably be brought up. There may be some refereeing issues that'll be brought up, but I can't speak for anybody else on it. I think it will be a point of conversation.\"\nTime might not be on the side of the tush push, but the rest of the 2023 season offers an opportunity to those who have mastered the play.\n\"We did a lot of studies on everything in the offseason to help ourselves be even better at it,\" Sirianni said, \"but it's about those guys up front. It's about Jalen.\n\"I think we would be pretty successful without the push, but we're just pushing them sometimes to give that extra thump.\"\nContributing: John Keim, Brooke Pryor, Todd Archer"}
{"title": "Untold stories of the Air Raid revolution, from pregame hot dogs to Phil Collins photo ops", "date": "2023-10-05 20:47:09", "text": "Long before the world knew Mike Leach or Dana Holgorsen or any of the other oddballs, eccentrics and revolutionaries of the Air Raid fraternity, Hal Mumme was a high school coach in Copperas Cove, Texas, with a problem.\nIt was 1986, the NBA and a young superstar had captured the attention of the school's best athletes. Even Mumme's own son came home from school one day and announced he wanted to be Michael Jordan.\nThis was Texas, and most coaches still romanticized the notion that football had to be torture for it to be worthwhile. There was a machismo to the running game, ramming head-on into each other and surviving battles of attrition, with defenses built around big, physical players meant to win those battles.\n\"My generation's football coaches fought World War II,\" Mumme said, \"and they were pretty damn determined to make us relive it every day in practice.\"\nSo Mumme, who had already gone from being the nation's youngest coordinator at UTEP at 27, was now 31, looking to reboot his career after the Miners' whole staff had been fired, and he had a wild idea. What if he made football fun? What if he actually used the entire field?\nAnd so the beginnings of the Air Raid were born, 67 miles from Austin, where just 10 years before, Texas coach Darrell Royal was running the wishbone and repeating his maxim: \"Three things can happen to you whenever you throw the football, and two of 'em are bad.\" But Mumme, who idolized Royal, realized that the same thing that made the wishbone work, spreading the ball in space to skilled athletes, might work even better as a passing offense. So he went all-in.\nA decade later, Mumme burst onto the national scene at Kentucky, walking around on SEC fields, eating hot dogs, wearing flip-flops and listening to Jimmy Buffett before becoming the only UK coach in the past 100 years to beat Alabama. His creation made 5-9 slot receivers superstars and walk-on quarterbacks Heisman winners. Mumme made it possible for Mike Leach, a lawyer from Pepperdine, to become a college football icon, for Lincoln Riley, a Texas Tech walk-on himself from tiny Muleshoe, Texas, to lead two of the most storied programs in history. He made football interesting for unpedigreed coaches who loved the sport, but who would rather write books about Geronimo than sleep in their offices or run the damn ball.\n\"The Air Raid is not an offense,\" TCU coach Sonny Dykes said. \"The Air Raid is a way of life.\"\n\"It's a mentality,\" Riley said, \"more than a collection of plays.\"\nThese mavericks changed the course of football history and rewrote record books, paving the way for Patrick Mahomes to win two Super Bowls while forcing Bill Belichick and Nick Saban to give into wide-open passing attacks. How they did it was never boring.\nLast year, Dykes, a former Mumme assistant at Kentucky, made a historic run to the national title game after a 5-7 season. This year Deion Sanders, who used to pick Mumme's brain and called Leach for offensive staff recommendations, is using the same wide-open principles at Colorado during its program jump-start, turning his own son, Shedeur, into a Heisman candidate at QB.\nWith the sport still mourning Leach, the most famous and revered coach in the extended Air Raid family, following his death in December, we set out to find tales from the rise of the game-changing offense that illustrate the methods behind their collective madness.\nFor every Tim Couch or Kyler Murray or Caleb Williams, the bluest of blue-chip prospects, there are dozens of record-setting Air Raid quarterbacks who were unwanted by anyone else, then ran up the gaudiest of numbers.\nDustin Dewald blazed the trail in Copperas Cove. He was one of those players who got disillusioned with the drudgery of football in the 1980s, so he quit to join the golf team after watching his older brother get pummeled over and over as their QB.\n\"We got our heads kicked in trying to run the ball down the throats of bigger, more powerful teams, lining up in the Power I with an offensive line that averaged 195 pounds,\" Dewald said. \"It was just ridiculous. Hal came in and said, 'All that's going to change.' It did. I think it was the first time in 10 years we didn't have a losing season in Cove.\"\nBetween 1978 and 1985, Cove went 10-69, including two 0-10 seasons. In Mumme's first year in 1986, the Bulldogs went 5-5. They were still outmanned, but Mumme, who began by using the run and shoot, gave them a shot in every game. Then against district rival Georgetown, the opposing coach, Art Briles, blitzed Mumme relentlessly, making it difficult for more complex plays to develop.\n\"I decided I was never going to let that happen to me again,\" Mumme said, reducing his offense to a collection of short passes and horizontal crossing routes.\nDewald threw the ball more than all but a handful of schools in Texas that year. There had been only two scholarship players in the previous 10 years at Cove, but he signed with Stephen F. Austin. Then, he went through the same cycle, quitting due to boredom and joining the golf team at Tarleton State. There weren't any college teams he knew of where he could replicate his experience. Until he went home to Cove to visit.\nHe stopped by the football offices to congratulate Mumme on his new job he'd just landed at a small college, Iowa Wesleyan. By the time he left, Mumme had once again recruited him to play quarterback for a team that was similar to Sanders' Colorado experiment: IWU was coming off an 0-10 season and had just two players returning.\n\"We tried to have a team meeting after I got introduced at the press conference and they told me there were going to be 40 guys,\" Mumme said. \"I walk in, there's two, and the three that I brought with me. I just gave 'em the same speech I was going to give 'em anyway about working hard in the offseason, and we're going to win games. One kid just got up and walked out. I guess he decided, 'This is bulls---, I'm not doing this.' So we had four.\"\nLeach was one of only two applicants for Mumme's offensive coordinator job, and they quickly realized they were kindred spirits. It was a leap of faith: The high school coach took a $20,000 pay cut to try to prove himself in college again. The lawyer who could've made $200,000 a year instead was making $12,000, and the golfer took on student-loan debt to go to school in Iowa -- where none of them had ever been.\nThey went 7-4 the next year, then, by 1991, started tinkering and added the up-tempo element where they never huddled and ran plays at a frenetic pace. Opposing teams had never seen anything like it and had no idea how to stop it. In Dewald's accidental career, he threw for 12,045 yards, 115 TDs and set 25 NAIA records. He threw for 4,418 yards and 45 TDs in 1991, including one game where he set national records with 86 attempts and 61 completions. Leach sent out news releases to national media, coining the name \"Air Raid\" in the process and building the mystique.\nWhile it might have appeared the gaudy numbers were because of an intricate playbook, it was actually the opposite. There was no playbook at all. The philosophy was making things as barebones as possible.\nDon't practice plays you won't call in a game. Don't call plays in a game you don't practice. Don't throw to a covered receiver and don't pass up an open one.\nThe plays came from LaVell Edwards at BYU, with Mumme saying he's watched every offensive snap of Edwards' career. He picked his favorites -- four passing and two rushing -- that seemed to always work. His practice drills, the real backbone of the Air Raid, according to the coaches, were all about details of that limited set, and were all based on Bill Walsh's 49ers practices.\nSo he made every practice consistent and repetitive and drilled until they were mind-numbingly boring. Do it until you can't screw it up, and let muscle memory win. And if it works, keep doing it. Mumme said he once called the same play 52 times in a game for Dewald.\nDecades after helping launch the revolution, Dewald has watched teammates like Bill Bedenbaugh, an Iowa Wesleyan offensive linemen who's now considered one of the best O-line coaches in the country at Oklahoma, along with Holgorsen, his old IWU wide receiver who's become another of the sport's most idiosyncratic coaches, and he finds it amusing that he still understands almost everything they do.\n\"For years, I would go visit [Leach or Mumme] every year for at least one home game and spend days with them at practice and on the sidelines of games,\" Dewald said. \"The last time I visited Mike at Washington State, I looked at the script for the game and it was crazy. I actually knew what to do on 90 percent of it -- and it was almost 30 years after I stopped playing. Just to see what they've all accomplished has been mind-blowing for me, how much it's changed the game and how successful they've all been has been really cool to watch.\"\nChris Hatcher is convinced Mumme isn't the inventor of the Air Raid. He claims the title.\nHatcher signed at Valdosta State to play for Mike Cavan, a former Georgia assistant who had coached under Vince Dooley and was Herschel Walker's lead recruiter. They were an I-formation team with a few passing concepts.\nMumme arrived at Valdosta after Cavan left for another job and, armed with talent he'd never had before, he initially made the same mistake he criticized other coaches for: He overcomplicated things.\n\"I don't care what anybody says, I'm the guy that invented the Air Raid,\" Hatcher said. \"I was not smart enough to comprehend all this stuff Hal wanted to do. So we had to dummy it way down for me. And then that's when the Air Raid took off. That is the truth.\"\nHatcher learned to appreciate the beauty of perfecting and running an offense so simple that he had a little extra time on his hands, enough to visit a frat party the night before homecoming and leave with a parting gift.\n\"You didn't have to be in the film room all night because it didn't matter what the defense was doing,\" Hatcher said. \"We were so good at it that you had time to go out and steal a cannon in the evening. It was a legit Civil War cannon, now, too. Let's not act like it was a little peashooter.\"\nHatcher, who's now the head coach at Samford, threw for 11,363 yards and 121 touchdowns and set 29 school records. During his senior year in 1994, he led the Blazers to their first postseason berth, advancing to the quarterfinals, and when it was all said and done set 29 VSU passing and total offense records. He won the 1994 Harlon Hill Award, often called the D-II Heisman, as the Blazers went 40-17-1 in his career.\nThis captured the attention of Kentucky athletic director C.M. Newton, who wanted to match the basketball program's pace. He handpicked Mumme, which raised eyebrows among purists who believed such a gimmick offense wouldn't work in the big, bad SEC. But Kentucky already had a homegrown star quarterback in Tim Couch, albeit one who was last seen losing 65-0 in his first start to Florida -- and defensive coordinator Bob Stoops -- and attempted just 84 passes over seven games.\nFirst, Mumme enlisted Hatcher, now a graduate assistant, to convince Couch not to transfer. (They went to Hooters and talked it out.) He stuck around, working with Hatcher, who was in charge of getting Mumme's play scripts prepared for Couch's wristband. Mumme would say Play 1 or Play 2, and Couch would call what's on the wristband. Quarterbacks often would check into different plays freely, but in one game, Couch took it to an extreme.\n\"We get about three or four first downs and Couch ain't run a play Mumme's called yet,\" Hatcher said. \"We go down and score, and the whole time Mumme is on the headsets using a few choice words to me.\"\nMumme accused Hatcher, who often changed the play himself when playing for Mumme, of purposely telling Couch not to run Mumme's calls.\n\"I can't believe you'd do this to me,\" Mumme said, according to Hatcher. \"Then it finally hit me. Couch was using the wristband from the week before, and didn't change it out. Every play was wrong, and we went down and scored anyway. My point is, when you rep the plays so much, we feel like it doesn't matter. I can pick me a handful of plays that should work against just about anything you'll see. I like to say we're a well-coached backyard football team.\"\nCouch's mastery paid off in 1997 when he threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Craig Yeast in overtime to lead Kentucky to a win over Alabama 40-34. It was Kentucky's first win over Alabama in 75 years -- something the Wildcats haven't done since. It came just a year after Couch threw for 13 yards (UK had 67 total yards) in an entire game against Stoops' Florida defense under Steve Spurrier. Couch threw for 348 and 406 yards in the next two meetings. While the Gators ended up pulling away and winning both games handily, it was frustrating for Stoops, and their mentality impressed him.\n\"I liked how [Leach] and Hal Mumme were over there standing together,\" Stoops said. \"I took note of the casual nature of the two of them. But they were the most difficult to deal with.\"\nNothing Mumme did was by accident. He doesn't dispute any contentions that he and Leach were arrogant.\n\"There's no question,\" Mumme said. \"We always thought we were smarter than everybody else. We always thought we had better ideas than everybody else. And we pretty much did. That's why everybody's trying to do it now.\"\nMumme could be combative with reporters, and Leach could be aloof. And they weren't worried about too many other opinions.\n\"We played Jimmy Buffett during warmups,\" said West Virginia coach Neal Brown, who played wide receiver at Kentucky under Mumme. \"I don't know if that gets it going for you.\"\n\"It got me and Mike going,\" Mumme said, laughing. \"We weren't worried about anybody else.\"\nThey loved causing a stir or annoying other fans, like when Leach mocked Texas A&M's Corps of Cadets as head coach at rival Texas Tech.\n\"How come they get to pretend they are soldiers?\" Leach said. \"The thing is, they aren't actually in the military. I ought to have Mike's Pirate School. The freshmen, all they get is the bandanna. When you're a senior, you get the sword and skull and crossbones. For homework, we'll work pirate maneuvers and stuff like that.\"\nThe Aggies were not amused.\nThen again, Leach and Mumme were, which was the point. Jeff Allen can testify.\nBefore Allen became the only staff member who has been with Nick Saban for his entire Alabama tenure, a trusted confidante and sports medicine guru, he was an assistant trainer at Kentucky -- but most importantly, he was Mumme's hot dog guy.\nUK was about to play at LSU in Death Valley, then coached by embattled coach Gerry DiNardo. Mumme marched into the training room on Wednesday with a request that befuddled Allen.\n\"Hey, during pregame, when I'm talking to DiNardo, I want you to bring me a hot dog,\" Mumme said.\nAllen didn't understand. He'd been with him for more than five years at this point, and this was a new one.\n\"Finally, over the next day or two, I said, 'Why do you want a hot dog while you're on the field talking to their head coach?\" Allen said, \"He said, 'Because they're going to be so uptight to begin with. I want to show 'em how carefree and how relaxed I am, and it's going to make them even more nervous.'\"\nMumme was very specific that he wanted mustard on it. He sent a student for the hot dog and was on the field during pregame when he saw Mumme, whom he hadn't talked to yet on the day of the game. He thought, \"well here goes nothing,\" and headed over.\n\"I looked at him and said, 'Coach, here's your hot dog,' Allen said. \"He looked at me and goes, 'Oh, thanks Jeff.' Then he said, 'Hey, hold on, hold on. Does it have mustard on it?'\" Allen assured him it did, all the while playing it straight.\n\"I can still see DiNardo's face,\" Allen said. \"He was like, 'What in the world is happening here?' And I swear to you, Hal just stood there talking and eating that hot dog. I walked off and I turned around and I wanted to see it again. And there they are talking and Hal is just chomping on a hot dog right there on the 50-yard line of Tiger Stadium. And our players were seeing it. They were laughing. They were dying during warmups watching it.\"\nThe Wildcats were 0-24 on the road against ranked teams since 1977. They were 9½-point underdogs. They played fast and loose and kicked a walk-off field goal to win at the buzzer 39-36, sealing one of the biggest wins in school history. It led Kentucky to a bid in the Outback Bowl, the first New Year's Day bowl for the Wildcats since 1952.\n\"I'm not saying we won that game because of the hot dog,\" Allen said. \"But I don't think it hurt.\"\nOn Dec. 1, 1998, Oklahoma hired Stoops. The Sooners hadn't had a winning season in six years and were coming off a 12-22 stretch in three years under John Blake. Stoops, then 38, was a hot commodity as a defensive coordinator. Hiring someone to run his offense was his first big decision.\n\"My initial talks were with Turner Gill, who was at Nebraska at the time,\" Stoops said. \"That didn't really work out. And then I got to thinking. ... I didn't know [Leach], but the more I thought about it, the more I referred back to how challenging it was to handle Kentucky. If they can be that good at Kentucky, why couldn't we be as good or better at Oklahoma? So I went with it.\"\nIt was a bold move. Leach had never been a playcaller, and let's face it, he was pretty weird.\n\"I thought Mike was really interesting,\" Stoops said. \"Mike had a little different way of doing things. But let me tell you something: He was a hell of a leader. He was demanding, as aloof as he might be. He wanted things done a certain way and they damn sure better be done that way or you were going to hear it. He might look laid back, he was demanding, very demanding.\"\nThat was a learning curve for the rest of the staff, who couldn't figure out if this was all an act, or if Leach was for real.\n\"It was completely different from anything that any of us had seen in the offensive meeting room,\" former Oklahoma assistant and Kansas head coach Mark Mangino said. \"It did take time to get used to.\"\nSo did Leach's personality. The staff was all staying at a hotel in Norman, and somehow Mangino's room became the center of the action.\n\"I couldn't get him out of my room when I was living in the Residence Inn,\" Mangino said. \"Every night, somebody delivered a couple cases of beer, a box of cigars, and we sat around and called recruits till about 11:30.\"\nBy midnight, everyone was gone. Except Leach.\n\"Mike used to like to watch those simulcasts of Howard Stern. And those things would run till 4 in the morning. I'm in my bed trying to sleep. And here's Leach at 3 in the morning, he's laughing at Howard Stern, he's drinking a beer and he's having a good time.\"\nStoops, too, had a learning curve.\n\"I learned after the first few weeks late at night not to stop in and check in on Mike,\" Stoops said. \"One night, it's 11 or something, I'm ready to go home, and he starts telling me a story about Geronimo. After about 20 minutes, I said, 'Mike, I'm going home. I'm the head coach, I get to go when I want.'\"\nMangino, meanwhile, couldn't shake him at night, and he couldn't get through to him by day. In a staff meeting, Mangino suggested a running play. Leach couldn't have been less interested. Mangino suggested trying it at practice, and Leach blew him off again. Mangino said maybe he'll practice it anyway.\n\"Mike said, you could put it in all you want, you could run it during every play of inside drill, but I'm never going to call it in a game,\" and Mangino and Leach nearly came to blows, Stoops said, laughing.\nAn irritated Stoops called them into his office and made them hash it out. Stoops made it clear that he had given Leach full control, and they'd do it his way. Leach and Mangino became good friends.\nThe Big 12 was never the same. The new-look Sooners went 7-5 and made their first bowl game in five years. Texas Tech hired Leach, and Mangino took over, finally getting to put in a couple of wrinkles of his own.\nMangino had a season's worth of reps in place, and he said he ran about 80% of Leach's offense. \"And it worked,\" he said. The Sooners won a national championship, going 13-0 behind Josh Heupel, a lightly recruited junior college quarterback Leach found at Snow College.\nFrom the @kfor archives, Mike Leach at his last OU practice with Josh Heupel on Dec. 8, 1999. You can see the emotions as he talks with Heupel. Leach was introduced as the Texas Tech head coach the next day. pic.twitter.com/xm65rAhAes\n\"They were the ones that invented it ... but we [Oklahoma, Leach, Texas Tech and the Big 12] were the ones to make it popular,\" Stoops said. \"They weren't getting the national attention at Kentucky until we started it. And then, of course, we kept it and won the national championship.\"\nLeach became a star at Texas Tech. He took down No. 1 Texas, guided the Red Raiders to a bowl game in all 10 of his seasons and finished as the program's all-time winningest coach at 84-43.\nDykes was part of Leach's first staff that replaced his dad, Spike Dykes, who had retired.\n\"We were doing all this stuff that was really analytics, but they didn't know it was,\" Dykes said. \"We were going for it all the time on fourth down or going for it in our own territory. My dad would be like, 'What the hell are you doing?' I'm like, 'It gives us a chance to beat Texas. Instead of losing by 14, we might lose by 50. But we also might win?'\"\nIt became one of the most influential eras in college football. In Mumme's days in Kentucky, Urban Meyer and Sean Payton were among the earliest coaches to visit to try to learn what the Air Raid is all about. In Lubbock, Leach made sure his doors were wide open, and there were visitors everywhere.\nLeach made sure his coaches knew that he wanted them to teach visitors anything they wanted to know.\nThere was only one issue: \"They didn't believe us,\" said Lincoln Riley, who was a student assistant for Leach, because the entire offense was so simple.\n\"I've never been to a place where you had more coaches around constantly,\" Riley said. \"Mike was so open to people coming in. You think just Texas high school coaches? No. I'm talking professional coaches, college coaches from all around the country, high school coaches from all around the country, every single year. There's a group from Japan that came, groups from England that came over, I mean, you name it, we had 'em.\"\nDykes and Holgorsen, who were receivers coaches and later co-offensive coordinators, would handle a lot of high school coaches on their visits. Dykes said he can remember walking out to the parking lot one day and overhearing the coaches leaving convinced the offense couldn't be that simple, that Leach & Co. were holding things back.\n\"'Those sumb------ wouldn't tell us anything,'\" Dykes recalled them saying. \"And we told them everything.\"\nMuleshoe High's David Wood coached Riley and his brother Garrett Riley, now the offensive coordinator at Clemson, and watched as they passed over small-school offers to head to Lubbock to learn from Leach. Over time, he said, you could see the Tech influence take hold and spread throughout high school football, with Muleshoe being one of the early adopters, because Lincoln returned to help him install it while he was still a walk-on quarterback at Tech.\n\"We were a run offense, but once we realized how simple it was, we didn't think it was going to be that hard to switch,\" Wood said. \"We used to run maybe 30 plays in practice because you analyze every play and tell every player what they did wrong and then you'd run the play again and make sure everyone did it right. The way Leach did it, when we watched it, you got to coach on the run. So we were able to get like 120 plays a practice instead of 30 plays a practice.\"\nWood said when Riley set out for Lubbock in 2002, there were maybe two schools in the Texas Panhandle that were running a spread offense.\n\"I would say probably 70 percent of the teams we played when I retired [in 2017] were running it,\" he said. \"Maybe 80.\"\nThe Big 12 became known for its shootouts, and Leach's earliest quarterback rooms were filled with future stars and coaches, all of whom waited their turn, many of them just to start for one season. Kliff Kingsbury, who had originally signed with Spike Dykes, threw for more than 5,000 yards as a senior in 2002 and set seven NCAA records in his three years as a starter at Tech. His backup, B.J. Symons, set the NCAA passing record with 5,833 yards in 2003, and Symons' backups, Sonny Cumbie and Cody Hodges, each passed for more than 4,000 yards in a season as starters.\nThey did it all because Leach repeated the same things he and Mumme had always preached, particularly in the film room.\n\"The worst coaching point he would ever give us, and the one that we all hated, was: 'This guy was open. This guy was open. This guy was open. This guy wasn't open. And he's the one guy you threw it to!\" said Cumbie, now the head coach at Louisiana Tech, imitating Leach's monotone cadence. \"I don't care if it's two-high [safety coverage], one-high. Is it man? Is it zone? Is this guy open? Yes. Throw it to him.\"\nMumme's Kentucky era ended in an NCAA investigation, with Mumme resigning in 2001 amid findings that an assistant coach was sending money orders to players in Memphis. Mumme was cited for a \"failure to monitor,\" but was not punished by the NCAA.\nSince then, he'll sign up to coach anything, anytime, anywhere, including stops at New Mexico State, reviving football after 20 years at Southeastern Louisiana or stops at Division III schools Belhaven in Mississippi and McMurry in Texas.\n\"I'm the Johnny Appleseed of football,\" Mumme said. \"I always thought that was a great story. It's not that I set out to do that -- I never set out to get kicked out of Kentucky -- but when you look back on it, providence had a plan. We spread it a whole lot of places it wouldn't have been otherwise.\"\nAnd despite his offense being almost the norm now, rather than catching teams by surprise, it still works as it was intended: As a sort of money ball, beating teams that you have no business beating.\nAt McMurry, he took over a program that had three winless seasons in the previous decade, including an 0-10 mark the year before he arrived. Three years later, they were 9-3 and 7-1 in the conference.\nOut of the spotlight, Mumme still made history. And he did it in the most Mumme way possible.\nMcMurry opened the 2011 season with an 82-6 loss to Stephen F. Austin, who was ranked in the FCS at the time. After getting down early, Mumme would just keep going for it on fourth down over and over. He was down 35-0 at halftime, and it only got worse from there. But he wouldn't stop.\n\"Losing by 50 was the same as losing by 1,\" Dykes said. \"Hal never cared.\"\nThe next week, Mumme gave the team four days off. He showed them five plays from the first half where it easily could've been 35-28 instead of 35-0. They were set to face UTSA the next week, a D-I team coached by Larry Coker, who'd won a national championship at Miami. Mumme's quarterback, Jake Mullin, like Dewald, wasn't on the team when he arrived. He played baseball, but was a quarterback on the intramural team when Mumme found him.\n\"They said they created this offense for teams without much talent, which was great for us,\" Mullin said, who, like Dewald, ended up throwing for more than 12,000 yards in his career. \"Whenever [Mumme] got there, there was not much there. I mean, I remember I was bigger than my left guard.\"\nMumme took the team to the Menger Hotel in San Antonio, his favorite place, where Teddy Roosevelt recruited Texans at the bar to serve in his Rough Riders. He took the team on a tour of the Alamo the night before the game. The next day, McMurry upset UTSA 24-21 in front of 31,000 fans in the Alamodome, one of the only upsets of a D-I team by a D-III team in history, and Mullin threw for 372 yards.\n\"The Menger's filled with ghosts, we did have a ghost sighting in there,\" Mumme said. \"Between the Menger ghosts and the Alamo ghosts, they probably helped us out.\"\nMumme's fascination with history earned him an invitation from then-McMurry professor Don Frazier to a party for his new book, \"The Alamo and Beyond.\" Also invited? One of the world's largest collectors of Alamo memorabilia in the world: Phil Collins. Yes, that Phil Collins.\nFrazier didn't want Collins to be constantly accosted at the event, so he invited Mumme because he said half the table of Texans would rather talk to Mumme about the Air Raid and Leach than to a British rock star. Even about the Alamo.\nMumme got his copy autographed by Collins. The inscription reads:\n\"To coach... Something's in the air tonight. Cheers. Phil Collins.\"\nMumme, 71, keeps spreading the gospel. He is part of the operations group of a new spring league called the International Football Alliance with teams in Mexico and Texas, and will coach one of the teams. His son, Matt, who never became Michael Jordan, instead stuck with the family business and is now the assistant head coach at Colorado State.\nMumme has seen his little creation change the sport, including watching some of the most storied running teams of his lifetime at USC and Oklahoma be completely transformed. Now, it's finally broken through to the final frontier: the Big Ten, where Wisconsin, under Leach acolyte Phil Longo, is following the same formula as Oklahoma: Join forces with a defensive head coach (Luke Fickell) and flip the offense. Harrell, the former Leach quarterback, is the new offensive coordinator at Purdue as well.\n\"A couple of days before Mike passed, we talked and he was just ultra excited that we're bringing the Air Raid to the Big Ten,\" Longo said. \"It's the most excited I've ever heard him. So it meant something to me that he was happy that we were making moves, and he's the only one who didn't seem shocked by it.\"\nMason Miller, Leach's offensive line coach at Mississippi State who is now the offensive coordinator at Tarleton State, has worked for either Mumme or Leach basically since 1994 when he played running back at Valdosta State. He said the Air Raid family has become so big that it has its share of \"little sibling rivalries,\" but that when they all get together, \"we're like magnets to each other.\"\nLeach's loss has been profound on the family. But out of that loss, there's a new beginning.\nLeach's son Cody spent two years as a volunteer coach at BYU under Kalani Sitake, and spent his dad's final year as a graduate assistant at Mississippi State. Now, he's an assistant special teams coach for the Bulldogs, who has completed his Air Raid certification -- a service Mumme offers to keep spreading the word to coaches anywhere -- and is studying his dad's old game tapes stored in Gatorade coolers in his garage.\n\"I wish I could have gotten more time with him,\" Cody, 27, said. \"But Dad being so famous, being on TV, the occasional 'Friday Night Lights' cameo and other random stuff in media, I can always find him. Not everyone has that kind of opportunity where your parent is so well-documented that you can just find them and pull them up anytime.\"\nThere's another Mumme-Leach pairing in the works, with Cody hoping to follow his father's path.\n\"He knew so many other amazing coaches and all the guys he knows, I've known for a long time too,\" Cody said. \"So I have plenty of people to be able to talk to. His was the first generation, and it's kind of taking off into other branches. For me, it's a legacy.\"\nStoops says he can't help but look around and see how profound their impact was.\n\"It goes back to Mike,\" he said. \"And Hal's not talked enough about. He and Mike were joined at the hip. Between the two of them, I don't know that anyone's had a stronger influence on coaches. It goes on and on. The influence is huge. These tentacles from them go all over the place. They branch out from the two of them everywhere.\"\nJake Trotter and Chris Low contributed to this story."}

(1:38)\nManchester City go to Arsenal on Sunday for a top of the Premier League table clash with confidence restored and normal winning service resumed.\nI was on hand in Germany to watch Pep Guardiola's team boss possession and the game in their 3-1 win over RB Leipzig on Wednesday in the UEFA Champions League, inspired by a moment of genius from Julián Álvarez as he chipped a delicious goal to effectively win the game following a spell of stubborn resistance from the Bundesliga side. The result ended any concerns that City might be showing signs of vulnerability after successive losses to Newcastle and Wolves.\nThe defending Premier League champions have not lost three games in a row in a single season since 2018 and never looked like doing so in Leipzig, where their share of possession was a staggering 88% at one stage.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nThe return of midfield anchor Rodri, who was available to play in Europe despite his current domestic ban, made a significant difference. Manchester City lose only seven percent of games when Rodri plays, rising to 33% when he is missing.\nYou can easily make the case that he's one of the team's mot valuable players, and the good news for Arsenal is that Rodri cannot play on Sunday. It is the final game of his three-match suspension and so the key to this big match might be how effectively City can cover Rodri's absence in that \"No. 6\" role.\nGuardiola clearly does not trust Kalvin Phillips and Mateo Kovacic; for all his class, Kovacic failed when handed the job in the shocking defeat by Wolves. John Stones, out since the Community Shield in August, is fit again and was on the bench in Germany. He has the nous and passing range to play that anchor role if needed, but is he going to be ready or sharp enough for a start against Arsenal after seeing so little action so far this season? It is a difficult dilemma for Guardiola, who will have to improvise in a key area of the pitch.\nOne man who certainly advanced his case in Leipzig was 18-year-old Rico Lewis, who was a bundle of ideas and energy alongside Rodri. When asked to assess the display of the Manchester-born youngster, Guardiola smiled broadly and said, \"Wow!\"\nMore cheer for City is the return from injury of Bernardo Silva, which means Kevin De Bruyne is the only significant name still in the treatment room. Against that, however, Jack Grealish looked subdued in the Champions League after returning from a nasty leg injury, and against Arsenal he could lose his starting spot to the pacy and direct Jérémy Doku, who scored City's third goal in Germany.\nMeanwhile Erling Haaland, typically a goal-scoring machine, is experiencing a rare dry spell. Five games without netting is his longest Champions League drought, and he hardly got a kick against Wolves' warhorse Craig Dawson last weekend. However, a hungry Haaland is never quiet for long and still has eight goals in 11 games this season.\nArsenal, for whom the title is a holy grail, not having won it since the 2003-04 season, will certainly provide a far stiffer test than a rather unambitious Leipzig. Still stinging from the way City conquered them last season, the Gunners approach will be fascinating in manager Mikel Arteta's latest mind game against his old City boss and mentor, Guardiola.\nYou suspect Arsenal's Champions League loss at Lens, where Bukayo Saka picked up an injury, might have been caused by minds already focused on the big clash against City. It is not in Arsenal's DNA to sit back at home and play on the counter, but Wolves showed that denying City's playmakers those half spaces might be the most effective game plan.\nHowever, a bolder, adventurous approach by Arsenal could easily backfire. Consider this: Both Fulham and Spurs have gone to the Emirates and exploited defensive shortcomings in 2-2 draws.\nThe gap between the teams narrowed to only one point last weekend, with City atop the table on 18 points, but their midweek win in Saxony sent out an ominous warning that City are back to their winning ways. And that, more than anything else, should worry Arsenal."}
{"title": "Who should struggling Chelsea have signed instead? Osimhen, Szoboszlai, more", "date": "2023-10-06 12:43:55", "text": "James Olley explains why the short-term pressure on Chelsea to get results will all fall on Mauricio Pochettino. (1:05)\nChelsea spent an unprecedented £1 billion across the last three transfer windows, but it hasn't really worked so far. The club have won two of their seven games, drawing two and losing three under new manager Mauricio Pochettino and sit 11th in the Premier League table -- already 10 points adrift of leaders Manchester City.\nWhile they have amassed a group of some of the most-talented young players in the world, all on long-term contracts, it's possible their strategy might have been better focused towards more experienced players who could make an immediate impact.\nHindsight is a wonderful thing, but here's who Chelsea should have put their faith in over the summer.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\nHaving let Romelu Lukaku (loan to AS Roma), Kai Havertz (£65 million to Arsenal) and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (free transfer to Marseille) depart, Chelsea were left with the injured 22-year-old Armando Broja and untried Brazilian 18-year-old, Deivid Washington as the only out-and-out centre-forwards in the squad.\nNicolas Jackson, who arrived for £30m from Villarreal this summer, can also play through the middle, despite having the skillset of a winger or even second striker. While Raheem Sterling (£47.5m), Mykhailo Mudryk (£62m) and, before his long-term injury, Christopher Nkunku (£52m), can all do a job as a \"false No. 9.\" However, with a proven goal scorer arguably the first priority when revamping a side, you would have thought Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly would have signed one.\nChelsea have scored just seven goals in their seven Premier League games -- Man City have 17, for context -- and Sterling is their top scorer with two.\nJulien Laurens explains why Napoli's social media posts mocking Victor Osimhen couldn't have come at a worse time.\nLast season's Serie A top scorer for Napoli is widely regarded as one of the leading centre-forwards in the game, arguably behind only Man City's Erling Haaland and now-Bayern Munich star Harry Kane in the pecking order of world-class No. 9s.\nNapoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis is known for driving a hard bargain, but a fee of £150m would likely have got a transfer done -- long before the Italian club upset their star man by making fun of him on social media -- which is small change for a club that have spent so much across the rest of the team, especially on untried teenagers.\nOsimhen, 24, is an excellent finisher (26 Serie A goals last season; five from six games this campaign) and the Nigeria international's movement across the defensive line, speed to stretch the opponents and aerial strength would be of exceptional value to a team that are a lot better at creating chances than converting them.\nParis Saint-Germain beat their rivals to secure a loan move (with a £56m obligation to sign permanently next summer) for Ramos. The 22-year-old Portugal international may not have set Ligue 1 alight yet (two goals in six games), but he's already proven enough for Benfica (41 goals in 106) and Portugal (eight goals in six) to show he is one of the top young central strikers in Europe.\nRamos features a fine holdup game -- useful for creating space and combining with the wide forwards or midfield runners -- is strong in the air and has a quick finishing technique too. In terms of playing style, he would certainly have offered a set of qualities that the Chelsea squad lacks, while they could have paid Benfica the fee up front without the need for a loan.\nVlahovic only arrived at Juventus from Fiorentina for around £70m in January last year, but struggled to settle. Linked with a summer move to every top club in Europe, the 23-year-old was given another chance to shine this season and has four goals from six games to date.\nThose who have monitored the left-footed centre-forward since his early days will know he carries lots of unreleased potential. But would his style have suited Chelsea better? Given that Juventus usually line up deeper (and tend to press lower), with longer distances between the attacking players, it's reasonable to assume that Vlahovic would have seen a lot more of the ball in goal-scoring positions at Chelsea.\nWhile he has less than five touches in the attacking penalty area per 90 minutes, chances are that a fresh start in a new environment could also have worked wonders for a forward who often looks short of confidence.\nStewart Robson and Gab Marcotti discuss Moises Caicedo's potential transfer to Chelsea from Brighton.\nChelsea have central midfielders in abundance and they're as young as they are immensely talented.\nNo-one would doubt the intrinsic quality of the likes of Enzo Fernández (£106.8m), Moisés Caicedo (£100m), Romeo Lavia (£53m), Lesley Ugochukwu (£23.5m), Carney Chukwuemeka (£20m) or academy graduate Conor Gallagher. Yet the latter is the most experienced performer at the heart of the team at the age of 23 now that N'Golo Kanté, Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic have been moved on.\nThough this midfield setup is undoubtedly part of the club's policy of hoarding the elite young talent around the world, an experienced presence to organise, lead and dictate the rhythm of the game and plug holes is key to the strategic functioning of the side. Some experienced football scouts and executives may argue that spending hundreds of millions of pounds on young talent is all well and good, but without a veteran or two the kids' talent may end up being wasted.\nWhile it wouldn't have been a popular move with the fans, Fulham's Palhinha could have taken the short trip across west London to do the kind of job Rodri is carrying out each week for Manchester City. Tactically disciplined and strong in the tackle, Palhinha is capable of making the rest of the team tick with swift intelligent passes -- short and long -- while expertly positioning himself poised for counter-attacks, tackles and interceptions.\nTor-Kristian Karlsen is a Norwegian football scout and executive and is the former chief executive and sporting director at AS Monaco. He will write regularly for ESPN on the business of soccer and the process of scouting.\nCaicedo and Lavia are outstanding at distribution and recovery, but it often takes years of elite-level football to attain the patience and game-reading skills required to operate as a defensive-minded holding midfielder.\nAt 28, the Portugal international may not fit Chelsea's approach to the transfer market, but the fact that Bayern Munich, a club known for well-considered spending, were prepared to part with £56m -- which would have made him their fourth-most expensive signing ever -- speaks volumes about how highly his understated qualities are valued.\nThe ESPN FC crew debate how new Liverpool signing Dominik Szoboszlai will fit in at Anfield.\nWhile Pochettino should have no complaints about the names he can select from in this department, there might be a case to be made for Chelsea adding a more defined playmaker-type to organise proceedings in the final third -- especially after letting Mason Mount depart for Man United.\nSterling is an experienced star, Cole Palmer (£35m) and Noni Madueke (£30m) are wildcards given their lack of experience at the age of 22, while the 21-year-old Mudryk is starting to show something of his obvious potential, but Chelsea were hit hard by Nkunku's injury. The France international is likely to provide a significant impact on his return, but without him there is a bit of a drop in quality.\nIt's still a bit of a mystery how Liverpool ended up signing Szoboszlai from RB Leipzig for his £60m release clause without any serious competition from other top European clubs (i.e. not only Chelsea.)\nFrom providing a significant goal threat from outside the box, to brilliant set-piece deliveries, while constantly inviting linkups and combinations with teammates in the final third, the Hungary captain is as elegant as he's efficient.\nThough Chelsea are not short of No. 8 midfielders, Szoboszlai -- who also has good physicality and a fine pressing-game -- could even do a shift deeper in midfield. And at 22, he certainly represents future value, too.\nWolves' winger might have been a useful addition to a squad which so far this season has struggled with end product. Rather inexplicably overlooked by bigger clubs this summer -- perhaps due to uncertainties after serious ankle and knee injuries -- the 23-year-old can operate equally well on either side of the attack and has experience of the Premier League since 2019.\nThough it can be argued that Neto, with his pace and outstanding dribbling ability, thrives better in a counter-attacking side, he still has the technical ability to adapt to a high-tempo team that dominate possession. His acceleration and one-vs.-one abilities also make him suited to unlocking teams that tend to sit deep, while cash-strapped Wolves would have likely listened to offers this summer. He is already being linked with Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, as well as Chelsea, for future windows."}
{"title": "What to know about the Warriors' WNBA expansion franchise", "date": "2023-10-06 06:14:27", "text": "Ramona Shelburne and Malika Andrews react to the Bay Area receiving a WNBA expansion team. (1:05)\nWNBA fans have long clamored for expansion, and that day is finally here: The league will add a 13th team in the Bay Area, awarded to the NBA's Golden State Warriors, that will begin play in 2025, the WNBA announced Thursday.\nA second expansion franchise is expected to be announced this year, likely Portland, per ESPN's Ramona Shelburne. That franchise would also begin play in 2025. WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert confirmed in a news conference Thursday the league's goal is to have 14 teams by 2025.\nEngelbert and Warriors personnel declined to reveal the expansion fee the Warriors paid. Engelbert added only that it was \"a record-breaking expansion fee\" for the league, along with other significant investments that come with starting a WNBA franchise.\nThe league, which had as many as 16 teams in 2000, has held steady at 12 teams since 2010, after the Sacramento Monarchs folded the previous year. It last had 14 teams in 2008, when both the Monarchs and Houston Comets were still playing.\nThe long-awaited news of expansion won't just open up more roster spots -- which currently is at a maximum of 144, or 12 per team -- but will also reestablish the WNBA in at least one market where the league has already been: The Monarchs were an original franchise and played in Sacramento from 1997 to 2009, winning a championship in 2005. The Portland Fire were added in 2000 before the franchise folded in 2002.\nThe new team -- which will likely be called \"Golden State\" per Shelburne, though its official name and mascot are still to be determined -- will play home games at the Chase Center in San Francisco (where the Warriors play) and will practice in Oakland at the Warriors' former practice facility.\nThe Warriors are the sixth NBA franchise with a WNBA team, joining the Indiana Pacers (Indiana Fever), Minnesota Timberwolves (Minnesota Lynx), Brooklyn Nets (New York Liberty), Phoenix Suns (Phoenix Mercury) and Washington Wizards (Washington Mystics).\nGolden State also expands the league's footprint out West, giving the WNBA five teams in the Pacific or Mountain time zones.\nESPN's Alexa Philippou, Michael Voepel and Kevin Pelton break down what we know and what we are still waiting to find out about the new Golden State WNBA team and the league's expansion plans.\nWarriors personnel and Engelbert pointed to signs that women's basketball and women's sports in general are taking off. On Thursday they mentioned how viewership, attendance and merchandise sales are all going in the right direction, as well as increased sponsorship interest even within the past five to 10 years. To put it simply: \"The league is ready,\" said Joe Lacob, Warrior co-executive chairman and CEO.\nWhile the WNBA sat on expansion for over a decade, the NWSL (which began competition in 2013) has showcased the surging interest and investment in women's sports, as the league has expanded from eight to 12 teams since 2021 and has three more to come, including one in the Bay Area.\nThe inability of promising yet developing players, or even already established talented veterans, to maintain roster spots in the league has led to calls for the WNBA to expand its size, which could be done either via franchise expansion or by increasing the number of players teams are permitted to carry. WNBA stakeholders have different opinions on which route would be best, but Engelbert has maintained she believes franchise expansion is the way to go.\n\"The depth of the talent in this league has never been better, and the depth of the talent and breadth of the talent coming out of the NCAA system has never been better,\" Engelbert said Thursday.\nFranchise expansion will arrive amid enormous excitement over the crop of talent and high-profile players currently in college -- a group Engelbert called \"generational players\" Thursday -- with the likes of Iowa's Caitlin Clark, LSU's Angel Reese, Stanford's Cameron Brink, UConn's Paige Bueckers and Azzi Fudd and Notre Dame's Olivia Miles expected to go pro over the next few years.\nThe 2025 calendar year will be pivotal for the league even beyond expansion. While the current CBA runs through 2027, there is a mutual opt-out clause that could go into effect at the end of the 2025 campaign. The league's media rights deal with ESPN also runs through 2025. Engelbert has previously identified the new rights deal -- and as part of that the league's valuation -- as critical to the league's growth, and has said that expansion can help boost the league's value ahead of those negotiations. -- Philippou\nEngelbert said Thursday that details on how Golden State will build its roster will be discussed after the WNBA Finals when both the competition committee and board of governors meet. She said an expansion draft would likely happen in late 2024, after the draft lottery for the 2025 draft is held.\nWhile we don't know exactly how the process will go, we can look to history for precedent. In 2008, the Atlanta Dream built their inaugural roster of 13 players via an expansion draft by selecting from a pool of available players from the other 13 WNBA franchises, and by conducting multiple trades. For the expansion draft, which was held in February before free agency, each team was able to protect a maximum of six players who were not eligible for selection by Atlanta. The Dream could choose one player from each team regardless of contract status, although they couldn't select multiple unrestricted free agents. Atlanta then had the right to \"core\" that unrestricted free agent -- in the Dream's case, Betty Lennox.\nThe last time an expansion draft was held for multiple incoming franchises was in 2000: the still-running Indiana Fever and Seattle Storm as well as the now-defunct Miami Sol and Portland. In that expansion draft, the rules largely preserved existing teams, allowing them to protect eight of their nine top players. The new teams selected six players in the expansion draft and filled out their rosters in the 2000 draft or via trades.\nIn 2008, the Dream were assigned the No. 4 pick and did not participate in the lottery. In 2006, the Chicago Sky were assigned the sixth pick, behind the five teams that missed the playoffs the previous season.\n\nAgain, these aren't necessarily the rules the league will dictate as Golden State builds its roster, but they give us an idea of what could happen. -- Philippou\nAside from the Bay Area's women's basketball tradition and roots, the region makes sense from an economic perspective. Engelbert mentioned multiple times the potential to capitalize off Silicon Valley as a \"global hub of technology and commerce and innovation.\"\n\"Technology is driving our economy, and the tech center of your country doesn't have a WNBA team -- that doesn't seem right to me,\" the commissioner said. The Bay Area is also a big media market and had favorable \"demographics and the psychographics\" for a WNBA team, she said.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nEngelbert mentioned the importance of bringing in \"long-term owners committed to success, not just to the team and winning championships but to the league overall,\" and the Warriors seem like they'll fit that bill perfectly. The fact that this Golden State team will play in a state-of-the-art arena such as the Chase Center and practice in a NBA-grade facility in Oakland shows the standard for investment in the league is light-years better than where it was even five years ago.\nThe Warriors have the expertise on how to operate a massive successful basketball franchise, and Lacob has shown a commitment to women's basketball previously with his involvement in the ABL and the San Jose Lasers. He noted that the sport is in a much different place than where it was in the late-1990s, but also said, \"I'm a lot wiser now. ... We are a little more experienced and we're certainly well-capitalized and have good facilities.\"\nMany notable WNBA players have Bay Area ties: Sabrina Ionescu, Chelsea Gray, Danielle Robinson and Haley Jones are from the region. Stanford produced sisters Nneka Ogwumike and Chiney Ogwumike, as well as Brink, and Layshia Clarendon went to Cal. Bay Area fans would be even more excited about their new team should it manage to get any of those local legends. -- Philippou\nIt's important to remember the Monarchs franchise didn't fold for lack of fan support. It was one of the franchises that was a victim of the global financial crisis of 2006 to '08, and the Maloof family -- which then also owned the NBA's Sacramento Kings -- got out of the WNBA.\nThere were Bay Area fans who supported the Monarchs; now they won't have as far to travel. Between the Stanford fan base, former Monarchs and Lasers fans, and cultivating new fans, this organization should be able to establish a solid following. -- Voepel\nLacob boldly said in Thursday's news conference that the Golden State team will win a championship within its first five years of existence (something he also said when he purchased the Warriors). That said, history tells us not to expect too much, too soon from an expansion team. The last two franchises added to the league won a combined nine games in their first season of play, with Chicago going 5-29 and Atlanta 4-30. But their paths diverged from there.\nThe Dream landed Angel McCoughtry by winning the 2009 draft lottery and improved by 14 wins in Year 2, making the playoffs. A year after that, Atlanta reached the WNBA Finals for the first of three trips in four years led by McCoughtry.\nMeanwhile, the Sky were still struggling to make the playoffs despite arriving in the league two years earlier. Their first postseason trip didn't come until their eighth season in 2013, when the addition of future MVP Elena Delle Donne as a rookie to another future MVP in Sylvia Fowles produced a 24-10 record. Chicago made the Finals for the first time the following year.\nMaking the Finals in Year 3 might not be realistic for the Golden State franchise, but with the Warriors' resources, it's unlikely the process will be as slow as it was for the Sky. -- Pelton"}

(0:37)\nFantasy football is a passion for many. Sometimes that passion causes fantasy managers to make emotional decisions even when the data suggests otherwise. Each week during the 2023 NFL season, Liz Loza will attempt to strike a balance between what the data states and what the heart wants. This is called Facts vs. Feelings.\nThis time next week I'll be toiling away on the Week 6 edition of Facts vs. Feelings from a dimly lit hotel room in Bristol, Connecticut. And I can't wait.\nNot because the corporate-approved lodging is particularly luxurious. It's not. Or because I'm thrilled to welcome a morning that doesn't involve yelling at my kids to hurry up and brush their teeth so I can peel out of the driveway only to sit in a car line and stress about potential tardy slips. OK, well maybe a little (I truly do miss those adorable gremlins while I'm on the road, though).\nIt's because... IT'S FALL, Y'ALL!\n\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nLos Angeles might have the whole of my heart (and my money), but the City of Angels cannot deliver on autumn vibes. It wasn't until last year -- when I returned to campus for the second time as an ESPN employee -- that I realized how much I loved (and missed) a proper fall. I gasped at the foliage. I stared wide-eyed at the bushels (like, actual bushels!) of gourds lining the streets. I was taken back to my childhood and willingly wrapped myself in all of the pumpkin spice nostalgia.\nMy colleagues seemed charmed (if not a little startled) by my exuberance. Numerous co-workers leaned into it, generously taking me for scenic drives through some of the area's most breathtaking vistas. (One of whom is likely proofreading this article right now. Hi, Pierre. [Good morning, Liz and gremlins.] That detour past the old-timey cemetery was so stinking cool!) It never got old -- for me, at least. And I hope my genuine wonder rubbed off on them, serving as a potential reminder to take in the less-than-sophisticated (dare I say, \"basic\") joys of the season.\nI've been trying to manufacture that same cozy feeling in preparation for this weekend's trip. Numerous outings to the local Trader Joe's have resulted in an abundance of harvest-themed purchases. And while the bouquet of sunflowers on my desk looks beautiful and the pumpkin yogurt tasted surprisingly good... I want the real thing.\nI want to hear fall leaves crunch under a pair of cute boots. I want to sip apple cider and not sweat. And I really want the Bears to not embarrass themselves Thursday night. None of those things will happen, however, without taking action. I need to -- on my own -- venture outside of the Bristol bubble and discover all of the bucolic hiking trails and quaint roadside stands. And the Bears, well, they need to do a whole lot but should probably start with letting Justin Fields use his legs.\nThe same is true in fantasy. We're a month into the 2023 experiment and, speaking for myself, it has felt more like raking the lawn than snacking on pumpkin seeds. We have reached a point of transition. More than a few hot summer takes have begun to chill.\nThe emergence of new patterns and facts requires us to confront our feelings about what we thought was going to happen and instead get real about what is actually going on. Whether that means benching Joe Burrow (QB31) or getting behind Evan Engram (TE4); it's time to shed what isn't working and adventure toward something different. There's no guaranteeing these adjustments will lead to victorious gains, but neither will nervously standing still.\nSo, while that maple chai-scented room diffuser might smell great now, you're going to need something stronger to get you through the winter.\nAnthony Richardson, QB, Indianapolis Colts: Richardson is showing zero anxiety. This man is fearlessly running -- literally and figuratively -- toward his destiny. Even while in the grasp of Aaron Freaking Donald, Richardson is advancing the ball. His maturation as a passer might still be in its beginning stages, but the rookie has, thus far, recorded the fifth-highest pressured completion percentage (63.6%). That shows guts and intelligence. Richardson's physical tools are successfully translating to the NFL while manifesting a boon for fantasy investors.\nCongrats to all of those who believed from the jump because Richardson is currently the QB2 in fantasy points per game. That's what happens when a wildly gifted mobile passer is not only allowed but even encouraged to lean into his talent as a rusher. Richardson has executed 14 designed runs in three games, which includes all four of his touchdowns. (Can someone please forward this to Luke Getsy?) As a result, he has managed more fantasy points per game as a runner (12.38) than Joe Mixon, Rachaad White or Alexander Mattison. Additionally, his 29.60 fantasy points from Week 4 was the third-highest total by any QB this season (and 11 completions, tied for the fewest by any signal-caller in a full game so far this year).\nRichardson will have to shift some of his focus from the ground to the air versus the Titans on Sunday. Tennessee has allowed a completion percentage of nearly 71% and an average exceeding 241 passing yards (10th-most) per week to opposing quarterbacks. Mike Vrabel's gritty defensive front also managed to hold Deshaun Watson (the only dual-threat QB the team has faced, save a compromised Joe Burrow) to 16 rushing yards. It figures to be a close battle (+/- 1) but my money is on Richardson's continued ascent. He's a top-five fantasy play in Week 5.\nDe'Von Achane, RB, Miami Dolphins: While we're on the topic of stocks rising ... holy heck, welcome to the NFL, De'Von Achane! The third-round selection out of Texas A&M followed up his 233-yard and four-TD effort in Week 3 by blazing his way to another 120 yards and two scores in Week 4. So, is this a fluke? Or is Achane the real deal?\nI'm leaning toward the latter. How does that genie fit back in the bottle? Achane's snap percentage has increased with each effort (0% - 8% - 42% - 66%). Meanwhile, Raheem Mostert's playing time has decreased since sharing the backfield with the explosive rookie (74% - 51% - 41%). The Dolphins -- like the rest of the modern NFL -- figure to go RBBC. However, Achane is proving to be the more effective rusher. His 11.4 yards per carry is as absurd as it is unsustainable. However, his 2.8 yards after contact per rush also ranks among the top three at the position.\nYou can't sit this guy. Not now. And certainly not as an 11-point favorite versus a reeling Giants squad that gave up 5.3 YPC to Seattle on Monday night. Achane has youth, juice and upside. He also has managed double-digit touches in back-to-back efforts. Consider the burgeoning star a top-12 fantasy RB this Sunday.\nMiles Sanders, RB, Carolina Panthers: If Miami's backfield is Fast & Furious, then Carolina's is giving Radiator Springs vibes. Sanders entered Week 4 with a groin injury, and although his effort deserves snaps, his output was worrisome. The Philly transplant managed a meager 19 rushing yards on 13 carries. While the aforementioned ailment certainly contributed to the vet's inefficiency, his rushing numbers have steadily decreased since the season opener. Sanders recorded 72 rushing yards in Week 1, but then a total of just 86 over his next three contests. Additionally, his 2.9 yards per carry ranks 37th among 44 qualifiers.\nIf there is a silver lining, it's Sanders' work in the passing game. Bryce Young is checking down on the regular. As a result, Sanders ranks third in team targets (23) and receptions (15), placing him among the top five at the position in both of those categories. But this offense has no juice. Between an unfavorable game script and Chuba Hubbard's pesky presence, Sanders is shaping up to be TD-dependent with little to no upside. He figures to further languish on the RB2/RB3 bubble when he takes on an improved (and rested) Lions defense in Week 5.\nMichael Wilson, WR, Arizona Cardinals: Meaningful impacts are hard to come by at the next level. Lord knows I'm still trying to make a positive one on my mother-in-law. Wilson, however, has delighted thus far in his pro campaign.\nThe Stanford alum has demonstrated enticing chemistry with Josh Dobbs, recording 50-plus receiving yards in three consecutive efforts. That stat becomes more impressive when noting that he's just one of 10 wideouts to accomplish such a feat. Wilson has additionally managed a top-15 aDOT (13.5 yards) along with the highest catch rate (88%) in the league. Furthermore, the rookie has outsnapped Rondale Moore in back-to-back games and managed to out-target the vet in his 7-76-0 effort at San Francisco this past Sunday. That arrow is pointing up, friends.\nA player with plus size and strength, Wilson is on his way to emerging as the ideal complement to Marquise Brown. It might not happen this week. And he'll still be saddled by Dobbs. Although with injuries mounting and byes upon us, now is the time to stash a rising star like Wilson. He's worth a speculative flex versus a Bengals defense that has allowed the ninth-most opponent yards per game (364.3).\nJordan Addison, WR, Minnesota Vikings: High expectations often lead to disappointment. So does putting up a bagel on any given Sunday. Enter Addison. The 2021 Biletnikoff Award winner was the first rookie off of most fantasy draft boards. Touchdowns over his first two starts appeared to validate the preseason hype. But all that good juju came to a screeching halt when the 21-year-old failed to convert on his lone target in Week 4. Was it the result of uncharacteristic quarterback play and game flow? Probably. We still need to address the facts and recalibrate our feelings, though.\nAddison's 13.4% target share ranks third on his team (just ahead of Mattison's 12.1%) and 70th among wide receivers. His above average aDOT (12.9) and his efficiency in the red area have buoyed his fantasy numbers. That kind of usage screams boom/bust. The reality of Addison's situation has been tempered by the Vikings' pass-heavy game scripts. When Kirk Cousins puts the ball in the air 40-plus times, Addison is likely to draw at least five looks. Makes easy sense, right? That is not, however, something we can rely on.\nConsider Week 4 the wake-up call. That doesn't mean Addison is a cut candidate. Definitely not while we're weaving through bye weeks and subbing players in and out of IR spots. It does, however, mean thinking about Addison (at least for the moment) as more of an upside flex than an automatic WR3. He's a top-40 FF WR option in what's projected to be a high-scoring game (53.0) versus the Chiefs.\nDalton Schultz, TE, Houston Texans: Schultz has been quiet because his young QB hasn't needed a binky. C.J. Stroud doesn't mind letting it rip, averaging 8.0 yards per attempt (QB3) while registering the sixth-most air yards (953) on the season. From 20 yards out, however, the former Cowboy is proving to be his young QB's bestie.\nSchultz is tied for first in team red zone looks (31% RZ target share) and leads the Texans' offense in end zone opportunities (38% EZ target share). From a positional point of view, His four red zone targets -- as well as this three end zone looks -- is tied for fourth among tight ends.\nIs this chasing touchdowns? Absolutely. Do I like to do it? No, it feels dirty. But some of us -- I'm looking at you, Kyle Pitts and Darren Waller investors -- need to light a three-wicked Yankee candle and conjure up some fantasy goodness. The manifesting figures to continue at Atlanta, as the Falcons have allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends. I'm optimistically forecasting four grabs, 41 yards and a tuddy for Schultz.\nTyler Conklin, TE, New York Jets: As Travis Kelce has consistently reminded us, knowing not just how but when to shoot your shot is key. Conklin has been on my radar since Zach Wilson took over as the Jets' starter. It wasn't until the CMU product finished second in team targets versus the Chiefs, however, that I considered leaning into his streaming potential.\nConklin delivered a smattering of top-12 fantasy finishes over 2022, although most of his highs came without Wilson at the helm. Whatever was lacking between the two last year appears to have dissolved this go-round. Conklin ranks third on the team in offensive play percentage (76.2%) and second in team targets (17). He has managed 5-plus looks in each game over the past three weeks. Although those numbers are far from astonishing, only eight tight ends have managed the same or better. Welcome (again) to the TE hellscape.\nAvailable in over 90% of ESPN fantasy leagues, Conklin offers sneaky sleeper appeal in Week 5. He'll face a bruised and battered Broncos defense that has coaxed production out even the most broken offenses. Denver has given up the seventh-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends, including a stunning 7-85-2 stat line to Cole Kmet in Week 4.\nI can't promise it will be pretty. But I know it's something different. Consider Conklin this week's newest borderline TE1.\nFollow Liz on social @LizLoza_FF"}

(3:15)\nThe Mississippi Department of Human Services filed notice this week of its intent to depose former NFL quarterback Brett Favre. More than a year ago, Favre was named as one of dozens of defendants in a civil lawsuit that aims to recover tens of millions of dollars in welfare funds a state audit said were misspent. Favre has denied any wrongdoing in the welfare case and has not been criminally charged.\nThe deposition, scheduled for Oct. 26, would be Favre's first time testifying under oath in this case, according to Front Office Sports. The people involved in the case aren't commenting because of a judge's gag order, but several unaffiliated attorneys explained what could happen when Favre arrives at the deposition in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where Favre starred for the University of Southern Mississippi.\nESPN spoke with William W. Berry III, a law professor at the University of Mississippi; Vangela M. Wade, an attorney and leader of the Mississippi Center for Justice; and Matthew Leish, a partner at the law firm Miller Korzenik Sommers Rayman in New York. The legal experts addressed, among other things, the risks that Favre potentially faces during the deposition process, and what he could do to help his case. All three said they do not know details of the case beyond what has been reported and would speak about general legal strategies. Here are their responses, which have been edited for clarity.\nWhat does it mean to be deposed?\nBerry: The idea of a deposition is to get someone's story on the record so that, at trial, they can't change it later. And so it'll obviously be very important for Brett Favre to tell the truth. This is his chance to get his story on the record.\nWade: In any deposition, it's part of discovery, of getting information directly from that person that they're deposing, or having that person to identify documents during the course of that deposition.\nLeish: There are really two goals. One, it's fact gathering. They're trying to find out what this person knows. The second part of it is to try to pin him down to get some admissions that will hurt his case. It can't be a complete fishing expedition, but they have some leeway to explore.\nHow long do depositions last?\nWade: I've seen depositions go anywhere from an hour to three days or longer for one person. It depends on the nature of the litigation and what the party is attempting to cover in that deposition.\nBerry: Most depositions are usually one-day depositions, maybe eight hours. In a more complicated case, it might take longer.\nWhat kinds of risks does Favre face during the deposition?\nLeish: The biggest danger is that he says something under oath that really helps the state prove its case. Maybe he admits something that they're trying to prove or he says something and they can call him out on it and it makes him look like he's not credible. I think those are the two biggest risks.\nHow can a deposition be used as evidence in a potential trial?\nBerry: If the plaintiffs in the case were to call Mr. Favre to testify and then he were to change his story on the stand, you would then cite him back to his deposition and impeach him in court. An impeachment is really showing someone's changing their story and then the credibility that person has with a jury or a judge is shot.\nWhat would help Favre in his deposition?\nLeish: When you're the person being deposed, it's really defensive. You're trying not to give the other side anything they can use. It's not so much that you're trying to prove your case. So his main goal is don't hurt yourself.\nBut having said that, if his testimony is very consistent with what he's saying -- \"I didn't do anything wrong, here's what I knew\" -- and he backs that up, he's got real evidence to support that, it can be useful to him. And the state can say, \"Hold on a second here, maybe we have a problem. Maybe we're going to have a hard time proving our case.\"\nBerry: What discovery is, is really a negotiation on some level in the sense of each party is trying to marshal, each lawyer is trying to figure out the best they can what really happened. So often you see these disputes in the media and you have the \"he said and she said,\" but then you start drilling down and you look at the actual evidence in the case and what evidence do you have and putting the evidence together.\nThen you get a sense of, \"Wow, this person really did something they weren't supposed to.\" Or alternatively, \"The allegation, it looked that way, but this person actually didn't do anything wrong.\""}

Kyle McCord has another year of eligibility for Ryan Day & Co. and will only be better following his experience in 2023.\nPaolo Uggetti: I'm with Tom and Blake, but for the sake of variety, how about Penn State traveling to USC in a rematch of the thrilling 2017 Rose Bowl? Sure, the players and some coaches are different now, but both offenses should be plenty explosive enough to provide a fitting encore. Really, any Big Ten team traveling to Los Angeles for a game against USC will make for an awesome environment not only because of the number of out-of-town fans who will make the trip, but also the transplants who already call the city their home.\nVanHaaren: Washington has a pretty tough schedule in 2024 with Iowa, Oregon, Penn State, Michigan, UCLA and USC all on tap. They'll have to travel to Indiana, Iowa, Oregon and Penn State. That Penn State game on the road could be a tough one considering how hard it is to play at Beaver Stadium. The Huskies also will have to travel to Rutgers, which will be a hike across the country. Washington is at home against Michigan, Northwestern, UCLA and USC, but that is a lot to take on in one season considering the team will likely be breaking in a new quarterback after Michael Penix Jr.'s eligibility runs out.\nBaumgartner: Michigan has four games on its 2024 schedule that immediately pop off the page -- road dates with Washington and Ohio State to couple with games in Ann Arbor against USC and Oregon. Having to make only one trek out to the West Coast helps logistically. Much has been made about the quality (or lack thereof) of the Wolverines' nonconference slate the past few seasons. We knew that was likely to take care of itself with the addition of the four Pac-12 schools. But to finally see what that looks like on paper hammers home how difficult it will be to win a Big Ten crown, let alone back-to-back titles as the Wolverines have done the past two years.\nUggetti: Nebraska will have to go on the road to both Ohio State and USC in 2024. While the rest of their road games (Indiana, Iowa, Purdue) as well as their home games (Illinois, Rutgers, UCLA, Wisconsin) don't present too tough a task, the two matchups against juggernauts on their home turf are enough to make their schedule next season one of the tougher ones in the conference. And given how they've looked so far this season, one can almost assume those two games will be near-automatic losses for the Cornhuskers.\nUggetti: In terms of big-name teams, I think Ohio State got the easiest draw in Year 1 of the new Big Ten. The Buckeyes travel to Northwestern, Michigan State, Penn State and will have to go to Oregon as their lone West Coast trip. They avoid playing USC, Washington and UCLA. That trip to Autzen will be much anticipated and, aside from perhaps the road trip to Penn State and hosting Michigan in the annual rivalry game, could be Ohio State's toughest task of the season.\n\nGet your favorite live sports, stories and originals with ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. Upgrade to a Disney Bundle plan and start streaming something for everyone today!\nVanHaaren: Rutgers has USC, UCLA and Washington, which will be a difficult stretch. But the Scarlet Knights don't have Michigan, Penn State or Ohio State on their schedule. That seems like a good trade-off, especially because the USC game is the only West Coast away game Rutgers will have in 2024. The matchups against Illinois, Minnesota, UCLA, Washington and Wisconsin will all be at home.\nBaumgartner: Logistically, Iowa's schedule stands out. Only once do the Hawkeyes have to travel out to the Pacific time zone -- for a game at the Rose Bowl with UCLA. Yes, a trip to Columbus is on the docket to face the Buckeyes, but road games against Michigan State, Minnesota and Maryland seem manageable. Oregon, Michigan and Penn State aren't on the schedule. Washington will get introduced to Kinnick Stadium's legendary pink visitors locker room for the first time. With divisions going the way of the dodo bird, Iowa didn't get a terrible shake in the first year of the 18-team league.\n\nFor the full matchups through the 2028 season, click here.\nHome: Michigan, Michigan State, Minnesota, Purdue\nAway: Nebraska, Northwestern, Oregon, Penn State, Rutgers\nHome: Maryland, Michigan, Nebraska, Purdue, Washington\nAway: Michigan State, Northwestern, Ohio State, UCLA\nHome: Nebraska, Northwestern, Washington, Wisconsin\nAway: Maryland, Michigan State, Minnesota, Ohio State, UCLA\nHome: Iowa, Michigan State, Northwestern, Rutgers, USC\nAway: Indiana, Minnesota, Oregon, Penn State\nHome: Michigan State, Minnesota, Northwestern, Oregon, USC\nAway: Illinois, Indiana, Ohio State, Washington\nHome: Indiana, Iowa, Ohio State, Purdue, Rutgers\nAway: Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Oregon\nHome: Iowa, Maryland, Penn State, USC\nAway: Illinois, Michigan, Rutgers, UCLA, Wisconsin\nHome: Illinois, Rutgers, UCLA, Wisconsin\nAway: Indiana, Iowa, Ohio State, Purdue, USC\nHome: Illinois, Indiana, Ohio State, Wisconsin\nAway: Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Purdue, Washington\nHome: Illinois, Maryland, Michigan State, Ohio State, Washington\nAway: Michigan, Purdue, UCLA, Wisconsin\nHome: Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, Purdue\nAway: Michigan State, Northwestern, Oregon, Penn State\nHome: Illinois, Maryland, Ohio State, UCLA, Washington\nAway: Minnesota, Purdue, USC, Wisconsin\nHome: Nebraska, Northwestern, Oregon, Penn State\nAway: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan State, Ohio State, Wisconsin\nHome: Illinois, Minnesota, UCLA, Washington, Wisconsin\nAway: Maryland, Michigan State, Nebraska, USC\nHome: Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, USC\nAway: Nebraska, Penn State, Rutgers, Washington\nHome: Nebraska, Penn State, Rutgers, Wisconsin\nAway: Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, UCLA, Washington\nHome: Michigan, Northwestern, UCLA, USC\nAway: Indiana, Iowa, Oregon, Penn State, Rutgers\nHome: Minnesota, Oregon, Penn State, Purdue\nAway: Iowa, Nebraska, Northwestern, Rutgers, USC"}
{"title": "Ross Chastain is too busy to trade barbs with NASCAR rivals", "date": "2023-10-05 17:37:36", "text": "HUNTERSVILLE, N.C. -- Ross Chastain is very comfortable at Waffle House.\nThat is where he is seated on a Tuesday morning, two days after finishing dead last at Talladega, which happened one week after finishing second at Texas, and only five days ahead of Sunday's NASCAR playoff 12-teams-to-eight cutoff event on the Charlotte Motor Speedway Roval, where he will start the race sitting three positions and nine points on the wrong side of that elimination line. So close, but so much work to do.\nYet here the three-time Cup Series racer winner is, the maestro behind the Hail Melon maneuver at Martinsville Speedway one year ago that became a crossover social media sensation, calmly knocking down coffee, over-easy eggs, grits and a peanut-butter-smeared waffle. He's in a bright yellow booth that is sandwiched directly between an off-duty landscaping crew and four vacationing husbands who have chosen to sit across the restaurant from their wives. No one in the place, not the patrons, not the java-pouring server, not even the batter-splattered cook at the griddle, has any idea that there is a race car driver in their midst.\nAnd not just any stock car racer but NASCAR's current lightning rod.\nThe guy who inspires as many boos as cheers. See: the seemingly 50/50 split of praise and ridicule that followed the Hail Melon (and a NASCAR rule change to prevent it from happening again), even after it cut through the NFL noise to put NASCAR on the media map and earned him a spot in 2022's Championship Four.\nThe guy whose name now comes up even when he isn't involved. See: a NASCAR on Fox Instagram post of Saturday's Truck Series fight between Matt Crafton and Nick Sanchez that produced nearly 900 comments. The top comment reads: \"I don't know how but it was Chastain's fault.\"\nThe guy who can't seem to get through a month without eliciting barb-covered sound bites about him from the sport's biggest stars.\nMartin Truex Jr. in August: \"Get your s--- together.\"\nKyle Busch, same day: \"I got Chastained.\"\nDenny Hamlin on his podcast after a wreck with Chastain in March: \"I think that Ross doesn't like it when I speak his name in the media and when I have this microphone. I told him I have a microphone and I'm going to call it like I see it. Until you get a microphone, you can then say whatever you want about me.\"\nSitting here in this Waffle House booth north of Charlotte, Ross Chastain is given that microphone. A chance to smother and cover the NASCAR world with a sharpened, witty response. Tape is rolling. The platform of the Worldwide Leader in Sports awaits.\nBut his reaction is the same now as it has been whenever he received similar \"Here's a flamethrower\" invitations from other outlets and shows. He shakes his head and smiles.\n\"I'm good, man. I've got too much work to do,\" the driver from Florida says to ESPN. \"I don't know what a response to anything said about me is going to do. It would be easy, sure. It would be easy to fire back on Twitter or go on a radio show or podcast and respond to stuff that's been said about me, and I am sure that it would get a big response. A lot of clicks and likes and dislikes and whatever. For a few hours, maybe a day. But the next day, you know what? I would still have the same work to do, and now I'd be a day behind because I spent it doing all of that stuff that doesn't matter. The work matters.\"\nHe smiles again.\n\"The best response is in results, and the only way to achieve results is through hard work.\"\nChastain knows hard work. In fact, he has arrived here for late breakfast having already put in a day's worth of it. There's body work, which he has just done for a couple of hours on the basketball court under the eye of a former college coach. There's racing work, having already conferred with Josh Wise, former NASCAR competitor and USAC champion, who is now a driver development and performance adviser with Team Chevy, walking racers through their physical and mental preparation before each race.\nBy week's end Chastain will have also been coached up by everyone from crew chief Phil Surgen to Olympic speed skating legend Dan Jansen, a longtime Charlotte-area resident, who helps the racer dive even further into his physical and mental shape. All the while he is ingesting all the data he can possibly process from throughout 2023 as well as last year's Roval event, where he finished 37th. That won't be good enough this time around.\n\"It's a lot, but it's all right here,\" he says, thumping the cover of ... a leather-bound notebook? \"I write everything down in here. I'm old-school like that.\"\nRoss Chastain is old-school all the time. That's why he still loves Waffle House.\n\"Waffle House, or sausage, egg and cheese biscuit in the truck, or even a Snickers bar and a soda in the truck. That's breakfast, man,\" he says as he busts the yolk from the white. \"I don't eat this as much as I used to, but I probably still eat it more than I should. I guarantee you my dad and brother still had one of those combos this morning on the way to work.\"\nThat would be down in Punta Gorda, where father Ralph and brother Chad, six years younger, still spend their days farming, managing thousands of acres in South Florida that produce more than 2,000 watermelons per acre. The work is grueling, hot and intense.\nWhen Ralph started putting Ross to work as a kid, the problem was never getting his son to work, it was getting him to slow down. Whenever Ross was behind the wheel of one of the sawed-off school buses used to transport the melons or a tractor rigged to plow or grade land, the kid had his foot in the throttle, seeking to beat whoever was doing the same job a few rows over.\nThe Chastains, eighth-generation watermelon farmers, worked six days a week. On the seventh day, they rested. Ross slowed down only to park in front of the television to watch his hero Jeff Gordon battle rivals on the racetrack, beginning with Dale Earnhardt and Rusty Wallace and then on to the next-gen likes of Busch and Kevin Harvick.\n\"Every step of my ladder wasn't supposed to happen,\" he recalls now. \"When I was 12 and we started, we were just supposed to do some local racing in Florida and nothing else. Then we were like, 'You know what? Let's try the next level, just one race, just so we can say that we did it.' Then that turned into the next step and the next step and all along the way.\"\nThe watermelon industry, enamored with one of its own moving up the NASCAR ladder, started providing some financial help. That has been framed up by Chastain critics as a silver-spoon kid buying rides, but, spoiler alert, bringing sponsorship to help land gigs is the way of the motorsports world.\n\"There are plenty of guys with rich daddies backing up a truckload of cash that keeps the guy in that car even when he's clearly a total disaster,\" explained Stacy Compton, the former Cup Series racer and ESPN analyst, not long after giving Chastain his first ride in the NASCAR Truck Series in 2011, replacing just-departed Justin Marks. \"Then there are the guys who have just enough to get themselves into a car for a race or two and they know if they are bad, the money's going to run out, the ride is going back to the shop and they all disappear forever. That guy, the second guy, you are never going to outwork that guy because he is literally racing for his racing life.\"\nChastain has raced for his racing life for so long that he doesn't know how else to go about it. Since that debut for Compton on July 29, 2011, he has made 493 starts across NASCAR's three national series, and at one point he set the record for most consecutive starts in all of those series to start a single season. It took him 66 tries spread out over nine years to finally earn the first of his four Truck Series wins, 132 tries over five seasons to grab the first of his three Xfinity Series wins and 121 starts spread out over six years before he shocked the world with the first of his three Cup Series wins, on the road course in Austin, Texas, on March 27, 2022.\n\"What people don't see, and this isn't unique to me, but they don't see the fighting to make it, is that you spend your time between those races not working on racing,\" Chastain says, sitting up straight over his untouched toast. \"It's phone calls and sales calls and business meetings. That's what this notebook was full of then. And for every deal you get done, there are 10 times that many that don't. Or deals that do and then, for whatever reason, stuff beyond your control, they fall apart.\"\nThe Smash™️ pic.twitter.com/aBJ8e99Wgi\nHe says he felt an indescribable relief in 2021 when new boss Chip Ganassi told him to stop with all of that other stuff and just worry about racing. Then, at midseason, while at a test session, he learned that Ganassi had sold the team to Marks, the racer whose vacancy with Compton had given Chastain his big league break a decade earlier. Newly rebranded Trackhouse Racing was an unknown at best, and even after Chastain had been assured that he would still be with the team, switching from the No. 42 Chevy to the No. 1 in 2022, the arrival of NASCAR's one-size-fits-all Next Gen car was the biggest unknown of them all.\n\"When 2022 started, we knew we had a little bit of an edge and I could feel it as soon as we started unloading for practice at the racetrack every weekend,\" Chastain remembers now of the season when he won not once but twice, including the Hail Melon and his rise through the ranks, to the ire of those who characterized it as reckless. \"I remember feeling this super-intense feeling of, 'Man, you'd better take advantage of this now because you don't know how long this is going to last.' So, yeah, as a driver, I attacked. If there was an opening, I was driving it in there. I was driving like I had better do it now because one day it might all go away. And that's how I felt.\"\nIt's a feeling straight from the farm. Watermelons are harvested only 100 days per year. Anyone who doesn't figure out how to get all they can out of those 100 days will spend the other 265 sifting through the want ads.\n\"This year, as the other teams have caught up to us, you have to change the way you approach the day,\" Chastain says. \"When you don't have the fastest car every week, you can't be in attack mode all the time. You pick your spots. But when you are there, when the chance comes, you can't hesitate. If you do, someone else won't and it's gone.\"\nChastain has only recently been introduced to the term \"imposter syndrome,\" explained to him by his longtime girlfriend, Erika Anne Turner. The official definition, as written by the National Library of Medicine is \"a behavioral health phenomenon described as self-doubt of intellect, skills or accomplishments among high-achieving individuals.\" In other words, a fear of being exposed as a fraud, even among people whose accomplishments are many and indisputable.\nIn the NASCAR garage, a world full of rags-to-riches stories, it is a common refrain and feeling. Richard Childress, a high school dropout who has gone on to win six Cup Series titles as a team owner and made countless millions across multiple industries, speaks of recurring dreams that he is in his office when people rush in and begin taking everything away, telling him the jig is up and he has to go back to being homeless in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Childress says Dale Earnhardt confessed to having the same feelings.\nIt isn't a long psychological walk to understand that anyone who keeps that kind of feeling compartmentalized all the time would, like Chastain, employ every type of coach he can; take every ride he can every weekend, even if it doesn't pay; and spend his own money jetting to driving schools to drive Mazda Miatas around road courses, all in an effort to find the edge that will keep him not even up front but gainfully employed.\n\"I don't have any doubt that I should be here, but yes, there is always that feeling of not being here tomorrow,\" Chastain says in reaction to a discussion about Childress' and Earnhardt's fears. \"I absolutely catch myself looking around on Sundays and thinking, 'Man, I am out here racing with Kevin Harvick! And Denny Hamlin! And Kyle Busch!' I can't believe it. It's the dream, the dream I had as a kid, and you don't want to wake up from it.\"\nThat dream, the one conjured up by the kid racing roofless school buses full of watermelons through the fields of Punta Gorda, did not include being called out publicly by those same drivers, but that's the reality of life as the Melon Man. A student of NASCAR history, he also knows he is in good company. Harvick, Hamlin, Busch, Brad Keselowski and even Gordon, they all spent their formative Cup Series days having to race amid scoldings from their elders and contemporaries. In a way, it's the ultimate compliment, no matter how much it might hurt.\nSometimes, they even turn into actual compliments. Just last week, Hamlin said of Chastain's current NASCAR playoffs effort: \"The dude keeps making chicken salad out of chicken s---, most weeks. I mean, he does. Not saying his car is chicken s---, but where [Trackhouse] is at, he's optimizing his day 95% of the time.\"\nChastain knows it all. He reads it all. He is aware of when he has won over the legends and he is aware of when he has pissed them off. He also knows he is perfectly capable of defending himself. We all do. Just ask Noah Gragson.\nBut don't bother trying to bait him into doing so at the Huntersville Waffle House. There is too much to do.\n\"I can't race any harder or work any harder than I already do,\" he says, throwing his napkin like a syrup-stained surrender flag onto the table. Ross Chastain is officially looking ahead to Sunday, merely the latest chapter in a lifetime of racing do-or-dies. \"But I can race smarter. That work is never done.\""}
{"title": "The offseason in five minutes: Everything you need to know", "date": "2023-10-05 15:51:36", "text": "The 2022-23 season ended with the most-viewed women's college basketball game on record as the national championship returned to network television for the first time since 1995. Broadcast on ABC and ESPN2, 9.9 million viewers tuned in as LSU beat Iowa 102-85.\nWhat has happened since then? Glad you asked.\nWe head into 2023-24 with LSU ranked No. 1 in ESPN's Way-Too-Early Top 25. For the second straight offseason, coach Kim Mulkey cleaned up in the transfer portal to make the Tigers -- who have Final Four Most Outstanding Player Angel Reese back -- the favorites on the road to Cleveland, where the national semifinals and title game will be played April 5-7 at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.\nDespite big personnel losses, led by WNBA Rookie of the Year Aliyah Boston, South Carolina -- which spent all last season at No. 1 before losing in the Final Four -- will still be in the hunt. With Paige Bueckers, who missed last season because of an ACL injury, and Azzi Fudd, who was limited to 15 games by knee issues, back and healthy, UConn is another front-runner as the Huskies pursue a 12th national championship.\nBut while some things remain the same ... along comes conference realignment. Stanford seeks one more Pac-12 title before the conference as we know it dissolves. Stanford's next stop, incongruous as this is, is the ACC. UCLA, expected to be Stanford's biggest Pac-12 challenger, is headed to the Big Ten next season. But more on that in a minute.\nIowa senior Caitlin Clark, the NCAA tournament supernova and reigning national player of the year, is back -- maybe for more than this season. Clark's incoming freshman class of 2020-21 is the last that can use the COVID-19 waiver to return for a fifth year, so WNBA teams likely will have to wait until the end of the college season to find out exactly which players -- such as Bueckers, Clark, Reese and Stanford's Cameron Brink -- are in the draft pool and potential lottery picks.\nBut before we tip off the new season on Nov. 6, ESPN's Michael Voepel, Alexa Philippou and Charlie Creme look at what has gone on since LSU hoisted the NCAA trophy, and how it impacts the coming season.\n\nJump to:\nHeadlines | Key transfers, coaching news, recruits | Bracketology risers and fallers\nOn \"The Paul Finebaum Show,\" Carolyn Peck explains why the talented Gamecocks and a gritty Tennessee will be stiff competition for the reigning national champs.\nLSU gets even better\nThe transfer portal has been kind of like free agency in college, and more than 1,000 players entered the portal this past offseason. LSU bringing in Hailey Van Lith from Louisville and Aneesah Morrow from DePaul gave the Tigers the \"portal championship\" a year after they did the same with Reese from Maryland in summer 2022. More on the other biggest transfers below.\nUConn back to full strength?\nWhile UConn's absurd streak of 14 consecutive Final Four appearances came to an end, the Huskies seem due for better luck after two seasons of multiple injuries.\nBueckers was national player of the year as a freshman and then battled through injuries to get UConn to the NCAA championship game as a sophomore. The Huskies missed her last season, but she seems to have gone through rehab well, is cleared to play and is ready to regain her status as one of the college game's biggest stars.\nSo long, Pac-12\nWe should have seen it coming when UCLA and USC announced in summer 2022 that they were headed to the Big Ten. The Pac-12 was crumbling, with the walls officially tumbling in summer 2023. With four teams headed to the Big Ten, four to the Big 12, two to the ACC and two others with an uncertain future, the Pac-12's swan song in 2023-24 is an ode to how football and television revenue have rendered geographic ties in college almost irrelevant.\nWell-played, Big 12\nIn summer 2010, the Big 12 appeared on the verge of collapse. It survived with 10 teams, and now will be adding Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah next season, putting the league at 16 teams after Texas and Oklahoma depart for the SEC. From a women's hoops perspective, the league will miss the Longhorns and Sooners, but the Utes (No. 5 in ESPN rankings) and Buffaloes (No. 22) are having program resurgences. And Arizona is just a few years removed from its appearance in the 2021 NCAA final.\n\nKa-ching!\nThe college world has changed with Name, Image and Likeness opportunities, especially for the bigger stars in women's sports. Players such as Reese and Clark have spent time since the national championship game shooting television commercials and being paid for appearing at events. -- Voepel\nCheck out highlights from No. 1 recruit Lauren Betts as she announces her intention to transfer from Stanford.\nAny discussion of the biggest player and coach news this offseason must start with LSU. Not only did Mulkey get the two best players in the transfer portal, she signed the No. 1 recruiting class, including two -- Mikaylah Williams and Aalyah Del Rosario -- of the top seven players in the 2023 class. Then early last month, the four-time national championship coach got a 10-year, $36 million contract extension, making her the highest paid coach in women's basketball.\nOut west, meanwhile, Lauren Betts' decision to leave Stanford for UCLA could signal a power shift in the Pac-12. The 6-foot-7 center was the top recruit in 2022 (and No. 3 in our transfer rankings) and had a promising showing for Team USA at the AmeriCup.\nAside from LSU, a handful of SEC schools did everything they could to keep up in the transfer portal:\nTennessee, seeking its first Final Four since 2008, when the Lady Vols won their eighth title, added a new backcourt. Destinee Wells (Belmont) and Jewel Spear (Wake Forest) are two scoring guards, something the Lady Vols have lacked in recent years.\nOle Miss brought in three new starters, and coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin didn't even need that many. Fresh off their first Sweet 16 since 2007, the Rebels have Kennedy Todd-Williams (North Carolina), KK Deans (Florida) and Kharyssa Richardson (Auburn) on what is now a deep and versatile roster.\nJoni Taylor joins \"The Paul Finebaum Show\" and reflects on Texas A&M's expectations, while emphasizing the spirit of coaching among the best in the SEC.\nOutside the SEC, TCU underwent the biggest shake-up from the end of the regular season until now. Of the more than four dozen Division I coaching changes this offseason, Mark Campbell from Sacramento State to the Horned Frogs has had the biggest impact so far.\nAfter seven years as an assistant at Oregon in which he spearheaded the recruitment of Sabrina Ionescu, Ruthy Hebard and Satou Sabally, and then two seasons with Hornets, which included the program's only NCAA tournament appearance, Campbell has already reformed TCU without even coaching a game. He plucked Jaden Owens (Baylor), Madison Conner (Arizona), Agnes Emma-Nnopu (Stanford) and Sedona Prince (Oregon) out of the portal, significantly improving a roster that went 1-17 in the Big 12 a year ago. -- Creme\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nAfter South Carolina's Boston, Laeticia Amihere, Zia Cooke, Brea Beal and Victaria Saxton were all selected in the 2023 WNBA draft, a changing of the guard is headed to Columbia this fall. Dawn Staley has plenty of reinforcements ready to take the mantle, such as center Kamilla Cardoso and point guard Raven Johnson, but she also brings in the nation's No. 2-ranked recruiting class and was active in the transfer portal, signing Te-Hina Paopao from Oregon as well as Sakima Walker, the 2023 NJCAA player of the year.\n\nIn the Pac-12, USC returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2014 and will look for its first appearance in the Associated Press preseason poll since 2011. Now the legendary program adds No. 1 overall recruit Juju Watkins and several experienced players from the portal. It is unclear if/when Aaliyah Gayles will make her college debut after recovering from being shot 10 times at a party in April 2022, but social media indicates she has been practicing. -- Philippou\nHow different did our projections look between our April 18 update shortly after LSU hoisted the NCAA trophy to our latest field of 68 on Sept. 19? These were the biggest women's Bracketology movers.\nBiggest riser: TCU\nNR to No. 41/projected Last Four Byes\nAs mentioned above, Campbell has reshaped the Horned Frogs into a veteran, NCAA tournament-worthy team. Once he finished all his work in the transfer portal, TCU was a No. 11 seed in last month's projection.\nOther risers\nMississippi State: No. 37/projected Last Four Byes to No. 21/projected No. 6 seed\nAfter two wins in the NCAA tournament, the Bulldogs upgraded their talent, too. Lauren Park-Lane (Seton Hall), Darrione Rogers (DePaul) and Erynn Barnum (Arkansas) will give the offense more punch. The Bulldogs were already a tournament team, but Sam Purcell pushed his Bulldogs more safely into the field.\nTexas A&M: No. 44/projected Last Four In to No. 28/projected No. 7 seed\nThe Aggies were too young a year ago and finished 9-20. So Joni Taylor made it a priority to bring in some experience. Graduate student Endyia Rogers (Oregon), senior Aicha Coulibaly (Auburn) and redshirt junior Lauren Ware (Arizona) give Taylor some veterans to put around ultra-talented sophomore Janiah Barker.\nBiggest faller: Arkansas\nFrom No. 26/projected No. 7 seed to No. 44/projected Last Four In\nWhen Barnum left the Razorbacks for Mississippi State, she helped elevate the Bulldogs and left Arkansas without a proven go-to scorer.\nOther fallers\nNC State: From No. 25/projected No. 7 seed to No. 33/projected No. 9 seed\nThe Wolfpack got passed by a few teams because of portal inactivity. After losing Jakia Brown-Turner to Maryland, NC State didn't add anyone of impact. -- Creme"}

The 2022-23 America East all-conference first-teamer will play under new coach Nathan Davis this season.\nTop competition: Earl Timberlake, Bryant Bulldogs (13.8 PPG, 8.4 RPG)\n \nArmando Bacot | 6-11 | F | North Carolina Tar Heels\nAlthough the Heels failed to make the NCAA tournament despite entering the 2022-23 season as the No. 1 team in America, Bacot (15.9 PPG, 10.4 RPG) undeniably is one of the top returning players in the country.\nTop competition: Kyle Filipowski, Duke Blue Devils (15.1 PPG, 9.0 RPG)\n \nDemarcus Sharp | 6-3 | G | Austin Peay Governors\nLast season's Southland Player of the Year (19.5 PPG, 5.0 RPG, 5.0 APG at Northwestern State now bring his talents to Austin Peay, where he'll try to reenergize a program that finished 9-22 in 2022-23.\nTop competition: Devontae Blanton, Eastern Kentucky Colonels (16.9 PPG, 37% from the 3-point line)\n \nDaRon Holmes II | 6-10 | F | Dayton Flyers\nA year after securing all-Atlantic 10 first-team honors, Holmes (18.4 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 1.9 BPG) hopes to lead Dayton to its first NCAA tournament since 2017.\nTop competition: James Bishop IV, George Washington Revolutionaries (21.6 PPG, 5.2 APG)\n \nTyler Kolek | 6-3 | G | Marquette Golden Eagles\nA thumb injury hindered the reigning Big East player of the year in the 2023 NCAA tournament, but Kolek (12.9 PPG, 7.5 APG, 40% from 3) is back to help Marquette chase its first Final Four appearance since 2003.\nTop competition: Ryan Kalkbrenner, Creighton Bluejays (15.9 PPG, 6.1 RPG, 2.1 BPG)\n \nDillon Jones | 6-6 | G | Weber State Wildcats\nThe all-Big Sky first-teamer last season (16.7 PPG, 10.9 RPG) tested the NBA draft waters and even had a strong showing at the G League Elite Camp and NBA draft combine -- but ultimately chose to return to Weber State, where he aims to lead the program to its first NCAA tournament appearance since 2016.\nTop competition: Aanen Moody, Montana Grizzlies (16.1 PPG, 41% from beyond the arc)\n \nDrew Pember | 6-11 | C | UNC Asheville Bulldogs\nThe reigning Big South Player of the Year (21.0 PPG, 9.2 RPG, 38% from 3) returns to anchor a team that hopes to hit the trifecta again with another league championship, conference tournament title and NCAA tournament appearance.\nTop competition: DaQuan Smith, Radford Highlanders (13.9 PPG, 40% from 3)\n \nHunter Dickinson | 7-1 | C | Kansas Jayhawks\nKansas will follow Dickinson (18.5 PPG, 9.0 RPG, 1.8 BPG), an all-Big Ten second-teamer in 2022-23 and the most coveted prospect in the transfer portal this offseason, as it attempts to win its second national championship in three seasons.\nTop competition: Max Abmas, Texas Longhorns (21.9 PPG, 37% from beyond the arc at Oral Roberts)\n \nZach Edey | 7-4 | C | Purdue Boilermakers\nWith another stellar performance, Edey (22.3 PPG, 12.9 RPG, 2.1 BPG) could become the first player to win the Wooden Award in consecutive years since Ralph Sampson pulled off the feat 40 years ago. He could also help erase the memory of that first-round loss to Fairleigh Dickinson with a deep run in the NCAA tournament.\nTop competition: Terrence Shannon Jr., Illinois Fighting Illini (17.2 PPG, 4.6 RPG)\n \nAjay Mitchell | 6-4 | G | UC Santa Barbara Gauchos\nMitchell (16.3 PPG, 5.1 APG), who led the Gauchos to a conference tournament crown and NCAA tournament appearance last season, will chase his second consecutive Big West Player of the Year award.\nTop competition: Elijah Pepper, UC Davis Aggies (22.5 PPG, 5.9 RPG)\n \nTyler Thomas | 6-3 | G | Hofstra Pride\nThe all-CAA second-teamer last season (16.5 PPG, 41% from 3) has one goal: to carry Hofstra to its first NCAA tournament appearance (the school won the CAA title in 2020 and would have played had the NCAA tournament not been canceled due to COVID-19) since 2001.\nTop competition: Charles Thompson, Towson Tigers (12.2 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 1.7 BPG)\n \nDontaie Allen | 6-6 | G | Western Kentucky Hilltoppers\nIn February and March, the former Kentucky guard began to hit his stride, seeing four games with 17 points or more. That momentum could propel Allen (9.3 PPG, 38% from the 3-point line) to new heights under new head coach Steve Lutz.\nTop competition: Kyle Rode, Liberty Flames (10.9 PPG, 40% from the 3-point line)\n \nBJ Freeman | 6-6 | G | Milwaukee Panthers\nFreeman showed his promise with a 43-point performance in a win over Stetson in last season's CBI. The guard, who averaged 18.22 PPG, could now help lead a program that's on an upward trajectory (22-12, 14-6 league) to its first NCAA tournament appearance in a decade.\nTop competition: Marques Warrick, Northern Kentucky Norse (18.8 PPG, 38% from the 3-point line)\n \nMatt Knowling | 6-5 | F | Yale Bulldogs\nThe all-Ivy League first-teamer (13.6 PPG) headlines a squad of key returners who were instrumental in winning the regular-season title. They missed out on the 2023 NCAA tournament following a nine-point loss to rival Princeton in the conference tournament championship.\nTop competition: Matt Allocco, Princeton Tigers (10.7 PPG, 38.3% from beyond the arc)\n \nMervin James | 6-7 | F | Rider Broncs\nThe all-MAAC second-teamer led Rider to a 13-7 record last season (second place in the league). Couple that with the departure of Rick Pitino and the exodus of transfers out of Iona, and the door is open for James and the Broncs to win top MAAC honors.\nTop competition: Dakota Leffew, Mount St. Mary's Mountaineers (13.1 PPG, 38% from beyond the arc)\n \nEnrique Freeman | 6-7 | C | Akron Zips\nAn all-MAC first-teamer last season, Freeman (16.8 PPG, 11.2 RPG, 1.2 BPG) anchors an Akron squad that could conquer the league and win the regular-season crown for the first time since 2020.\nTop competition: Jaylin Hunter, Ohio Bobcats (13.2 PPG, 41% from 3)\n \nShy Odom | 6-6 | F | Howard Bison\nThe buzz around Odom's MEAC Player of the Year potential in 2023-24 increased when he led notched 15 points (5-for-9) and eight rebounds in the 16-seed's 96-68 loss to 1-seed Kansas in the first round of last year's NCAA tournament.\nTop competition: Martaz Robinson, Delaware State Hornets (11.8 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 1.5 SPG)\n \nTucker DeVries | 6-7 | F | Drake Bulldogs\nIt would be difficult to topple the reigning MVC player of the year, who returns after averaging 18.6 PPG (37% from the 3-point line) and leading his team to the NCAA tournament.\nTop competition: Bowen Born, Northern Iowa Panthers (17.9 PPG, 37% from 3)\n \nJamal Mashburn Jr. | 6-2 | G | New Mexico Lobos\nThe son of former NBA and Kentucky star Jamal Mashburn Sr. is a potent scorer (19.1 PPG, 38% from 3) and hopes to position his team to compete for a Mountain West championship.\nTop competition: Tyson Degenhart, Boise State Broncos (14.1 PPG)\n \nNico Galette | 6-6 | F | Sacred Heart Pioneers\nThe all-NEC first-teamer (15.4 PPG, 6.7 RPG) scored in double figures 30 times and recorded four double-doubles last seasons, making him one of the top returning mid-major stars in the country.\nTop competition: Ansley Almonor, Fairleigh Dickinson Knights (13.6 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 38% from the 3-point line)\n \nMark Freeman | 5-10 | G | Morehead State Eagles\nHead coach Preston Spradlin told ESPN.com this summer that Freeman (15.0 PPG, 3.7 APG) has continued to improve from last season. That's significant for a player who easily won 2022-23 OVC Player of the Year honors.\nTop competition: Ray'Sean Taylor, SIU Edwardsville Cougars (15.5 PPG, 4.1 RPG)\n \nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nOumar Ballo | 7-0 | C | Arizona Wildcats\nBallo (14.2 PPG, 8.6 RPG), an all-Pac-12 first-teamer last season, is a lock to win this award this year -- especially if he connects on 65% of his shots inside the arc the way he did in 2022-23.\nTop competition: Boogie Ellis, USC Trojans (17.7 PPG, 39% from the 3-point line)\n \nKeegan Records | 6-10 | F | Colgate Raiders\nA year after helping Colgate win the Patriot League's regular-season and conference tournament crowns, Records (13.0 PPG, 6.0 RPG, 1.3 BPG) could very well orchestrate a repeat.\nTop competition: Keith Higgins Jr., Lehigh Mountain Hawks (14.7 PPG, 41% from beyond the arc)\n \nWade Taylor IV | 6-0 | G | Texas A&M Aggies\nThe all-SEC first-teamer (16.3 PPG, 3.9 APG) led Texas A&M to the NCAA tournament last season, finishing the 2022-23 campaign with 20 points or more in 12 games. It's likely he can accomplish something similar this season.\nTop competition: Santiago Vescovi, Tennessee Volunteers (12.5 PPG, 37% from the 3-point line)\n \nTre Jackson | 6-1 | G | Western Carolina Catamounts\nJackson (15.8 PPG, 43% from beyond the arc) is the leader of a Western Carolina team that returns the bulk of its starting rotation.

But he was already a contender before they left, thanks to a sizzling February and March (20.4 PPG over the last nine games of the 2022-23 season).\nTop competition: Parker Bjorklund, St. Thomas-Minnesota Tommies (22.8 PPG, 8.3 RPG)\n \nAustin Crowley | 6-5 | G | Southern Miss Golden Eagles\nThe all-Sun Belt first-teamer returns to avenge a 4-for-13 performance in a first-round Sun Belt Conference tournament loss to South Alabama -- the same loss that sent the league's regular-season champs home much earlier than anticipated.\nTop competition: Donovan Gregory, Appalachian State Mountaineers (12.5 PPG, 4.3 APG)\n \nPJ Henry | 5-10 | G | Texas Southern Tigers\nFor the last three years, Texas Southern has won the SWAC tournament, and therefore the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. The return of Henry (12.4 PPG) could lead to a fourth consecutive berth for coach Johnny Jones' squad.\nTop competition: Jeremiah Kendall, Alcorn State Braves (11.1 PPG, 6.7 RPG)\n \nRayshon Harrison | 6-4 | G | Grand Canyon Lopes\nHe was an all-WAC first-teamer last season after averaging 17.8 PPG and 4.0 RPG, and leading his team to the NCAA tournament. With his return to college basketball, Harrison hopes to prove his 20-point effort in the Lopes' 82-70 loss to Gonzaga in the first round wasn't a fluke.\nTop competition: Cameron Tyson, Seattle U Redhawks (18.6 PPG, 4.4 RPG)\n \nAidan Mahaney | 6-3 | G | Saint Mary's Gaels\nWith Drew Timme gone, Mahaney (13.9 PPG, 40% from the 3-point line) could emerge as the face of West Coast Conference basketball -- particularly if he can lead the Gaels to another conference title (they shared the crown with Gonzaga last season) and an NCAA tournament berth.\nTop competition: Ryan Nembhard, Gonzaga Bulldogs (12.1 PPG, 4.8 APG at Creighton)"}
{"title": "All the biggest storylines of the 2023-24 offseason", "date": "2023-10-05 15:51:23", "text": "Has it really only been six months?\nThe buzzer sounded on UConn's win over San Diego State in the men's college basketball national championship game exactly six months ago -- but the entire landscape of the sport has changed in that time. Rick Pitino is back in the big time; Bob Huggins is no longer coaching. Arizona will be headed to the Big 12; the Pac-12 is essentially no more. More than 1,800 players entered the transfer portal; another couple hundred turned pro.\nSimply put, there's been an incredible amount of change.\nBut before we turn the page and fully look ahead to the 2023-24 season, which tips off Nov. 6, let's take stock of exactly what happened in the past six months.\nIf the last thing you remember about college hoops is confetti falling from the NRG Stadium rafters after the Huskies won their fifth national championship in 25 years, ESPN's men's college basketball experts -- Jeff Borzello, John Gasaway, Joe Lunardi and Myron Medcalf -- are here to help you catch up.\nJump to:\nBiggest headlines | Coach & player movements | Bracketology risers and fallers | High school recruiting spotlights\n \nLeBron James says his son Bronny has begun his rehab process so he can play with USC this season.\nBronny James suffers cardiac incident\nDuring a July team workout at USC, the 5-star recruit and son of LeBron James collapsed after suffering cardiac arrest. James is recovering and attending his classes on campus. But his basketball future -- his father has said he hopes to one day play with Bronny in the NBA -- is unclear, per a recent statement from the university.\nHunter Dickinson picks Kansas\nIn May, the former Michigan star and top recruit in the transfer portal picked the Jayhawks over multiple suitors coveting the big man who averaged 18.5 points and 9.0 rebounds last season. In interviews, Dickinson implied his decision was partly influenced by name, image and likeness (NIL) opportunities. His arrival likely elevates Kansas, which returns Dajuan Harris Jr. and K.J. Adams Jr., to the No. 1 spot in every reputable preseason poll.\nZach Edey, Donovan Clingan and Kyle Filipowski return\nThe current state of big men in college basketball is strong with three elite players returning for another season. Edey, the Purdue star who won the Wooden Award last season, is back to help a Purdue squad that suffered a historic upset against 16-seed Fairleigh Dickinson in the 2023 NCAA tournament. Clingan, the 7-footer who averaged 1.8 blocks in just 13.1 minutes per game, will attempt to lead UConn to a second consecutive national title. And Filipowski, who is currently recovering from hip surgery, will try to lead Duke to its second Final Four appearance since 2015.\nControversy surrounds Rick Pitino hiring at St. John's\nIn three years at Iona, Pitino led the Gaels to two league titles and two NCAA tournament appearances. Pitino repeatedly stated he was content at the New Rochelle, New York, school and had no interest in other jobs. But he was eventually wooed by St. John's, which is just 30 minutes from his hometown of Oyster Bay, New York. The Hall of Fame coach has already made a massive impact in the transfer portal, adding Harvard star Chris Ledlum (18.8 PPG) and Penn's Jordan Dingle (23.4 PPG) along with other standouts who should immediately boost the Red Storm in the Big East race. But Mike Anderson, St. John's former head coach, has sued the school in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, claiming the school fired him for cause without justification.\nJahvon Quinerly picks Memphis Tigers\nLast season, the guard was critical to Alabama's NCAA tournament run, but he announced he would transfer to his third school when he committed to Penny Hardaway in July. As a grad transfer, Quinerly is immediately eligible for the squad that last season allowed former SMU transfer Kendric Davis to blossom. Quinerly, who averaged 8.7 PPG in Tuscaloosa last season, joins a nucleus that could include 27-year-old DeAndre Williams -- provided he is granted a waiver to play another season.\nChris \"Mad Dog\" Russo sounds off on the lack of rivalries between the teams heading to the Big Ten and Big 12 in 2024.\nBig 12 becomes superconference, rejects Gonzaga, UConn\nIn August, Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark announced that talks with Gonzaga and UConn about joining the league ended after the conference decided to add four Pac-12 squads. While the Zags and Huskies would have strengthened men's basketball in a league that is arguably the nation's best, pound-for-pound, the additions of Arizona, Arizona State, Utah and Colorado in 2024-25 also enhance the league. With Houston, BYU, Cincinnati and UCF all joining this season, the Big 12 will boast seven teams that finished 2022-23 within the top 30 on KenPom.\nMikey Williams' basketball career jeopardized by gun incident\nWith millions of followers on social media, the four-star recruit and Memphis commit was well-known even outside of basketball when he was in high school. But Williams' college hoops career is now on hold. Earlier this year, Williams was charged with six felonies after he allegedly fired a weapon at multiple individuals who had come to his San Diego home. He pled not guilty in the initial court hearing, but Memphis released a statement last week saying Williams will not be with the team until there is a resolution in his legal case.\nEd Cooley leaves Providence for Georgetown\nFor more than a decade, Cooley was the face of Providence basketball in his hometown. Under him, the Friars reached the NCAA tournament seven times. But his bond with the late John Thompson contributed to his shocking decision to accept the head coaching job at Georgetown. Providence officials and fans were blindsided by the move, which now gives Georgetown a proven leader as it attempts to rebuild the program following the turbulent Patrick Ewing era. -- Medcalf\n \nThe biggest movement of the summer was actually an exit. Bob Huggins entered the offseason No. 3 all time in career wins as a Division I men's coach, behind only Mike Krzyzewski and Jim Boeheim. Now, well, he's still No. 3, but that number for wins (935) will stay where it is until further notice.\nHuggins appeared to resign as West Virginia coach on June 17 after he was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence. Then, in early July, he insisted he never formally resigned. Cue the lawyers. But Huggins is out, and Josh Eilert is interim head coach of the Mountaineers.\nNor should we look past a very different and truly historic offseason movement, one 65 years in the making. On June 8, the NCAA announced that all numbers from 0 to 99 will once again be permitted on men's college basketball jerseys. We haven't seen a 6, 7, 8 or 9 on the floor since Bill Russell rocked No. 6 for the San Francisco Dons in the 1950s.\nWho will be the first player to follow in George Mikan's footsteps with a No. 99 in hoops? The new season will literally look different than anything many of us have seen before. -- Gasaway\n \nRick Pitino chats on \"SportsCenter\" about why he decided to become the next coach at St. John's.\nIt's both embarrassing and instructive to look back at where we ranked teams at the start of the offseason versus now, with the tip off of a new season right around the corner. Alas, that is the assignment, and here are the results:\nBIGGEST RISER: St. John's Red Storm (No. 170 to No. 45, projected Last Four In). The Red Storm fired Mike Anderson on March 10 and needed only 10 days to lure Rick Pitino from New Rochelle (and Iona) to Queens. Myron covered the larger St. John's saga above, but suffice to say, Pitino's pursuit of an NCAA tournament bid -- and beyond -- for the Red Storm will be among the major storylines of the 2023-24 campaign.\nOTHER RISERS:\nIllinois Fighting Illini (No. 74 to No. 18, projected 5-seed). Illinois gained ground by essentially standing still, retaining 6-foot-6 senior Terrence Shannon Jr. and 6-10 junior Coleman Hawkins, a pair of standouts who figured to leave the program at the end of last season. Now, the Illini have the experience and production to challenge presumptive Big Ten favorites Purdue and Michigan State.\nMississippi State Bulldogs (No. 78 to No. 29, projected 8-seed). The Bulldogs already overachieved in Year 1 under Chris Jans, reaching the NCAA First Four. The surprising return of 6-2 senior Dashawn Davis, a presumed departure, means the trend line points even further up in Starkville.\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\nNorthwestern Wildcats (No. 76 to No. 32, projected 8-seed)\nOregon Ducks (No. 75 to No. 34, projected 9-seed)\nKansas State Wildcats (No. 70 to No. 41, projected First Four)\nVirginia Cavaliers (No. 72 to No. 43, projected First Four)\nStanford Cardinal (No. 77 to No. 49, projected First Four Out)\nNew Mexico Lobos (No. 95 to No. 50, projected Next Four Out)\nUtah Utes (No. 81 to No. 53)\nSeton Hall Pirates (No. 84 to No. 56)\nLSU Tigers (No. 96 to No. 64)\nNevada Wolf Pack (No. 121 to No. 68)\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems »\n• Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams »\n• NBA training camp cheat sheets »\n More ESPN+ content »\nBIGGEST FALLER: Washington State Cougars (from No. 42, projected 11-seed, to No. 76). The Cougars' best players are now in Atlanta (Mouhamed Gueye, NBA Hawks), in Cleveland (Justin Powell, NBA Cavaliers), at Villanova (TJ Bamba, transfer portal) and at USC (DJ Rodman, transfer portal). The Cougars also don't have a conference after this season. Other than that ...\nOTHER FALLERS:\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish (from No. 183 to No. 214). The rebuilding Irish were always going to be a heavy lift for new coach Micah Shrewsberry. The loss of grad transfer Cormac Ryan to North Carolina makes the start of the post-Mike Brey era that much harder.\nMiami Hurricanes (from No. 10, projected 3-seed, to No. 33, projected 9-seed). Folks remain justifiably high on the Hurricanes, but it's hard not to forecast at least a one-season drop after a Final Four finish led by ACC player of the year Isaiah Wong, subsequently picked by the Indiana Pacers in the NBA draft.\nMORE FALLERS:\nUCLA Bruins (from No. 11, projected 3-seed, to No. 25, projected 7-seed)\nProvidence Friars (from No. 32, projected 8-seed, to No. 44, projected Last Four In)\nRutgers Scarlet Knights (from No. 35, projected 89-seed, to No. 47, projected First Four Out)\nOhio State Buckeyes (from No. 36, projected 9-seed, to No. 48, projected First Four Out)\nBoise State Broncos (from No. 38, projected 10-seed, to No. 52, projected Next Four Out)\nMichigan Wolverines (from No. 43, projected First Four, to No. 61)\nVirginia Tech Hokies (from No. 44, projected First Four, to No. 60)\n-- Lunardi\n \nCooper Flagg shows out with three nice dunks before playing in the SLAM Summer Classic.\nRon Holland decommits from Texas, goes pro\nHolland -- now the projected No. 1 pick in the 2024 NBA draft -- was expected to be the cornerstone of Texas' 2023-24 roster. He committed to the Longhorns in November and stayed committed, despite Chris Beard's firing. After weeks of speculation, however, the No. 2-ranked recruit in the 2024 class announced in late April he was reopening his recruitment. One month later, Holland chose to play for the G League Ignite.\nBronny James signs with USC\nJames' cardiac arrest was the biggest story of the summer, but his recruitment was one of the biggest stories of the spring. He became a legitimate five-star prospect and a projected first-round draft pick during his high school senior season then impressed at the postseason all-star games. There was very little concrete information about his recruitment, but USC emerged as the favorite over the final weeks and ultimately beat out Oregon and Ohio State.\nMackenzie Mgbako flips from Duke to Indiana\nOn the same day that Kyle Filipowski announced he was returning to Duke, Mgbako -- a top-10 recruit in the 2024 class -- requested a release from his letter of intent to the Blue Devils. He considered several schools following his decommitment, including Kansas, St. John's and Louisville, but picked Mike Woodson and Indiana, where he should immediately be a go-to scorer.\nCooper Flagg cements himself as the No. 1 recruit -- and reclassifies to 2024\nFlagg was the story of the summer in the recruiting world. Entering July, there was a debate over which player was the best in high school basketball: Flagg, Cameron Boozer or A.J. Dybantsa. A couple of weeks later, there was a clear winner. Flagg averaged 25.4 points, 13 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 6.9 blocks at the prestigious Nike EYBL Peach Jam, including three triple-doubles. He then moved from the 2025 class into the 2024 class, and Flagg is in the process of taking his official visits. He went to UConn in late September, and he will head Duke this month. -- Borzello"}
{"title": "Wood: Difficult to keep making weight, moving up after Warrington title defense", "date": "2023-10-05 16:31:25", "text": "Leigh Wood believes Saturday's world title defense could be his last as making the featherweight limit is becoming increasingly difficult for him.\nWood (27-3, 16 KOs), the WBA featherweight champion and ESPN's No. 2 at 126 pounds, defends his title against English rival Josh Warrington (31-2-1, 8 KOs) on Saturday at the Sheffield Arena in Sheffield, England.\nWood, 35, managed his weight perfectly for his last outing in May, which resulted in an impressive performance as he contained and outpointed the dangerous Mauricio Lara after flooring him early on. The Mexican went into the fight as ESPN's No. 1 at featherweight after stopping Wood in the seventh round of their first fight in February, but was stripped of the belt the day before for missing the weight.\n\"It gets harder every time to make the featherweight limit,\" Wood told ESPN. \"The last time against Lara was harder than before and Lara not making the weight made me feel even more sorry for myself. I know what it is like.\n\"I'm 35 now and I've been making this weight for a long time, it doesn't get easier. I think it takes a little bit out of me and I would be stronger at junior lightweight, definitely. There's nothing more I can cut, except if I was to cut an arm off.\"\nFor Wood, the climax of his career could be at junior lightweight even if he beats Leeds native Warrington. Both are two-time world champions in the last phase of their careers looking to set up a big fight for next year.\n\"I said two more fights after I beat Lara, but it's a fight-by-fight basis really,\" Wood said. \"I don't want to retire from boxing until I'm the first boxer to headline at the City Ground in Nottingham. The timing meant we couldn't do the Warrington fight there in the summer -- the ground had a new pitch laid [before the English Premier League season started in August] and even the Nottingham Forest players couldn't train on it.\"\nJoe Cordina (16-0, 9 KOs), the IBF junior lightweight champion, is a possibility for the winner of Saturday's fight in Sheffield, as like Wood and Warrington he is promoted by Matchroom. Cordina defends his belt against Edward Vazquez on Nov. 4 in Monte Carlo, Monaco.\n\"My focus is on Josh Warrington but I'm confident and if I did move up Joe Cordina is a possibility, he's a great fighter,\" Wood told ESPN. \"My dream is to fight at the City Ground, and I have to win this one to make it happen. It would have to be a unification fight or perhaps a rematch with Michael Conlan to keep me at featherweight.\"\nWood's career leapt from domestic to elite level when he knocked out Xu Can in the last round for the WBA world title in July 2021, before doing the same to Michael Conlan in 2022's ESPN fight of the year. Despite his strong recent performances, Wood is aware that Warrington represents a different challenge.\n\"My discipline and patience was what I was pleased most about against Lara,\" Wood told ESPN. \"I had to stay switched on when there was not a lot happening because he likes to jump in and surprise you. I learned that the hard way in the first fight with him. Patience was also key in the second fight, not to go leaving myself open.\nWoods believes he needs a different approach against Warrington because he's a different style of a fighter.\n\"There are things he does well but there are areas I know I can exploit against him,\" Wood said.\nWood insists the pressure is on Warrington this time after Warrington lost the IBF belt to Luis Alberto Lopez a year ago.

{"title": "Gio Reyna's USMNT return raises questions for Gregg Berhalter -- on and off the field", "date": "2023-10-05 23:47:12", "text": "The rapprochement between U.S. men's national team manager Gregg Berhalter and talented attacker Gio Reyna has finally taken place.\nNow what?\nReyna is included in the latest U.S. roster, which was announced on Thursday for games against Germany on Oct. 14 and Ghana three days later. The matches will mark Reyna's first action with the USMNT since fracturing his right leg in the Concacaf Nations League final against Canada last June.\nMore critically, Reyna and Berhalter will be working together for the first time since the 2022 World Cup, when tensions between the pair led to the families of both men being engulfed by a very public feud.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Depth charts for every Premier League team\nThere are still plenty of questions about what the future holds for Reyna at international level. Foremost among these is the extent to which Reyna and Berhalter's relationship is really mended.\nThere was a roughly eight-month period in which the two didn't talk following a maelstrom of incidents that stemmed from Reyna's limited playing time at the 2022 World Cup. Berhalter afterward contributed to the subsequent outing of Reyna's poor attitude, and in response Reyna's family told U.S. Soccer officials about a decades-old domestic violence incident involving Berhalter.\nSuffice it to say, there was considerable healing that needed to take place.\nOn a conference call with reporters after Thursday's roster announcement, Berhalter confirmed that the first step took place \"weeks ago\" with the two conversing over a Zoom call. He didn't provide much in the way of details beyond that, except for saying that he and Reyna are in a \"good spot\" and that it was a \"positive conversation.\"\nBerhalter did acknowledge that the process of mending the relationship is ongoing.\n\"I think it will take time,\" Berhalter said. \"It is a difference between a Zoom call and being in person. But I think that both intentions are positive, and the idea is that we work together for the team to be successful, and I think we're both prepared to do that.\"\nTime will reveal the extent to which that actually happens. There are ups and downs in any coach-player relationship, and what took place over those eight months isn't just going to wash away.\nBut the two have to begin somewhere, and the upcoming camp is the place to start. Reyna's return to the national team camp raises its own set of on-field questions, though.\nReyna hasn't played for club or country since sustaining the aforementioned right leg fracture. He has been healthy enough to be on the bench for Borussia Dortmund of late, so how much could he see the field for the U.S. team?\nBerhalter indicated his approach to using Reyna in the upcoming games will be similar to his handling of Folarin Balogun during the September window. On that occasion, with Balogun working his way back to full fitness following his move to AS Monaco, Berhalter limited the forward to 45-minute stints against Uzbekistan and Oman.\nHerc Gomez reacts to U.S. soccer sporting director Matt Crocker saying there's \"a way forward\" for Gio Reyna and Gregg Berhalter.\nBerhalter said on Thursday that his goal is to build up Reyna's fitness \"in a safe way\" and send him back to Dortmund in a position to make a greater impact for his club.\n\"We're going to be creative with the minutes,\" Berhalter said in relation to Reyna. \"We want to certainly get him on the field and work through both the Germany game, and seeing what position he plays. And then in the Ghana game, same thing, seeing how we can get him in different positions throughout the camp on the field.\"\nWhere Reyna is deployed may just be the biggest question of all. During the 2022 cycle, Reyna played almost exclusively on the wing. But against better teams, the U.S. has struggled to create chances on a consistent basis and, in response, Berhalter could look at putting the creative Reyna in a position to get on the ball more.\nAt the 2022 World Cup -- in which Reyna played a mere 52 minutes due in part to disciplinary issues -- the USMNT's xG, or expected goals, per 90 minutes of actual playing time (which includes stoppage time) was 0.91. That xG, which measures chance creation, ranked 22nd in the tournament among all 32 teams, and 12th out of the 16 teams that reached the knockout stages. Yes, that's a small sample size, but it still points to how the U.S. could use more creativity.\nOne possible solution was on display last June, when the USMNT, under interim manager B.J. Callaghan, trotted out a 4-2-3-1 with Reyna in a central attacking role. Against World Cup qualifiers Mexico and Canada, the U.S. attack looked much more fluid and the attack also benefited from Reyna handling set piece duties.\nHerculez Gomez and Sebastian Salazar debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only)\nBerhalter didn't rule out Reyna reprising that central attacking role, but he didn't completely commit to it either.\n\"In terms of Gio, we see him being able to play three positions: center midfielder, attacking midfielder and winger,\" Berhalter said. \"And we use wingers in different ways. Sometimes the wingers are wide against the line, and sometimes they're in between the lines, and we see him as more of an in-between-the-lines winger.\"\nThe continued absence of defensive midfielder Tyler Adams due to a hamstring injury means the U.S. manager has some other questions about his midfield to solve. Does he play with a single holding midfielder or resort to a double pivot? But in the past, Berhalter has lauded how the midfield trio of Adams, Yunus Musah and Weston McKennie played together, hinting that he would continue with that group if all were healthy.\nDuring the Nations League, Callaghan noted that Reyna's ability to defend is an area where the U.S. coaching staff have asked for improvement, and the 20-year-old responded well to that challenge. If that continues to be the case, the benefits of playing Reyna centrally seem to outweigh his defensive shortcomings, especially if he has two out of Musah, McKennie and (hopefully) Adams playing behind him. It seems the time has arrived to gather more data about Reyna's ability to operate in that midfield role.\nEither way, the games against Germany and Ghana will certainly provide a stern test to see if the U.S. attack -- as well as Berhalter and Reyna -- can move forward."}

(1:37)\nWhile rookies are the most challenging players to project in a given fantasy basketball season, sophomores aren't far behind. With the majority of drafted players entering the NBA in their late teens or very early 20s, and many of those players international, the development process from prospect to professional can extend beyond a single season. .\n\nCreate or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nNow, some young players are more ready than others. They are physically gifted, with skill and strong nerves to step in and make an impact right away. Other players never catch up to the NBA game and find their potential unfulfilled. Then, there are the players that just need more time, and at some point in their rookie season or perhaps in the offseason after, the switch flips and they are ready to ball.\nAs you prepare for your fantasy basketball draft, it will be up to you to identify which young players fit into which category and pick accordingly.\nThat's where I come in.\nWe have already gone through the prospects and fantasy basketball draft outlook for this year's rookie class. Now, let's do the same for the second-year players.\nBanchero made good on his status as the top pick in the 2022 NBA draft, winning Rookie of the Year honors. Banchero was the top fantasy hoops producer in his class last season, and is favored to be so again this year. He averaged 20.0 PPG, 6.9 RPG and 3.7 APG as a rookie and did a lot of that with pure talent and physical ability. Banchero created a lot of his own looks off the iso, breaking down his defender on the drive or pulling up for 3-pointers... which he shot at a less than 30 percent clip. As a sophomore, particularly one that spent the last month of his summer playing with some of the best talent in the NBA on Team USA for the FIBA World Cup, Banchero should be a more polished player who is confident and established in what he wants to do. I look for him to potentially make a leap and would consider drafting him starting around the middle of the third round of 10-team fantasy basketball leagues. He has the upside to move into the top-20 of the fantasy rankings by the end of the season.\nProjected line: 24 PPG (45 FG%, 31 3P%, 75 FT%), 8 RPG, 3.5 APG, 1.7 3PG, 1.0 SPG, 0.8 BPG\nKessler surprised many last season. He averaged a double-double on excellent scoring efficiency from the field while blocking three shots per game in 32 games from mid-January to the end of March. Kessler's play earned him a spot on the All Rookie first team, and he joined Banchero on Team USA at the FIBA World Cup to further raise his cachet and confidence entering Year 2. Kessler should come off the board in the sixth to eighth round range of standard fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected line: 11 PPG (73 FG%, 54 FT%), 10 RPG, 1.1 APG, 0.0 3PG, 0.4 SPG, 2.7 BPG\nWilliams entered his rookie season as the less hyped of the Thunder's two lottery rookies. While second overall pick Chet Holmgren missed the season with a foot injury, Williams went on to have an outstanding rookie season which saw him finish second in the Rookie of the Year voting. Williams entered the league with an NBA-ready frame and held his own from the start. Williams averaged 19.0 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 4.2 APG, 2.0 SPG and 1.3 3PG over a 25-game period from Feb. 7 to the end of the season, while shooting 55.1% from the field and 89.4% from the line. He appears set for a big sophomore campaign and is value in the sixth to eighth rounds of fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected line: 18 PPG (53 FG%, 37 3P%, 82 FT%), 5 RPG, 3.0 APG, 1.6 3PG, 1.5 SPG, 0.5 BPG\nSmith Jr. had a very solid rookie season, but still decided to play on the Rockets' Summer League team. He impressed in Las Vegas, scoring 71 points with a whopping 27 free throw attempts in only 64 minutes of action. Smith always had a strong jumper and good shot-blocking ability, but this summer he showed an aggressiveness and ability to attack off the dribble and finish through contact as well as a desire to take and make the big shot that will serve him very well in his second season. Smith projects as an eighth to ninth round fantasy draft pick, but based on how impressive he was this summer, I might slide him more to the sixth/seventh round range in some of my drafts.\nProjected stats: 17 PPG (43 FG%, 33 3P%, 81 FT%), 8 RPG, 2.0 3PG, 1.4 APG, 1.3 BPG, 0.6 SPG\nMurray is another current member of the NBA All-Rookie First Team that rounds out this list. Murray was almost purely a 3-point shooter for the Kings last season, and that was enough to maintain a solid floor value. But Murray should get the chance to show he has a much more polished, well-rounded offense game beyond spot-up shooting in his second season. He also flashed as a rebounder and defender in the second half of his rookie season. I expect him to improve his numbers on that end of the court as well. He is a solid value in the eighth to 10th round of fantasy leagues.\nProjected line: 17 PPG (47 FG%, 42 3%, 77 FT%), 7 RPG, 1.4 APG, 2.1 3PG, 0.9 SPG, 0.6 BPG\nIvey had a strong rookie campaign as a lead/combo guard on the Pistons and has already shown flashes of strong scoring, playmaking and shooting when in rhythm. Those moments should come more frequently as a sophomore, particularly with Cade Cunningham back. The two combine to form Detroit's backcourt of the future. I would consider Ivey in the 10th round of standard 10-team fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected stats: 18 PPG (43 FG%, 36 3P%, 76 FT%), 4.0 RPG, 5.5 APG, 1.8 3PG, 09. SPG, 0.2 BPG\nMathurin is a pure scorer with 20 PPG upside as soon as this season. He remains on the fringe draft pick in standard fantasy basketball leagues because he doesn't contribute to may secondary categories, which limits his fantasy scoring average. On the other hand, his scoring also keeps his floor relatively high. Mathurin is potentially more valuable as a role player in catalog leagues than points leagues, and if he develops more versatility in his game as a sophomore, he could become more universally valuable to fantasy teams. Mathurin is worth a late round upside pick in standard leagues. In deeper leagues with 12 or more teams, he is a more definitive late-round selection.\nWilliams moved into the starting lineup for the Hornets late last season and averaged a double-double on 63 FG% with more than a block and almost a steal per game. He is worth considering as a defense/role playing center in the last rounds of standard fantasy basketball drafts.\nEason was a regular contributor on the Rockets as a rookie and was another sophomore that I feel was too good to be playing in the Summer League in Vegas. He teamed up with Jabari Smith Jr. to dominate opposing competition, scoring off the dribble and setting up teammates while still focusing on the spot-up 3-pointer that is at the heart of his 3-and-D role in Houston. The Rockets are deep with talented young wings, but Eason should carve out playing time and has fantasy-worthy upside if he is able to be a starter this season.\nSharpe was drafted in 2022 based on his sheer talent and by the end of the season was a starter and producing for the Trail Blazers. He is a key cog in Portland's post-Lillard rebuild, and has explosive upside this season as the game slows down for him. Sharpe exhibited a nice rapport with rookie Scoot Henderson in their one game together at the Las Vegas Summer League. If they can translate that connection to the NBA stage, Sharpe could get better looks playing alongside a talented young point guard.\nI would consider Duren in the later rounds of fantasy drafts, but he more likely will be a free agent worth keeping an eye on. Duren has all the physical tools to be a dominant NBA center, but he's on a deep Pistons' front court and may not get enough minutes to make an impact. Nevertheless, he is on the fantasy radar purely off potential. His excellent per-minute numbers suggest he could be a nightly double-double threat if he/when he earns consistent starter minutes.\nBranham and Sochan both had productive rookie seasons for the Spurs, averaging double digits scoring and displaying flashes of brilliance to suggest they could develop into more. The Spurs were already deep into rebuilding last season, which allowed both to get more playing time in their first seasons. Branham had a 10-game stretch through most of February when he averaged 18.1 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 2.9 APG and 2.2 3PG in 32.7 MPG, then finished the season averaging 16.1 PPG, 3.6 APG and 1.4 3PG in 26.8 MPG in his last nine games.\nSochan had several similar extended runs. He averaged 18.0 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 3.3 APG and 1.6 3PG in 30.2 MPG over seven games in January, then produced 19.8 PPG, 8.3 RPG and 2.8 APG in 30.8 MPG from late February until injuries derailed his season in mid-March.\nNeither Branham nor Sochan enter this season listed as starters on the Spurs depth chart, but both are only 20 years old and have enough talent to earn extended playing time as the Spurs continue their youth movement."}
{"title": "Six rookies to draft and eight others to keep an eye on", "date": "2023-10-02 21:40:37", "text": "Andre Snellings breaks down why Jarace Walker and Keyonte George are two rookies that fantasy managers should keep an eye on this season. (2:20)\nWe say it every year -- typically, rookies aren't drafted until the middle to late rounds in fantasy basketball.\nYes, every now and then, there's a hyped up player who sneaks into round three (like this year), but most seasons the top rookie won't go until the fourth or fifth round at the earliest.\n\nCreate or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nThis presents a major opportunity for the savvy fantasy manager, who dedicates the early rounds to setting up the foundation of their team while having a certain rookie or two in mind for the middle and late rounds. Find the right rookies, and this can be a winning formula.\nBut who are the rookies to have this season? And who are other sleeper first-year players to keep an eye on as the season progresses?\nWembanyama was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft and is touted as the best prospect since at least LeBron James in 2003. Wembanyama stands 7-foot-5, has the ball-handling and perimeter skills of a forward, but the rim protection ability of an elite defensive anchor. The Spurs are building their entire franchise around him, and based on the combination of his talent, the way that Spurs coach Gregg Popovich deployed his last top overall pick/generational talent in Tim Duncan, and the history of players with the level of hype and/or body types similar to Wembanyama, I project Wembanyama to produce strong fantasy hoops numbers as a rookie. After watching him in the Las Vegas Summer League, both his underwhelming debut and his outstanding second game, I would consider him as soon as the third round of fantasy basketball drafts this season.\nProjected line: 20 PPG (49 FG%, 30 3P%, 78 FT%), 9.5 RPG, 2.5 APG, 0.9 3PG, 0.7 SPG, 2.4 BPG\nHolmgren was the No. 2 overall pick of the 2022 NBA Draft but missed the entire season with a foot injury suffered last summer. Many, including ESPN Analytics' NBA Draft projections, had Holmgren as arguably the top prospect of the class. But there was also a vocal pushback that Holmgren's lack of girth (listed at 7-1, 195 pounds) would keep him from being effective at the next level. Holmgren played at the Las Vegas Summer League in each of the last two seasons, and this summer he looked visibly stronger and more ready for the physical NBA. He will always be thin, but now he looks wiry instead of frail. His game popped as well, with some similar strengths and weaknesses as Wembanyama, and he should also be a nightly double-double threat with strong defensive numbers and 3-point range as a \"rookie\". Holmgren would be good value in the middle rounds of fantasy drafts, between rounds 6 and 8.\nProjected line: 15 PPG (51 FG%, 32 3%, 79 FT%), 9 RPG, 2.3 APG, 1.3 3PG, 0.7 SPG, 1.6 BPG\nHenderson is the heir apparent to the Trail Blazers franchise player throne vacated by Damian Lillard. In Vegas this summer, Henderson's explosiveness and creativity looked ready-made for the pro game. He may have some growing pains as he learns to work around a streaky jumper and defensive pressure that may lead to turnovers, but if the Trail Blazers hand him the reins he should produce flex-worthy fantasy hoops stats. His draft range is 6th through 8th round.\nProjected stats: 19 PPG (43 FG%, 39 3P%, 80 FT%), 7 APG, 5 RPG, 1.1 3PG, 0.4 BPG, 1.4 SPG\nMiller was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, and on paper his length and scoring ability on the wing should pair well with franchise guard LaMelo Ball. And I believe that it will, as the season goes along. But Miller struggled at times in the Summer League, particularly when his shot was off. The physicality and speed of the game could require a learning curve early in the season, but I expect he'll find his level as the season progresses. He is worth consideration in the late rounds of fantasy basketball drafts, as an upside pick once your fantasy starters have already been taken.\nProjected stats: 15 PPG (44 FG%, 35 3P%, 85 FT%), 7 RPG, 2 APG, 1.7 3PG, 1.1 SPG, 0.7 BPG\n\nAmen Thompson looked amazing during the first three quarters of his first summer league game with the Rockets before he injured his ankle and had to sit. His twin brother, Ausar, went on to have a strong summer league performance with the Pistons. Both have excellent size for wings, elite athleticism and the defensive tenacity to produce strong numbers at that end of the court from day one. Their defense could be what earns either/both of them more playing time out the gate. Amen is a better ball-handler than his brother and is niftier at finishing around the rim and drawing fouls, while Ausar may hit the boards a bit harder and may have a more direct path to a starting role on the Pistons. I would consider both players late in drafts as fliers with upside.\nProjected stats Amen: 10 PPG (45 FG%, 33 3P%, 77 FT%), 5 RPG, 3 APG, 1.0 3PG, 1.1 SPG, 0.5 BPG\nProjected stats Ausar: 9 PPG (46 FG%, 30 3P%, 72 FT%), 6 RPG, 2 APG, 0.9 3PG, 1.4 SPG, 0.7 BPG\nWalker is a new-age, do-it-all power forward in the mold of Draymond Green or Aaron Gordon moreso than a scorer or pure banger in the post. On offense, he is more catch-and-shoot than creator, but he plays with a lot of energy and could develop into a leader on the Pacers even as a rookie. Walker gave a glimpse into his versatile game in Vegas, filling the box scores with averages of 14.3 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 3.3 APG, 1.3 SPG and 1.3 BPG. He has an NBA body and the strength to compete right away. Walker enters the season with the chance to earn a starting nod on the Pacers, but he will have to compete with Obi Toppin for that honor. If he does get starter minutes, Walker could be an All-Rookie selection so it is worth it to watch the position battle in the preseason to see if he's worth a roster spot in fantasy hoops leagues.\nBlack has the size of a wing but the game of a guard. He is more strong than explosive, so he has to use craftiness, angles and his body to create scoring opportunities off the dribble. His all-around game is promising, but he needs to work on his shooting and ability to finish in the paint. In Las Vegas, Black made only one of his six 3-point attempts in three games, and he also shot only 54.5% from the free throw line. On a Magic team with a relatively deep backcourt, it is hard to see Black beating out Markelle Fultz or Jalen Suggs, and he still has to potentially contend with Cole Anthony and Gary Harris for backcourt minutes as well. Black has solid long-term upside, but after the Summer League and getting a better feel for how his game would fit on the Magic, I scaled back my projections and have him listed more as a player to watch than a likely fantasy draftee.\nHendricks enters this season with the floor of a 3-and-D stretch-4, but has the upside to eventually develop into a more all-around threat. In college, he led his conference in blocked shots and made 39% of his 3-pointers on solid volume. He has a 7-1 wingspan and high motor, and seems to fit well next to Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen on a potential Jazz frontcourt of the future. But, the Jazz traded for John Collins this offseason, meaning there is no space for Hendricks to start. He could earn good minutes off the bench, though, and is worth watching in case his role grows as the season progresses.\nWhitmore was widely projected to be a top-5 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft but slid on Draft Night to the Rockets at the 20th pick. He showed off his game in Vegas, where he was named the MVP of the Vegas Summer League after averaging 19.3 PPG, 5.2 RPG and 2.5 SPG. But more than the numbers, Whitmore clearly has an NBA body and will be able to physically match up with NBA wings from day one. He is a prototype 3-and-D wing in today's NBA, and the only reason he isn't higher on this list is his path to playing time isn't fully clear on a Rockets team full of young talent on the wing. He will be competing with Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, Amen Thompson, Jae-Sean Tate and Tari Eason for minutes.\nDick made headlines on NBA Draft night by wearing an ostentatious red suit with sequins that analysts said was \"as electric as his 3-point shooting.\" Dick is arguably the best 3-point shooter in his draft class, great at spotting up and knocking down his jumpers with a lightning quick release. He also has great size for a wing at 6-foot-7 ½ inches, which gives him some rebounding potential. He had a similar statistical footprint to Tyler Herro in college, but Dick is taller. He lacks the strength to compete defensively in the NBA right now, but his length gives him defensive upside. Dick had a strong showing in Vegas with multiple 20-plus point scoring performances, but he has a difficult path to playing time on a Raptors squad featuring O.G. Anunoby, Scottie Barnes and Gary Trent Jr. on the wing.\nWallace is a 6-foot-3 guard with a 6-foot-8 wingspan that draft analyst Jay Bilas described as the safest pick in the draft because his game is known and reliable. Wallace can play the point but can also work off the ball. He has a strong all around game but isn't a pure scorer and tends to be streaky. In Vegas, Wallace had a monster debut from downtown with six made 3-pointers and 20 points, but followed that up by going 2-for-12 from the field and 1-for-8 from downtown in the next game. Wallace is behind Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey on the guard depth chart for the Thunder, and will have to compete with several others for backup minutes.\nGeorge was the Big 12 Freshman of the Year last season at Baylor. At 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds, George has excellent size for a combo guard with the quickness and athleticism to develop into a good defender. On offense, he is crafty at creating space, can finish in the paint and has demonstrated shooting range out to about 30 feet. George played six summer league games for the Jazz across multiple leagues, but in the last two games before he injured his ankle he went for 33 points and 10 assists in one game and 26 points with seven assists in the next. He could compete with incumbent starter Collin Sexton for minutes at the point in Utah this season.\nHoward is a knock-down 3-point shooter, and can knock down his shot off the dribble as well as the spot-up. He is great at coming off screens and firing, a skill that will serve him well in the NBA. Howard is about 6-foot-8 and 215 pounds, smaller than his Fab Five father Juwan, but with good size for a forward. While his shooting range is his strength, Howard needs to work on his defense and rebounding. He has the athleticism to do so, if he is willing to put in the work. Howard ran hot and cold in Vegas, with a couple poor outings to start with before bouncing back with 22 points and four 3-pointers in the third game. The Magic were one of the worst shooting teams in the NBA last season, so they could use Howard's sharp-shooting, but he has to compete with veterans like Joe Ingles for minutes off the bench behind Franz Wagner."}

Igor Shesterkin, Ilya Sorokin, Jake Oettinger, Connor Hellebuyck ... they are likely to be better investments for your fantasy squad, but they'll cost a high draft pick.\nBut winning your league last year was better accomplished by drafting Linus Ullmark and Alexandar Georgiev, which was just a matter of backing the right two sleepers. Who will those sleepers be this season? As implied, that's a tough call.\n\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nMore than ever, a winning fantasy strategy can be lifted from the world of tandems. When one emerges and dominates, it's a low-cost draft investment that can lead to championships (think Ullmark). But even if the time split remains, goaltenders can earn fantasy value -- Ilya Samsonov placed 108th overall last season with only 50.2% crease share and Filip Gustavsson was 81st overall with only 46.5% crease share.\nWe've listed the teams below most likely to use a tandem this season. Some are more likely than others and some are just a guess given the current status of their goaltenders. There's also a chance we missed some that could emerge. But when doing your draft shopping for your crease, don't overlook the potential value of a goaltender projected to get just 50% of the crease share.\nRelevant stats for each goaltender include their crease share from last season, their overall ranking for fantasy, their fantasy points per 60 minutes, and their average draft position so far this draft season. Remember that an ADP higher than about 220 means they are not being drafted in most ESPN leagues.\nLinus Ullmark: 58.9% crease share, fourth overall fantasy points, 5.38 fantasy points per game (FPP60), 38.2 average draft position (ADP)\nJeremy Swayman: 41.1% crease share, 144th overall, 4.04 FPP60, 108.6 ADP\nThis is the potential tandem that will offer the most headaches for fantasy managers. Ullmark blew away the field last season and would be a no-brainer first-round fantasy pick if we knew he was going to do it again. But so many offseason changes, not the least of which was the retirement of Patrice Bergeron, leaves a lot of questions. Are the Bruins as good defensively? Do they win as frequently? But even beyond those questions, Swayman earned himself a raise and a chance to prove he has a long-term future as a starter for the club.\nI would not advise paying the premium for Ullmark given the question marks, but if he falls in your lap closer to the 70th-overall pick, I could get on board. Given that Swayman is on the weak side of the tandem, his draft price of 108th on average is also on the high end. But let's be clear: Both of these goaltenders have the potential to be fantasy difference-markers in 2023-24. The problem is that we can't say that with heaps of confidence for either one.\nAdin Hill: 33.7% crease share, 451st overall, 3.02 FPP60, 211.3 ADP\nLogan Thompson: 49.1% crease share, 248th overall, 2.99 FPP60, 241.9 ADP\n\nChoose your league size, customize the scoring and set the rules you want to create the fantasy hockey league you want to play in.\nCreate your custom league for free!\nNeither goaltender was a staple of fantasy clubs for most of last season, though Thompson had some nice runs earlier in the campaign. But we all know what Hill did after the regular season in leading the Golden Knights to the Stanley Cup. There's an argument to be made that this isn't a tandem coming into the season, with Hill earning a massive raise, but Hill has never played more than 27 games in an NHL season before, so it's hard to call him a workhorse starter at this stage.\nThis will probably be a \"hot-hand\" crease, with whichever goaltender is having a solid run getting the lion's share of starts. After Hill was so dominant in the postseason, he would be my preference for a fantasy team. That said, there is a chance you can secure both later in drafts and have the crease of the defending champions locked up on your roster.\nStuart Skinner: 58.9% crease share, 132nd overall, 2.86 FPP60, 158.0 ADP\nJack Campbell: 41.1% crease share, 627th overall, 1.29 FPP60, 229.0 ADP\nThis tandem, like the Golden Knights, had a flip-flop from the regular season to the postseason. Skinner was the hero in the regular season, taking the starting job away from Campbell and keeping the Oilers on track for the playoffs. But Skinner stumbled in the postseason, with Campbell coming on in relief multiple times and not looking too bad. That narrative from the playoffs was arguably enough for a soft reset on whose crease this is coming into 2023-24.\nThe Oilers should win plenty of games with their overpowered offense and upgraded defense, but who is going to be in the crease for most of those wins? Skinner's ADP is very palatable, but you shouldn't completely count out Campbell at this stage. In fact, this might be an old school insurance scenario in which drafting Skinner means you should target Campbell in the final rounds to play it safe. There is value to be had here, as the Oilers are a 50-win team these days.\nStarting your own league is easier than ever!

When both Andersen and Raanta were hurt last season, Kochetkov had a chance to show he could do the job in net. But the rookie faded with his chances later in the season, ultimately leaving the Hurricanes to decide to re-sign both Andersen and Raanta on fairly short-term deals. Kochetkov, now 24, can be sent down to the AHL without risking waivers, so he'll be the No. 3 goaltender for the Canes this season.\nThen there's the Andersen or Raanta debate. Raanta was the better goaltender of the two last season, posting better ratios and almost as many wins in fewer starts, but we are only two years removed from when Andersen finished 24th overall in fantasy in 2021-22 with 3.85 FPP60.\nHealth will be the first and foremost concern, as Andersen and Raanta were both fragile last season and the season prior (recall that Andersen missed the 2021-22 playoffs). That said, the Hurricanes wouldn't invest in Andersen and Raanta again unless they thought one of them could be the guy for at least one more season with Kochetkov still waiver eligible. Andersen's ADP is actually trending low if he ends up getting the bulk of starts here, which is the most likely scenario.\nCam Talbot: 40.1% crease share, 587th overall, 1.57 FPP60 (with Ottawa Senators), 219.5 ADP\nPheonix Copley: 42.2% crease share, 351st overall, 2.56 FPP60, 230.2 ADP\nAs much as Copley saved the Kings from themselves last season, he apparently didn't do enough to get a clear shot at the starter's gig yet. Copley was a huge stabilizer for the Kings last season, winning twice as many games as anyone else on the roster. But his ratios weren't great and faded down the stretch. The Kings brought in Joonas Korpisalo at the trade deadline, but Korpisalo opted for the Ottawa Senators in the offseason. The natural choice from there? Sign the Senators goaltender from last season. Cam Talbot had a rough year, earning almost no fantasy value, and is now 36 years old. The age is a major concern, as Talbot is past the spot on the goaltender curve where they usually remain productive for fantasy. But Copley, adequate, wasn't exactly changing the game for fantasy managers in his 37 games last season.\nTalbot hasn't had as much wear and tear as some other 36-year-old goaltenders, spending a lot of his career as a backup. So there is a world in which he can pull out another solid season behind a solid squad. Copley doesn't have a lot of upside, so the ideal situation here is Talbot hanging on for another year of value and getting the bulk of starts. He's the one to take a chance on.\nVitek Vanecek: 59.0% crease share, 111th overall, 3.08 FPP60, 116.2 ADP\nAkira Schmid: 18.2% crease share, 574th overall, 3.48 FPP60, 228.4 ADP\nJordan Binnington: 71.4% crease share, 541st overall, 1.00 FPP60, 228.1 ADP\nJoel Hofer: 6.4% crease share, 805th overall, 2.16 FPP60, 230.0, ADP\nNeither of these teams look like they will have a tandem on paper. But Schmid and Hofer have both shown glimpses and are both 23 coming into the season, which is about the age goaltenders really start coming on. If you are drafting Vanecek, Schmid is a good idea to handcuff. You probably shouldn't be looking at Binnington for your crease, but Hofer has upside if he pushes for more time.\nReady to play?
