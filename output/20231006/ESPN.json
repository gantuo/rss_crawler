(2:22)\nDick Butkus, arguably the fiercest Monster of the Midway, has died at age 80, the Chicago Bears announced Thursday.\nButkus became a Bears legend and Pro Football Hall of Famer in his nine-year career, which started in 1965. The middle linebacker was a vicious tackler whose intimidating presence put some players on their heels before the ball was even snapped.\nIn a statement released through the Bears, Butkus' family said he \"died peacefully in his sleep overnight\" at his home in Malibu, California.\n\"Dick was the ultimate Bear, and one of the greatest players in NFL history,\" team chairman George McCaskey said in a statement. \"He was Chicago's son. He exuded what our great city is about and, not coincidentally, what George Halas looks for in a player: toughness, smarts, instincts, passion and leadership.\n\"He refused to accept anything less than the best from himself, or from his teammates. ... His contributions to the game he loved will live forever and we are grateful he was able to be at our home opener this year to be celebrated one last time by his many fans.\"\nDick Butkus was a legend who embodied what it means to be a Chicago Bear. Our hearts go out to his family and friends. pic.twitter.com/8UEVuuZLwi\nThe Bears took on the Commanders on Thursday night in Landover, Maryland, and a moment of silence for Butkus was held before kickoff.\nHall of Fame defensive end Deacon Jones once called Butkus a \"maniac\" and \"well-conditioned animal.\" Butkus appeared to want to send a message with every tackle.\n\"I want to just let 'em know that they've been hit, and when they get up, they don't have to look to see who it was that hit 'em,\" Butkus once told NFL Films. \"It shouldn't be any puzzle. When they come to, they got to say, 'It must've been Butkus that got me.'\"\nIn a game against the rival Green Bay Packers during the 1970 season, Butkus and teammate Willie Holman hit quarterback Bart Starr so hard Starr lost his helmet and began walking toward the wrong bench.\nSaid the Chicago Tribune: \"[Starr] looked like Oscar Bonavena after Cassius Clay [Muhammad Ali] had finished with him.\"\nHe made the Pro Bowl in eight of his nine seasons, but a chronic knee injury abruptly ended his career in 1974 at age 31.\n\"Dick Butkus was a fierce and passionate competitor who helped define the linebacker position as one of the NFL's all-time greats,\" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement Thursday. \"Dick's intuition, toughness and athleticism made him the model linebacker whose name will forever be linked to the position and the Chicago Bears.\n\"... We send our deepest condolences to the Butkus family, the Bears organization and the many fans and people he impacted throughout his life.\"\nButkus finished his career with 1,020 tackles and 22 interceptions. He was named first team All-Pro five times, won the George Halas Award in 1974 and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1979.\nHe also was named to the NFL's all-decade teams in the 1960s and 1970s and is a member of the league's 75th and 100th anniversary all-time teams.\nButkus spent his entire football career in Illinois. Born on Dec. 9, 1942, as the youngest of eight children, he grew up on the city's South Side as a fan of the Chicago Cardinals, the Bears' crosstown rivals. He played high school football for Chicago Vocational High School, earning a high school player of the year award as a junior.\nHe went on to compete in college at Illinois, where he played both center and linebacker. He helped the Fighting Illini to an 8-1-1 record and Rose Bowl victory in 1963. In his senior season, he made the All-America team and finished third in Heisman Trophy voting.\nThat led to Butkus being selected by the Bears with the third overall pick in the 1965 NFL draft. He had to fill the big shoes of Hall of Fame linebacker Bill George, but Butkus quickly showed he was up to the task. He set career highs with five interceptions and seven fumble recoveries during his rookie season.\nButkus would hit runners high, wrap them up and drive them to the ground like a rag doll. Sports Illustrated once called him \"The Most Feared Man in the Game.\"\nWhen the Detroit Lions unveiled an I-formation against the Bears at old Tigers Stadium, Butkus knocked every member of the \"I\" -- the center, quarterback, fullback and halfback -- out of the game.\nSaid teammate Ed O'Bradovich: \"Just to hit people wasn't good enough. He loved to crush people.\"\nA legend of the game & part of what makes the NFL's oldest rivalry so special. Sending our condolences to the family & friends of Dick Butkus & the entire @ChicagoBears organization üôè pic.twitter.com/dU7h8TtsWi\n\"I wouldn't ever go out to hurt anybody deliberately,\" Butkus once replied tongue-in-cheek when asked about his on-field reputation. \"Unless it was, you know, important... like a league game or something.\"\nButkus played for only two winning teams with the Bears, however, and never made the playoffs. He came on during the end of the George Halas era, just missing the 1963 championship season. In his final season, the Bears went 3-11.\nAfter he retired, Butkus sued the Bears for $1.6 million, contending he was provided inadequate medical care and owed the four years of salary remaining on his contract. The lawsuit was settled for $600,000, but Butkus and Halas didn't speak for five years.\nThat divide healed, however, and he became a staunch public supporter of the franchise. A year ago, he even took over the team's social media account for an evening, thrilling fans.\nThrough the Butkus Foundation, he helped establish a program at a Southern California hospital to encourage early screenings to detect heart disease. He promoted a campaign to encourage high school athletes to train and eat well and avoid performance-enhancing drugs.\nThe foundation oversees the Butkus Award, established in 1985 to honor college football's best linebacker. It was expanded in 2008 to include pros and high school players.\n\"Dick had a gruff manner, and maybe that kept some people from approaching him, but he actually had a soft touch,\" McCaskey, who is Halas' grandson, said in his statement. \"His legacy and philanthropy included a mission of ridding performance enhancing drugs from sports and promoting heart health.\"\nMany people knew Butkus more for his appearances in films -- such as \"The Longest Yard\" in 1974 -- and on television (\"My Two Dads\" and \"Hang Time\") after his playing days. He became a well-known pitchman in commercials. His Miller Lite commercials with Bubba Smith, in which they played off their menacing reputations, were especially well-known.\nButkus also was a sports broadcaster, even serving as a color analyst on Bears games.\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame lowered its flags to half-staff in Butkus' honor.\n\"Playing in an era when middle linebacker became one of the game's glamour positions -- and several of Dick's contemporaries also would end up in the Pro Football Hall of Fame -- his name most often was cited first as the epitome of what it took to excel at the highest level,\" Hall of Fame president Jim Porter said in a statement.\nButkus is survived by his wife, Helen, and children Ricky, Matt and Nikki. Nephew Luke Butkus has coached in college and the NFL, including time with the Bears.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}
{"title": "Sources: Eppler resigned amid MLB investigation", "date": "2023-10-06 01:30:08", "text": "New York Mets general manager Billy Eppler resigned Thursday amid a Major League Baseball investigation into improper use of the injured list, sources told ESPN.\nThe investigation was first reported by The New York Post.\nEppler's resignation continues an overhaul of the team's leadership with the recent hiring of president of baseball operations David Stearns and firing of manager Buck Showalter.\nEppler, 48, was expected to stay on, despite owner Steve Cohen officially handing control of the team's baseball operations department to Stearns this week.\n\"I wanted David to have a clean slate and that meant me stepping down,\" Eppler said in a statement.\nHe does so after one of the most disappointing seasons in franchise history. The Mets entered the year with the largest payroll in Major League Baseball history and World Series aspirations. They ended it having dealt nearly a quarter of their major league roster at the trade deadline and finishing 75-87, fourth place in the National League East division and 29 games behind first-place Atlanta.\nEppler was hired in late 2021 after the Mets fired Zack Scott, their interim GM, who had been charged with DWI but later was found not guilty. Scott replaced Jared Porter, who was fired 38 days after being hired following an ESPN report that he had sent explicit text messages to a female reporter.\nStearns, 38, joined the Mets after seven seasons running the Milwaukee Brewers that included four playoff appearances. While his arrival in Queens had been long expected, there was no indication in his introductory news conference three days ago that Eppler would not be part of the team's infrastructure.\n\"He decided it is in everyone's best interest to fully hand over the leadership of baseball operations to David Stearns,\" Cohen said Thursday in a statement.\nEppler's first season with the Mets, whom he joined after five years as Los Angeles Angels GM, wound up with 101 wins -- and an ignominious loss to San Diego in the wild-card round.\nWhile Eppler warranted praise for a 2022 offseason in which he signed ace Max Scherzer and acquired steady starter Chris Bassitt, his lack of urgency at the trade deadline led to a trio of dud moves, as the team added only designated hitter Daniel Vogelbach, first baseman Darin Ruf and outfielder Tyler Naquin.\nAt the deadline a year earlier, in an ill-fated effort to make the postseason, the Mets had traded outfielder Pete Crow-Armstrong, who would become a top prospect, for infielder Javier Baez.\nThe Mets' spending spree this past winter brought back closer Edwin Diaz and center fielder Brandon Nimmo while adding future Hall of Famer Justin Verlander and Japanese star Kodai Senga to the rotation. Diaz's season-ending injury in the World Baseball Classic cast a pall on the season, and by the time the deadline rolled around, the Mets punted, trading Scherzer to the Texas Rangers and Verlander to the Houston Astros.\nNew York enters a seminal winter, with two-way star Shohei Ohtani -- whom Eppler signed as GM of the Angels -- reaching free agency and the Mets mulling the future of first baseman Pete Alonso, who is a year away from free agency and hired agent Scott Boras this week.\nThe Mets also will continue looking for a manager after Stearns fired Showalter, whom Eppler hired in December 2021, three months into his tenure."}

Smith says the Bears are worse than the 2008 Lions, who went 0-16, and says Matt Eberflus has no business being a head coach. (1:53)\nLANDOVER, Md. -- Bears general manager Ryan Poles expressed finality regarding the ongoing saga with wide receiver Chase Claypool, who has been away from the team this week and is inactive for Chicago's Thursday night matchup against the Washington Commanders.\n\"I think Chase is going to learn from this situation, we all will, and I wish him luck moving forward throughout his career,\" Poles said in a pregame interview on ESPN 1000's pregame radio show.\nClaypool was a healthy scratch for the second time in five days. Last Friday, the 25-year-old wide receiver expressed frustration with his role in Chicago's offense, and he was made inactive a day later. Claypool was told by the team not to attend the Bears' game against the Denver Broncos on Sunday.\nThe team informed Claypool on Monday that he would be inactive for Thursday's game and requested that he remain away from the team while the Bears prepared for the Commanders.\nThe Bears sent a second-round pick to Pittsburgh last November for Claypool; the pick ended up being 32nd in the draft order. In 10 games with Chicago, Claypool was targeted 43 times and totaled 18 catches for 191 yards and one touchdown.\n\"You're always disappointed in this situation, and it's definitely something I take ownership of,\" Poles said. \"Last year, in the situation we were in, we wanted to add another receiver to the offense, not only to help us be more productive but also to help [quarterback] Justin [Fields] take the next step. The right thought process was there, and I feel comfortable with that. Unfortunately it didn't work out and we were hoping for him to be a little bit more productive and be someone that could help us take it to the next level.\"\nPoles said the Bears would be taking things \"day by day to figure out what our next move is\" with Claypool, who remains on the 53-man roster.\n\"I always look at things from a player's perspective,\" Poles said. \"You have a player going into his free agent year, who wants to be productive and help us, and when things aren't going the right way, sometimes you get emotional, things don't work out and you struggle to blend in and keep resilient and stay resilient with the rest of the crew.

(0:32)\nBATON ROUGE, La. -- LSU Tigers star Angel Reese is well aware much was made about the closing moments of the women's basketball national championship game in April. LSU had sealed the program's first NCAA title, and Reese gave wrestling star John Cena's \"You can't see me\" hand motion toward Iowa Hawkeyes star Caitlin Clark, then motioned to her ring finger.\nClark said after LSU's 102-85 victory in Dallas that she didn't really notice, but that she didn't think that Reese had done anything wrong. Clark said enthusiasm, emotion and even some trash-talking are a normal part of competitive sports, the same things she has done herself.\nThursday at LSU's media day, Reese shared similar sentiments. All eyes are on the Tigers -- they added top transfers Hailey Van Lith and Aneesah Morrow and are No. 1 in ESPN's preseason rankings -- and on Reese, the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player. She said she is ready to move forward, but did address the hoopla from April.\n\"I love Caitlin; we've been competing since we were in AAU,\" Reese said. \"It was always fun, always competitive. One day, hopefully, we could even be teammates. She is a great player, shooter, person and teammate.\n\"The world is always going to have a good girl and a bad girl. I'll take that I'm going to be the bad guy because I know I've grown women's basketball and inspired people.\"\nReese laughed when it was pointed out that \"good vs. bad\" just depended on which team fans were rooting for.\n\"Yeah, LSU loves me, but they might not like her. People can think what they think,\" Reese said. \"Me and Caitlin are cool; we've never had any issues. Just knowing I've helped grow women's basketball, and she has, too, that's all that matters.\"\nReese also spoke of the news that the WNBA announced an expansion team Thursday, and how much she wants to play in the pro league and for the U.S. senior national team someday. Like Clark, Reese is a senior but could return for a fifth college season in 2024-25 because of the COVID-19 waiver.\nReese said she isn't thinking much now about whether she will enter the 2024 or 2025 WNBA draft. She said she will talk with her family, advisers and LSU coach Kim Mulkey about that when this college season ends -- which Reese hopes will be with another NCAA title.\nThe 6-foot-3 forward averaged 23.0 points and 15.4 rebounds last season, had 34 double-doubles and has worked on her shooting range in the offseason. Morrow, a 6-1 junior forward who transferred from the DePaul Blue Demons, averaged 25.7 points and 12.2 rebounds last season. Both are eager to team up in dominating the paint this season for LSU.\n\"Angel is a competitor; I wanted to be around her every day,\" Morrow said of her decision to come to LSU. \"We are doing nothing but making each other better.\"\nAs good as the 34-2 Tigers were last season, Reese hopes they can improve. She's not just about winning games, but also winning over new fans.\n\"Women are changing the game,\" she said. \"I mean, 9.9 million people watched the [national championship] game. The feedback we've gotten, men and women reach out to us, celebrities, NBA players. Seeing we have so many people in our corner, I think that helps.\""}

(0:33)\nNorth Carolina wide receiver Tez Walker will be eligible to play in 2023 after new information emerged that the NCAA said school officials \"failed to provide\" previously.\nWalker is a transfer from Kent State, and his initial eligibility for the 2023 season was denied because he had transferred twice. His case became a flashpoint for NCAA rules, in part because Walker hadn't played during the COVID-19 season of 2020 at North Carolina Central, which did not have a season because of the pandemic.\nThursday's announcement did not specify what the new information was that prompted the NCAA to reverse its decision. Walker missed No. 14 North Carolina's first four games, which the NCAA intimated in a statement could have been avoided if the university staff had \"submitted this information weeks ago.\"\nEven with Walker's eligibility confirmed after months of public bickering, NCAA officials and UNC athletic director Bubba Cunningham sparred publicly in statements Thursday in the wake of the decision. The NCAA said the \"entire unfortunate episode could have been avoided\" with timely submission of materials. Cunningham responded that UNC put forward the information as it was made available and said the NCAA \"delayed making the correct decision.\"\nThe school posted a video to social media later Thursday that showed Tar Heels coach Mack Brown delivering the news to Walker about his eligibility.\nThe moment @DevontezWalker found out he's eligible üíôüêè#CarolinaFootball üèà #UNCommon pic.twitter.com/DQLjUx6Dm5\nWalker, widely considered a top-50 prospect for next year's NFL draft, transferred to North Carolina in part to play with star quarterback Drake Maye.\nWalker is eligible to join the undefeated Tar Heels for Saturday's game against Syracuse, and a source told ESPN that he is expected to play, as he has been practicing with the team. His snaps are uncertain at this point.\nThe 6-foot-3 wide receiver hauled in 58 receptions for 921 yards and 11 touchdowns last season at Kent State.\n\"I'm so excited and thankful that the NCAA has granted my eligibility to play this season,\" Walker said in a statement. \"This hasn't been easy, but I'm looking forward to putting this in the past and moving forward. I always knew UNC was a special place, but it's proved it over and over again throughout the last few months. I've received so much support from the University, the athletics department, my coaches, the staff and my teammates.\"\nIn an unusually pointed statement, both NCAA president Charlie Baker and Georgia president Jere Morehead, the Division I board of directors chair, chastised North Carolina officials for their handling of Walker's case.\n\"It is unfortunate that UNC failed to provide this important information previously,\" the NCAA said in its statement, which is attributed to both Baker and Morehead. \"While we must be careful not to compromise a student-athlete's right to privacy when it comes to sensitive issues, we want to assure the Division I membership and everyone watching how the new transfer rules are applied, that this meets the new transfer waiver standards.\"\nThe statement concluded: \"UNC's behavior and decision to wage a public relations campaign is inappropriate and outside the bounds of the process UNC's own staff supported. Had the UNC staff not behaved in this fashion and submitted this information weeks ago, this entire unfortunate episode could have been avoided.\"\nUNC chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz said in a statement: \"In our stated effort to exhaust all avenues, new information about this matter came to our attention and we immediately gathered and submitted it for consideration. The NCAA reached the right decision that restores Tez's experience as a student-athlete and a Tar Heel.\"\nBrown, who had been overtly critical of the initial NCAA decision, said in a statement Thursday: \"Everything that's transpired over the last few months has been with the sole purpose of helping and supporting [Walker], and now he's going to have a chance to live his dream. We want to express our gratitude to the people at UNC who have worked tirelessly to assist Tez. We never gave up. We also want to thank the NCAA for being willing to re-examine Tez's case, and ultimately deciding to grant him his eligibility.\"\nThe last previous ruling on Walker came Sept. 7, and it sparked criticism in statements from Brown and Cunningham.\nBrown said at the time that he didn't know whether he had \"ever been more disappointed\" in a group than he was in the NCAA. He ended his statement by saying: \"SHAME ON YOU!\" Cunningham called the decision \"maddening, frustrating and wrong.\"\nThat prompted an NCAA response the next week, with Morehead and another official chastising North Carolina officials and saying they were \"troubled\" by the school's response. The statement said \"violent and possibly criminal threats\" had been directed at committee members."}

{"title": "Fitzgerald suing NU for $130M for wrongful firing", "date": "2023-10-06 01:30:08", "text": "Attorney Dan K. Webb announces a \"major lawsuit\" against Northwestern on behalf of former coach Pat Fitzgerald for wrongful termination. (2:35)\nCHICAGO -- Former Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald filed a wrongful termination lawsuit Thursday against the university and president Michael Schill, in which he is seeking in excess of $130 million for lost earnings as well as reputational and punitive damages.\nFitzgerald alleges Northwestern unlawfully fired him for cause July 10, three days after announcing a two-week suspension as part of corrective measures from a university-commissioned hazing investigation into the program. Northwestern's investigation, led by attorney Maggie Hickey, found that while claims of hazing from a former player were largely corroborated, there was not sufficient evidence Fitzgerald and other coaches and staff had knowledge of the incidents.\nAttorney Dan Webb, who filed the lawsuit, said Northwestern fired Fitzgerald based on \"no new facts, no new developments whatsoever, zero.\" Schill said July 8, hours after The Daily Northwestern reported details of the hazing allegations from the former player, that he \"may have erred\" with the initial discipline for Fitzgerald. Schill fired Fitzgerald two days later.\nWebb said Fitzgerald and Northwestern reached an \"oral agreement\" before the two-week suspension was announced that the coach would face no further discipline from the university.\n\"The fact that he was terminated based on no rational reasons or facts whatsoever, the fact that they've gone out and destroyed his reputation as one of the best football coaches in America, based on no legitimate reason or evidence, is disgraceful,\" said Webb, a former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois who now serves as co-executive chairman of the Winston & Strawn law firm. \"It's despicable conduct on behalf of Northwestern. My client and his family are entitled to their day in court for justice.\"\nAfter conducting interviews with dozens of former Northwestern players and coaches, Webb said he does not believe \"any significant hazing occurred\" within the program but noted that new evidence could emerge at trial. He has asked for but not received Hickey's full investigative report; the university released an executive summary July 7 in announcing Fitzgerald's suspension. The lawsuit states that Fitzgerald fully cooperated with the investigation and was never confronted with any evidence he knew about hazing within the program.\nSince Webb is opposing Northwestern, he cannot talk to current players or coaches but expects to call them as witnesses at trial.\n\"They're going to say they didn't see any significant hazing other than horseplay ... between young men in the locker room,\" Webb said of those he has interviewed.\nThe lawsuit states that Fitzgerald met with Northwestern general counsel Stephanie Graham and athletic director Derrick Gragg on July 3. They presented him a plan where he would accept some punishment because of the findings in the investigation.\n\"Gragg also stated that Schill felt Fitzgerald needed to 'take a hit' for the findings summarized in the Hickey Report, even though the Hickey Report concluded that Fitzgerald and his staff did not know about any hazing activities within the Northwestern football program,\" the lawsuit reads. \"Gragg and Graham told Fitzgerald that if he agreed to this plan, wanted the two week suspension to coincide with Fitzgerald's two-week vacation, so Fitzgerald could attend an important recruiting event on Northwestern's behalf shortly after his suspension ended.\"\nWebb said the anonymous whistleblower who first came forward in November \"had a grudge against ... Coach Fitzgerald\" and that the player's plan to report false allegations of hazing was reported to Fitzgerald by a teammate during a leadership council meeting in November. A current player told ESPN in July that the whistleblower had informed him of a detailed plan with the sole objective to take down Fitzgerald. The current player relayed a conversation he said he had with the former player early this year to Northwestern trustees and other influential university figures.\nIn a response to Thursday's lawsuit, Northwestern said \"multiple current or former\" players under Fitzgerald admitted to investigators hazing that \"included nudity and sexualized acts\" occurred. The university also referred to the lawsuits filed by more than a dozen former Northwestern football players against the university -- many named Fitzgerald and Schill as defendants -- alleging they experienced and/or witnessed hazing while in the program under Fitzgerald, who led Northwestern's program from July 2006 until earlier this year.\nA two-time national defensive player of the year at Northwestern, Fitzgerald was the winningest coach in team history, going 110-101.\n\"As head coach of the football program for 17 years, Patrick Fitzgerald was responsible for the conduct of the program,\" Northwestern said in a statement. \"He had the responsibility to know that hazing was occurring and to stop it. He failed to do so. ... The safety of our students remains our highest priority, and we deeply regret that any student-athletes experienced hazing. We remain confident that the University acted appropriately in terminating Fitzgerald and we will vigorously defend our position in court.\"\nResponding to the claim Fitzgerald should have known about what was happening, Webb said, \"That's a ridiculous allegation, not supported by any evidence whatsoever.\"\nWebb said the out-of-pocket damages he is seeking for Fitzgerald include $68 million that remained on his contract, which ran through 2030, as well as future earnings losses of approximately $62 million. The lawsuit also is claiming reputational damages, emotional distress and punitive damages. Webb intends to call an expert witness who will show that Fitzgerald will \"not work again at the same level, ever again.\"\nThe lawsuit also claims no Northwestern player, coach or staff member ever reported hazing allegations directly to Fitzgerald. According to the claim, an anonymous complaint was submitted to the athletic department in August 2022 of \"serious misconduct and hazing,\" which Northwestern and police investigated and determined was unfounded.\nWebb noted Fitzgerald was proactive with anti-hazing training and told players, including freshmen and transfers, of a zero-tolerance policy within the program. Players also had several outlets to report hazing and mistreatment.\nSince July, Northwestern has implemented new mandatory anti-hazing training for all its teams before each season and hired former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to conduct a larger review of how allegations are reported in the program.\n\"Northwestern's hired a former attorney general that's going to come in and tell Northwestern where they somehow went wrong and could find a better program,\" Webb said. \"Well, they're not going to find it. My expert's going to explain to the jury that what Fitzgerald did was truly second to none in any coaching program in the United States.\"\nWebb said he talked with Northwestern about an out-of-court settlement but was \"unsuccessful.\"\n\"Settlement's always an option, but I have no reason to say that's going to happen,\" Webb said.\nA group of attorneys representing players who have filed lawsuits against Northwestern issued a statement in response to Fitzgerald's lawsuit.\n\"The filing of the lawsuit by former coach Patrick Fitzgerald is clearly all about financial gain for him and is incredibly tone deaf in defending his actions. His complaint ironically details claims that he was deeply involved in each player's life, mental health, academic career, athletic performance and potential after graduation ... all of which actually supports what we've been saying all along, that given the head coach's proximity he knew or should have known what was happening in his program. This is the legal standard: knew or should have known about the abuse, and we feel strongly that the civil lawsuits brought by his former players have merit. Together we represent numerous former players who have provided detailed allegations of abuse. We are united in our goal to get them the justice they deeply deserve,\" read the statement from the attorneys from Levin & Perconti, Ben Crump Law, Romanucci & Blandin and Hart McLaughlin & Eldridge.\nAttorney Margaret Battersby Black said she has seen evidence from more than 80 victims of the Northwestern hazing scandal (far more than the number of lawsuits filed so far).\n\"That [Fitzgerald] allows his lawyer to so callously call these former family members liars shows you everything that you need to know about the culture that he established at this school,\" Battersby Black said. \"And he's trying to continue to suppress and victimize these young men by painting himself as the victim.\""}

The next day, Tucker's lawyers sent a note to preserve documentation \"in anticipation of litigation.\" At stake for Tucker beyond the hearing is the $79 million he had remaining on his contract. After initially suspending Tucker without pay pending the hearing, the school fired him, saying he violated the moral turpitude clause and that his admitted actions on a phone call with Tracy brought ridicule on the school.\nThe letter sent out Thursday is the latest in a tense back-and-forth between Tucker's side and the school, with this letter being sent by attorney Jennifer Z. Belveal. It attempts to catch Tracy in conflicting statements, using dozens of messages between her and her assistant, who is now deceased. It does not say specifically how the messages were obtained.\nThe letter, in part, alleges that Tracy's motivations for filing the complaint are financial. One of Tucker's lawyers shared what Tucker's team says are partially redacted parts of conversations Tracy had with her former assistant where they discuss her finances and the notion that she would be open to settling her claims with Tucker.\n\"I'm filing a formal complaint with MSU,\" Tracy wrote, according to the letter. \"... [My lawyer] said after that we can let him know that we want to come to an agreement then it doesn't have to go to a hearing or anything unless he wants it to.\"\nAccording to the messages provided by Tucker's lawyers, Tracy later added: \"Money is my only recourse to make him feel like there is a punishment\" and \"when they do the money I should make him pay me 10k directly.\"\nThe letter criticizes the MSU investigation for failing \"to attempt to get fulsome text exchanges\" for the Office of Institutional Equity investigation. It alleges the school left out Tracy having good feelings about her experience after Michigan State's spring game.\n\"Blessings on blessings when you stay the course and do what's right. ... No regrets. My heart is good and so is my conscience[.]\"\nThe messages came before the alleged phone encounter that became one of the focuses of the claim. Tracy said it wasn't consensual, but Tucker has disagreed.\nThe letter was released minutes after the hearing began Thursday morning. Tucker will not attend the hearing, the letter states, because of a medical condition the letter doesn't disclose."}
{"title": "Untold stories of the Air Raid revolution, from pregame hot dogs to Phil Collins photo ops", "date": "2023-10-05 20:47:09", "text": "Long before the world knew Mike Leach or Dana Holgorsen or any of the other oddballs, eccentrics and revolutionaries of the Air Raid fraternity, Hal Mumme was a high school coach in Copperas Cove, Texas, with a problem.\nIt was 1986, the NBA and a young superstar had captured the attention of the school's best athletes. Even Mumme's own son came home from school one day and announced he wanted to be Michael Jordan.\nThis was Texas, and most coaches still romanticized the notion that football had to be torture for it to be worthwhile. There was a machismo to the running game, ramming head-on into each other and surviving battles of attrition, with defenses built around big, physical players meant to win those battles.\n\"My generation's football coaches fought World War II,\" Mumme said, \"and they were pretty damn determined to make us relive it every day in practice.\"\nSo Mumme, who had already gone from being the nation's youngest coordinator at UTEP at 27, was now 31, looking to reboot his career after the Miners' whole staff had been fired, and he had a wild idea. What if he made football fun? What if he actually used the entire field?\nAnd so the beginnings of the Air Raid were born, 67 miles from Austin, where just 10 years before, Texas coach Darrell Royal was running the wishbone and repeating his maxim: \"Three things can happen to you whenever you throw the football, and two of 'em are bad.\" But Mumme, who idolized Royal, realized that the same thing that made the wishbone work, spreading the ball in space to skilled athletes, might work even better as a passing offense. So he went all-in.\nA decade later, Mumme burst onto the national scene at Kentucky, walking around on SEC fields, eating hot dogs, wearing flip-flops and listening to Jimmy Buffett before becoming the only UK coach in the past 100 years to beat Alabama. His creation made 5-9 slot receivers superstars and walk-on quarterbacks Heisman winners. Mumme made it possible for Mike Leach, a lawyer from Pepperdine, to become a college football icon, for Lincoln Riley, a Texas Tech walk-on himself from tiny Muleshoe, Texas, to lead two of the most storied programs in history. He made football interesting for unpedigreed coaches who loved the sport, but who would rather write books about Geronimo than sleep in their offices or run the damn ball.\n\"The Air Raid is not an offense,\" TCU coach Sonny Dykes said. \"The Air Raid is a way of life.\"\n\"It's a mentality,\" Riley said, \"more than a collection of plays.\"\nThese mavericks changed the course of football history and rewrote record books, paving the way for Patrick Mahomes to win two Super Bowls while forcing Bill Belichick and Nick Saban to give into wide-open passing attacks. How they did it was never boring.\nLast year, Dykes, a former Mumme assistant at Kentucky, made a historic run to the national title game after a 5-7 season. This year Deion Sanders, who used to pick Mumme's brain and called Leach for offensive staff recommendations, is using the same wide-open principles at Colorado during its program jump-start, turning his own son, Shedeur, into a Heisman candidate at QB.\nWith the sport still mourning Leach, the most famous and revered coach in the extended Air Raid family, following his death in December, we set out to find tales from the rise of the game-changing offense that illustrate the methods behind their collective madness.\nFor every Tim Couch or Kyler Murray or Caleb Williams, the bluest of blue-chip prospects, there are dozens of record-setting Air Raid quarterbacks who were unwanted by anyone else, then ran up the gaudiest of numbers.\nDustin Dewald blazed the trail in Copperas Cove. He was one of those players who got disillusioned with the drudgery of football in the 1980s, so he quit to join the golf team after watching his older brother get pummeled over and over as their QB.\n\"We got our heads kicked in trying to run the ball down the throats of bigger, more powerful teams, lining up in the Power I with an offensive line that averaged 195 pounds,\" Dewald said. \"It was just ridiculous. Hal came in and said, 'All that's going to change.' It did. I think it was the first time in 10 years we didn't have a losing season in Cove.\"\nBetween 1978 and 1985, Cove went 10-69, including two 0-10 seasons. In Mumme's first year in 1986, the Bulldogs went 5-5. They were still outmanned, but Mumme, who began by using the run and shoot, gave them a shot in every game. Then against district rival Georgetown, the opposing coach, Art Briles, blitzed Mumme relentlessly, making it difficult for more complex plays to develop.\n\"I decided I was never going to let that happen to me again,\" Mumme said, reducing his offense to a collection of short passes and horizontal crossing routes.\nDewald threw the ball more than all but a handful of schools in Texas that year. There had been only two scholarship players in the previous 10 years at Cove, but he signed with Stephen F. Austin. Then, he went through the same cycle, quitting due to boredom and joining the golf team at Tarleton State. There weren't any college teams he knew of where he could replicate his experience. Until he went home to Cove to visit.\nHe stopped by the football offices to congratulate Mumme on his new job he'd just landed at a small college, Iowa Wesleyan. By the time he left, Mumme had once again recruited him to play quarterback for a team that was similar to Sanders' Colorado experiment: IWU was coming off an 0-10 season and had just two players returning.\n\"We tried to have a team meeting after I got introduced at the press conference and they told me there were going to be 40 guys,\" Mumme said. \"I walk in, there's two, and the three that I brought with me. I just gave 'em the same speech I was going to give 'em anyway about working hard in the offseason, and we're going to win games. One kid just got up and walked out. I guess he decided, 'This is bulls---, I'm not doing this.' So we had four.\"\nLeach was one of only two applicants for Mumme's offensive coordinator job, and they quickly realized they were kindred spirits. It was a leap of faith: The high school coach took a $20,000 pay cut to try to prove himself in college again. The lawyer who could've made $200,000 a year instead was making $12,000, and the golfer took on student-loan debt to go to school in Iowa -- where none of them had ever been.\nThey went 7-4 the next year, then, by 1991, started tinkering and added the up-tempo element where they never huddled and ran plays at a frenetic pace. Opposing teams had never seen anything like it and had no idea how to stop it. In Dewald's accidental career, he threw for 12,045 yards, 115 TDs and set 25 NAIA records. He threw for 4,418 yards and 45 TDs in 1991, including one game where he set national records with 86 attempts and 61 completions. Leach sent out news releases to national media, coining the name \"Air Raid\" in the process and building the mystique.\nWhile it might have appeared the gaudy numbers were because of an intricate playbook, it was actually the opposite. There was no playbook at all. The philosophy was making things as barebones as possible.\nDon't practice plays you won't call in a game. Don't call plays in a game you don't practice. Don't throw to a covered receiver and don't pass up an open one.\nThe plays came from LaVell Edwards at BYU, with Mumme saying he's watched every offensive snap of Edwards' career. He picked his favorites -- four passing and two rushing -- that seemed to always work. His practice drills, the real backbone of the Air Raid, according to the coaches, were all about details of that limited set, and were all based on Bill Walsh's 49ers practices.\nSo he made every practice consistent and repetitive and drilled until they were mind-numbingly boring. Do it until you can't screw it up, and let muscle memory win. And if it works, keep doing it. Mumme said he once called the same play 52 times in a game for Dewald.\nDecades after helping launch the revolution, Dewald has watched teammates like Bill Bedenbaugh, an Iowa Wesleyan offensive linemen who's now considered one of the best O-line coaches in the country at Oklahoma, along with Holgorsen, his old IWU wide receiver who's become another of the sport's most idiosyncratic coaches, and he finds it amusing that he still understands almost everything they do.\n\"For years, I would go visit [Leach or Mumme] every year for at least one home game and spend days with them at practice and on the sidelines of games,\" Dewald said. \"The last time I visited Mike at Washington State, I looked at the script for the game and it was crazy. I actually knew what to do on 90 percent of it -- and it was almost 30 years after I stopped playing. Just to see what they've all accomplished has been mind-blowing for me, how much it's changed the game and how successful they've all been has been really cool to watch.\"\nChris Hatcher is convinced Mumme isn't the inventor of the Air Raid. He claims the title.\nHatcher signed at Valdosta State to play for Mike Cavan, a former Georgia assistant who had coached under Vince Dooley and was Herschel Walker's lead recruiter. They were an I-formation team with a few passing concepts.\nMumme arrived at Valdosta after Cavan left for another job and, armed with talent he'd never had before, he initially made the same mistake he criticized other coaches for: He overcomplicated things.\n\"I don't care what anybody says, I'm the guy that invented the Air Raid,\" Hatcher said. \"I was not smart enough to comprehend all this stuff Hal wanted to do. So we had to dummy it way down for me. And then that's when the Air Raid took off. That is the truth.\"\nHatcher learned to appreciate the beauty of perfecting and running an offense so simple that he had a little extra time on his hands, enough to visit a frat party the night before homecoming and leave with a parting gift.\n\"You didn't have to be in the film room all night because it didn't matter what the defense was doing,\" Hatcher said. \"We were so good at it that you had time to go out and steal a cannon in the evening. It was a legit Civil War cannon, now, too. Let's not act like it was a little peashooter.\"\nHatcher, who's now the head coach at Samford, threw for 11,363 yards and 121 touchdowns and set 29 school records. During his senior year in 1994, he led the Blazers to their first postseason berth, advancing to the quarterfinals, and when it was all said and done set 29 VSU passing and total offense records. He won the 1994 Harlon Hill Award, often called the D-II Heisman, as the Blazers went 40-17-1 in his career.\nThis captured the attention of Kentucky athletic director C.M. Newton, who wanted to match the basketball program's pace. He handpicked Mumme, which raised eyebrows among purists who believed such a gimmick offense wouldn't work in the big, bad SEC. But Kentucky already had a homegrown star quarterback in Tim Couch, albeit one who was last seen losing 65-0 in his first start to Florida -- and defensive coordinator Bob Stoops -- and attempted just 84 passes over seven games.\nFirst, Mumme enlisted Hatcher, now a graduate assistant, to convince Couch not to transfer. (They went to Hooters and talked it out.) He stuck around, working with Hatcher, who was in charge of getting Mumme's play scripts prepared for Couch's wristband. Mumme would say Play 1 or Play 2, and Couch would call what's on the wristband. Quarterbacks often would check into different plays freely, but in one game, Couch took it to an extreme.\n\"We get about three or four first downs and Couch ain't run a play Mumme's called yet,\" Hatcher said. \"We go down and score, and the whole time Mumme is on the headsets using a few choice words to me.\"\nMumme accused Hatcher, who often changed the play himself when playing for Mumme, of purposely telling Couch not to run Mumme's calls.\n\"I can't believe you'd do this to me,\" Mumme said, according to Hatcher. \"Then it finally hit me. Couch was using the wristband from the week before, and didn't change it out. Every play was wrong, and we went down and scored anyway. My point is, when you rep the plays so much, we feel like it doesn't matter. I can pick me a handful of plays that should work against just about anything you'll see. I like to say we're a well-coached backyard football team.\"\nCouch's mastery paid off in 1997 when he threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Craig Yeast in overtime to lead Kentucky to a win over Alabama 40-34. It was Kentucky's first win over Alabama in 75 years -- something the Wildcats haven't done since. It came just a year after Couch threw for 13 yards (UK had 67 total yards) in an entire game against Stoops' Florida defense under Steve Spurrier. Couch threw for 348 and 406 yards in the next two meetings. While the Gators ended up pulling away and winning both games handily, it was frustrating for Stoops, and their mentality impressed him.\n\"I liked how [Leach] and Hal Mumme were over there standing together,\" Stoops said. \"I took note of the casual nature of the two of them. But they were the most difficult to deal with.\"\nNothing Mumme did was by accident. He doesn't dispute any contentions that he and Leach were arrogant.\n\"There's no question,\" Mumme said. \"We always thought we were smarter than everybody else. We always thought we had better ideas than everybody else. And we pretty much did. That's why everybody's trying to do it now.\"\nMumme could be combative with reporters, and Leach could be aloof. And they weren't worried about too many other opinions.\n\"We played Jimmy Buffett during warmups,\" said West Virginia coach Neal Brown, who played wide receiver at Kentucky under Mumme. \"I don't know if that gets it going for you.\"\n\"It got me and Mike going,\" Mumme said, laughing. \"We weren't worried about anybody else.\"\nThey loved causing a stir or annoying other fans, like when Leach mocked Texas A&M's Corps of Cadets as head coach at rival Texas Tech.\n\"How come they get to pretend they are soldiers?\" Leach said. \"The thing is, they aren't actually in the military. I ought to have Mike's Pirate School. The freshmen, all they get is the bandanna. When you're a senior, you get the sword and skull and crossbones. For homework, we'll work pirate maneuvers and stuff like that.\"\nThe Aggies were not amused.\nThen again, Leach and Mumme were, which was the point. Jeff Allen can testify.\nBefore Allen became the only staff member who has been with Nick Saban for his entire Alabama tenure, a trusted confidante and sports medicine guru, he was an assistant trainer at Kentucky -- but most importantly, he was Mumme's hot dog guy.\nUK was about to play at LSU in Death Valley, then coached by embattled coach Gerry DiNardo. Mumme marched into the training room on Wednesday with a request that befuddled Allen.\n\"Hey, during pregame, when I'm talking to DiNardo, I want you to bring me a hot dog,\" Mumme said.\nAllen didn't understand. He'd been with him for more than five years at this point, and this was a new one.\n\"Finally, over the next day or two, I said, 'Why do you want a hot dog while you're on the field talking to their head coach?\" Allen said, \"He said, 'Because they're going to be so uptight to begin with. I want to show 'em how carefree and how relaxed I am, and it's going to make them even more nervous.'\"\nMumme was very specific that he wanted mustard on it. He sent a student for the hot dog and was on the field during pregame when he saw Mumme, whom he hadn't talked to yet on the day of the game. He thought, \"well here goes nothing,\" and headed over.\n\"I looked at him and said, 'Coach, here's your hot dog,' Allen said. \"He looked at me and goes, 'Oh, thanks Jeff.' Then he said, 'Hey, hold on, hold on. Does it have mustard on it?'\" Allen assured him it did, all the while playing it straight.\n\"I can still see DiNardo's face,\" Allen said. \"He was like, 'What in the world is happening here?' And I swear to you, Hal just stood there talking and eating that hot dog. I walked off and I turned around and I wanted to see it again. And there they are talking and Hal is just chomping on a hot dog right there on the 50-yard line of Tiger Stadium. And our players were seeing it. They were laughing. They were dying during warmups watching it.\"\nThe Wildcats were 0-24 on the road against ranked teams since 1977. They were 9¬Ω-point underdogs. They played fast and loose and kicked a walk-off field goal to win at the buzzer 39-36, sealing one of the biggest wins in school history. It led Kentucky to a bid in the Outback Bowl, the first New Year's Day bowl for the Wildcats since 1952.\n\"I'm not saying we won that game because of the hot dog,\" Allen said. \"But I don't think it hurt.\"\nOn Dec. 1, 1998, Oklahoma hired Stoops. The Sooners hadn't had a winning season in six years and were coming off a 12-22 stretch in three years under John Blake. Stoops, then 38, was a hot commodity as a defensive coordinator. Hiring someone to run his offense was his first big decision.\n\"My initial talks were with Turner Gill, who was at Nebraska at the time,\" Stoops said. \"That didn't really work out. And then I got to thinking. ... I didn't know [Leach], but the more I thought about it, the more I referred back to how challenging it was to handle Kentucky. If they can be that good at Kentucky, why couldn't we be as good or better at Oklahoma? So I went with it.\"\nIt was a bold move. Leach had never been a playcaller, and let's face it, he was pretty weird.\n\"I thought Mike was really interesting,\" Stoops said. \"Mike had a little different way of doing things. But let me tell you something: He was a hell of a leader. He was demanding, as aloof as he might be. He wanted things done a certain way and they damn sure better be done that way or you were going to hear it. He might look laid back, he was demanding, very demanding.\"\nThat was a learning curve for the rest of the staff, who couldn't figure out if this was all an act, or if Leach was for real.\n\"It was completely different from anything that any of us had seen in the offensive meeting room,\" former Oklahoma assistant and Kansas head coach Mark Mangino said. \"It did take time to get used to.\"\nSo did Leach's personality. The staff was all staying at a hotel in Norman, and somehow Mangino's room became the center of the action.\n\"I couldn't get him out of my room when I was living in the Residence Inn,\" Mangino said. \"Every night, somebody delivered a couple cases of beer, a box of cigars, and we sat around and called recruits till about 11:30.\"\nBy midnight, everyone was gone. Except Leach.\n\"Mike used to like to watch those simulcasts of Howard Stern. And those things would run till 4 in the morning. I'm in my bed trying to sleep. And here's Leach at 3 in the morning, he's laughing at Howard Stern, he's drinking a beer and he's having a good time.\"\nStoops, too, had a learning curve.\n\"I learned after the first few weeks late at night not to stop in and check in on Mike,\" Stoops said. \"One night, it's 11 or something, I'm ready to go home, and he starts telling me a story about Geronimo. After about 20 minutes, I said, 'Mike, I'm going home. I'm the head coach, I get to go when I want.'\"\nMangino, meanwhile, couldn't shake him at night, and he couldn't get through to him by day. In a staff meeting, Mangino suggested a running play. Leach couldn't have been less interested. Mangino suggested trying it at practice, and Leach blew him off again. Mangino said maybe he'll practice it anyway.\n\"Mike said, you could put it in all you want, you could run it during every play of inside drill, but I'm never going to call it in a game,\" and Mangino and Leach nearly came to blows, Stoops said, laughing.\nAn irritated Stoops called them into his office and made them hash it out. Stoops made it clear that he had given Leach full control, and they'd do it his way. Leach and Mangino became good friends.\nThe Big 12 was never the same. The new-look Sooners went 7-5 and made their first bowl game in five years. Texas Tech hired Leach, and Mangino took over, finally getting to put in a couple of wrinkles of his own.\nMangino had a season's worth of reps in place, and he said he ran about 80% of Leach's offense. \"And it worked,\" he said. The Sooners won a national championship, going 13-0 behind Josh Heupel, a lightly recruited junior college quarterback Leach found at Snow College.\nFrom the @kfor archives, Mike Leach at his last OU practice with Josh Heupel on Dec. 8, 1999. You can see the emotions as he talks with Heupel. Leach was introduced as the Texas Tech head coach the next day. pic.twitter.com/xm65rAhAes\n\"They were the ones that invented it ... but we [Oklahoma, Leach, Texas Tech and the Big 12] were the ones to make it popular,\" Stoops said. \"They weren't getting the national attention at Kentucky until we started it. And then, of course, we kept it and won the national championship.\"\nLeach became a star at Texas Tech. He took down No. 1 Texas, guided the Red Raiders to a bowl game in all 10 of his seasons and finished as the program's all-time winningest coach at 84-43.\nDykes was part of Leach's first staff that replaced his dad, Spike Dykes, who had retired.\n\"We were doing all this stuff that was really analytics, but they didn't know it was,\" Dykes said. \"We were going for it all the time on fourth down or going for it in our own territory. My dad would be like, 'What the hell are you doing?' I'm like, 'It gives us a chance to beat Texas. Instead of losing by 14, we might lose by 50. But we also might win?'\"\nIt became one of the most influential eras in college football. In Mumme's days in Kentucky, Urban Meyer and Sean Payton were among the earliest coaches to visit to try to learn what the Air Raid is all about. In Lubbock, Leach made sure his doors were wide open, and there were visitors everywhere.\nLeach made sure his coaches knew that he wanted them to teach visitors anything they wanted to know.\nThere was only one issue: \"They didn't believe us,\" said Lincoln Riley, who was a student assistant for Leach, because the entire offense was so simple.\n\"I've never been to a place where you had more coaches around constantly,\" Riley said. \"Mike was so open to people coming in. You think just Texas high school coaches? No. I'm talking professional coaches, college coaches from all around the country, high school coaches from all around the country, every single year. There's a group from Japan that came, groups from England that came over, I mean, you name it, we had 'em.\"\nDykes and Holgorsen, who were receivers coaches and later co-offensive coordinators, would handle a lot of high school coaches on their visits. Dykes said he can remember walking out to the parking lot one day and overhearing the coaches leaving convinced the offense couldn't be that simple, that Leach & Co. were holding things back.\n\"'Those sumb------ wouldn't tell us anything,'\" Dykes recalled them saying. \"And we told them everything.\"\nMuleshoe High's David Wood coached Riley and his brother Garrett Riley, now the offensive coordinator at Clemson, and watched as they passed over small-school offers to head to Lubbock to learn from Leach. Over time, he said, you could see the Tech influence take hold and spread throughout high school football, with Muleshoe being one of the early adopters, because Lincoln returned to help him install it while he was still a walk-on quarterback at Tech.\n\"We were a run offense, but once we realized how simple it was, we didn't think it was going to be that hard to switch,\" Wood said. \"We used to run maybe 30 plays in practice because you analyze every play and tell every player what they did wrong and then you'd run the play again and make sure everyone did it right. The way Leach did it, when we watched it, you got to coach on the run. So we were able to get like 120 plays a practice instead of 30 plays a practice.\"\nWood said when Riley set out for Lubbock in 2002, there were maybe two schools in the Texas Panhandle that were running a spread offense.\n\"I would say probably 70 percent of the teams we played when I retired [in 2017] were running it,\" he said. \"Maybe 80.\"\nThe Big 12 became known for its shootouts, and Leach's earliest quarterback rooms were filled with future stars and coaches, all of whom waited their turn, many of them just to start for one season. Kliff Kingsbury, who had originally signed with Spike Dykes, threw for more than 5,000 yards as a senior in 2002 and set seven NCAA records in his three years as a starter at Tech. His backup, B.J. Symons, set the NCAA passing record with 5,833 yards in 2003, and Symons' backups, Sonny Cumbie and Cody Hodges, each passed for more than 4,000 yards in a season as starters.\nThey did it all because Leach repeated the same things he and Mumme had always preached, particularly in the film room.\n\"The worst coaching point he would ever give us, and the one that we all hated, was: 'This guy was open. This guy was open. This guy was open. This guy wasn't open. And he's the one guy you threw it to!\" said Cumbie, now the head coach at Louisiana Tech, imitating Leach's monotone cadence. \"I don't care if it's two-high [safety coverage], one-high. Is it man? Is it zone? Is this guy open? Yes. Throw it to him.\"\nMumme's Kentucky era ended in an NCAA investigation, with Mumme resigning in 2001 amid findings that an assistant coach was sending money orders to players in Memphis. Mumme was cited for a \"failure to monitor,\" but was not punished by the NCAA.\nSince then, he'll sign up to coach anything, anytime, anywhere, including stops at New Mexico State, reviving football after 20 years at Southeastern Louisiana or stops at Division III schools Belhaven in Mississippi and McMurry in Texas.\n\"I'm the Johnny Appleseed of football,\" Mumme said. \"I always thought that was a great story. It's not that I set out to do that -- I never set out to get kicked out of Kentucky -- but when you look back on it, providence had a plan. We spread it a whole lot of places it wouldn't have been otherwise.\"\nAnd despite his offense being almost the norm now, rather than catching teams by surprise, it still works as it was intended: As a sort of money ball, beating teams that you have no business beating.\nAt McMurry, he took over a program that had three winless seasons in the previous decade, including an 0-10 mark the year before he arrived. Three years later, they were 9-3 and 7-1 in the conference.\nOut of the spotlight, Mumme still made history. And he did it in the most Mumme way possible.\nMcMurry opened the 2011 season with an 82-6 loss to Stephen F. Austin, who was ranked in the FCS at the time. After getting down early, Mumme would just keep going for it on fourth down over and over. He was down 35-0 at halftime, and it only got worse from there. But he wouldn't stop.\n\"Losing by 50 was the same as losing by 1,\" Dykes said. \"Hal never cared.\"\nThe next week, Mumme gave the team four days off. He showed them five plays from the first half where it easily could've been 35-28 instead of 35-0. They were set to face UTSA the next week, a D-I team coached by Larry Coker, who'd won a national championship at Miami. Mumme's quarterback, Jake Mullin, like Dewald, wasn't on the team when he arrived. He played baseball, but was a quarterback on the intramural team when Mumme found him.\n\"They said they created this offense for teams without much talent, which was great for us,\" Mullin said, who, like Dewald, ended up throwing for more than 12,000 yards in his career. \"Whenever [Mumme] got there, there was not much there. I mean, I remember I was bigger than my left guard.\"\nMumme took the team to the Menger Hotel in San Antonio, his favorite place, where Teddy Roosevelt recruited Texans at the bar to serve in his Rough Riders. He took the team on a tour of the Alamo the night before the game. The next day, McMurry upset UTSA 24-21 in front of 31,000 fans in the Alamodome, one of the only upsets of a D-I team by a D-III team in history, and Mullin threw for 372 yards.\n\"The Menger's filled with ghosts, we did have a ghost sighting in there,\" Mumme said. \"Between the Menger ghosts and the Alamo ghosts, they probably helped us out.\"\nMumme's fascination with history earned him an invitation from then-McMurry professor Don Frazier to a party for his new book, \"The Alamo and Beyond.\" Also invited? One of the world's largest collectors of Alamo memorabilia in the world: Phil Collins. Yes, that Phil Collins.\nFrazier didn't want Collins to be constantly accosted at the event, so he invited Mumme because he said half the table of Texans would rather talk to Mumme about the Air Raid and Leach than to a British rock star. Even about the Alamo.\nMumme got his copy autographed by Collins. The inscription reads:\n\"To coach... Something's in the air tonight. Cheers. Phil Collins.\"\nMumme, 71, keeps spreading the gospel. He is part of the operations group of a new spring league called the International Football Alliance with teams in Mexico and Texas, and will coach one of the teams. His son, Matt, who never became Michael Jordan, instead stuck with the family business and is now the assistant head coach at Colorado State.\nMumme has seen his little creation change the sport, including watching some of the most storied running teams of his lifetime at USC and Oklahoma be completely transformed. Now, it's finally broken through to the final frontier: the Big Ten, where Wisconsin, under Leach acolyte Phil Longo, is following the same formula as Oklahoma: Join forces with a defensive head coach (Luke Fickell) and flip the offense. Harrell, the former Leach quarterback, is the new offensive coordinator at Purdue as well.\n\"A couple of days before Mike passed, we talked and he was just ultra excited that we're bringing the Air Raid to the Big Ten,\" Longo said. \"It's the most excited I've ever heard him. So it meant something to me that he was happy that we were making moves, and he's the only one who didn't seem shocked by it.\"\nMason Miller, Leach's offensive line coach at Mississippi State who is now the offensive coordinator at Tarleton State, has worked for either Mumme or Leach basically since 1994 when he played running back at Valdosta State. He said the Air Raid family has become so big that it has its share of \"little sibling rivalries,\" but that when they all get together, \"we're like magnets to each other.\"\nLeach's loss has been profound on the family. But out of that loss, there's a new beginning.\nLeach's son Cody spent two years as a volunteer coach at BYU under Kalani Sitake, and spent his dad's final year as a graduate assistant at Mississippi State. Now, he's an assistant special teams coach for the Bulldogs, who has completed his Air Raid certification -- a service Mumme offers to keep spreading the word to coaches anywhere -- and is studying his dad's old game tapes stored in Gatorade coolers in his garage.\n\"I wish I could have gotten more time with him,\" Cody, 27, said. \"But Dad being so famous, being on TV, the occasional 'Friday Night Lights' cameo and other random stuff in media, I can always find him. Not everyone has that kind of opportunity where your parent is so well-documented that you can just find them and pull them up anytime.\"\nThere's another Mumme-Leach pairing in the works, with Cody hoping to follow his father's path.\n\"He knew so many other amazing coaches and all the guys he knows, I've known for a long time too,\" Cody said. \"So I have plenty of people to be able to talk to. His was the first generation, and it's kind of taking off into other branches. For me, it's a legacy.\"\nStoops says he can't help but look around and see how profound their impact was.\n\"It goes back to Mike,\" he said. \"And Hal's not talked enough about. He and Mike were joined at the hip. Between the two of them, I don't know that anyone's had a stronger influence on coaches. It goes on and on. The influence is huge. These tentacles from them go all over the place. They branch out from the two of them everywhere.\"\nJake Trotter and Chris Low contributed to this story."}
{"title": "What to know about the Warriors' WNBA expansion franchise", "date": "2023-10-06 00:46:22", "text": "Ramona Shelburne and Malika Andrews react to the Bay Area receiving a WNBA expansion team. (1:05)\nWNBA fans have long clamored for expansion, and that day is finally here: The league will add a 13th team in the Bay Area, awarded to the NBA's Golden State Warriors, that will begin play in 2025, the WNBA announced Thursday.\nA second expansion franchise is expected to be announced this year, likely Portland, per ESPN's Ramona Shelburne. That franchise would also begin play in 2025. WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert confirmed in a news conference Thursday the league's goal is to have 14 teams by 2025.\nEngelbert and Warriors personnel declined to reveal the expansion fee the Warriors paid. Engelbert added only that it was \"a record-breaking expansion fee\" for the league, along with other significant investments that come with starting a WNBA franchise.\nThe league, which had as many as 16 teams in 2000, has held steady at 12 teams since 2010, after the Sacramento Monarchs folded the previous year. It last had 14 teams in 2008, when both the Monarchs and Houston Comets were still playing.\nThe long-awaited news of expansion won't just open up more roster spots -- which currently is at a maximum of 144, or 12 per team -- but will also reestablish the WNBA in at least one market where the league has already been: The Monarchs were an original franchise and played in Sacramento from 1997 to 2009, winning a championship in 2005. The Portland Fire were added in 2000 before the franchise folded in 2002.\nThe new team -- which will likely be called \"Golden State\" per Shelburne, though its official name and mascot are still to be determined -- will play home games at the Chase Center in San Francisco (where the Warriors play) and will practice in Oakland at the Warriors' former practice facility.\nThe Warriors are the sixth NBA franchise with a WNBA team, joining the Indiana Pacers (Indiana Fever), Minnesota Timberwolves (Minnesota Lynx), Brooklyn Nets (New York Liberty), Phoenix Suns (Phoenix Mercury) and Washington Wizards (Washington Mystics).\nGolden State also expands the league's footprint out West, giving the WNBA five teams in the Pacific or Mountain time zones.\nESPN's Alexa Philippou, Michael Voepel and Kevin Pelton break down what we know and what we are still waiting to find out about the new Golden State WNBA team and the league's expansion plans.\nWarriors personnel and Engelbert pointed to signs that women's basketball and women's sports in general are taking off. On Thursday they mentioned how viewership, attendance and merchandise sales are all going in the right direction, as well as increased sponsorship interest even within the past five to 10 years. To put it simply: \"The league is ready,\" said Joe Lacob, Warrior co-executive chairman and CEO.\nWhile the WNBA sat on expansion for over a decade, the NWSL (which began competition in 2013) has showcased the surging interest and investment in women's sports, as the league has expanded from eight to 12 teams since 2021 and has three more to come, including one in the Bay Area.\nThe inability of promising yet developing players, or even already established talented veterans, to maintain roster spots in the league has led to calls for the WNBA to expand its size, which could be done either via franchise expansion or by increasing the number of players teams are permitted to carry. WNBA stakeholders have different opinions on which route would be best, but Engelbert has maintained she believes franchise expansion is the way to go.\n\"The depth of the talent in this league has never been better, and the depth of the talent and breadth of the talent coming out of the NCAA system has never been better,\" Engelbert said Thursday.\nFranchise expansion will arrive amid enormous excitement over the crop of talent and high-profile players currently in college -- a group Engelbert called \"generational players\" Thursday -- with the likes of Iowa's Caitlin Clark, LSU's Angel Reese, Stanford's Cameron Brink, UConn's Paige Bueckers and Azzi Fudd and Notre Dame's Olivia Miles expected to go pro over the next few years.\nThe 2025 calendar year will be pivotal for the league even beyond expansion. While the current CBA runs through 2027, there is a mutual opt-out clause that could go into effect at the end of the 2025 campaign. The league's media rights deal with ESPN also runs through 2025. Engelbert has previously identified the new rights deal -- and as part of that the league's valuation -- as critical to the league's growth, and has said that expansion can help boost the league's value ahead of those negotiations. -- Philippou\nEngelbert said Thursday that details on how Golden State will build its roster will be discussed after the WNBA Finals when both the competition committee and board of governors meet. She said an expansion draft would likely happen in late 2024, after the draft lottery for the 2025 draft is held.\nWhile we don't know exactly how the process will go, we can look to history for precedent. In 2008, the Atlanta Dream built their inaugural roster of 13 players via an expansion draft by selecting from a pool of available players from the other 13 WNBA franchises, and by conducting multiple trades. For the expansion draft, which was held in February before free agency, each team was able to protect a maximum of six players who were not eligible for selection by Atlanta. The Dream could choose one player from each team regardless of contract status, although they couldn't select multiple unrestricted free agents. Atlanta then had the right to \"core\" that unrestricted free agent -- in the Dream's case, Betty Lennox.\nThe last time an expansion draft was held for multiple incoming franchises was in 2000: the still-running Indiana Fever and Seattle Storm as well as the now-defunct Miami Sol and Portland. In that expansion draft, the rules largely preserved existing teams, allowing them to protect eight of their nine top players. The new teams selected six players in the expansion draft and filled out their rosters in the 2000 draft or via trades.\nIn 2008, the Dream were assigned the No. 4 pick and did not participate in the lottery. In 2006, the Chicago Sky were assigned the sixth pick, behind the five teams that missed the playoffs the previous season.\n\nAgain, these aren't necessarily the rules the league will dictate as Golden State builds its roster, but they give us an idea of what could happen. -- Philippou\nAside from the Bay Area's women's basketball tradition and roots, the region makes sense from an economic perspective. Engelbert mentioned multiple times the potential to capitalize off Silicon Valley as a \"global hub of technology and commerce and innovation.\"\n\"Technology is driving our economy, and the tech center of your country doesn't have a WNBA team -- that doesn't seem right to me,\" the commissioner said. The Bay Area is also a big media market and had favorable \"demographics and the psychographics\" for a WNBA team, she said.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n‚Ä¢ Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ NBA training camp cheat sheets ¬ª\n More ESPN+ content ¬ª\nEngelbert mentioned the importance of bringing in \"long-term owners committed to success, not just to the team and winning championships but to the league overall,\" and the Warriors seem like they'll fit that bill perfectly. The fact that this Golden State team will play in a state-of-the-art arena such as the Chase Center and practice in a NBA-grade facility in Oakland shows the standard for investment in the league is light-years better than where it was even five years ago.\nThe Warriors have the expertise on how to operate a massive successful basketball franchise, and Lacob has shown a commitment to women's basketball previously with his involvement in the ABL and the San Jose Lasers. He noted that the sport is in a much different place than where it was in the late-1990s, but also said, \"I'm a lot wiser now. ... We are a little more experienced and we're certainly well-capitalized and have good facilities.\"\nMany notable WNBA players have Bay Area ties: Sabrina Ionescu, Chelsea Gray, Danielle Robinson and Haley Jones are from the region. Stanford produced sisters Nneka Ogwumike and Chiney Ogwumike, as well as Brink, and Layshia Clarendon went to Cal. Bay Area fans would be even more excited about their new team should it manage to get any of those local legends. -- Philippou\nIt's important to remember the Monarchs franchise didn't fold for lack of fan support. It was one of the franchises that was a victim of the global financial crisis of 2006 to '08, and the Maloof family -- which then also owned the NBA's Sacramento Kings -- got out of the WNBA.\nThere were Bay Area fans who supported the Monarchs; now they won't have as far to travel. Between the Stanford fan base, former Monarchs and Lasers fans, and cultivating new fans, this organization should be able to establish a solid following. -- Voepel\nLacob boldly said in Thursday's news conference that the Golden State team will win a championship within its first five years of existence (something he also said when he purchased the Warriors). That said, history tells us not to expect too much, too soon from an expansion team. The last two franchises added to the league won a combined nine games in their first season of play, with Chicago going 5-29 and Atlanta 4-30. But their paths diverged from there.\nThe Dream landed Angel McCoughtry by winning the 2009 draft lottery and improved by 14 wins in Year 2, making the playoffs. A year after that, Atlanta reached the WNBA Finals for the first of three trips in four years led by McCoughtry.\nMeanwhile, the Sky were still struggling to make the playoffs despite arriving in the league two years earlier. Their first postseason trip didn't come until their eighth season in 2013, when the addition of future MVP Elena Delle Donne as a rookie to another future MVP in Sylvia Fowles produced a 24-10 record. Chicago made the Finals for the first time the following year.\nMaking the Finals in Year 3 might not be realistic for the Golden State franchise, but with the Warriors' resources, it's unlikely the process will be as slow as it was for the Sky. -- Pelton"}

Cano has been a little more hittable in the second half, especially in the final month. The Orioles are deep in left-handed relievers with Cionel Perez, Danny Coulombe and rookie DL Hall, but they're scrambling a bit from the right side aside from Cano. Tyler Wells, a starter until he was sent down to the minors in late July, is back as a reliever and could get some high-leverage moments. -- SchoenfieldTwo years removed from a 110-loss season, Baltimore punched its ticket to October -- and has much bigger things in its future.\nDavid Schoenfield ¬ªKurkjian: From raw to really, really good ¬ª\nPassan: The Homer Hose and more ¬ª\nReady for his October close-up: Last year, when the Orioles rose from 110 losses to the edge of contention within the sport's most difficult division, it was all about Adley Rutschman. This year, as the Orioles have surged through a 100-win season, it's all about Gunnar Henderson, a lock for the AL Rookie of the Year award and a legitimate star at the age of 22. Henderson can hit, slug, run and field, but, like Rutschman, he also just seems to have this aura around him, like it's already so obvious that we're watching a generational talent. That swing is pure poetry, too. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: This is a franchise that lost 110 games just two seasons ago, making this year's rise to the top of the American League one of the most dramatic turnarounds in major league history. The Orioles have emerging young stars such as Rutschman and Henderson, plus vets such as Cedric Mullins and Anthony Santander who suffered through some terrible seasons in Baltimore. They're not flashy, but they play good defense, they run the bases well and the lineup is deeper than you might realize. Plus, root for them now when they're the shiny new thing: You might get tired of them down the road after they make the playoffs every year for the next decade. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One thing we know about the AL teams in the bracket is that if they play the Braves in the last series of the season, that will mean any questions about them that we have entering the playoffs will have been answered. In the Orioles' case, that will mean the back of the bullpen has come together but even more importantly, it would suggest that the stage hasn't been too big for the O's. And that would mean their young stars like Henderson and Rutschman are doing their thing. If that happens, all the Orioles have to do is be themselves, because they can match the Braves in terms of raw talent. -- DoolittleHouston AstrosNo. 2 seed | 90-72 | AL West champsALDS opponent: Twins (53.3% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 12.5% | Caesars odds: +500Predicted date of their last game: Nov. 3The one thing that will decide their October fate: Pitching carried the Astros to the World Series title last season -- especially the bullpen -- as they hit just .232/.302/.389 in the postseason. The pitching doesn't appear as strong this season, so the offense will have to do better. We all know what Yordan Alvarez can do but the keys are Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman. Altuve didn't have a single RBI last postseason and Bregman struggled in the 2021 playoffs, when he was battling an injury. Houston needs both of them to perform this October. -- Schoenfield Ready for his October closeup: Michael Brantley remained a major voice in the Astros' clubhouse during their run to a championship last fall, but his bat was a major void from their lineup. Now he's back. Brantley returned in August after a 14-month absence that was caused by a torn labrum, and he did what he always does -- he performed like one of the best pure hitters in the game. This team is still very much the same Astros that have reached the AL Championship Series in six straight years, but they've only performed like that in spurts this season. They'll really need Brantley's bat in the playoffs this time. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: Well, chances are you won't, unless you're an Astros fan. Even last year you could at least root for Dusty Baker to finally win a World Series. But maybe you're a fan of baseball history and would appreciate Houston becoming the first team to win consecutive World Series since the Yankees won three in a row from 1998 to 2000. OK, who am I kidding? You're not rooting for the Astros unless you live in Houston. -- SchoenfieldMLB trade deadline in hindsightKnowing what we know now, which teams should have done more, less -- or exactly the same? Judging all 30 clubs one month later ¬ª\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Remember '21. If we end up with a pairing of the last two champions in the Fall Classic, it will be a bit of a turnabout. In 2021, an upstart Braves squad that won just 88 regular season games knocked off a 95-win Astros squad in six games. Adding to the indignity was that Atlanta finished off the Astros in Houston. The enduring image from the deciding contest was on a night when the roof was open at Minute Maid Park, Jorge Soler blasted a Luis Garcia pitch over the Crawford Boxes, over the head of the choo-choo commander up on the tracks and out onto the street and into the Texas night. If we get a rematch, we're talking about a 104-win Braves juggernaut against a wounded champ in Houston, which barely earned its playoff spot. Is revenge the right motivation for a defending champ? Sure, why not? -- DoolittleMinnesota TwinsNo. 3 seed | 87-75 | AL Central champsALDS opponent: Astros (46.7% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 10.5% | Caesars odds: +2000Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 11The one thing that will decide their October fate: Will the Twins stay healthy enough? Everything went Minnesota's way in the opening round, but health remains a question. Carlos Correa missed the final two weeks of the regular season with plantar fasciitis. Royce Lewis, who hit four grand slams in an eight-game stretch and leads the team in OPS, missed the end of the season with a hamstring issue before a stellar wild-card round. Byron Buxton, who didn't play in the field all season, missed almost all of the final two months (and scuffled at the plate all season anyway). Reliever Brock Stewart, who came out of nowhere to post a sub-1.00 ERA, had been out since June before returning for the final two series. -- SchoenfieldReady for his October closeup: Lewis spent the first two months of the season recovering from his second torn ACL and didn't join the team until late May. But he has been the Twins' most productive hitter, slashing .309/.372/.548 in a 58-game sample. Injuries, unfortunately, continue to be a big part of his story. Lewis missed six weeks around midseason with an oblique strain and finished the year on the injured list, though he seems on track to at least make it back as a designated hitter. The Twins had high hopes for Lewis when they took him with the No. 1 overall pick out of high school in 2017, and he has finally provided glimpses of his potential this year. His real opportunity is in the postseason -- and he is off to a roaring start. -- GonzalezEditor's PicksPassan: Why all 12 MLB playoff teams can win the World Series -- and which one actually will3dJeff PassanOctober ace tiers: Ranking the top 15 starting pitchers for the 2023 MLB playoffs6dKiley McDanielAn A+ for the O's ... and SIX F's!? Full regular-season grades for all 30 MLB teams9dDavid Schoenfield2 RelatedWhy you should root for them: This is an easy one. You're certainly tired of the Astros. You're not ready to jump on the Orioles' or Rangers' bandwagons. But the Twins ... the Twins just ended an unfathomable streak of 18 consecutive playoff losses going back to 2004. The fine people of Minnesota don't deserve this. Let the Twins make a run. Nobody expects them to win, so if you want an underdog in the AL, the Twins are your team. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One of the things that makes the Braves so lethal is that despite a historic level of collective power, they don't strike out that much. Nevertheless, the standout trait of the Twins has been the ability of their pitchers to dominate the strike zone. Minnesota's hurlers led the majors in strikeout percentage and ranked fourth in walk percentage. The strike zone is a dangerous place to be against the Braves: Their OPS on pitches in the zone was nearly 100 points better than that of any other team. For Sonny Gray, Pablo Lopez and the rest, throwing strikes while staying out of the middle of the plate is their best hope of keeping the Braves in the ballpark and, perhaps just as important, keeping runners off base so when Atlanta does go deep, it's a solo shot. -- DoolittleTexas RangersNo. 5 seed | 90-72 | AL second wild cardALDS opponent: Orioles (49.8% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 12.1% | Caesars odds: +1600Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 11The one thing that will decide their October fate: The bullpen. The Rangers have the worst bullpen ERA of any of the playoff teams and rank 26th in the majors in bullpen win probability added. Will Smith lost his job as closer weeks ago and Aroldis Chapman and Jose Leclerc have shared closer duties in September. Both do have strikeout stuff and the ability to dominate -- when they're not walking everybody. And who sets them up? Andrew Heaney has been pitching out of the bullpen and will get key innings. Jonathan Hernandez had to relieve Chapman in a key spot in Seattle and gave up a game-losing bases-loaded double. The lack of depth also means it's imperative for the starters to give Bruce Bochy some length. Jordan Montgomery has been able to do that, but Nathan Eovaldi had been slowly ramping up since his return from the injured list before a strong showing to open the postseason. And Max Scherzer? The Rangers haven't ruled him out of the postseason -- and you don't want to bet against Scherzer -- but his return appears unlikely. -- SchoenfieldHow the Rangers got to OctoberAfter decades of struggles on the mound, the Rangers finally cracked the code for building a modern rotation, or so they hope.\nJeff Passan ¬ªPassan: Inside Texas' deadline spree ¬ª\nDoolittle: Weathering Texas-sized storm ¬ª\nReady for his October closeup: The Rangers acquired Adolis Garcia for almost nothing. The Cardinals had basically given up on him, and so in December of 2019, the Rangers picked him up for mere cash considerations. He didn't establish himself in the major leagues until 2021, his age-28 season, but he has improved every year since with his OPS jumping from .741 to .756 to, this year, .836. As the Rangers have lifted themselves into championship contention, Garcia has emerged as one of the sport's most menacing power hitters. He also has become a lot more discerning within the strike zone. The Rangers, with that very shaky bullpen situation, are going to have to hit their way through October, and Garcia will be a big part of that. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: The Braves' offense has understandably received much of the national attention, but the Rangers aren't far behind in runs scored -- although they've benefited from a huge home-park advantage with 53 more home runs at Globe Life Field than on the road. Like the Braves, they have ridiculous depth from No. 1 to No. 9 in the lineup, with Corey Seager leading the way by putting up one of the greatest offensive seasons ever for a shortstop (other than missing 40 games). They lead the AL in average, home runs, walks, OBP and slugging. Oh, and keep an eye on 21-year-old outfielder Evan Carter, who has torn the cover off the ball since his September call-up. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Rangers bashed their way to a breakout season for much of the summer. They won 11 games by 10 or more runs, far and away more than any other team. That includes the homer-happy Braves. If the Rangers survive the AL bracket, it's almost certainly going to be because they've touched the offensive ceiling they displayed earlier in the campaign. The pitching staff, especially the bullpen, has to be better than it was for much of the post-trade-deadline part of the season. But if the Rangers win the World Series, it's going to be because Marcus Semien, Seager, Garcia and the rest are turning the scoreboard. In particular, that is their formula for beating Atlanta. -- DoolittleNational LeagueAtlanta BravesNo. 1 seed | 104-58 | NL East champsNLDS opponent: Phillies (61.5% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 21.7% | Caesars odds: +275Predicted date of their last game: Nov. 3The one thing that will decide their October fate: Suddenly there are big concerns about Atlanta's starting rotation. Max Fried missed his last couple of starts of the regular season with a blister problem. Charlie Morton has already been ruled out of the division series with a finger issue. Bryce Elder was an All-Star in the first half but saw his ERA balloon to over 5.00 in the second half. Even Spencer Strider has had some mediocre outings down the stretch and seen his MLB-leading strikeout rate drop in the final two months. On top of that, the bullpen has some injury issues and had its worst month in September, which puts even more pressure on the rotation. -- SchoenfieldThe year of the HR-crushing BravesCheck out our best Braves coverage from this season as they gear up to make a playoff run.MLB execs on how to beat Atlanta ¬ª Greatest lineup ever? ¬ª\nInside Acuna's return to MVP form ¬ª\nReady for his October closeup: Ronald Acuna Jr. was nursing a torn ACL when the Braves won it all in 2021. He had made it back when they returned to the postseason in 2022, but he clearly wasn't himself yet. This year, he has reached a new level. He's the NL MVP front-runner, the first member of the 40-70 club and a far more disciplined hitter than he ever has been. At 25, he is the best baseball player on the planet (non-Shohei Ohtani division). And his prowess from the leadoff spot is the biggest reason this Braves lineup has become historic. When the games matter most, Acuna can impact them with his majestic power and blazing speed and rocket arm, and he's sure to do plenty of that in October. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: The Murderer's Row Yankees of Ruth and Gehrig. The Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s. The Big Red Machine. The \"Idiot\" Red Sox of 2004. With a World Series title, the Braves have a chance to cement their place in history as one of the most fearsome lineups of all time. They dominated the regular season -- tying the single-season home run record -- with a lineup that became the first to feature four players with 35-plus home runs. They've been the team to watch all season and now that greatness will be tested in October. -- SchoenfieldWhy they are the team to beat: The offense is just too good to keep down. And while we've seen offensive powerhouses falter before in the crucible of October, the Braves' attack looks airtight. Their numbers hold up no matter how you split them up. They mash at home and on the road, against lefties and righties, against all kinds of pitch profiles. They have power at every spot in the lineup. Earlier in the season, it looked like the Braves might have become too reliant on homers for scoring, a trait that doesn't always hold up well in the playoffs. But Atlanta's offense has gradually become more varied as the season has progressed and right now appears to be without weakness. Sure, the Braves have question marks around their pitching staff, but if their offense is putting up five or more runs a game, that might not matter. -- DoolittleLos Angeles DodgersNo. 2 seed | 100-62 | NL West champsNLDS opponent: D-backs (67.4% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 19.9% | Caesars odds: +500Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 23The one thing that will decide their October fate: Sure, they'll need this patched-together starting rotation to step up, but let's face it: Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman have carried this team all season with their all-around brilliance and L.A. will be relying on those two stars to keep it going. Yes, those two have supporting offensive characters in Max Muncy and J.D. Martinez, who both topped 30 home runs, and Will Smith, but this has been the Mookie and Freddie show. It's hard to envision a path to the World Series that doesn't revolve around those two both having big October runs. -- SchoenfieldReady for his October closeup: Clayton Kershaw and Lance Lynn will be limited in their starts and the likes of Emmet Sheehan, Ryan Pepiot and Ryan Yarbrough will be used mostly to soak up the middle innings. But Bobby Miller -- the 24-year-old power right-hander, the best of an emerging young core of starting pitchers -- will essentially be counted on to be the Dodgers' ace. He has the electric stuff, and the Dodgers believe he also possesses the poise, a la Walker Buehler. Miller dominated at the outset, allowing only two runs in 23 innings through the first four starts of his major league career. He hasn't been as effective since, but he had a solid month of September. He'll need to take it to another level in October. -- GonzalezL.A.'s dominant transition yearCheck out our best Dodgers coverage from this season as they get ready for the 2023 playoffs.

And yet, their only World Series title during this dynastic run carries an asterisk because it came that shortened campaign with playoff games at neutral sites and the whole weirdness of that season. So, yes, there is part of me that would like the Dodgers to win a World Series in a real season, with fans in the stands, with Mookie hitting home runs, Freddie hitting doubles and maybe even Kershaw dialing up Father Time and having his best October ever. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: While the Braves might be scrambling to fill out an injury-riddled rotation, the Dodgers have been doing that all along. So there doesn't appear to be an advantage for Atlanta in starting pitching and the Dodgers' bullpen is deeper and better. If that translates to lower-scoring games than the Braves prefer, the chances of one or two performances tipping the series rise. And for all of Ronald Acuna Jr.'s spectacular play and Matt Olson's home runs, would anyone be surprised if Freeman and Betts were enough all on their own to propel the Dodgers past the Braves? Their combined brilliance this season has been breathtaking and the postseason context for both of them is by now old hat. -- DoolittlePhiladelphia PhilliesNo. 4 seed | 90-72 | NL first wild cardNLDS opponent: Braves (38.6% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 8.5% | Caesars odds: +1400Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 12The one thing that will decide their October fate: Home runs. This is true of every team, of course, that you need to hit home runs to win in the postseason, but the Phillies spent the first four months of the season not hitting enough homers. Through the end of July they were 21st in the majors in home runs, topping out at 33 in a month. Then they hit 59 in August and 46 in September to tie the Braves for the most home runs over the final two months. That team -- like the one we saw last October with Bryce Harper and Kyle Schwarber leading the way -- is a team that can return to the World Series. -- SchoenfieldReady for his October closeup: Phillies fans rallied behind Alec Bohm last year and watched him go from being a mess defensively to a very capable third baseman who became an integral part of a World Series team. The same is taking place with Trea Turner, who signed a $300 million contract over the offseason and struggled mightily through his first four months. He then got a supportive standing ovation from the home crowd, and went off in August and September. It's probably no coincidence. When Turner is right, he is one of the most dynamic players in the sport. We saw it early this year during the World Baseball Classic. Soon, he'll get his chance to become a true Philly legend. -- GonzalezEarly MLB free agency rankingsNow that the trade deadline has passed, Kiley McDaniel takes a look at who could get paid big this offseason. Ohtani and rest of top 10 ¬ª\nWhy you should root for them: Come on, this is a fun team. Harper is the straw that stirs the drink and he's must-watch TV in October. Schwarber had one of the wildest, weirdest seasons of all time, with a sub-.200 average but still scoring and driving in 100 runs thanks to his power and walks. Turner got red hot the final two months. Rookie Johan Rojas is electrifying and may be the best defensive center fielder in the game. The bullpen is often a high-wire act, so every Phillies game -- whether they're leading or trailing -- feels undecided until that final out. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Phillies have star power in the lineup and the collective long ball ability to go toe-to-toe with the Braves. Their outfield defense has improved with personnel changes through the season. The rotation is in much better shape than Atlanta's injury-marred group. But the most underrated aspect of the Phillies, and where they may have a decisive edge over the Braves, is the bullpen. The Phillies feature high-octane stuff, depth and balance in this area and most of the chief components (Craig Kimbrel, Gregory Soto, Jose Alvarado, Jeff Hoffman, Matt Strahm, Seranthony Dom√≠nguez) have been on point as the playoffs approach. In Rob Thomson, they have a skipper who proved last year that he knows how to deploy a bullpen in October. If the Phillies can turn a series against the Braves into a successive battle of the bullpens, look out. -- DoolittleArizona DiamondbacksNo. 6 seed | 84-78 | NL third wild cardNLDS opponent: Dodgers (32.6% chance of advancing)World Series odds: 3.8% | Caesars odds: +3300Predicted date of their last game: Oct. 12The one thing that will decide their October fate: The starting pitchers not named Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly -- but what happens after that? The only other starter with an ERA under 5.00 was Tommy Henry and he's injured. Zach Davies was actually in the rotation until he was designated for assignment just a few days before the season ended. That leaves rookies Ryne Nelson and Brandon Pfaadt, who have both been hit hard and struggled with the long ball. Pfaadt has more swing-and-miss stuff, so he's probably the No. 3 starter, but Arizona will have to find a way to win some non-Gallen/Kelly games. -- SchoenfieldHow the D-backs learned to contendWith the help of some emerging veteran leadership, Arizona doubled down on its youth carrying the load.\nJesse Rogers ¬ªPassan: Inside Carroll's rise to stardom ¬ª\nReady for his October closeup: You'd be hard-pressed to find a more electric player than Corbin Carroll, a dynamic defender and an elite hitter who also plays with his hair on fire. Carroll became the first player ever to combine 50-plus steals with 25-plus home runs and 10-plus triples in the same season. He did that as a rookie. David Cone recently said Carroll reminds him of Derek Jeter in his rookie season, largely because of their leadership qualities at a young age. One big difference: Jeter played for one of the world's most decorated franchises. Carroll, not so much. But that's what makes the playoffs so cool -- the world is about to find out just how good and fun Carroll really is. -- GonzalezWhy you should root for them: We mentioned the Orioles turning it around from 110 losses two seasons ago. Well, the Diamondbacks matched them that year with 110 defeats, so getting to the playoffs just two years later is a great achievement for a young, building team. In this day of rocket-armed pitchers, Gallen and Kelly are two starters who rely on movement, location and pitch selection more than pure velocity. The art of pitching is alive and well with those two. -- SchoenfieldWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Run, run, run. Despite the uptick in stolen bases this season, this still isn't baseball, circa 1985. To run on offense, the hitters have to get on base and get the ball in play. If that happens, the Diamondback rolled up 161 stolen bases and did so with a MLB-best 87% success rate. They can drive Sean Murphy and his pitchers crazy. But that's not the only kind of running we're talking about. Arizona's athleticism also paid off on defense as Torey Lovullo's fielders as a unit was arguably the best in the majors. Like Toronto, if Arizona's pitchers can keep the Braves' power bats in the ballpark (easier said than done), Carroll & Co. can impact games by running down balls in the gap -- Doolittle\n\n\n\nBaltimore Orioles\nNo. 1 seed | 101-61 | AL East champs\nALDS opponent: Rangers (50.2% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 12.1% | Caesars odds: +650\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 23\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Now that All-Star closer Felix Bautista is officially done for the season and will undergo Tommy John surgery, the pressure ramps up on a Baltimore bullpen that was so dominant with the late-game duo of Yennier Cano and Bautista. Cano has been a little more hittable in the second half, especially in the final month. The Orioles are deep in left-handed relievers with Cionel Perez, Danny Coulombe and rookie DL Hall, but they're scrambling a bit from the right side aside from Cano. Tyler Wells, a starter until he was sent down to the minors in late July, is back as a reliever and could get some high-leverage moments. -- Schoenfield\nTwo years removed from a 110-loss season, Baltimore punched its ticket to October -- and has much bigger things in its future.\nDavid Schoenfield ¬ª\nKurkjian: From raw to really, really good ¬ª\nPassan: The Homer Hose and more ¬ª\nReady for his October close-up: Last year, when the Orioles rose from 110 losses to the edge of contention within the sport's most difficult division, it was all about Adley Rutschman. This year, as the Orioles have surged through a 100-win season, it's all about Gunnar Henderson, a lock for the AL Rookie of the Year award and a legitimate star at the age of 22. Henderson can hit, slug, run and field, but, like Rutschman, he also just seems to have this aura around him, like it's already so obvious that we're watching a generational talent. That swing is pure poetry, too. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: This is a franchise that lost 110 games just two seasons ago, making this year's rise to the top of the American League one of the most dramatic turnarounds in major league history. The Orioles have emerging young stars such as Rutschman and Henderson, plus vets such as Cedric Mullins and Anthony Santander who suffered through some terrible seasons in Baltimore. They're not flashy, but they play good defense, they run the bases well and the lineup is deeper than you might realize. Plus, root for them now when they're the shiny new thing: You might get tired of them down the road after they make the playoffs every year for the next decade. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One thing we know about the AL teams in the bracket is that if they play the Braves in the last series of the season, that will mean any questions about them that we have entering the playoffs will have been answered. In the Orioles' case, that will mean the back of the bullpen has come together but even more importantly, it would suggest that the stage hasn't been too big for the O's. And that would mean their young stars like Henderson and Rutschman are doing their thing. If that happens, all the Orioles have to do is be themselves, because they can match the Braves in terms of raw talent. -- Doolittle\n\nHouston Astros\nNo. 2 seed | 90-72 | AL West champs\nALDS opponent: Twins (53.3% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 12.5% | Caesars odds: +500\nPredicted date of their last game: Nov. 3\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Pitching carried the Astros to the World Series title last season -- especially the bullpen -- as they hit just .232/.302/.389 in the postseason. The pitching doesn't appear as strong this season, so the offense will have to do better. We all know what Yordan Alvarez can do but the keys are Jose Altuve and Alex Bregman. Altuve didn't have a single RBI last postseason and Bregman struggled in the 2021 playoffs, when he was battling an injury. Houston needs both of them to perform this October. -- Schoenfield \nReady for his October closeup: Michael Brantley remained a major voice in the Astros' clubhouse during their run to a championship last fall, but his bat was a major void from their lineup. Now he's back. Brantley returned in August after a 14-month absence that was caused by a torn labrum, and he did what he always does -- he performed like one of the best pure hitters in the game. This team is still very much the same Astros that have reached the AL Championship Series in six straight years, but they've only performed like that in spurts this season. They'll really need Brantley's bat in the playoffs this time. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: Well, chances are you won't, unless you're an Astros fan. Even last year you could at least root for Dusty Baker to finally win a World Series. But maybe you're a fan of baseball history and would appreciate Houston becoming the first team to win consecutive World Series since the Yankees won three in a row from 1998 to 2000. OK, who am I kidding? You're not rooting for the Astros unless you live in Houston. -- Schoenfield\nKnowing what we know now, which teams should have done more, less -- or exactly the same?\n Judging all 30 clubs one month later ¬ª\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: Remember '21. If we end up with a pairing of the last two champions in the Fall Classic, it will be a bit of a turnabout. In 2021, an upstart Braves squad that won just 88 regular season games knocked off a 95-win Astros squad in six games. Adding to the indignity was that Atlanta finished off the Astros in Houston. The enduring image from the deciding contest was on a night when the roof was open at Minute Maid Park, Jorge Soler blasted a Luis Garcia pitch over the Crawford Boxes, over the head of the choo-choo commander up on the tracks and out onto the street and into the Texas night. If we get a rematch, we're talking about a 104-win Braves juggernaut against a wounded champ in Houston, which barely earned its playoff spot. Is revenge the right motivation for a defending champ? Sure, why not? -- Doolittle\n\nMinnesota Twins\nNo. 3 seed | 87-75 | AL Central champs\nALDS opponent: Astros (46.7% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 10.5% | Caesars odds: +2000\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 11\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Will the Twins stay healthy enough? Everything went Minnesota's way in the opening round, but health remains a question. Carlos Correa missed the final two weeks of the regular season with plantar fasciitis. Royce Lewis, who hit four grand slams in an eight-game stretch and leads the team in OPS, missed the end of the season with a hamstring issue before a stellar wild-card round. Byron Buxton, who didn't play in the field all season, missed almost all of the final two months (and scuffled at the plate all season anyway). Reliever Brock Stewart, who came out of nowhere to post a sub-1.00 ERA, had been out since June before returning for the final two series. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Lewis spent the first two months of the season recovering from his second torn ACL and didn't join the team until late May. But he has been the Twins' most productive hitter, slashing .309/.372/.548 in a 58-game sample. Injuries, unfortunately, continue to be a big part of his story. Lewis missed six weeks around midseason with an oblique strain and finished the year on the injured list, though he seems on track to at least make it back as a designated hitter. The Twins had high hopes for Lewis when they took him with the No. 1 overall pick out of high school in 2017, and he has finally provided glimpses of his potential this year. His real opportunity is in the postseason -- and he is off to a roaring start. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: This is an easy one. You're certainly tired of the Astros. You're not ready to jump on the Orioles' or Rangers' bandwagons. But the Twins ... the Twins just ended an unfathomable streak of 18 consecutive playoff losses going back to 2004. The fine people of Minnesota don't deserve this. Let the Twins make a run. Nobody expects them to win, so if you want an underdog in the AL, the Twins are your team. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: One of the things that makes the Braves so lethal is that despite a historic level of collective power, they don't strike out that much. Nevertheless, the standout trait of the Twins has been the ability of their pitchers to dominate the strike zone. Minnesota's hurlers led the majors in strikeout percentage and ranked fourth in walk percentage. The strike zone is a dangerous place to be against the Braves: Their OPS on pitches in the zone was nearly 100 points better than that of any other team. For Sonny Gray, Pablo Lopez and the rest, throwing strikes while staying out of the middle of the plate is their best hope of keeping the Braves in the ballpark and, perhaps just as important, keeping runners off base so when Atlanta does go deep, it's a solo shot. -- Doolittle\n\nTexas Rangers\nNo. 5 seed | 90-72 | AL second wild card\nALDS opponent: Orioles (49.8% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 12.1% | Caesars odds: +1600\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 11\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: The bullpen. The Rangers have the worst bullpen ERA of any of the playoff teams and rank 26th in the majors in bullpen win probability added. Will Smith lost his job as closer weeks ago and Aroldis Chapman and Jose Leclerc have shared closer duties in September. Both do have strikeout stuff and the ability to dominate -- when they're not walking everybody. And who sets them up? Andrew Heaney has been pitching out of the bullpen and will get key innings. Jonathan Hernandez had to relieve Chapman in a key spot in Seattle and gave up a game-losing bases-loaded double. The lack of depth also means it's imperative for the starters to give Bruce Bochy some length. Jordan Montgomery has been able to do that, but Nathan Eovaldi had been slowly ramping up since his return from the injured list before a strong showing to open the postseason. And Max Scherzer? The Rangers haven't ruled him out of the postseason -- and you don't want to bet against Scherzer -- but his return appears unlikely. -- Schoenfield\nAfter decades of struggles on the mound, the Rangers finally cracked the code for building a modern rotation, or so they hope.\nJeff Passan ¬ª\nPassan: Inside Texas' deadline spree ¬ª\nDoolittle: Weathering Texas-sized storm ¬ª\nReady for his October closeup: The Rangers acquired Adolis Garcia for almost nothing. The Cardinals had basically given up on him, and so in December of 2019, the Rangers picked him up for mere cash considerations. He didn't establish himself in the major leagues until 2021, his age-28 season, but he has improved every year since with his OPS jumping from .741 to .756 to, this year, .836. As the Rangers have lifted themselves into championship contention, Garcia has emerged as one of the sport's most menacing power hitters. He also has become a lot more discerning within the strike zone. The Rangers, with that very shaky bullpen situation, are going to have to hit their way through October, and Garcia will be a big part of that. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: The Braves' offense has understandably received much of the national attention, but the Rangers aren't far behind in runs scored -- although they've benefited from a huge home-park advantage with 53 more home runs at Globe Life Field than on the road. Like the Braves, they have ridiculous depth from No. 1 to No. 9 in the lineup, with Corey Seager leading the way by putting up one of the greatest offensive seasons ever for a shortstop (other than missing 40 games). They lead the AL in average, home runs, walks, OBP and slugging. Oh, and keep an eye on 21-year-old outfielder Evan Carter, who has torn the cover off the ball since his September call-up. -- Schoenfield\nWhat they do that could take down the Braves: The Rangers bashed their way to a breakout season for much of the summer. They won 11 games by 10 or more runs, far and away more than any other team. That includes the homer-happy Braves. If the Rangers survive the AL bracket, it's almost certainly going to be because they've touched the offensive ceiling they displayed earlier in the campaign. The pitching staff, especially the bullpen, has to be better than it was for much of the post-trade-deadline part of the season. But if the Rangers win the World Series, it's going to be because Marcus Semien, Seager, Garcia and the rest are turning the scoreboard. In particular, that is their formula for beating Atlanta. -- Doolittle\n\nAtlanta Braves\nNo. 1 seed | 104-58 | NL East champs\nNLDS opponent: Phillies (61.5% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 21.7% | Caesars odds: +275\nPredicted date of their last game: Nov. 3\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Suddenly there are big concerns about Atlanta's starting rotation. Max Fried missed his last couple of starts of the regular season with a blister problem. Charlie Morton has already been ruled out of the division series with a finger issue. Bryce Elder was an All-Star in the first half but saw his ERA balloon to over 5.00 in the second half. Even Spencer Strider has had some mediocre outings down the stretch and seen his MLB-leading strikeout rate drop in the final two months. On top of that, the bullpen has some injury issues and had its worst month in September, which puts even more pressure on the rotation. -- Schoenfield\nCheck out our best Braves coverage from this season as they gear up to make a playoff run.\nMLB execs on how to beat Atlanta ¬ª\n Greatest lineup ever? ¬ª\nInside Acuna's return to MVP form ¬ª\nReady for his October closeup: Ronald Acuna Jr. was nursing a torn ACL when the Braves won it all in 2021. He had made it back when they returned to the postseason in 2022, but he clearly wasn't himself yet. This year, he has reached a new level. He's the NL MVP front-runner, the first member of the 40-70 club and a far more disciplined hitter than he ever has been. At 25, he is the best baseball player on the planet (non-Shohei Ohtani division). And his prowess from the leadoff spot is the biggest reason this Braves lineup has become historic. When the games matter most, Acuna can impact them with his majestic power and blazing speed and rocket arm, and he's sure to do plenty of that in October. -- Gonzalez\nWhy you should root for them: The Murderer's Row Yankees of Ruth and Gehrig. The Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s. The Big Red Machine. The \"Idiot\" Red Sox of 2004. With a World Series title, the Braves have a chance to cement their place in history as one of the most fearsome lineups of all time. They dominated the regular season -- tying the single-season home run record -- with a lineup that became the first to feature four players with 35-plus home runs. They've been the team to watch all season and now that greatness will be tested in October. -- Schoenfield\nWhy they are the team to beat: The offense is just too good to keep down. And while we've seen offensive powerhouses falter before in the crucible of October, the Braves' attack looks airtight. Their numbers hold up no matter how you split them up. They mash at home and on the road, against lefties and righties, against all kinds of pitch profiles. They have power at every spot in the lineup. Earlier in the season, it looked like the Braves might have become too reliant on homers for scoring, a trait that doesn't always hold up well in the playoffs. But Atlanta's offense has gradually become more varied as the season has progressed and right now appears to be without weakness. Sure, the Braves have question marks around their pitching staff, but if their offense is putting up five or more runs a game, that might not matter. -- Doolittle\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers\nNo. 2 seed | 100-62 | NL West champs\nNLDS opponent: D-backs (67.4% chance of advancing)\nWorld Series odds: 19.9% | Caesars odds: +500\nPredicted date of their last game: Oct. 23\nThe one thing that will decide their October fate: Sure, they'll need this patched-together starting rotation to step up, but let's face it: Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman have carried this team all season with their all-around brilliance and L.A. will be relying on those two stars to keep it going. Yes, those two have supporting offensive characters in Max Muncy and J.D. Martinez, who both topped 30 home runs, and Will Smith, but this has been the Mookie and Freddie show. It's hard to envision a path to the World Series that doesn't revolve around those two both having big October runs. -- Schoenfield\nReady for his October closeup: Clayton Kershaw and Lance Lynn will be limited in their starts and the likes of Emmet Sheehan, Ryan Pepiot and Ryan Yarbrough will be used mostly to soak up the middle innings. But Bobby Miller -- the 24-year-old power right-hander, the best of an emerging young core of starting pitchers -- will essentially be counted on to be the Dodgers' ace. He has the electric stuff, and the Dodgers believe he also possesses the poise, a la Walker Buehler. Miller dominated at the outset, allowing only two runs in 23 innings through the first four starts of his major league career. He hasn't been as effective since, but he had a solid month of September. He'll need to take it to another level in October. -- Gonzalez\nCheck out our best Dodgers coverage from this season as they get ready for the 2023 playoffs.\n Inside Dodgers' pitching plan for playoffs ¬ª\n 5 reasons they keep winning ¬ª\nHow Mookie Betts became an infielder ¬ª\nWhy you should root for them: I get it: The Dodgers are here every year, they're a blue-blood franchise with a high payroll and you're about as tired of them as you are of the Astros.

{"title": "Lowe: Why the Rockets' Jalen Green might be the most important swing player in the NBA", "date": "2023-10-06 03:51:57", "text": "AS COACHES AND players trudged into the locker room at halftime of what would become yet another dispiriting loss -- one of 62 for the 2021-22 Houston Rockets, a team built to lose in its first full season since the end of the James Harden era -- they heard an unusual voice command attention.\n\"You're supposed to lead by example,\" Jalen Green, then a 19-year-old rookie and No. 2 overall draft pick, chastised one of the few veterans on the team -- a player Green and others present won't identify today. Other players and coaches had noticed that veteran playing with a halfhearted selfishness. Only Green spoke up. \"We need you to be better,\" Green continued. \"You're supposed to show us how to do this.\"\nGreen was calm and measured, witnesses recall.\n\"He did it from a place of, 'I'm seeking knowledge,'\" John Lucas, the longtime Rockets assistant coach who now works in the front office, told ESPN. \"It made Jalen a leader among the younger guys.\"\nThere was no retort, no heated back-and-forth. \"The truth has no feelings,\" Lucas said.\n\"It was about showing everyone needs to be held accountable,\" Green told ESPN.\nEighteen months later, Green is the highest draft pick and headliner of one of the NBA's deepest pools of young talent -- the product of three straight losing seasons in which the Rockets won just 59 combined games and prioritized their own first-round picks.\nIn Green, Alperen Sengun, Jabari Smith Jr., Amen Thompson, Tari Eason, and Cam Whitmore, Houston has six high-wattage prospects -- including three top-four picks in Thompson, Smith, and Green. The Rockets have surrounded them with veterans in Fred VanVleet, Dillon Brooks, Jeff Green, and Jock Landale. (They nearly snagged Brook Lopez from the Milwaukee Bucks, sources said.)\nThe veterans are around to teach habits and help the Rockets win more; Houston owes its 2024 first-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder, protected for the top four draft slots -- the first of two painful debts stemming from the Daryl Morey regime's ill-fated 2019 swap of Chris Paul for Russell Westbrook in a desperate bid to placate Harden. By the cold reality of incentives, the losing has to stop.\nMeanwhile, Houston's front office already has to look years ahead: Is it even possible to pay all six of those young guys second contracts under this new collective bargaining agreement -- even with restricted free agency still a powerful cudgel?\nIf none of those players becomes a No. 1-level superstar, can the Rockets -- loaded with picks and prospects -- win the trade wars for one, and still have enough talent leftover? Or does the talent fit so well as to compensate for the lack of that amorphous \"best player on a title team\" -- becoming (one day) one of those greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts contenders? What Green remains a low-percentage shooter who doesn't bring enough outside of points? What if the whole thing fizzles?\nRight now, Green probably represents their best chance at that superstar -- the apex ball handler. He has internal competition. Thompson has star potential. Smith surged last season, blew up in summer league, and seems poised for another leap in Year 2 on both ends. Sengun could be an All-Star-level producer on offense as soon as this season -- in part because of his promising two-man game with Green -- though Sengun has to reach a passable level on defense.\nBut Green has tantalizing scoring tools and a willingness, he and his coaches say, to lean into more of a playmaking role and to give more effort on defense. In Year 3, he now has to live the message he delivered to that would-be veteran mentor: play unselfishly, play hard, play defense -- always.\nVanVleet is the new point guard, but the Rockets still want the ball in Green's hands. (The Rockets have banished Kevin Porter Jr. from the team as he faces domestic violence charges. The basketball impact -- way down the list of what matters in the Porter case -- is that Green and the rest of Houston's young core will have more opportunities to handle the ball.)\nVanVleet's ability to work off the ball is one reason Houston's decision-makers, including new head coach Ime Udoka, preferred VanVleet over a free agency reunion with Harden.\n\"Nothing against James,\" Udoka told ESPN, \"but Fred is just a better fit. I coached James in Brooklyn. He's one of the smartest players I've ever been around. The words 'Ime doesn't want James' never came out of my mouth. It was, 'Let's look at the best fit.' If we want Jalen and the young guys to take the next steps, we need them to have the ball. As for me saying I don't want James, that was never the case. It was about fit.\"\nIt is on Green to pay off that faith by digging deeper into nonscoring aspects of the game.\n\"This is a huge year for him,\" Rafael Stone, the Rockets general manager, told ESPN. \"It's on him to really put together all the things he's worked on. You see individual games where he's locked in -- whether it's on-ball defense, help-side defense, making the right reads in the pick-and-roll. And then there are other games where he just kind of let go of the rope. He's a bucket. It's about all the little things.\"\nA lot of young lottery picks chase points. For some players and their agents, points are the best vehicle to that first big payday. But Houston's coaches are unanimous that Green can become more well-rounded in a season where winning has suddenly become a priority. And where Green ends up in three, four, five years along an unusually wide possibility of outcomes could make or break this new Houston experiment.\n\"He's growing into a pro,\" said Lucas, who worked closely with Green during his rookie season, tweaking Green's jumper and quickening the release. \"His savvy is coming. He's an absolute delight to work with.\"\nGreen said he's ready.\n\"I can contribute to winning,\" he told ESPN. \"I'm an all-around player.\"\nGREEN'S COMBINATION OF speed, burst, and leaping ability is rare even among players toward the top of the draft. During his 1-on-0 pre-draft workout with the Rockets, Green lost the ball on the way up during a layup drill, reached out in midair to snare it, and dunked with power. \"It was like, 'Holy s---, I haven't seen that one before,'\" Stone recalled. \"His athleticism popped. He has one of the highest ceilings of any player that has been drafted recently, and we are in the business of drafting for upside.\"\nOne executive from another team drafting around Green's range told his front office that Green could lead the league in scoring one day.\n\"I have never coached anyone like him,\" Brad Roznovsky, who coached Green for three years at San Joaquin Memorial High School in Fresno, California, told ESPN. \"And I never will again.\"\nAt age 20 on a rebuilding Rockets team -- facing elite defenders almost every game -- Green averaged 22 points and almost four assists. He knifed his way to six free throws per game. Some high-usage ball handlers never average that many free throws. Green was inefficient, but he is on a clear All-Star trajectory.\nAfter an offseason of speculation, Damian Lillard was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in a blockbuster three-team deal that also sent 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton to Portland.\n‚Ä¢ Woj: How trade got to finish line\n‚Ä¢ Lowe: What Bucks look like with Dame\n‚Ä¢ Pelton: Grades for Bucks, Blazers, Suns\n‚Ä¢ Big questions after shocking deal\n‚Ä¢ Rosters: Bucks | Blazers | Suns\nRival executives often project his potential peak as similar to those of Bradley Beal and Zach LaVine, and some statistical models suggest those as decent comparisons. They are also close to Green's height (6-foot-4), a tick shorter than the big wing ball-handlers who often rule the league.\nBeal and LaVine have made five combined All-Star teams, and that number should jump. Beal made one All-NBA team. Those are objectively good outcomes, even for a much-hyped No. 2 pick with Green's scoring chops.\nBut neither has ever been the No. 1 option on a dangerous postseason team. Beal is now the third option on a contender in the Phoenix Suns. LaVine's Chicago Bulls have flatlined in mediocrity. The Rockets aren't putting any ceiling on Green yet, and they shouldn't.\nStill, there is an enormous gap between where Green is now and All-Star-level efficiency. Green shot 41.6% last season -- 33.8% on 3s, 47.1% on 2s. He converted just 55% at the rim.\nThere is low-hanging fruit to pluck. Green chucks up a lot of low-chance jumpers early in the clock when one pass or dribble would keep the offense chugging toward something better.\nGreen has taken (by a hair) more pull-up 3s than catch-and-shoot treys in his career, per NBA.com. He's capable of hitting those shots, but too many come early in possessions. Some are off-balance, over multiple defenders.\n\"There were just too many possessions where he took poor shots with three guys on him,\" Udoka said.\nAlmost one-third of Green's shots in 2022-23 were midrangers, a ton by the standards of the analytics-heavy Rockets. The team is fine with those looks late in the shot clock. They know elite defenses sometimes snuff everything else. Green hit 42% on long 2s last season, and has a knack for stopping on a dime, rising into the clouds, and generating clean on-balance looks. With more judiciousness, that percentage could climb into the high-40s.\nBut the team would like Green to bag contested pull-up 2s that come with time left to explore.\n\"What's important for Jalen is making sure he takes virtually none of those,\" Stone said. \"If that shot [a long 2] is contested, there has to be a better shot for someone else.\"\nOn some of those plays, the right pass is in front of him:\nWatch Sengun roll free then turn his palms to the sky in exasperation after Green jacks a long 2 with 12 seconds on the shot clock instead of threading the pocket pass.\nWhat's both encouraging and frustrating is that Green has those passes in his bag. When trapped, Green is happy to slip the ball to an open teammate immediately.\nThere are plenty of instances of Green making the basic pocket pass as soon as it opens:\nThen just a minute later -- as in that game against the Bulls -- Green might ignore that identical pocket pass in favor of a wayward drive, or toss it too late:\nGreen attempted shots on about 47% of his pick-and-rolls that resulted in the end of possessions -- 43rd among 174 ball handlers who ran at least 200 such plays, per Second Spectrum. Green dished assists on only 9.8% of those actions -- 163rd among that 174-player sample.\nGreen is determined to find a better pass-or-shoot balance.\n\"It's simple reads,\" Green said. \"The pocket pass to Alpie [Sengun], or if the low man helps over, hitting that shooter in the corner.\"\nGREEN SPENT MUCH of the summer in Los Angeles, training with a personal coach -- Adam Harrington, a former assistant for both the Thunder and the Nets -- and participating in 5-on-5 runs with Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and other NBA stars. Udoka watched a lot of those pickup games, including one in which Green and Smith were on the same team -- facing a squad that included both Durant and Booker.\n\"In my mind, it was Houston against Phoenix,\" Udoka said. He saw progress in Green's passing.\n\"He has the ability to make the right play,\" Udoka continued. \"You don't always see it on a young team where it's your turn, my turn, and guys are taking poor shots at times. But when the level of talent is raised around him, he makes the right reads. Now there are no excuses. I've seen you do it.\"\nObserving those pickup games, Udoka would sometimes shout for Green to set a flare screen or cut to the rim. Green has flashed some instincts to cut back door when Sengun -- a clever passer -- has the ball at the elbow. Those plays hint at a decent feel -- something that should translate to passing.\n‚Ä¢ Lowe: Five most intriguing players\n‚Ä¢ Bontemps: Resetting East after big deals\n‚Ä¢ Shelburne: The Harden-Morey feud\n‚Ä¢ Pelton: Teams on way up and way down\n‚Ä¢ Top second-year players to watch\n‚Ä¢ Forecast: East | West | Champs\n‚Ä¢ FAQ: In-season tournament | Rest rules\nBut they were mere flashes. Houston's offense last season was stagnant. Porter and Green pounded the air out of the ball. On some possessions, they had to wait several seconds before a Houston big man realized he should run up to set a screen. There was no structure, no pace. Spacing was cluttered.\n\"There was a lot of standing around,\" Udoka said.\nLike a lot of young guards, Green sometimes dribbled around the arc without purpose -- bobbing and weaving in the general area of picks without going anywhere. He sometimes rushed through moves, zooming forward before really executing them -- before giving defenders a chance to take the bait.\nVanVleet should loosen spacing and allow Green to attack more off the catch -- with the floor in motion. \"We want to use him more off the ball,\" Udoka said of Green. \"We want him coming off screens and slashing. I don't know if it's natural for him, but you've seen glimpses.\"\nSpacing remains a challenge. Defenses will ignore both Brooks and Eason on the perimeter until they prove themselves as shooters; against certain Houston lineups, defenses had centers guard Eason and hang near the paint. (Eason, by the way, has a chance to be a really good two-way player. He seems to have magnets in his hands, sucking up steals and rebounds that appear out of reach. The Rockets are optimistic he can do more with the ball on offense.) With Sengun and Landale, it might be hard for Udoka to get to lineups in which Smith plays small-ball center.\nGreen oozes ballhandling craft that he is just starting to harness. He can lull defenders to sleep with languid hesitation dribbles toward picks, and then dust them by darting away from those screens. He works nasty in-and-out dribbles with either hand:\nGreen is slim, but at 6-foot-4 with his speed and leaping ability, he could develop a Westbrook-esque style of turbocharged drives through smaller point guard defenders:\nGreen can get to the rim almost at will. His approach and judgment once there has been addled. Green has a habit of flying at rim protectors without a plan and throwing up wild, flailing hope shots.\n\"You have to know where your dump-offs are,\" Udoka said. \"Jalen is used to being able to finish over anyone, but if you get separation and Joel Embiid is sitting in the paint, you can take the midranger instead of attacking him.\"\nIN OFFSEASON WORKOUTS, Harrington slowed everything down and had Green walk through the final two or three steps of every typical action over and over: planting to catch the ball running off a pick; rising for a contested layup; leaping for a pull-up 3; loading off one foot to take a Ray Allen-style leaning jumper.\n\"It was about balance,\" Green said. Harrington wanted Green to feel what each foot should be doing -- to download the body mechanics so that he is comfortable, strong, and poised in every situation.\nThat could lead to more plays where it all comes together:\nThere are not many 20-year-olds who can work all those skills -- all those changes of direction and cadence -- into one pick-and-roll. Green slithers to his right around that Sengun screen then slows down to pin his defender on his hip -- waiting for Sengun to find space. Green veers left, then back right -- finally getting Xavier Tillman to commit and unlocking that hook pass.\nGreen spent a lot of time in L.A. around Durant, watching him work and listening to Durant's advice. Durant told Green that every practice and drill should mimic game intensity.\n\"That's what stuck with me -- to really make everything game-like,\" Green said.\nThe harder work comes on defense. Green has been a pretty glaring minus on that end. Bigger opponents have bullied him, and Green has gotten lost now and then in rotation.\nBut Green can become at least an average defender. He has good length, and he seems to care. His lean frame has its advantages. Harrington developed a mantra for him: Avoid every screen.\n\"We've argued a lot,\" Lucas said about Green when the subject turned to defense. \"Jalen can guard when he wants to. He just hasn't been required to yet.\"\n(Lucas loves needling Green to get under his skin and motivate him. He sometimes asks Green where he was selected in the draft. When Green replies that he was the second pick, Lucas -- the top pick in 1976 -- boasts that he might have already been at the after party or even asleep by the time the second pick rolled around in his draft. \"He gets so mad,\" Lucas said, laughing. When Lucas finds out Green admires an opposing player -- De'Aaron Fox and Anthony Edwards, as examples -- he tells Green that if he is such a fan, Lucas can walk to the opponent locker room and ask for a pair of signed shoes.)Top stories of the week from Get exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n‚Ä¢ Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ NBA training camp cheat sheets ¬ª\n More ESPN+ content ¬ª\n\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n‚Ä¢ Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ NBA training camp cheat sheets ¬ª\n More ESPN+ content ¬ª\nDefense is not optional under Udoka. \"Defense is more of a mentality,\" the coach said. \"He will be challenged a lot more.\"\nUdoka spares no one in film sessions. \"You'll get called out if you are the weak link,\" Udoka said. \"I'll call him out in front of the whole team.

And you have to do it 82 times -- and then 10 or 15 or 20 more times in the postseason, when the talent is better, the coaching is more targeted, and everything is done with more urgency.\nLucas is confident. \"In another year, he will really be a professional,\" Lucas said of Green. \"Next season [2024-25], he is going to take off like Ja Morant and Devin Booker.\"\nEven optimists know how much distance lies between where Green is now and where those guys -- and Beal, even LaVine -- have reached.

{"title": "Week 6 preview: Improbable unbeatens and quarterbacks facing off", "date": "2023-10-05 21:47:14", "text": "Bobby Carpenter and Pat McAfee preview Maryland's matchup with Ohio State this weekend. (1:38)\nIf you were asked in August to pick five teams that would be undefeated at this point, you'd probably be quick to name the traditional powerhouses: Georgia, Ohio State, Michigan, USC, Alabama. And you'd be wrong on Alabama. But you get the point.\nWho in the world thought Louisville, Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri and Washington State all would be unbeaten now? Sure, maybe one or two because of the early-season schedule. But not all the wins were expected -- who thought Kentucky would wallop Florida?\nThose teams put their perfect records on the line in Week 6, which features the biggest battle of 5-0 teams with No. 12 Oklahoma facing No. 3 Texas in Saturday's Red River Rivalry.\nOur reporters preview Week 6 with a look at the surprising undefeated teams and quarterback matchups to watch, plus some of the week's best quotes.\nLouisville: When Louisville hired native son Jeff Brohm, you could feel the excitement build not only among the fan base but among the football program. He then overhauled the roster and brought in several key transfers who have paid off in big ways, starting with quarterback Jack Plummer, who played for him at Purdue. Plummer ranks No. 3 in the ACC in passing, no surprise considering Brohm's background and history, and transfer Jamari Thrash ranks No. 2 in the league in receiving. Perhaps the biggest revelation has been the Cardinals' rushing offense behind Jawhar Jordan, who leads the league with 510 yards and six touchdowns. Defensively, transfers Devin Neal (Baylor) and Cam'Ron Kelly (UNC), tied for second on the team with 24 tackles, have been big additions, too. But returner Ashton Gillotte has taken the next step with five sacks.\nBrohm described his team's 13-10 win over NC State last week as his defense's best performance of the season. But it will take a complete team effort to beat Notre Dame and end the Irish's 30-game regular-season winning streak against the ACC.\n\"We've done just enough to win five games,\" Brohm told ESPN. \"And we've shown some toughness and some grit to come back and win a few, so that's been really good to see, our guys play that hard. To this point, everything's been good. I know as a coach that our schedule will just continue to get tougher and tougher, and we're going to have challenges ahead, starting this week.\" -- Andrea Adelson\nMaryland: Winners of its first five games in a season for the first time since Ralph Friedgen coached the program to the ACC title in 2001, Maryland heads into a major spotlight Saturday when it visits the Horseshoe to tangle with No. 4 Ohio State. Taulia Tagovailoa spearheads a Terrapins offense that leads the Big Ten in total offense (454.8 YPG) while sitting behind only Penn State in scoring offense (38.6 PPG). Tagovailoa, who tops the conference with both 1,464 passing yards and 13 touchdown passes, has three games of at least three touchdown tosses, led by last week's 352-yard, five-touchdown effort in a 44-17 dispatching of Indiana. Led by Jeshaun Jones' 19 receptions, six receivers have caught at least 11 passes and eight players have found the end zone, as Tagovailoa has done a stellar job of spreading the wealth and not letting opposing defenses key on one player. Defensively, Brian Williams' unit has forced 10 turnovers combined over the past three weeks in convincing victories over Virginia, Michigan State and Indiana. It faces its stiffest challenge yet with a Buckeyes offense itching to sustain momentum from their win in South Bend on Sept. 23. -- Blake Baumgartner\nKentucky: The schedule has been more than manageable, and even the most blue-hearted Kentucky fan would acknowledge as much. Three of the Wildcats' wins have come over teams (Ball State, Akron and Vanderbilt) with a combined 4-12 record, and a fourth win came over FCS foe Eastern Kentucky. That's not to diminish the fact the Wildcats are doing the things it takes to win at a high level, in particular running the ball, stopping the run, eliminating explosive plays and forcing turnovers. They're averaging 6.48 yards per rush (second nationally) and limiting opponents to 2.54 yards per rush (eighth nationally). Ray Davis, a transfer from Vanderbilt, rushed for 280 yards last week in the 33-14 win over Florida, the most rushing yards by an FBS player this season. Kentucky dominated the line of scrimmage, as quarterback Devin Leary attempted just 19 passes, completing nine for 69 yards. He's a better passer than he's shown to this point and will have to make more plays down the field in the passing game if the Wildcats are going to keep it going, and that starts Saturday against No. 1 Georgia. Leary's top two receiving targets, Tayvion Robinson and Barion Brown, left the Florida game in the second half with injuries. Their status is up in the air. Some younger receivers may need to step up, but the Wildcats are going to need more out of their passing game as they tackle an October stretch that includes Georgia on the road and then Missouri and Tennessee at home. -- Chris Low\nMissouri: The short version for why Mizzou is 5-0 is simple: Brady Cook to Luther Burden III. But here's the longer version. The Tigers began the season with wins over South Dakota and MTSU, but the offense disappointed terribly in the process. The Tigers averaged 4.9 yards per play against MTSU, worse than Murray State (5.7) and everyone else on the Blue Raiders' schedule, and a couple of fourth-and-short punts both revealed Eliah Drinkwitz's general lack of confidence and nearly proved costly in the 23-19 win. But the frustration emanating from that evidently lit a fire. The Tigers scored at least 30 points in wins over Kansas State, Memphis and Vanderbilt -- all teams better than MTSU -- in recent weeks. And Cook has been one of the best QBs in the country in the process, averaging 364 passing yards per game with eight TDs. He's set an SEC record for consecutive passes without an interception, and he's thriving both because of Burden, the nation's leading receiver, and because other targets like Theo Wease (118 yards vs. Vanderbilt) have begun to thrive. The Tigers' defense is still a top-30 or so unit, and suddenly the offense is dynamite. And now they return home to host an LSU team that is equal parts dangerous and flawed. -- Bill Connelly\nWashington State: With half the Pac-12 ranked in the top 18 of the AP poll, the Cougars remain under the radar despite climbing from unranked to No. 13. Yet, when laying out the best wins by Pac-12 teams, it's the Cougars -- Wisconsin, Oregon State -- who stand out. Both of those win margins were by single digits, but WSU controlled both games and has impressed on both sides of the ball. There is a lot of credit to spread around, but it begins with quarterback Cam Ward. In new offensive coordinator Ben Arbuckle's offense, Ward has made significant strides to become one of the best quarterbacks in the country. He's accurate, he makes good decisions, and he's playing with a general sense of calm that evaded him at times last year. Plus, the additions of Josh Kelly and Kyle Williams at receiver have given him a deep, talent group of receivers, joining Lincoln Victor. This is a team without a major problem area, which makes it a tough out each week. -- Kyle Bonagura\n\nSam Hartman (Notre Dame) vs. Jack Plummer (Louisville)\nIt might be easy to pick Plummer based on what happened last season alone. Hartman, playing for Wake Forest, had the worst game of his career at Louisville -- throwing three interceptions, losing three fumbles and taking seven sacks in a 48-21 loss. He was benched to start the fourth quarter in a game Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson called a \"disaster.\" But Hartman is in a different spot now with the Irish -- and a different offense that is not asking him to put as much on his shoulders as he did at Wake. His late-game heroics last week against Duke led Notre Dame to a 21-14 comeback victory. Meanwhile, Plummer faced all sorts of pressure from the NC State defense a week ago and did not play his best game, throwing two interceptions and getting sacked four times. Expect Notre Dame to bring the same type of pressure as NC State did, and Hartman to have a much better performance than a year ago. -- Adelson\n\nQuinn Ewers (Texas) vs. Dillon Gabriel (Oklahoma)\nGabriel notably missed this game last year due to a concussion, leading to disaster for Oklahoma. Five different players attempted a pass, including two running backs and a punter, as the Sooners managed just 39 passing yards in a historic 49-0 blowout loss, the worst in any game in school history. But this season, he's leading the Big 12 in QBR, with Ewers second. Gabriel is third nationally with eight completions of 40 or more yards, while Ewers has been inconsistent on deep balls, though he's improved in that area. Both defenses have taken huge steps this season, but Gabriel has been more consistent and will be asked to do more. In what could end up as another Texas-OU shootout, Gabriel likely will have the better numbers. -- Dave Wilson\n\nTaulia Tagovailoa (Maryland) vs. Kyle McCord (Ohio State) \nMcCord finished the Notre Dame game on an encouraging note, but Tagovailoa had five touchdown passes last week and eight in his first two Big Ten games. Maryland's receiving corps doesn't generate the attention Ohio State's does, but there's real depth with Tai Felton and West Virginia transfer Kaden Prather emerging alongside Jeshaun Jones. \"Very similar to when I was at Alabama, I had [Henry] Ruggs and [Jerry] Jeudy] and [Jaylen] Waddle and Smitty [DeVonta Smith],\" Terrapins coach Mike Locksley told me. \"Your offense is more dynamic when the ball is spread around.\" -- Adam Rittenberg\n\nDevin Leary (Kentucky) vs. Carson Beck (Georgia)\nLeary, who passed for 6,807 yards during his career at NC State, is due for a breakout game. He's thrown 10 touchdown passes and five interceptions in his first five outings for Kentucky, which really hasn't needed to throw the ball much. The Wildcats could be short-handed at receiver with Tayvion Robinson and Barion Brown both being banged up, and that won't help matters against a Georgia defense that has already intercepted eight passes and is tied for third nationally in allowing just 4.8 yards per pass attempt. Carson Beck, in his first season as Georgia's starter, is completing 72 percent of his passes and averaging right at 300 passing yards per game. The Bulldogs got star tight end Brock Bowers going in the win over Auburn last week, and that's a connection that gives Beck (and any quarterback) the edge. -- Low\nBilly Napier: The Florida coach was blunt when it came to assessing his team's 33-14 drubbing by Kentucky.\n\"There is no sugarcoating this thing. We have no excuse. We can coach better and we can play better. Hopefully, we will do that.\"\nDeion Sanders: There's no question that celebrity has surrounded the Buffaloes, and the coach was more than happy to help Snoop Dogg deliver a message to Omarion Miller, who caught seven passes for 196 yards in Colorado's Week 5 loss to USC.\n\"A dear friend called me and summoned me to get him on the phone to FaceTime. [He] wanted to talk to him and wanted to let him know that he has a tremendous gift. I don't know what the conversation was, but I know I just handed him the phone. I said, 'Somebody wants to talk to you.' He looked at the phone like, 'Oh my god.' Yeah, it was Snoop. Snoop wanted to talk to [Miller]. He wanted to challenge him.\"\nDave Clawson: The Wake Forest coach, whose team plays at Clemson on Saturday (3:30 p.m. ET, ACC Network), hasn't forgotten last year's 2OT loss to the Tigers.\n\"There are certain games in your career you never, ever get over. That's one of them. When I'm on my deathbed, that game will still bother me. Hopefully, our players feel the same way.\""}

(0:37)\nFantasy football is a passion for many. Sometimes that passion causes fantasy managers to make emotional decisions even when the data suggests otherwise. Each week during the 2023 NFL season, Liz Loza will attempt to strike a balance between what the data states and what the heart wants. This is called Facts vs. Feelings.\nThis time next week I'll be toiling away on the Week 6 edition of Facts vs. Feelings from a dimly lit hotel room in Bristol, Connecticut. And I can't wait.\nNot because the corporate-approved lodging is particularly luxurious. It's not. Or because I'm thrilled to welcome a morning that doesn't involve yelling at my kids to hurry up and brush their teeth so I can peel out of the driveway only to sit in a car line and stress about potential tardy slips. OK, well maybe a little (I truly do miss those adorable gremlins while I'm on the road, though).\nIt's because... IT'S FALL, Y'ALL!\n\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nLos Angeles might have the whole of my heart (and my money), but the City of Angels cannot deliver on autumn vibes. It wasn't until last year -- when I returned to campus for the second time as an ESPN employee -- that I realized how much I loved (and missed) a proper fall. I gasped at the foliage. I stared wide-eyed at the bushels (like, actual bushels!) of gourds lining the streets. I was taken back to my childhood and willingly wrapped myself in all of the pumpkin spice nostalgia.\nMy colleagues seemed charmed (if not a little startled) by my exuberance. Numerous co-workers leaned into it, generously taking me for scenic drives through some of the area's most breathtaking vistas. (One of whom is likely proofreading this article right now. Hi, Pierre. [Good morning, Liz and gremlins.] That detour past the old-timey cemetery was so stinking cool!) It never got old -- for me, at least. And I hope my genuine wonder rubbed off on them, serving as a potential reminder to take in the less-than-sophisticated (dare I say, \"basic\") joys of the season.\nI've been trying to manufacture that same cozy feeling in preparation for this weekend's trip. Numerous outings to the local Trader Joe's have resulted in an abundance of harvest-themed purchases. And while the bouquet of sunflowers on my desk looks beautiful and the pumpkin yogurt tasted surprisingly good... I want the real thing.\nI want to hear fall leaves crunch under a pair of cute boots. I want to sip apple cider and not sweat. And I really want the Bears to not embarrass themselves Thursday night. None of those things will happen, however, without taking action. I need to -- on my own -- venture outside of the Bristol bubble and discover all of the bucolic hiking trails and quaint roadside stands. And the Bears, well, they need to do a whole lot but should probably start with letting Justin Fields use his legs.\nThe same is true in fantasy. We're a month into the 2023 experiment and, speaking for myself, it has felt more like raking the lawn than snacking on pumpkin seeds. We have reached a point of transition. More than a few hot summer takes have begun to chill.\nThe emergence of new patterns and facts requires us to confront our feelings about what we thought was going to happen and instead get real about what is actually going on. Whether that means benching Joe Burrow (QB31) or getting behind Evan Engram (TE4); it's time to shed what isn't working and adventure toward something different. There's no guaranteeing these adjustments will lead to victorious gains, but neither will nervously standing still.\nSo, while that maple chai-scented room diffuser might smell great now, you're going to need something stronger to get you through the winter.\nAnthony Richardson, QB, Indianapolis Colts: Richardson is showing zero anxiety. This man is fearlessly running -- literally and figuratively -- toward his destiny. Even while in the grasp of Aaron Freaking Donald, Richardson is advancing the ball. His maturation as a passer might still be in its beginning stages, but the rookie has, thus far, recorded the fifth-highest pressured completion percentage (63.6%). That shows guts and intelligence. Richardson's physical tools are successfully translating to the NFL while manifesting a boon for fantasy investors.\nCongrats to all of those who believed from the jump because Richardson is currently the QB2 in fantasy points per game. That's what happens when a wildly gifted mobile passer is not only allowed but even encouraged to lean into his talent as a rusher. Richardson has executed 14 designed runs in three games, which includes all four of his touchdowns. (Can someone please forward this to Luke Getsy?) As a result, he has managed more fantasy points per game as a runner (12.38) than Joe Mixon, Rachaad White or Alexander Mattison. Additionally, his 29.60 fantasy points from Week 4 was the third-highest total by any QB this season (and 11 completions, tied for the fewest by any signal-caller in a full game so far this year).\nRichardson will have to shift some of his focus from the ground to the air versus the Titans on Sunday. Tennessee has allowed a completion percentage of nearly 71% and an average exceeding 241 passing yards (10th-most) per week to opposing quarterbacks. Mike Vrabel's gritty defensive front also managed to hold Deshaun Watson (the only dual-threat QB the team has faced, save a compromised Joe Burrow) to 16 rushing yards. It figures to be a close battle (+/- 1) but my money is on Richardson's continued ascent. He's a top-five fantasy play in Week 5.\nDe'Von Achane, RB, Miami Dolphins: While we're on the topic of stocks rising ... holy heck, welcome to the NFL, De'Von Achane! The third-round selection out of Texas A&M followed up his 233-yard and four-TD effort in Week 3 by blazing his way to another 120 yards and two scores in Week 4. So, is this a fluke? Or is Achane the real deal?\nI'm leaning toward the latter. How does that genie fit back in the bottle? Achane's snap percentage has increased with each effort (0% - 8% - 42% - 66%). Meanwhile, Raheem Mostert's playing time has decreased since sharing the backfield with the explosive rookie (74% - 51% - 41%). The Dolphins -- like the rest of the modern NFL -- figure to go RBBC. However, Achane is proving to be the more effective rusher. His 11.4 yards per carry is as absurd as it is unsustainable. However, his 2.8 yards after contact per rush also ranks among the top three at the position.\nYou can't sit this guy. Not now. And certainly not as an 11-point favorite versus a reeling Giants squad that gave up 5.3 YPC to Seattle on Monday night. Achane has youth, juice and upside. He also has managed double-digit touches in back-to-back efforts. Consider the burgeoning star a top-12 fantasy RB this Sunday.\nMiles Sanders, RB, Carolina Panthers: If Miami's backfield is Fast & Furious, then Carolina's is giving Radiator Springs vibes. Sanders entered Week 4 with a groin injury, and although his effort deserves snaps, his output was worrisome. The Philly transplant managed a meager 19 rushing yards on 13 carries. While the aforementioned ailment certainly contributed to the vet's inefficiency, his rushing numbers have steadily decreased since the season opener. Sanders recorded 72 rushing yards in Week 1, but then a total of just 86 over his next three contests. Additionally, his 2.9 yards per carry ranks 37th among 44 qualifiers.\nIf there is a silver lining, it's Sanders' work in the passing game. Bryce Young is checking down on the regular. As a result, Sanders ranks third in team targets (23) and receptions (15), placing him among the top five at the position in both of those categories. But this offense has no juice. Between an unfavorable game script and Chuba Hubbard's pesky presence, Sanders is shaping up to be TD-dependent with little to no upside. He figures to further languish on the RB2/RB3 bubble when he takes on an improved (and rested) Lions defense in Week 5.\nMichael Wilson, WR, Arizona Cardinals: Meaningful impacts are hard to come by at the next level. Lord knows I'm still trying to make a positive one on my mother-in-law. Wilson, however, has delighted thus far in his pro campaign.\nThe Stanford alum has demonstrated enticing chemistry with Josh Dobbs, recording 50-plus receiving yards in three consecutive efforts. That stat becomes more impressive when noting that he's just one of 10 wideouts to accomplish such a feat. Wilson has additionally managed a top-15 aDOT (13.5 yards) along with the highest catch rate (88%) in the league. Furthermore, the rookie has outsnapped Rondale Moore in back-to-back games and managed to out-target the vet in his 7-76-0 effort at San Francisco this past Sunday. That arrow is pointing up, friends.\nA player with plus size and strength, Wilson is on his way to emerging as the ideal complement to Marquise Brown. It might not happen this week. And he'll still be saddled by Dobbs. Although with injuries mounting and byes upon us, now is the time to stash a rising star like Wilson. He's worth a speculative flex versus a Bengals defense that has allowed the ninth-most opponent yards per game (364.3).\nJordan Addison, WR, Minnesota Vikings: High expectations often lead to disappointment. So does putting up a bagel on any given Sunday. Enter Addison. The 2021 Biletnikoff Award winner was the first rookie off of most fantasy draft boards. Touchdowns over his first two starts appeared to validate the preseason hype. But all that good juju came to a screeching halt when the 21-year-old failed to convert on his lone target in Week 4. Was it the result of uncharacteristic quarterback play and game flow? Probably. We still need to address the facts and recalibrate our feelings, though.\nAddison's 13.4% target share ranks third on his team (just ahead of Mattison's 12.1%) and 70th among wide receivers. His above average aDOT (12.9) and his efficiency in the red area have buoyed his fantasy numbers. That kind of usage screams boom/bust. The reality of Addison's situation has been tempered by the Vikings' pass-heavy game scripts. When Kirk Cousins puts the ball in the air 40-plus times, Addison is likely to draw at least five looks. Makes easy sense, right? That is not, however, something we can rely on.\nConsider Week 4 the wake-up call. That doesn't mean Addison is a cut candidate. Definitely not while we're weaving through bye weeks and subbing players in and out of IR spots. It does, however, mean thinking about Addison (at least for the moment) as more of an upside flex than an automatic WR3. He's a top-40 FF WR option in what's projected to be a high-scoring game (53.0) versus the Chiefs.\nDalton Schultz, TE, Houston Texans: Schultz has been quiet because his young QB hasn't needed a binky. C.J. Stroud doesn't mind letting it rip, averaging 8.0 yards per attempt (QB3) while registering the sixth-most air yards (953) on the season. From 20 yards out, however, the former Cowboy is proving to be his young QB's bestie.\nSchultz is tied for first in team red zone looks (31% RZ target share) and leads the Texans' offense in end zone opportunities (38% EZ target share). From a positional point of view, His four red zone targets -- as well as this three end zone looks -- is tied for fourth among tight ends.\nIs this chasing touchdowns? Absolutely. Do I like to do it? No, it feels dirty. But some of us -- I'm looking at you, Kyle Pitts and Darren Waller investors -- need to light a three-wicked Yankee candle and conjure up some fantasy goodness. The manifesting figures to continue at Atlanta, as the Falcons have allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends. I'm optimistically forecasting four grabs, 41 yards and a tuddy for Schultz.\nTyler Conklin, TE, New York Jets: As Travis Kelce has consistently reminded us, knowing not just how but when to shoot your shot is key. Conklin has been on my radar since Zach Wilson took over as the Jets' starter. It wasn't until the CMU product finished second in team targets versus the Chiefs, however, that I considered leaning into his streaming potential.\nConklin delivered a smattering of top-12 fantasy finishes over 2022, although most of his highs came without Wilson at the helm. Whatever was lacking between the two last year appears to have dissolved this go-round. Conklin ranks third on the team in offensive play percentage (76.2%) and second in team targets (17). He has managed 5-plus looks in each game over the past three weeks. Although those numbers are far from astonishing, only eight tight ends have managed the same or better. Welcome (again) to the TE hellscape.\nAvailable in over 90% of ESPN fantasy leagues, Conklin offers sneaky sleeper appeal in Week 5. He'll face a bruised and battered Broncos defense that has coaxed production out even the most broken offenses. Denver has given up the seventh-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends, including a stunning 7-85-2 stat line to Cole Kmet in Week 4.\nI can't promise it will be pretty. But I know it's something different. Consider Conklin this week's newest borderline TE1.\nFollow Liz on social @LizLoza_FF"}

(3:15)\nThe Mississippi Department of Human Services filed notice this week of its intent to depose former NFL quarterback Brett Favre. More than a year ago, Favre was named as one of dozens of defendants in a civil lawsuit that aims to recover tens of millions of dollars in welfare funds a state audit said were misspent. Favre has denied any wrongdoing in the welfare case and has not been criminally charged.\nThe deposition, scheduled for Oct. 26, would be Favre's first time testifying under oath in this case, according to Front Office Sports. The people involved in the case aren't commenting because of a judge's gag order, but several unaffiliated attorneys explained what could happen when Favre arrives at the deposition in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where Favre starred for the University of Southern Mississippi.\nESPN spoke with William W. Berry III, a law professor at the University of Mississippi; Vangela M. Wade, an attorney and leader of the Mississippi Center for Justice; and Matthew Leish, a partner at the law firm Miller Korzenik Sommers Rayman in New York. The legal experts addressed, among other things, the risks that Favre potentially faces during the deposition process, and what he could do to help his case. All three said they do not know details of the case beyond what has been reported and would speak about general legal strategies. Here are their responses, which have been edited for clarity.\nWhat does it mean to be deposed?\nBerry: The idea of a deposition is to get someone's story on the record so that, at trial, they can't change it later. And so it'll obviously be very important for Brett Favre to tell the truth. This is his chance to get his story on the record.\nWade: In any deposition, it's part of discovery, of getting information directly from that person that they're deposing, or having that person to identify documents during the course of that deposition.\nLeish: There are really two goals. One, it's fact gathering. They're trying to find out what this person knows. The second part of it is to try to pin him down to get some admissions that will hurt his case. It can't be a complete fishing expedition, but they have some leeway to explore.\nHow long do depositions last?\nWade: I've seen depositions go anywhere from an hour to three days or longer for one person. It depends on the nature of the litigation and what the party is attempting to cover in that deposition.\nBerry: Most depositions are usually one-day depositions, maybe eight hours. In a more complicated case, it might take longer.\nWhat kinds of risks does Favre face during the deposition?\nLeish: The biggest danger is that he says something under oath that really helps the state prove its case. Maybe he admits something that they're trying to prove or he says something and they can call him out on it and it makes him look like he's not credible. I think those are the two biggest risks.\nHow can a deposition be used as evidence in a potential trial?\nBerry: If the plaintiffs in the case were to call Mr. Favre to testify and then he were to change his story on the stand, you would then cite him back to his deposition and impeach him in court. An impeachment is really showing someone's changing their story and then the credibility that person has with a jury or a judge is shot.\nWhat would help Favre in his deposition?\nLeish: When you're the person being deposed, it's really defensive. You're trying not to give the other side anything they can use. It's not so much that you're trying to prove your case. So his main goal is don't hurt yourself.\nBut having said that, if his testimony is very consistent with what he's saying -- \"I didn't do anything wrong, here's what I knew\" -- and he backs that up, he's got real evidence to support that, it can be useful to him. And the state can say, \"Hold on a second here, maybe we have a problem. Maybe we're going to have a hard time proving our case.\"\nBerry: What discovery is, is really a negotiation on some level in the sense of each party is trying to marshal, each lawyer is trying to figure out the best they can what really happened. So often you see these disputes in the media and you have the \"he said and she said,\" but then you start drilling down and you look at the actual evidence in the case and what evidence do you have and putting the evidence together.\nThen you get a sense of, \"Wow, this person really did something they weren't supposed to.\" Or alternatively, \"The allegation, it looked that way, but this person actually didn't do anything wrong.\""}
{"title": "WNBA trendsetters: Why Hammon, Brondello are just the start of former players as Finals coaches", "date": "2023-10-05 20:41:47", "text": "When the Las Vegas Aces and New York Liberty tip off the WNBA Finals on Sunday (3 p.m. ET, ABC/ESPN App), the coaching matchup between Becky Hammon and Sandy Brondello will be 26 years in the making.\nAlthough former WNBA players have coached teams to the Finals before, this is the first time in league history two of them will square off against each other in the championship series.\nAlong with Coach of the Year Stephanie White, whose Connecticut Sun lost to Brondello's Liberty in the semifinals, the success Brondello and Hammon are enjoying coaching the WNBA's highest-profile teams is reflective of the league embracing former players as coaches. After never  having more than three head-coaching spots held by former players, they've made up half of the league's 12 jobs in each of the past two seasons.\nWith the WNBA's diversity coaching initiative dramatically increasing the number of assistant coaches with playing experience in the league, Brondello and Hammon might be the first former players to square off in the Finals. They won't be the last.\n\"Since 2019,\" WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said, \"we have tripled the number of former players who are head coaches and significantly increased those in the assistant coaching ranks.\"\nBRONDELLO AND HAMMON -- who have both already won WNBA titles as coaches, Brondello with the Phoenix Mercury in 2014 and Hammon last season with Las Vegas -- previously saw their careers overlap in San Antonio. Brondello was an assistant during Hammon's first three years with the Silver Stars, and then her head coach in 2010. The same person brought both of them to San Antonio: longtime WNBA head coach Dan Hughes, an advocate for former players on the sidelines.\nStarting with his first full-time coaching job in 2000 with the Cleveland Rockers, Hughes had a former WNBA player on every one of his staffs.\n\"I knew I wanted to be a basketball coach, but I also knew that I wanted my staffs to be diverse,\" Hughes told ESPN. \"I wanted them to be different than me. That was always important to me. So I needed somebody who came in as a player and then became a coach. I always needed that. I needed that kind of mentality as part of the brain trust that I was trying to create to make good decisions.\"\nWhen Hughes joined the Silver Stars in 2005 after the Rockers folded, he received a cold call from Brondello while driving to scout a UConn-Notre Dame matchup. She informed Hughes she was retiring after a lengthy playing career in both her native Australia and the WNBA, and wanted to become a coach. Although Hughes had no prior relationship with Brondello besides coaching against her, he immediately saw her as the right fit.\n\"I did everything but hire her that moment,\" Hughes recalled. \"It was just perfect. That's exactly what I wanted ...\n\"Just the way she played the game and thought the game, I thought she would make a great coach.\"\nWith Hammon, a consummate leader during her 16-season WNBA career, the question for Hughes was never whether she could coach but whether she would choose to do so rather than pursue a career in media or outside basketball.\nIn 2013, Hammon suffered an ACL tear in her first game and spent the remainder of the season watching from the sidelines. She told Hughes at season's end she wanted to coach and asked whether he could help connect her with the NBA's San Antonio Spurs and the coach who would go on to be the winningest in league history.\n\"I went over the next day to Gregg Popovich,\" Hughes said. \"They were in the gym, him and [Spurs CEO] R.C. Buford. I said, 'How do you feel about Becky coming over?' 'Oh, we'd love to have her.' Pop said, 'Give her my phone number and give me a call.' That's kind of how that went down.\"\nAfter spending the 2013-14 season shadowing the Spurs coaching staff while rehabilitating her injury, Hammon was hired by the Spurs in 2014 as the first full-time, paid female assistant coach in the NBA upon her retirement from playing.\nHammon's journey led back to the WNBA before last season. After interviewing for NBA head-coaching jobs, Hammon chose to leave the San Antonio bench to become head coach of the Aces, who won the 2022 title and are now looking to become the first repeat WNBA champion since the Los Angeles Sparks in 2001 and 2002.\nSitting on the bench alongside Brondello, Hughes remembers feeling what he calls an \"unspoken understanding of the game\" shared with Hammon on the court.\n\"Becky and Sandy both have incredible offensive minds,\" Hughes said. \"I like putting people like that around me, to be honest with you, because I come at it defensively. That's my starting point. Players, a lot of times, are like that. There were times -- and Becky wouldn't necessarily have been privy to some of these, because she was on the floor -- Sandy would interpret what Becky was going to do to me on the bench before Becky did it.\"\nBecky Hammon's Las Vegas Aces and Sandy Brondello's New York Liberty dominated opponents and statistics in 2023. In the regular season, the teams ranked 1-2 in several categories. -- ESPN Stats & Information\nHughes, who retired from the WNBA in 2021 ranked fifth all time in coaching wins, texted with both coaches after they advanced to the Finals. He's hoping to attend Game 3 in New York, but will be torn, knowing how both coaches might feel at series' end.\n\"Mostly I'm excited for both these coaches,\" Hughes said, \"but I know the reality that one of them is going to attain an incredible moment and another one is going to have a pretty incredible loss.\"\nINEVITABLY, THE WNBA needed time to build up enough longevity for former players to go into the coaching ranks. Though a pair of superstar players retired and were immediately made head coaches in the league's early days -- with Nancy Lieberman taking over the expansion Detroit Shock in the WNBA's second season (1998) and Cynthia Cooper-Dyke coaching the Phoenix Mercury in 2001 after winning Finals MVP in each of the league's first four years -- they were outliers.\nIt wasn't until 2009, the WNBA's 13th year of existence, that former players coached against each other in a regular-season game when Jenny Boucek's Sacramento Monarchs faced Jennifer Gillom's Minnesota Lynx.\nWhen WNBA teams sought professional playing experience in the league's first decade, they often turned instead to former NBA players. Five of the league's 13 coaches to start the 2004 campaign were NBA veterans after Bill Laimbeer's Detroit Shock beat Michael Cooper's Los Angeles Sparks in the 2003 Finals.\nAs the WNBA has matured, more players, like Brondello and Hammon, have had opportunities to play full careers before moving to the sidelines, first as assistants (Hammon getting that experience in the NBA) and later as head coaches. In 2015, Brondello and White were joined by Boucek to give the WNBA a record three former players on the sidelines.\nBy 2020, however, that trend seemed to be heading the wrong direction. After Katie Smith was fired by New York, Brondello was left as the league's only former player serving as head coach. At that point, as the NBA was also seeing decreasing numbers of head coaches with playing experience, the WNBA made a subtle but important rules change.\nAs reported in March 2020 by Erica Ayala at The Athletic, the league increased the limit on assistant coaches from two to three for teams that have at least one former WNBA player as either an assistant or head coach.\nBecause teams would prefer to have larger coaching staffs, they quickly responded by hiring more former WNBA players. In 2019, seven of the league's 12 teams had a former player on staff. By 2021, that was 11 of 12, and this year, for the first time, every team has one. The total number of assistant coaches with playing experience has skyrocketed from nine in 2019 to 22 this season.\n\"This is about a pipeline of your future leaders so that the next time we have a coaching role or a general manager role or a team president role, that you have a very diverse pool to pick from,\" Engelbert said in 2021. \"So that's what our diversity initiatives are working on -- building experience, building capability so the next person up will get a job when there's an opening. You have to do that sometimes three years before the opening comes for that person to be ready now.\"\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n‚Ä¢ Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ NBA training camp cheat sheets ¬ª\n More ESPN+ content ¬ª\nWhen Hughes retired, former player Noelle Quinn was elevated to replace him with the Seattle Storm. Starting with her promotion, hiring former players as head coaches became a trend. All four coaching vacancies after the 2021 season went to players with WNBA experience. Three -- Brondello, Hammon and Vanessa Nygaard with the Phoenix Mercury -- either played or coached for Hughes.\n\"I wanted the landscape, like it is now, to be reflective of former players,\" he said. \"Women who are sitting in that head-coaching position. That was important to me.\"\nIt's also notable that, after Derek Fisher was fired by the Sparks in June 2022, this was the first season since 1998 in which no former NBA player served as a WNBA head coach.\nAs compared to the NBA, the WNBA is a little behind schedule for having two former players meet as coaches in the Finals. That first happened in what the NBA considers its 20th season of existence, 1967, when Alex Hannum's Philadelphia 76ers beat Bill Sharman's San Francisco Warriors. We're also still nowhere near the peak of former players as head coaches in the NBA, which came when 22 of 27 (81.5%) to start the 1993-94 season had playing experience.\nHaving Brondello and Hammon lead their talented teams to the Finals is sure to create more opportunities for the increasing number of assistant coaches like them who have followed a typical path from playing to coaching.\n\"I think what we're starting to see,\" recently retired WNBA star Sue Bird said when Quinn was introduced as head coach in 2021, \"is the WNBA was almost too young 15 years ago to have these players with these long, successful careers where they've played in the WNBA, they've played for multiple coaches, they've played overseas, maybe they've had national team experiences, whatever the case may be. With that is just a ball of knowledge and a wealth of experience.\n\"And now we're finally starting to see those coaches become assistant coaches, become head coaches. That's the path that we've all kind of been waiting for someone to start to forge that path and now we're starting to see it. [Quinn's] just another example of that. I think it's amazing. I think we're going to see more of it. I have zero doubt about that.\""}
{"title": "Predictions: Can Aces repeat or will Liberty win first title?", "date": "2023-10-05 20:41:47", "text": "Seven of 18 WNBA Finals have gone the distance since the best-of-five format started in 2005. With the top two seeds and preseason favorites playing for the 2023 WNBA championship, will we see an eighth rendition of a winner-take-all Game 5 when the Las Vegas Aces face the New York Liberty?\nWe couldn't ask for a better setup, with a matchup of superstars in their primes -- Las Vegas' A'ja Wilson and New York's Breanna Stewart -- as two teams with the top talent and what appears to be the best chemistry meet. The Finals will begin Sunday in Las Vegas at 3 p.m. ET on ABC/ESPN App.\nThe most recent five-game WNBA Finals was in 2019, when the Washington Mystics beat the Connecticut Sun. That was a matchup of the top two teams in the standings, as was the case in 2016 and 2017, when the Los Angeles Sparks and Minnesota Lynx went the distance and alternated in taking home the trophy.\nThis season, the Liberty beat the Aces in the Commissioner's Cup final, while the teams split their four regular-season meetings. They played four times in August, so those games are still fresh in their minds.\nAlmost anywhere you look in this series, you'll see a No. 1 pick or an MVP or a statistical leader -- or someone who is all three.\nBoth coaches are former WNBA players; Las Vegas' Becky Hammon led the Aces to the league title last year, while New York's Sandy Brondello guided the Phoenix Mercury to the 2014 championship.\nThe fan bases come at this from a different perspective. The Aces' franchise dates to the start of the WNBA in 1997 as the Utah Starzz, but their time in Las Vegas has been short and successful. They moved from San Antonio to the Strip in 2018, and they are appearing in the Finals for the third time.\nNew York, on the other hand, is the only still-existing original WNBA franchise that has not won a title. While the Liberty players -- none of whom has been with the team since before 2019 -- might not really feel that historical weight, the longtime Liberty fans do.\nSo which superteam will be the 2023 champion? ESPN's Kevin Pelton, Alexa Philippou and Michael Voepel preview the Finals.\nVoepel: Stewart's shooting woes have been a surprise. She was at 46.5% overall and 35.5% from behind the arc in the regular season. In the Liberty's six playoff games, those percentages have dropped to 35.6 and 20.7. Of course, if she got a lot of her misses out of the way before the Finals, that's good news for the Liberty.\nPhilippou: Having covered the Liberty-Sun series in person, New York seemed to develop grit in real time to overcome a 0-1 deficit versus an uber-tough Connecticut squad and win three straight games, including two at Mohegan Sun Arena. Different people stepped up in different moments for the Liberty, but for the most part, they stayed poised to close out such a competitive series in four games.\nI am surprised the Liberty's bench hasn't seen more minutes in the playoffs, since their depth seemed to be an advantage when considering New York as a contender earlier this season. Does that change against the Aces? Kayla Thornton's toughness and energy can turn around a game, as can Marine Johannes' shooting, and Stefanie Dolson adds post depth against a team that doesn't have a ton of it. Johannes had a stellar outing versus the Aces in the Commissioner's Cup championship, but she has played only 42 minutes this postseason.\nPelton: In addition to seconding what Alexa said, I agree Stewart's postseason slump has been a surprise. When the Seattle Storm lost to Las Vegas in last year's semifinals, it was the first time a healthy Stewart had been knocked out of the playoffs since 2017. And even then, Stewart set a playoff record with 42 points in the final game of a hard-fought series. Going back to UConn, and including EuroLeague competition, Stewart has almost always been at her best when the stakes are the highest. They don't come much higher than in this series.\nPhilippou: Yes, the Finals are a whole new series, but those games -- particularly the August ones -- showed us a lot about how these teams match up. That said, I expect Wilson to play closer to how she did Aug. 28 against the Liberty (23 points) than say how she fared Aug. 6, when she tallied nine points on 2-for-14 shooting and tweeted, \"I doubt I'll ever shoot 2-14 again I pray I don't lol.\" Since then, she has shot below 40% just once, and she has been playing on another level over the past two months or so. The Liberty have excellent defenders in Stewart and Jonquel Jones, but they'll still have their hands full trying to slow down Wilson.\nVoepel: The Aces' 98-81 victory over the Liberty on June 29 doesn't have much bearing on this series, as Candace Parker was still playing for the Aces, and Jones wasn't quite in the playing form she is now. The other four matchups, all in August, are likely indicative of what we will see in the Finals. The Aces didn't play well in their first game in Brooklyn nor in the Commissioner's Cup final in Las Vegas. Those will be games the Aces will review in preparation because they were far from their best in both.\nThe Aces and Liberty split their regular-season series, but New York beat Las Vegas in their Aug. 15 Commissioner's Cup championship game, which doesn't count toward WNBA standings or statistics. While the Aces are 2-3 against New York, they went 37-4 against the rest of the league, and only the Liberty had multiple wins against Las Vegas, per ESPN Stats & Information.\nPelton: It's interesting that head-to-head results haven't been particularly predictive of Finals results. Since the WNBA went to a single playoff table in 2016, and not including the shortened 2020 Wubble season, teams that won the regular-season series have gone just 2-4 in the Finals. And both of those winners, the 2018 Storm and last year's Aces, also had home-court advantage in the Finals. However, we've never seen teams play each other this often before the Finals. All of those previous head-to-head series were three games rather than the five times Las Vegas and New York have already met this year.\nPelton: Given the firepower on both sides, I think it's more about which team can consistently get stops. New York was 15-0 in the regular season (and 1-0 so far in the playoffs) when holding opponents to 95 points per 100 possessions or fewer. One of those games was the Aug. 6 blowout win over Las Vegas that represented the Aces' worst offensive performance of the season in terms of points per possession -- and the Liberty's best on defense.\nPhilippou: Defensively, for the reasons Pelton stated, but also because if you ask both Hammon and Brondello, they'd say defense wins championships. Not just by the pure nature of getting stops and keeping an opponent off the scoreboard, but for these two teams in particular, defense (and defensive rebounding) fuels offense on the other end, especially in transition.\nThe Aces have had the best defensive rating in both the regular season and playoffs, but they allowed the Liberty to score at least 80 points in all of their previous meetings except one -- Aug. 17, the only time Las Vegas beat New York in their four matchups that month.\nTop-seeded Las Vegas and No. 2 seed New York dominated opponents and statistics in 2023. In the regular season, they ranked 1-2 in several categories. -- ESPN Stats & Information\nVoepel: The Aces have the two-time Defensive Player of the Year in Wilson, but she has given much praise to Kiah Stokes as the true anchor of Las Vegas' defense. The Aces' Jackie Young is one of the league's best defensive guards and at 6 feet tall actually can take on just about anyone. Sixth Player of the Year Alysha Clark is also a versatile defender.\nIt makes sense to say defense will prevail in this series, for all the reasons Alexa and Kevin point out. Still, let's add this: The Aces can be like a runaway train on offense, and that can take over games. The Aces won playoff games scoring 97 points and 64 points, which shows how effective they can be on both ends of the court.\nPhilippou: Jones' emergence into her MVP-level self is arguably the single biggest development that has catapulted this Liberty team into a contender. In the postseason, she has had six double-doubles in as many games; and in the second half alone of Game 4 in the semifinals, Jones came up with 20 points and eight rebounds.\nGoing up against the Mystics' and Sun's frontcourts is different than facing that of the Aces' (especially with Wilson being unstoppable as of late). But if Jones can play like she did in New York's August meetings versus Las Vegas, the Liberty are much better positioned to win.\nAnother X factor is Liberty forward Betnijah Laney, who has scored at least 19 points in all but one of New York's postseason games and will be critical to helping contain the Aces' high-powered guards.\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n‚Ä¢ Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ NBA training camp cheat sheets ¬ª\n More ESPN+ content ¬ª\nVoepel: Jones is the biggest X factor overall in the series. The biggest for Las Vegas is Kelsey Plum's 3-point shooting, because that can really fuel the Aces. Plum averaged 2.4 3s per game and shot 38.9% from behind the arc in the regular season; during the Aces' five playoff games, she was at 3.2 and 42.1%. Plum, Young and Chelsea Gray all can do damage from long range, but if Plum gets in a groove, it makes Las Vegas' offense all the harder to stop.\nPelton: Stokes. Over the course of the season, as well as the playoffs, the Aces' starting lineup with Stokes in place of the injured Parker -- the group that led Las Vegas to last year's title -- has remained dominant.\nHowever, that hasn't been the case against the Liberty. In 45 minutes across the five meetings, the Aces were outscored by 19 points with their starting five on the court. Although Hammon can always go small with Clark in Stokes' place, not being able to keep Stokes on the court will leave Las Vegas painfully thin.\nPhilippou: Liberty in 5. I went back and forth and wouldn't be shocked to be proved wrong. But at the end of the day, it's hard to ignore how much the Liberty dominated the Aces in their most recent meetings in August. Plus, New York had a much tougher road to the championship series, and being battle-tested will pay off. Jones won MVP of the Commissioner's Cup championship game thanks to her dominance in the paint on both ends and on the glass, and I project her to take home Finals MVP should the Liberty win.\nVoepel: Aces in 5. This feels like the 2016 and 2017 Lynx-Sparks Finals, when there was such a good case for both teams to win both years. They split, with the Sparks winning in 2016 and the Lynx in 2017. The Sparks won 2016's Game 5 on Minnesota's home court, which is so hard to do in the clinching game of a playoff series. Then the Lynx won in Minneapolis in 2017's Game 5 -- although at the University of Minnesota's Williams Arena, because Target Center was being refurbished. The WNBA's most recent Finals Game 5 was in 2019, when Washington beat Connecticut on the Mystics' home court.\nIt seems like this year, the Aces -- who celebrated their 2022 title in Connecticut -- might win it at home.\nPelton: Liberty in 4. That's not a reflection on how close the series might be, but lower-seeded teams that have won the Finals in the best-of-five era have been more likely to close out at home than win a Game 5 on the road. If Parker were healthy, I'd be inclined to pick Las Vegas. But New York has been the (slightly) better team since the All-Star break, and I don't expect Stewart's shooting slump to carry over into the Finals.\nRamona Shelburne: Aces in 5. Las Vegas misses Parker, and this matchup is going to be difficult. But the Aces are the defending champs until someone takes the title from them. You've got to knock them off, and that's difficult over a best-of-five series."}

(3:41)\nAS JALEN MILROE gets more comfortable at quarterback, as the offensive line gets its act together, as penalties and turnovers continue to mount and an offensive identity only now begins to come into focus, one thing has kept the Alabama dynasty on life support and within earshot of the playoff conversation: its defense.\nThrough five games -- admittedly a smallish sample size but not insignificant, either -- the Crimson Tide have given up 4.42 yards per play against FBS opponents, which ranks ninth nationally. Turnovers and pressures are up from last season. Opposing quarterbacks' ratings are down.\nIt has been a while since an Alabama defense has looked this good, on pace to allow fewer than 300 yards per game for the first time since 2017. Against Ole Miss two weeks ago, it held the Rebels to 10 points, their fewest in an SEC game under coach Lane Kiffin and well short of their previous average of 52.7 points per game. And lest that be labeled a fluke, Ole Miss hung 55 on LSU its next time out.\nLast weekend, Alabama kept Mississippi State quarterback Will Rogers, the SEC's No. 2 all-time leading passer, in check to the tune of 107 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions. And lest that be labeled a fluke as well, Rogers was coming off 487 yards passing against South Carolina.\nDoes this all mean the return of vintage Nick Saban defenses? It's probably too soon to tell. We'll learn more Saturday when the Tide travel to Texas A&M (3:30 p.m. ET, CBS) for the first time since they gave up 41 points in a loss there two years ago. But while we wait, it may be time to ask an important question: How, after losing arguably the best defensive player in college football in Will Anderson, did the defense get better?\nCredit cornerbacks Malachi Moore and Terrion Arnold for stepping up. The same goes for linebackers Deontae Lawson and Chris Braswell. But the place to start is the man who on paper was tasked with replacing Anderson.\nDallas Turner spent the past two seasons quietly making a name for himself as one of the best young players in the country -- a blend of speed, agility and strength that's perfectly suited for the modern edge rusher. Playing opposite Anderson at outside linebacker, the South Florida native flourished in a role that was part sidekick, part understudy. His 12.5 sacks during that time were solid, ranking in the top 50 nationally, but they were dwarfed by Anderson and his FBS-best 27.5 sacks.\nWhen Anderson left for the NFL draft in January, he pulled Turner aside and told him pointedly, \"Bro, it's your defense.\"\nAnderson, drafted No. 3 overall, said he told Saban the same thing, stressing that the outside linebackers set the tone.\n\"[Turner] can be one of the best to come through Alabama,\" Anderson told ESPN. \"He would always say, 'Bro, I wanna do what you do.' And I always told him, 'Do better than what I did.' And I honestly believe he can do that, 100 percent.\"\nThat includes surpassing Anderson's 17.5 sacks and 34 tackles for loss as a sophomore, he said.\n\"I truly believe that,\" Anderson said. \"I know the type of hard work he puts in. I know his mentality. I know the grit and the love that he has for the game, that he can go out there and do all those things.\"\nAfter posting 3.5 tackles for loss, two sacks and a forced fumble against Ole Miss, Turner wore a T-shirt with a likeness of himself flexing in uniform. Soft-spoken, he let his attire do the work.\nWritten in all-caps above the cartoon image were the words, \"NO LIMIT.\"\nIt's what Turner feels about Alabama this season -- \"There's no limit to how good the defense can be,\" he said -- and how coaches feel about his potential as one of the most gifted edge rushers in college football.\nTURNER'S FOOTBALL ASCENSION was first written in code on a PlayStation outside of Seoul, South Korea. It was 2001, and Delon Turner was nearing the end of his professional career for Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus of the Korean Basketball League when he and a roommate passed the time during an off day by playing Madden.\nThey competed in full seasons against one another with simple rules. They each allowed the other to create one player and give that player an unlimited rating, making that player the best on the field.\nDelon's roommate created a running back and named him after his son, Jaylen. And because Delon couldn't tackle the 99-rated Jaylen with anyone on the roster, he made a 99-rated defensive end as a countermeasure.\nHe didn't have a son of his own yet, so he picked a name at random: Dallas.\nFast-forward two years and a return to the U.S., the name stuck. But the unique story of Dallas' birth didn't end there.\n\"As [my wife] was giving labor,\" Delon recalled, \"I was watching the Pro Bowl.\"\nThe stars aligned perfectly as Delon handed down not only his athletic ability but his work ethic as a professional athlete. Dallas seemed to understand the big picture at a young age, like when he gave up a promising basketball career, which had included a coveted Team USA invite, to focus on football. He went to American Heritage High School to get coached by former Miami Dolphin Pat Surtain. And sensing he needed a change of scenery before college, he transferred to St. Thomas Aquinas, where he would receive coaching from another former Dolphin, Jason Taylor, a first-ballot Hall of Famer and one of the best defensive ends to ever play the game.\n\"God blessed Dallas with a lot of talent and length and height and size,\" Taylor said. \"So you combine that with the skills learned on the basketball court -- your lateral movement, your foot quickness, your hand-eye coordination, instantaneously going from offense to defense and having to backpedal and turn and open your hips and roll and run and all the things -- and then you transplant that into a kid that has some dog in them and is highly, highly competitive and physical and hungry, it's a nasty combination.\"\nBut the thing Taylor said he appreciated most about Dallas was how open he was to coaching. Already a high-profile recruit once he got to St. Thomas Aquinas, Taylor said Dallas \"wanted to be pushed.\" So much so that Delon hired pass-rush specialist Javon Gopie to work with Dallas starting his sophomore season of high school. Gopie said Dallas told him right off the bat, \"These are the things I'm great at, but I want to be more intentional and become a smarter pass-rusher.\"\nWhen Nick Saban came calling, Taylor didn't sugarcoat what an Alabama offer meant. Taylor, who was coached by Saban for two years in the NFL and credits him with taking his career from good to great, told Dallas, \"You have to be willing to go there and work and grind and be coached hard.\"\n\"That place isn't for everybody,\" Taylor said, \"and he didn't shy away from it.\"\nDallas considered Georgia, Florida, Michigan and Oklahoma. But he said, \"My family trusted Nick Saban and the coaching staff over there to help me get where I need to go.\"\nDelon said there was one more factor that helped seal the deal.\nDelon recalled the family visiting campus for a game against No. 3 Georgia when a newcomer named Will Anderson stood out, racking up four tackles and a quarterback hurry. Anderson would go on to register seven sacks in his final six games as a true freshman.\nDallas told Delon after the game, \"If that guy can do it, I can do it.\"\nAnd then when it came to other colleges, \"everybody else was a distant second,\" Delon said.\nTURNER WAS QUIET when he got to Alabama. Naturally reserved, he watched Anderson and veterans like Chris Allen work and kept his distance at first.\nAnderson was having none of that, though, welcoming him to the team with some good-natured ribbing about his weight.\n\"Dallas,\" Anderson chided him, \"you're a little big to play outside linebacker.\"\nTruth be told, Turner was in fine shape. He just needed time to find his place on the defense, starting out on the bench until Drew Sanders suffered a season-ending injury five games into the 2021 season.\nBy that time, Anderson had already taken Turner under his wing, teaching him patience.\n\"From the get-go, it was an easy relationship to build,\" Anderson said. \"He came in with his head on right, he was willing to listen to the older guys in the room, and he just wanted to be great. And when you have guys like that, who share the mentality that I have, we just gravitate towards each other.\"\n\nGet your favorite live sports, stories and originals with ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. Upgrade to a Disney Bundle plan and start streaming something for everyone today!\nBy a shared mentality, Anderson meant, \"Whatever it takes to be great.\"\nLike Anderson, Turner came on late as a freshman, registering all 5.5 of his sacks in his final seven games.\nThe two became close -- \"That's my best friend, my little bro,\" Anderson said -- spending countless hours in the film room studying one another.\n\"It was never a competition between me and Will,\" Turner said. \"Because I always knew Will was good. I knew when I came in that people were going to be better than me. So I just tried to look at it as just be a sponge, just soak up everything.\"\nAnderson said Turner taught him a few things, too, like what techniques to use against certain offensive tackles.\nWhereas Anderson overwhelmed opponents with his strength and speed, Turner was a tactician. Their go-to moves even coincided with their nicknames: Anderson went by \"Speed-to-power Will\" while Turner went by \"Stab Club Dal.\"\nOffensive lineman JC Latham said he constantly has to be on the lookout for Turner's lethal \"ghost\" move, where he deploys a stutter step and curls under contact to get to the quarterback.\n\"Dallas has a pass-rush repertoire that allows him to dive deep into many different things,\" Latham said. \"So even though both [Turner and Anderson] are extremely talented, extremely great, they have two different types of styles to play.\"\nAnderson got all the publicity. He even picked up the catchy nickname, \"The Terminator,\" from then-offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian.\nTurner flew below the radar. \"It's just Dallas for now,\" he said.\nREPLACE WILL ANDERSON?\nAs in, replace an All-American and one of the best defensive players to ever come through Alabama?\nNo, Saban wasn't buying that premise at all.\n\"You don't kind of look at it like somebody's replacing somebody,\" he said. \"You look at it like, what do you need to continue to help develop that guy to play well.\"\nGopie has seen the long arc of Turner's development -- the five-star prospect with his pick of schools, the standout freshman at Alabama and the perceived sophomore dip last season, going from 8.5 sacks in 2021 to four sacks in 2022. Gopie said the numbers are a bit misleading because Turner was still affecting the quarterback as a sophomore. And the analytics back that up, showing a pressure rate of 12.2% vs. 13.8% the year before. Turner's third-down pressure rate actually improved 4.9 percentage points.\nBut Gopie recognized the pressure entering Turner's junior season. With Anderson no longer rushing off the opposite edge, it was fair to wonder how effective Turner would be.\n\"Last year when Will was projected a top-five pick, I think Dallas knew at that moment, 'OK, my time is coming and it's time for me to be able to lead the group,'\" Gopie said. \"He's no longer the young guy anymore.\"\nGopie said it has been encouraging to see Turner lean on his family and the pass-rush community he has been a part of during the offseason in South Florida, working with pros like Greg Russo, Shaq Lawson and Bradley Chubb.\n\"I think leaning on everybody that he has in his corner has really really empowered him to embrace this position,\" Gopie said. \"And he's excited for it.\"\nAt SEC media days this summer, Turner acknowledged what was at stake in what could be his final season in college. ESPN rates him a consensus top-10 pick in next year's NFL draft.\nA reporter reminded him that no Alabama player during the Saban era has gone three years without winning a national championship. But before the reporter could finish his sentence, Turner pointed to his ring finger, where a piece of jewelry should be.\nRemembering the losses the past two seasons and hearing all the criticism of the defense has been like adding fuel to their collective fire, Turner said.\nWhen Anderson said he \"cried [his] eyes out\" after Alabama suffered its second loss of the 2022 season at LSU, Turner said he was right there with him.\n\"But I feel like [Anderson] has taught me some things leadership wise to how to lead the team in the right direction,\" he said. \"But I feel like now we have all the right pieces now that we need all the right guys in the locker room, all the leaders that we need, too, to get to where we need to go.\"\nTurner promised he'd take \"full ownership.\"\nThat accountability showed after a Week 2 loss to Texas. Turner took it personally, calling it \"sickening\" that they gave up 34 points at home. The next day, the veterans on the team called a players-only meeting to clear the air. Turner called it a \"come-together moment\" in which they \"set the tone of what it's going to be on Saturdays.\"\nIn the three games since, Turner has been a man on fire, with 17 tackles, two forced fumbles and 5.5 sacks, which is second most among Power 5 players this season.\nDon't look now, but Turner's rate of sacks per game (1.1) and tackles for loss (1.5) are both higher than Anderson's last season.\nSo how good can he be?\nTaylor said there's no limit.\n\"As good as he wants,\" he said. \"He's an ultra-talented kid. Got a lot of bend, really good twitch, long, powerful. I mean, he's got everything. The length, the hand usage, plays a great pad level. He's as competitive as any kid I've been around. He's very gifted. Now the rest is up to him.\""}
{"title": "Gio Reyna's USMNT return raises questions for Gregg Berhalter -- on and off the field", "date": "2023-10-05 23:47:12", "text": "The rapprochement between U.S. men's national team manager Gregg Berhalter and talented attacker Gio Reyna has finally taken place.\nNow what?\nReyna is included in the latest U.S. roster, which was announced on Thursday for games against Germany on Oct. 14 and Ghana three days later. The matches will mark Reyna's first action with the USMNT since fracturing his right leg in the Concacaf Nations League final against Canada last June.\nMore critically, Reyna and Berhalter will be working together for the first time since the 2022 World Cup, when tensions between the pair led to the families of both men being engulfed by a very public feud.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Depth charts for every Premier League team\nThere are still plenty of questions about what the future holds for Reyna at international level. Foremost among these is the extent to which Reyna and Berhalter's relationship is really mended.\nThere was a roughly eight-month period in which the two didn't talk following a maelstrom of incidents that stemmed from Reyna's limited playing time at the 2022 World Cup. Berhalter afterward contributed to the subsequent outing of Reyna's poor attitude, and in response Reyna's family told U.S. Soccer officials about a decades-old domestic violence incident involving Berhalter.\nSuffice it to say, there was considerable healing that needed to take place.\nOn a conference call with reporters after Thursday's roster announcement, Berhalter confirmed that the first step took place \"weeks ago\" with the two conversing over a Zoom call. He didn't provide much in the way of details beyond that, except for saying that he and Reyna are in a \"good spot\" and that it was a \"positive conversation.\"\nBerhalter did acknowledge that the process of mending the relationship is ongoing.\n\"I think it will take time,\" Berhalter said. \"It is a difference between a Zoom call and being in person. But I think that both intentions are positive, and the idea is that we work together for the team to be successful, and I think we're both prepared to do that.\"\nTime will reveal the extent to which that actually happens. There are ups and downs in any coach-player relationship, and what took place over those eight months isn't just going to wash away.\nBut the two have to begin somewhere, and the upcoming camp is the place to start. Reyna's return to the national team camp raises its own set of on-field questions, though.\nReyna hasn't played for club or country since sustaining the aforementioned right leg fracture. He has been healthy enough to be on the bench for Borussia Dortmund of late, so how much could he see the field for the U.S. team?\nBerhalter indicated his approach to using Reyna in the upcoming games will be similar to his handling of Folarin Balogun during the September window. On that occasion, with Balogun working his way back to full fitness following his move to AS Monaco, Berhalter limited the forward to 45-minute stints against Uzbekistan and Oman.\nHerc Gomez reacts to U.S. soccer sporting director Matt Crocker saying there's \"a way forward\" for Gio Reyna and Gregg Berhalter.\nBerhalter said on Thursday that his goal is to build up Reyna's fitness \"in a safe way\" and send him back to Dortmund in a position to make a greater impact for his club.\n\"We're going to be creative with the minutes,\" Berhalter said in relation to Reyna. \"We want to certainly get him on the field and work through both the Germany game, and seeing what position he plays. And then in the Ghana game, same thing, seeing how we can get him in different positions throughout the camp on the field.\"\nWhere Reyna is deployed may just be the biggest question of all. During the 2022 cycle, Reyna played almost exclusively on the wing. But against better teams, the U.S. has struggled to create chances on a consistent basis and, in response, Berhalter could look at putting the creative Reyna in a position to get on the ball more.\nAt the 2022 World Cup -- in which Reyna played a mere 52 minutes due in part to disciplinary issues -- the USMNT's xG, or expected goals, per 90 minutes of actual playing time (which includes stoppage time) was 0.91. That xG, which measures chance creation, ranked 22nd in the tournament among all 32 teams, and 12th out of the 16 teams that reached the knockout stages. Yes, that's a small sample size, but it still points to how the U.S. could use more creativity.\nOne possible solution was on display last June, when the USMNT, under interim manager B.J. Callaghan, trotted out a 4-2-3-1 with Reyna in a central attacking role. Against World Cup qualifiers Mexico and Canada, the U.S. attack looked much more fluid and the attack also benefited from Reyna handling set piece duties.\nHerculez Gomez and Sebastian Salazar debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only)\nBerhalter didn't rule out Reyna reprising that central attacking role, but he didn't completely commit to it either.\n\"In terms of Gio, we see him being able to play three positions: center midfielder, attacking midfielder and winger,\" Berhalter said. \"And we use wingers in different ways. Sometimes the wingers are wide against the line, and sometimes they're in between the lines, and we see him as more of an in-between-the-lines winger.\"\nThe continued absence of defensive midfielder Tyler Adams due to a hamstring injury means the U.S. manager has some other questions about his midfield to solve. Does he play with a single holding midfielder or resort to a double pivot? But in the past, Berhalter has lauded how the midfield trio of Adams, Yunus Musah and Weston McKennie played together, hinting that he would continue with that group if all were healthy.\nDuring the Nations League, Callaghan noted that Reyna's ability to defend is an area where the U.S. coaching staff have asked for improvement, and the 20-year-old responded well to that challenge. If that continues to be the case, the benefits of playing Reyna centrally seem to outweigh his defensive shortcomings, especially if he has two out of Musah, McKennie and (hopefully) Adams playing behind him. It seems the time has arrived to gather more data about Reyna's ability to operate in that midfield role.\nEither way, the games against Germany and Ghana will certainly provide a stern test to see if the U.S. attack -- as well as Berhalter and Reyna -- can move forward."}
{"title": "Are United's making Hojlund's life harder by asking him to do the (near) unprecedented?", "date": "2023-10-05 20:18:19", "text": "Gab & Juls analyse Rasmus Hojlund's performance in Man United's 4-3 loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League. (1:04)\nAt the risk of piling on to the laundry list of Manchester United concerns -- back-to-back Champions League defeats, four defeats in seven games to open the Premier League season, no sign of the football Erik Ten Hag played at Ajax, Antony being questioned by police in two countries for assaulting women, Jadon Sancho exiled from the squad, Luke Shaw and Lisandro Mart√≠nez injured, the club being wholly or partly up for sale and nobody meeting the owners' expectations, Harry Maguire sticking around and the Glazers, too -- I wonder if it's time to fret over Rasmus Hojlund.\nIt has nothing to do with his attitude or his production thus far. Despite being injured going into the season, the young center-forward has looked, sharp, motivated and gifted. He scored a fine goal against Galatasaray and was among those least to blame for the home defeat.\nRather, I'm concerned about the enormity of the task in front of him: playing center-forward at his age on a team of United's magnitude at a time when all is not well and still living up to expectations.\nHojlund does not turn 21 until Feb. 4. He reportedly cost the club a whopping ‚Ç¨70m ($73.5m) in transfer fees, rising to ‚Ç¨80m ($84m) this past summer. To put this in context, according to Transfermarkt, only 42 players in the history of the game have changed clubs for bigger fees. Of those, just 11 were under the age of 21 and of those 11, none was a central striker, and none moved to a club facing the sort of turmoil currently engulfing United.\nIt's not just that Hojlund moved to an enormous club for enormous money at a very young age, either; it's that he will have to get serious playing time of the sort that center-forwards aren't usually afforded at his age. Why? Because United are in four competitions and they only have two other realistic options up front. One is Marcus Rashford, who is arguably their best player and has been far more productive playing out wide. The other is Anthony Martial, who has scored all of 11 goals in his last 67 league appearances. He also has a poor injury record and hasn't impressed in a long, long time, which explains why his contract expires in June and there has been no talk of extending it.\nAll this translates to a lot of minutes on the pitch for Hojlund, and that's not something we see very often at that age, especially at a major club with a lot of pressure.\nClubs are more willing these days than they were in the past to put their faith in youngsters, but when they do, it's overwhelmingly in certain positions: out on the wing, perhaps in attacking midfield, occasionally at fullback. These are roles where, rightly or wrongly, mistakes are easier to tolerate by fans, media and (crucially) teammates. Precocious center-forwards -- especially ones like Hojlund -- are not quite as rare as teenage keepers, but they're not far off either.\nTake the last five seasons in Europe's Big Five leagues and a cut off of, say, 60% of a team's minutes (2,052) as a reasonable amount for a starter. That's 118 teams multiplied by five seasons, which is 590 times it could have happened. Well, it only happened on 21 occasions and once you whittle down the players who split their between up front and out wide -- like Jo√£o F√©lix in 2019-20 at Atletico Madrid, Christian Kouam√© at Genoa in 2018-19 or Amine Gouiri at Nice in 2020-21 -- and stick to proper center-forwards, you're left with just 17 instances where this has happened.\nOf those, there are just two examples in the Premier League: Armando Broja at Southampton (2021-22), and Rashford at Manchester United (2018-19). And Rashford isn't a great comp here, since United often played a front two that season and unlike Hojlund, he'd been at the club from a young age and had 2¬Ω years as a regular under his belt when he did it.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\nElsewhere around Europe, you have Erling Haaland, who did it twice (no surprise there), but we're talking about a phenom and an outlier. With a few exceptions, most who did it were at small clubs with far less pressure, where it was OK to \"chuck in the kid\" and see what happened -- I'm thinking here of guys like Jonathan Burkardt at Mainz (2021-22) or Youssef En-Nesyri at Leganes (2018-19). The biggest clubs where it occurred were Real Sociedad (Alexander Isak, 2020-21), Fiorentina (Dusan Vlahovic, 2020-21), Eintracht Frankfurt (Luka Jovic, 2018-19, though he often played in a front two with Sebastian Haller) and Lille (Victor Osimhen in 2019-20 and Jonathan David in 2020-21, though, again both often played in a front two).\nYou might also notice that none of those guys -- except for Osimhen in 2019-20 -- played Champions League football and that three of them played in empty stadiums during the pandemic, rather than in front of 70,000 at Old Trafford.\nRob Dawson reacts to loud boos at Old Trafford after Erik ten Hag's decision to sub Anthony Martial on for Rasmus Hojlund.\nThe bottom line? United appear to be asking Hojlund to do something that's near unprecedented in Europe's major leagues. The fact that Haaland did it, he's also from Scandinavia and there's a certain assonance to their names is pretty meaningless here. Using him as a benchmark is also unfair. We know United's budget was stretched to the limit this past summer, but with hindsight, you wonder if maybe they wouldn't have been better off picking up a veteran striker, ideally on loan, to take some of the workload off Hojlund and help him develop.\n(OK, this is where some will giggle and blurt out: \"What? You mean like Wout Weghorst?\" Laugh all you like about Weghorst, but he cost nothing in fees, gave United some meaningful minutes and they finished third in the Premier League, won the League Cup and went on a deep Europa League run with him.)\nHeck, Hojlund himself benefited from being part of an attacking corps rather than the main man last season at Atalanta, when he scored 10 goals in 34 appearances. He shared playing time with two veteran center-forwards like Luis Muriel and Duv√°n Zapata and only made 20 starts, very rarely up front on his own. And he was the team's third-leading scorer, after Ademola Lookman and Teun Koopmeiners. There was no European football to worry about, and the focus was squarely on his personal growth.\nHojlund has impressive tools -- we can debate the transfer fee another time -- and it's entirely possible that a season of apparent hardship and turmoil at the club will only toughen him up even further and not impact his development arc one bit. But the frustrating thing is that it didn't need to be this way. There was no reason to make his job that much more difficult and the club's massive investment in him that much more difficult to come to fruition."}

(1:38)\nThe 2023-24 Champions League group stage is underway, and matchday two is in the books with Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Barcelona the only teams to maintain a 100% record. After a thrilling round of games, we asked our writers Gab Marcotti, Rob Dawson and Sam Marsden to answer some of our burning questions.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n- Guardiola passes Sir Alex Ferguson for UCL wins\nManchester United. Two games, two defeats, and they're already struggling to qualify for the Round of 16. They've scored five goals in games against Bayern Munich and Galatasaray but the way they've defended has been appalling, leaking seven goals in 180 minutes of football. They conceded three at home against Galatasaray but it could have been even worse. Mauro Icardi missed a penalty after Casemiro had been sent off, and also had a good chance in stoppage-time with the score already at 3-2. It's not the first time in recent history that United have been in trouble in the group stage, going out before the knockouts in both 2015-16 and 2020-21. -- Dawson\nFive teams are on zero points, but obviously Manchester United stand out, mainly because of the recurring psychodrama in the background (Antony, the Glazers, Jadon Sancho, half the starting back four out, etc.) and their horrible league form as well. I'd throw in Paris Saint-Germain as well, simply because of the manner of the 4-1 defeat at Newcastle United, the way the club can be a zoo, and the fact that head coach Luis Enrique is, well, different. And if I'm Arsenal, I'm not taking things for granted either. Sevilla home and away next can be very tricky. -- Marcotti\nIt's Man United, isn't it?! But to add some variety, there is also pressure on Luis Enrique and PSG. It's not just that they lost to Newcastle, it's that they were beaten 4-1. Throw in the fact they are in the toughest group in the competition and now have a double-header coming up against AC Milan and it's not hard to imagine them failing to make it into the knockout rounds. Three draws and a defeat in seven Ligue 1 games show this is not just a European issue, either. The post-Lionel Messi and Neymar years, built around Kylian Mbapp√© and French brilliance, were not supposed to be so rocky so soon. -- Marsden\nCraig Burley and Alejandro Moreno assess another dismal defeat for Man United in the UEFA Champions League at the hands of Galatasaray.\nFC Copenhagen. They've never been past the group stage, but they've done enough in the opening two games to show they've got a chance this time. They were 2-0 up against Galatasaray in Istanbul with four minutes to go, and were only pegged back to 2-2 after going down to 10 men; then they took the lead at home against Bayern before narrowly losing 2-1. Their fate in Group A will be decided by back-to-back games against Manchester United, and with Erik ten Hag's team not playing well, the Danish champions could spring a surprise. -- Dawson\nLet's face it, nobody in Group F (Newcastle, PSG, AC Milan and Dortmund), which is wide open, is an underdog. Nor are Lens, frankly. So I'm going to suggest Feyenoord. I love the fact that head coach Arne Slot decided to stick around and give it a go after winning the Eredivisie title, rather than chasing coin elsewhere like so many of his colleagues would have done. They gave Atletico Madrid a real fright away, and can do the same to others. -- Marcotti\nMaybe underdog is pushing it, but Real Sociedad were in pot four in the draw so should technically be the worst the team in their group. I know the science to the pots means that isn't necessarily the case but Internazionale and Benfica would still have been the two teams expected to progress. Instead, La Real sit top after two games thanks to a draw against the Italians and Tuesday's 2-0 win at FC Salzburg. Take Kubo and Brais M√©ndez are great fun to watch, and they have a homegrown spine that makes it easy to root for them. -- Marsden\nCraig Burley lays into the performance of PSG's Kylian Mbappe following their thumping 4-1 defeat to Newcastle United in the Champions League.\nManchester United have been rubbish in the Champions League but ¬£72 million striker Rasmus Hojlund has, at least, been a positive. The 20-year-old became the youngest player to score in his first two Champions League games since Erling Haaland when he found the net against Galatasaray after opening his United account on matchday one against Bayern. His first against Galatasaray was a thumping header from Marcus Rashford's cross, and his second was about his pace and finishing ability after racing away from the halfway line. Hojlund is under immense pressure to perform as United's central striker and, so far, he's handling it well. -- Dawson\nAm I allowed to say Newcastle defender Dan Burn? What, you want somebody more glamorous? I had zero expectations for Icardi, but he came up huge for Galatasaray last season and it's continuing this year. Some love for Atletico striker √Ålvaro Morata too, please. Mendez has been really impressive for Real Sociedad, and Man City's Juli√°n √Ålvarez gets better every time I see him play. -- Marcotti\nIt's hard to focus on one player after just two games, but I'll go with Alvarez. He was the star in Manchester City's win over Red Star Belgrade and then came off the bench to down RB Leipzig on Wednesday. He's making it impossible for City boss Pep Guardiola to leave him out when the big games come around. A shout out for Jo√£o F√©lix, too, who has been good in both of Barcelona's games so far, and Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham. Even if we expected him to be good, we did not imagine him having this impact so soon, with important goals in wins over Union Berlin and Napoli. -- Marsden\nAle Moreno heaps praise on Jude Bellingham following Real Madrid's Champions League win over Napoli.\nThey need to defend better. Injuries, particularly at the back, have been a problem this season, but Lisandro Mart√≠nez, Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are likely to miss the rest of the group-stage games and manager Ten Hag has to find a way of improving with the players he's got available. One easy fix is to move Sofyan Amrabat from a makeshift left-back into midfield to give Casemiro some help. Casemiro will have to serve a suspension after his red card against Galatasaray, but having him alongside Amrabat once the Brazilian is back will make United far more robust in the middle of the pitch. -- Dawson\nIt's kinda two different questions as I see it, in the sense they don't need to hit their stride to get out of the group. Obviously, they need to take four of six points in the double-header against Copenhagen and avoid defeat in Istanbul. Then, on matchday six, they play Bayern, who will probably have qualified by then and may play the C-team. So that's eight points they can get without being particularly good. And that might be enough.\nHow do they actually get good? Well, that's a far more complicated question. I'm not sure their injured guys will be back in time to affect this group stage, Casemiro is now suspended, Antony is anyone's guess. There's enough there that Bruno Fernandes and Rashford can carry them at times (not all the time as we've seen) but there's a reason why they've only won three games all season (I'm not counting the win over Palace in the Carabao Cup). And, lest we forget, Wolverhampton Wanderers were robbed after outplaying them for long stretches, and United they had to come from two goals down to beat Nottingham Forest, who played the last 23 minutes with 10 men. Meanwhile, against Burnley, they were thoroughly outplayed and it took a moment of magic from Bruno (and ... wait for it ... Jonny Freaking Evans!) to get the three points. Yeah, it's bad, it's really bad. -- Marcotti\nAs Gab points out, the two are not mutually exclusive. United are now in a situation where they need to turn to an old football cliche and take things game by game. In that sense, they have a nice fixture list. Back-to-back matches against Copenhagen, who have proven tough opponents against Galatasaray and Bayern, give them a chance to revive their European hopes. Winning those fixtures would set up a huge game in Turkey against Galatasaray. Beyond that, they need to get players back in their natural positions (which is not easy with their list of absentees, but Amrabat into midfield would be a start) and build around their best players, who at the moment are Bruno and Hojlund. The latter's goal-scoring ability could help lift the mood around the team, but it looks bleak at the moment. -- Marsden"}
{"title": "USC at Michigan? Ohio State at Oregon? Big Ten's best matchups in 2024", "date": "2023-10-05 20:05:00", "text": "With the additions of Oregon, Washington, USC and UCLA, the Big Ten conference revealed its matchups for the 2024 to 2028 seasons on Thursday.\nThose matchups included 12 protected annual games, preserving rivalries and games of historical significance such as Ohio State-Michigan and the matchup of newcomers USC and UCLA.\nThere is a lot to digest with the matchups being released, and while we don't know exact dates and times, we do know which teams will face each other and how the future of the Big Ten will be shaped. Our writers analyzed the new Big Ten, breaking down the best games and the toughest and easiest matchups.\nJump to:\n2024 matchups\n\nTom VanHaaren: The 2024 schedule has a lot of really exciting matchups, but I think I'm most excited for USC traveling to Ann Arbor to play Michigan. We don't know yet if Caleb Williams will be the quarterback for the Trojans, but with Lincoln Riley as the head coach, we know the offense will be explosive. The Wolverines have put together a balanced team and have a defense that has stifled opponents this season. Putting USC's offense against Michigan's defense would be fun to watch.\nBlake Baumgartner: Ohio State's visit to Eugene to tangle with the Ducks is another great matchup. The two schools last met in Columbus back in 2021, with Oregon pulling off the upset of a top-10 Buckeyes team. Dan Lanning has been doing work on the recruiting trail and the race to succeed Bo Nix at quarterback will be fun to watch, as top-25 overall prospect Michael Van Buren (No. 23 overall in 2024) headlines a class that ESPN has ranked fourth. Kyle McCord has another year of eligibility for Ryan Day & Co. and will only be better following his experience in 2023.\nPaolo Uggetti: I'm with Tom and Blake, but for the sake of variety, how about Penn State traveling to USC in a rematch of the thrilling 2017 Rose Bowl? Sure, the players and some coaches are different now, but both offenses should be plenty explosive enough to provide a fitting encore. Really, any Big Ten team traveling to Los Angeles for a game against USC will make for an awesome environment not only because of the number of out-of-town fans who will make the trip, but also the transplants who already call the city their home.\nVanHaaren: Washington has a pretty tough schedule in 2024 with Iowa, Oregon, Penn State, Michigan, UCLA and USC all on tap. They'll have to travel to Indiana, Iowa, Oregon and Penn State. That Penn State game on the road could be a tough one considering how hard it is to play at Beaver Stadium. The Huskies also will have to travel to Rutgers, which will be a hike across the country. Washington is at home against Michigan, Northwestern, UCLA and USC, but that is a lot to take on in one season considering the team will likely be breaking in a new quarterback after Michael Penix Jr.'s eligibility runs out.\nBaumgartner: Michigan has four games on its 2024 schedule that immediately pop off the page -- road dates with Washington and Ohio State to couple with games in Ann Arbor against USC and Oregon. Having to make only one trek out to the West Coast helps logistically. Much has been made about the quality (or lack thereof) of the Wolverines' nonconference slate the past few seasons. We knew that was likely to take care of itself with the addition of the four Pac-12 schools. But to finally see what that looks like on paper hammers home how difficult it will be to win a Big Ten crown, let alone back-to-back titles as the Wolverines have done the past two years.\nUggetti: Nebraska will have to go on the road to both Ohio State and USC in 2024. While the rest of their road games (Indiana, Iowa, Purdue) as well as their home games (Illinois, Rutgers, UCLA, Wisconsin) don't present too tough a task, the two matchups against juggernauts on their home turf are enough to make their schedule next season one of the tougher ones in the conference. And given how they've looked so far this season, one can almost assume those two games will be near-automatic losses for the Cornhuskers.\nUggetti: In terms of big-name teams, I think Ohio State got the easiest draw in Year 1 of the new Big Ten. The Buckeyes travel to Northwestern, Michigan State, Penn State and will have to go to Oregon as their lone West Coast trip. They avoid playing USC, Washington and UCLA. That trip to Autzen will be much anticipated and, aside from perhaps the road trip to Penn State and hosting Michigan in the annual rivalry game, could be Ohio State's toughest task of the season.\n\nGet your favorite live sports, stories and originals with ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. Upgrade to a Disney Bundle plan and start streaming something for everyone today!\nVanHaaren: Rutgers has USC, UCLA and Washington, which will be a difficult stretch. But the Scarlet Knights don't have Michigan, Penn State or Ohio State on their schedule. That seems like a good trade-off, especially because the USC game is the only West Coast away game Rutgers will have in 2024. The matchups against Illinois, Minnesota, UCLA, Washington and Wisconsin will all be at home.\nBaumgartner: Logistically, Iowa's schedule stands out. Only once do the Hawkeyes have to travel out to the Pacific time zone -- for a game at the Rose Bowl with UCLA. Yes, a trip to Columbus is on the docket to face the Buckeyes, but road games against Michigan State, Minnesota and Maryland seem manageable. Oregon, Michigan and Penn State aren't on the schedule. Washington will get introduced to Kinnick Stadium's legendary pink visitors locker room for the first time. With divisions going the way of the dodo bird, Iowa didn't get a terrible shake in the first year of the 18-team league.\n\nFor the full matchups through the 2028 season, click here.\nHome: Michigan, Michigan State, Minnesota, Purdue\nAway: Nebraska, Northwestern, Oregon, Penn State, Rutgers\nHome: Maryland, Michigan, Nebraska, Purdue, Washington\nAway: Michigan State, Northwestern, Ohio State, UCLA\nHome: Nebraska, Northwestern, Washington, Wisconsin\nAway: Maryland, Michigan State, Minnesota, Ohio State, UCLA\nHome: Iowa, Michigan State, Northwestern, Rutgers, USC\nAway: Indiana, Minnesota, Oregon, Penn State\nHome: Michigan State, Minnesota, Northwestern, Oregon, USC\nAway: Illinois, Indiana, Ohio State, Washington\nHome: Indiana, Iowa, Ohio State, Purdue, Rutgers\nAway: Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Oregon\nHome: Iowa, Maryland, Penn State, USC\nAway: Illinois, Michigan, Rutgers, UCLA, Wisconsin\nHome: Illinois, Rutgers, UCLA, Wisconsin\nAway: Indiana, Iowa, Ohio State, Purdue, USC\nHome: Illinois, Indiana, Ohio State, Wisconsin\nAway: Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Purdue, Washington\nHome: Illinois, Maryland, Michigan State, Ohio State, Washington\nAway: Michigan, Purdue, UCLA, Wisconsin\nHome: Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, Purdue\nAway: Michigan State, Northwestern, Oregon, Penn State\nHome: Illinois, Maryland, Ohio State, UCLA, Washington\nAway: Minnesota, Purdue, USC, Wisconsin\nHome: Nebraska, Northwestern, Oregon, Penn State\nAway: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan State, Ohio State, Wisconsin\nHome: Illinois, Minnesota, UCLA, Washington, Wisconsin\nAway: Maryland, Michigan State, Nebraska, USC\nHome: Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, USC\nAway: Nebraska, Penn State, Rutgers, Washington\nHome: Nebraska, Penn State, Rutgers, Wisconsin\nAway: Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, UCLA, Washington\nHome: Michigan, Northwestern, UCLA, USC\nAway: Indiana, Iowa, Oregon, Penn State, Rutgers\nHome: Minnesota, Oregon, Penn State, Purdue\nAway: Iowa, Nebraska, Northwestern, Rutgers, USC"}
{"title": "Ross Chastain is too busy to trade barbs with NASCAR rivals", "date": "2023-10-05 17:37:36", "text": "HUNTERSVILLE, N.C. -- Ross Chastain is very comfortable at Waffle House.\nThat is where he is seated on a Tuesday morning, two days after finishing dead last at Talladega, which happened one week after finishing second at Texas, and only five days ahead of Sunday's NASCAR playoff 12-teams-to-eight cutoff event on the Charlotte Motor Speedway Roval, where he will start the race sitting three positions and nine points on the wrong side of that elimination line. So close, but so much work to do.\nYet here the three-time Cup Series racer winner is, the maestro behind the Hail Melon maneuver at Martinsville Speedway one year ago that became a crossover social media sensation, calmly knocking down coffee, over-easy eggs, grits and a peanut-butter-smeared waffle. He's in a bright yellow booth that is sandwiched directly between an off-duty landscaping crew and four vacationing husbands who have chosen to sit across the restaurant from their wives. No one in the place, not the patrons, not the java-pouring server, not even the batter-splattered cook at the griddle, has any idea that there is a race car driver in their midst.\nAnd not just any stock car racer but NASCAR's current lightning rod.\nThe guy who inspires as many boos as cheers. See: the seemingly 50/50 split of praise and ridicule that followed the Hail Melon (and a NASCAR rule change to prevent it from happening again), even after it cut through the NFL noise to put NASCAR on the media map and earned him a spot in 2022's Championship Four.\nThe guy whose name now comes up even when he isn't involved. See: a NASCAR on Fox Instagram post of Saturday's Truck Series fight between Matt Crafton and Nick Sanchez that produced nearly 900 comments. The top comment reads: \"I don't know how but it was Chastain's fault.\"\nThe guy who can't seem to get through a month without eliciting barb-covered sound bites about him from the sport's biggest stars.\nMartin Truex Jr. in August: \"Get your s--- together.\"\nKyle Busch, same day: \"I got Chastained.\"\nDenny Hamlin on his podcast after a wreck with Chastain in March: \"I think that Ross doesn't like it when I speak his name in the media and when I have this microphone. I told him I have a microphone and I'm going to call it like I see it. Until you get a microphone, you can then say whatever you want about me.\"\nSitting here in this Waffle House booth north of Charlotte, Ross Chastain is given that microphone. A chance to smother and cover the NASCAR world with a sharpened, witty response. Tape is rolling. The platform of the Worldwide Leader in Sports awaits.\nBut his reaction is the same now as it has been whenever he received similar \"Here's a flamethrower\" invitations from other outlets and shows. He shakes his head and smiles.\n\"I'm good, man. I've got too much work to do,\" the driver from Florida says to ESPN. \"I don't know what a response to anything said about me is going to do. It would be easy, sure. It would be easy to fire back on Twitter or go on a radio show or podcast and respond to stuff that's been said about me, and I am sure that it would get a big response. A lot of clicks and likes and dislikes and whatever. For a few hours, maybe a day. But the next day, you know what? I would still have the same work to do, and now I'd be a day behind because I spent it doing all of that stuff that doesn't matter. The work matters.\"\nHe smiles again.\n\"The best response is in results, and the only way to achieve results is through hard work.\"\nChastain knows hard work. In fact, he has arrived here for late breakfast having already put in a day's worth of it. There's body work, which he has just done for a couple of hours on the basketball court under the eye of a former college coach. There's racing work, having already conferred with Josh Wise, former NASCAR competitor and USAC champion, who is now a driver development and performance adviser with Team Chevy, walking racers through their physical and mental preparation before each race.\nBy week's end Chastain will have also been coached up by everyone from crew chief Phil Surgen to Olympic speed skating legend Dan Jansen, a longtime Charlotte-area resident, who helps the racer dive even further into his physical and mental shape. All the while he is ingesting all the data he can possibly process from throughout 2023 as well as last year's Roval event, where he finished 37th. That won't be good enough this time around.\n\"It's a lot, but it's all right here,\" he says, thumping the cover of ... a leather-bound notebook? \"I write everything down in here. I'm old-school like that.\"\nRoss Chastain is old-school all the time. That's why he still loves Waffle House.\n\"Waffle House, or sausage, egg and cheese biscuit in the truck, or even a Snickers bar and a soda in the truck. That's breakfast, man,\" he says as he busts the yolk from the white. \"I don't eat this as much as I used to, but I probably still eat it more than I should. I guarantee you my dad and brother still had one of those combos this morning on the way to work.\"\nThat would be down in Punta Gorda, where father Ralph and brother Chad, six years younger, still spend their days farming, managing thousands of acres in South Florida that produce more than 2,000 watermelons per acre. The work is grueling, hot and intense.\nWhen Ralph started putting Ross to work as a kid, the problem was never getting his son to work, it was getting him to slow down. Whenever Ross was behind the wheel of one of the sawed-off school buses used to transport the melons or a tractor rigged to plow or grade land, the kid had his foot in the throttle, seeking to beat whoever was doing the same job a few rows over.\nThe Chastains, eighth-generation watermelon farmers, worked six days a week. On the seventh day, they rested. Ross slowed down only to park in front of the television to watch his hero Jeff Gordon battle rivals on the racetrack, beginning with Dale Earnhardt and Rusty Wallace and then on to the next-gen likes of Busch and Kevin Harvick.\n\"Every step of my ladder wasn't supposed to happen,\" he recalls now. \"When I was 12 and we started, we were just supposed to do some local racing in Florida and nothing else. Then we were like, 'You know what? Let's try the next level, just one race, just so we can say that we did it.' Then that turned into the next step and the next step and all along the way.\"\nThe watermelon industry, enamored with one of its own moving up the NASCAR ladder, started providing some financial help. That has been framed up by Chastain critics as a silver-spoon kid buying rides, but, spoiler alert, bringing sponsorship to help land gigs is the way of the motorsports world.\n\"There are plenty of guys with rich daddies backing up a truckload of cash that keeps the guy in that car even when he's clearly a total disaster,\" explained Stacy Compton, the former Cup Series racer and ESPN analyst, not long after giving Chastain his first ride in the NASCAR Truck Series in 2011, replacing just-departed Justin Marks. \"Then there are the guys who have just enough to get themselves into a car for a race or two and they know if they are bad, the money's going to run out, the ride is going back to the shop and they all disappear forever. That guy, the second guy, you are never going to outwork that guy because he is literally racing for his racing life.\"\nChastain has raced for his racing life for so long that he doesn't know how else to go about it. Since that debut for Compton on July 29, 2011, he has made 493 starts across NASCAR's three national series, and at one point he set the record for most consecutive starts in all of those series to start a single season. It took him 66 tries spread out over nine years to finally earn the first of his four Truck Series wins, 132 tries over five seasons to grab the first of his three Xfinity Series wins and 121 starts spread out over six years before he shocked the world with the first of his three Cup Series wins, on the road course in Austin, Texas, on March 27, 2022.\n\"What people don't see, and this isn't unique to me, but they don't see the fighting to make it, is that you spend your time between those races not working on racing,\" Chastain says, sitting up straight over his untouched toast. \"It's phone calls and sales calls and business meetings. That's what this notebook was full of then. And for every deal you get done, there are 10 times that many that don't. Or deals that do and then, for whatever reason, stuff beyond your control, they fall apart.\"\nThe Smash‚Ñ¢Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/aBJ8e99Wgi\nHe says he felt an indescribable relief in 2021 when new boss Chip Ganassi told him to stop with all of that other stuff and just worry about racing. Then, at midseason, while at a test session, he learned that Ganassi had sold the team to Marks, the racer whose vacancy with Compton had given Chastain his big league break a decade earlier. Newly rebranded Trackhouse Racing was an unknown at best, and even after Chastain had been assured that he would still be with the team, switching from the No. 42 Chevy to the No. 1 in 2022, the arrival of NASCAR's one-size-fits-all Next Gen car was the biggest unknown of them all.\n\"When 2022 started, we knew we had a little bit of an edge and I could feel it as soon as we started unloading for practice at the racetrack every weekend,\" Chastain remembers now of the season when he won not once but twice, including the Hail Melon and his rise through the ranks, to the ire of those who characterized it as reckless. \"I remember feeling this super-intense feeling of, 'Man, you'd better take advantage of this now because you don't know how long this is going to last.' So, yeah, as a driver, I attacked. If there was an opening, I was driving it in there. I was driving like I had better do it now because one day it might all go away. And that's how I felt.\"\nIt's a feeling straight from the farm. Watermelons are harvested only 100 days per year. Anyone who doesn't figure out how to get all they can out of those 100 days will spend the other 265 sifting through the want ads.\n\"This year, as the other teams have caught up to us, you have to change the way you approach the day,\" Chastain says. \"When you don't have the fastest car every week, you can't be in attack mode all the time. You pick your spots. But when you are there, when the chance comes, you can't hesitate. If you do, someone else won't and it's gone.\"\nChastain has only recently been introduced to the term \"imposter syndrome,\" explained to him by his longtime girlfriend, Erika Anne Turner. The official definition, as written by the National Library of Medicine is \"a behavioral health phenomenon described as self-doubt of intellect, skills or accomplishments among high-achieving individuals.\" In other words, a fear of being exposed as a fraud, even among people whose accomplishments are many and indisputable.\nIn the NASCAR garage, a world full of rags-to-riches stories, it is a common refrain and feeling. Richard Childress, a high school dropout who has gone on to win six Cup Series titles as a team owner and made countless millions across multiple industries, speaks of recurring dreams that he is in his office when people rush in and begin taking everything away, telling him the jig is up and he has to go back to being homeless in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Childress says Dale Earnhardt confessed to having the same feelings.\nIt isn't a long psychological walk to understand that anyone who keeps that kind of feeling compartmentalized all the time would, like Chastain, employ every type of coach he can; take every ride he can every weekend, even if it doesn't pay; and spend his own money jetting to driving schools to drive Mazda Miatas around road courses, all in an effort to find the edge that will keep him not even up front but gainfully employed.\n\"I don't have any doubt that I should be here, but yes, there is always that feeling of not being here tomorrow,\" Chastain says in reaction to a discussion about Childress' and Earnhardt's fears. \"I absolutely catch myself looking around on Sundays and thinking, 'Man, I am out here racing with Kevin Harvick! And Denny Hamlin! And Kyle Busch!' I can't believe it. It's the dream, the dream I had as a kid, and you don't want to wake up from it.\"\nThat dream, the one conjured up by the kid racing roofless school buses full of watermelons through the fields of Punta Gorda, did not include being called out publicly by those same drivers, but that's the reality of life as the Melon Man. A student of NASCAR history, he also knows he is in good company. Harvick, Hamlin, Busch, Brad Keselowski and even Gordon, they all spent their formative Cup Series days having to race amid scoldings from their elders and contemporaries. In a way, it's the ultimate compliment, no matter how much it might hurt.\nSometimes, they even turn into actual compliments. Just last week, Hamlin said of Chastain's current NASCAR playoffs effort: \"The dude keeps making chicken salad out of chicken s---, most weeks. I mean, he does. Not saying his car is chicken s---, but where [Trackhouse] is at, he's optimizing his day 95% of the time.\"\nChastain knows it all. He reads it all. He is aware of when he has won over the legends and he is aware of when he has pissed them off. He also knows he is perfectly capable of defending himself. We all do. Just ask Noah Gragson.\nBut don't bother trying to bait him into doing so at the Huntersville Waffle House. There is too much to do.\n\"I can't race any harder or work any harder than I already do,\" he says, throwing his napkin like a syrup-stained surrender flag onto the table. Ross Chastain is officially looking ahead to Sunday, merely the latest chapter in a lifetime of racing do-or-dies. \"But I can race smarter. That work is never done.\""}
{"title": "Who's the player of the year in all 32 women's college basketball conferences?", "date": "2023-10-05 15:51:36", "text": "Caitlin Clark is the clear favorite for the 2023-24 women's college basketball national player of the year. The Iowa guard became a household name last season, winning every major postseason award for which she was eligible. She even transcended women's basketball by taking home the Sullivan Award, given to the year's best amateur athlete.\nBut despite being the preseason front-runner, Clark has plenty of competition.\nPaige Bueckers is back from a season lost to a knee injury, and the UConn guard won most of the national player of the year honors when she and Clark were freshmen in 2020-21. LSU's Angel Reese also returns after outdueling Clark for a national championship and the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player in April.\nCameron Brink of Stanford and Elizabeth Kitley of Virginia Tech are two post players who have both played in the Final Four and can dominate, just in a different fashion than Clark.\nAll these players will be among the favorites to win player of the year in their respective leagues. But they aren't the only ones. It's time to break down the prospective winners in all 32 conferences.\nSome are fifth- and sixth-year seniors looking for one more season of success. Others are young players about to make their mark, or transfers from big-name schools looking to renew their careers at mid-majors. All will have a chance to pick up some hardware at season's end.\nNavigate to each league:\nAmerican | America East |  ACC |  Atlantic Sun | A-10 | Big 12 |  Big East |  Big Sky |  Big South |  Big Ten |  Big West |  CAA |  C-USA |  Horizon | Ivy | MAAC |  MAC |  MEAC |  MVC |  MW |  NEC |  OVC |  Pac-12 |  Patriot  |  SEC |  SoCon |  Southland |  SWAC |  Summit  |  Sun Belt |  WCC |  WAC\n\n \nDanae McNeal, 6-0, G, East Carolina Pirates\nAfter being named AAC Defensive Player of the Year, Most Improved Player and first-team all-conference, the big prize is about the only honor left for McNeal to win as she enters her fifth season. McNeal's scoring average jumped from 8.4 PPG to 17.4 PPG, which was good for second in the league. She also ranked eighth in the country with 97 steals for the AAC tournament champs.\nTop competition: Sammie Puisis, 6-1, G, South Florida Bulls\nThe Bulls' top returning scorer at 15.6 PPG, Puisis also led the AAC in 3-point shooting percentage (38.7%).\n \nAdrianna Smith, 6-0, F, Maine Black Bears\nWith teammate and 2022 conference POY Anne Simon sidelined for much of last season with injuries, Smith came out of nowhere to win the award in 2023. Smith jumped from 2.1 points and 2.0 rebounds per game as a freshman to a league-leading 18.0 PPG and 9.5 RPG last year. Her 23.5 PPG and 10.3 RPG in conference games marked the first time since 1994 that an America East player averaged over 20 points and 10 rebounds.\nTop competition: Emma Utterback, 5-8, G, Vermont Catamounts\nThe America East leader in assists, Utterback is a big reason why the Catamounts had their best season in 13 years.\n \nElizabeth Kitley, 6-4, C, Virginia Tech Hokies\nAstonishingly consistent over the past three seasons, Kitley is the reigning two-time conference player of the year. Adding the honor this year would mean joining Alana Beard and Alyssa Thomas as the only three-time winners. Kitley has averaged 18.1, 18.2 and 18.2 points and 10.4, 9.8 and 10.7 rebounds per game the past three seasons all while shooting between 53.1% and 55.8% from the field.\nTop competition: Olivia Miles, 5-10, G, Notre Dame Fighting Irish\nMuch of Miles' All-American potential and Notre Dame's fate this season hinges on her recovery from a knee injury suffered late last season. It doesn't appear she will start the season on the court, but when she gets to a 100%, Miles might be the best passing point guard in the country.\n \nAntwainette Walker, 5-11, G, Eastern Kentucky Colonels\nAfter one season at Little Rock and two more at Marquette, Walker settled into EKU, earning ASUN Newcomer of the Year and first-team all-conference. She led the league in scoring (21.0 PPG) and steals (2.4 SPG) and was second in rebounding (9.4 RPG).\nTop competition: Ajulu Thatha, 6-1, F, Florida Gulf Coast Eagles\nA grad transfer from SIU Edwardsville, Thatha earned all-OVC honors with 13.7 points and a league-leading 9.7 rebounds per game. She will play her fifth year with the Eagles, looking to be the best player on the A-SUN's best team.\n \nMaye Toure, 6-1, F, Rhode Island Rams\nA summer of international basketball a year ago for the France native propelled her from a little-used player on Rhode Island's bench to the Rams' best player. She led the A-10 regular-season co-champs in scoring (13.8 PPG) and rebounding (8.2 RPG). An outstanding athlete and tireless worker, Toure might be ready to be the conference's best player.\nTop competition: Kyla McMakin, 5-11, G, Saint Louis Billikens\nIn her four collegiate seasons (including three at Longwood), McMakin has never averaged fewer than 17.2 points per game. Her 27 points against UMass in the A-10 title game propelled the Billikens to their first conference tournament championship.\n \nPaige Bueckers, 5-11, G, UConn Huskies\nIt feels so long ago that Bueckers was the best player in college basketball, but it was only 2020-21 that she took home every national player of the year. Injuries cost her much of 2021-22 and all of last season. But she showed her ability to bounce back when her recovery two years ago led to Huskies run to the national championship game. That included a Bridgeport Regional MOP and a Final Four all-tournament selection for Bueckers. Completely healthy, Bueckers will be back in the running for national honors again.\nTop competition: Aaliyah Edwards, 6-3, F, UConn Huskies\nUConn guard Azzi Fudd could be thrown into the mix here as well, with the Huskies expected to dominate the Big East if they stay healthy. Edwards is the one UConn star who has been healthy throughout her career, and she blossomed last season as one of the best frontcourt players in the country. She led the Huskies with 16.6 points per game and the Big East with a 58.9 field goal percentage.\n \nJamie Loera, 5-9, G, Eastern Washington Eagles\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n‚Ä¢ Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ NBA training camp cheat sheets ¬ª\n More ESPN+ content ¬ª\nAfter three seasons with minimal playing time at Arizona State, Loera joined the Eagles and became the Big Sky's Defensive Player of the Year (2.6 SPG). She also ranked third in the conference in assists (5.1 APG) and scored 11.4 points per game.\nTop competition: Carmen Gfeller, 6-1, F, Montana Lady Griz\nAn all-conference honoree in each of the last three seasons, Gfeller led the Lady Griz in scoring (14.2 PPG) and emerged as one of the Big Sky's best shooters.\n \nLauren Bevis, 5-5, G, High Point Panthers\nSecond in the POY voting last year with Gardner-Webb, Bevis brings 15.4 points per game and 40.9% 3-point shooting to the Panthers for her bonus season.\nTop competition: Christabel Ezumah, 6-2, F, Campbell Fighting Camels\nBlossoming as a junior, Ezumah was named first-team all-Big South while setting career highs with 10.3 PPG and 9.3 RPG.\n \nRori Harmon, 5-6, G, Texas Longhorns\nOne of the best defensive players in the country regardless of position, Harmon is the glue that kept the Longhorns together on their way to a share of the Big 12 regular-season title. Her 7.4 assists per game were a program record, and she and Caitlin Clark were the only players in the country last season to average over 11 points, seven assists and five rebounds.\nTop competition: Darianna Littlepage-Buggs, 6-1, F, Baylor Bears\nA potential breakout star as a sophomore, Littlepage-Buggs was one of the best freshmen in the country last season. She was a unanimous choice as the top rookie in the Big 12. With the Bears now fully separated from the Kim Mulkey era, Littlepage-Buggs might be the face of the program.\n \nCaitlin Clark, 6-0, G, Iowa Hawkeyes\nThe Big Ten has a host of good players, but Clark as Big Ten Player of the Year might be the easiest prediction of the 32. There is no more dynamic scorer in the game, and she has also led the country in assists two years running. Her shooting range is incomparable, and no player elicits more excitement. Clark's career averages of 27.2 points, 7.9 assists and 7.0 rebounds are staggering.\nTop competition: Mackenzie Holmes 6-3, F, Indiana Hoosiers\nIn most leagues, in most years, Holmes would be a heavy favorite to be a conference player of the year. Clark makes that nearly impossible in the Big Ten. Holmes, whose decision to stay for a fifth year keeps Indiana among the best teams in the country, was the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year and a first-team All-American.\n \nLily Wahinekapu, 5-7, G, Hawaii Rainbow Wahine\nIn two seasons Wahinekapu has been the Big West Freshman of the Year at Cal State Fullerton and a first-team all-conference team selection at Hawaii. She led the Rainbow Wahine in points (12.9 PPG), assists (2.9 APG), steals (1.7 SPG), minutes (32.2 MPG), 3-point percentage (33.1%) and free throws.\nTop competition: Evanne Turner, 5-9, G, UC Davis Aggies\nThe Aggies' all-time leading 3-point shooter, Turner led the Big West in scoring last season at 15.1 PPG.\n \nKylie Kornegay-Lucas, 5-10, G, Towson Tigers\nAfter leaving Virginia, Kornegay-Lucas has been the CAA Sixth Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year. Her offense was on display last season as well, leading the Tigers in scoring (14.0 PPG), rebounding (7.3 RPG) and assists (4.0 PPG).\nTop competition: Jada Logan, 5-9, G, Charleston Cougars\nIn her first season with the Cougars, Logan was second in the CAA in scoring (18.0 PPG) and recorded the second triple-double in program history.\n \nSavannah Wheeler, 5-6, G, Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders\nWheeler was the top scorer (15.1 PPG) on a Blue Raiders' team that set the CUSA record for most league wins (18). She also led the Blue Raiders in assists.\nTop competition: Destiny Salary, 6-0, G, Western Kentucky Lady Toppers\nA former four-star recruit, Salary played the last two seasons at Ole Miss and now has a great opportunity with the Lady Toppers.\n \nDestiny Leo, 5-10, G, Cleveland State Vikings\nPrimed to be one of the best players in Horizon League history, Leo will be attempting to defend her 2023 Player of the Year trophy. For the second straight season, Leo led the league in scoring (17.9 PPG) and was among the country's best free throw shooters (91.1%).\nTop competition: Brooke Quarles-Daniels, 5-7, G, Oakland Golden Grizzlies\nOne of the most decorated recruits in Oakland history, Quarles-Daniels was the Horizon's best freshman a year ago and led the Golden Grizzlies with 12.1 points and 3.1 assists per game.\n \nAbbey Hsu, 5-11, G, Columbia Lions\nOne of the most prolific shooters in the country, Hsu set the Ivy single-season record for 3-pointers and ranked second in the country with 3.3 treys made per game. Her 17.8 points per game led the league -- and she could be even better after spending the summer competing with Team USA at the AmeriCup in Mexico.\nTop competition: Kaitlyn Chen, 5-9 G, Princeton Tigers\nLast season's winner and the Ivy League tournament Most Outstanding Player each of the last two years, Chen remains the leader on the Ivy League's best team.\n \nAaliyah Parker, 5-9, G, Niagara Purple Eagles\nThe only underclassman on the all-MAC first-team, Parker led the conference is scoring (16.9 PPG) and ranked second in the country with 3.4 steals per game. That all helped the Purple Eagles to the postseason as a Division I program for the first time in their history.\nTop competition: Anajah Brown, 6-1, F, Siena Saints\nIf the Saints are to challenge for their first regular-season title since 2004, Brown, coming off a third-team all-MAAC season, will have to be one of the conference's best players.\n \nQuinesha Lockett, 5-10, G, Toledo Rockets\nWith one of the best three-year runs in program history, Lockett will be on every national mid-major player of the year list. She was voted the Mid-American's best player a year ago after averaging 17.9 points, 4.9 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 1.2 steals per game.\nTop competition: Reagan Bass, 6-1, F, Akron Zips\nThe only underclassman to make the all-conference first team, Bass ranked in the top 10 in scoring (17.1 PPG), rebounding (7.7 RPG), field goal percentage (51.3%) and blocks (1.1 BPG).\n \nDiamond Johnson, 5-5, G, Norfolk State Spartans\nFew players in the MEAC have ever had the r√©sum√© of Johnson. After an all-Big Ten freshman team season at Rutgers, Johnson was the ACC's Sixth Player of the Year in 2022 and NC State's leading scorer (12.3 PPG) last season. Her presence makes the Spartans a heavy favorite for a third consecutive regular-season title.\nTop competition: Destiny Howell, 6-0, G, Howard Bison\nLast year's winner, Howell led the MEAC in scoring (16.8 PPG) and 3-point field goal percentage (35.6%).\n \nKatelyn Young, 6-1, F, Murray State Racers\nHad the Racers been more successful last season (8th place in the MVC), Young might be going for a POY three-peat. She won it in the OVC in 2022 and then led the MVC in scoring (20.1 PPG) and rebounding (8.1 RPG) a year ago. According to HerHoopStats' advance metrics, she was 12th in the country in offensive win shares.\nTop competition: Grace Boffeli, 6-1, F, Northern Iowa Panthers\nIf UNI is going to win its first MVC title since 2016, Boffeli will need to have a big year. Duplicating last year's 16.1 PPG, 9.2 RPG and 55.3% shooting from the field would qualify.\n \nDesi-Rae Young, 6-1, C, UNLV Lady Rebels\nYoung won MWC Player of the Year in 2022 and then had an even better season last year but lost out to Colorado State's McKenna Hofschild. The award is Young's to lose this time around. The Lady Rebels have been the dominant team in the MWC for consecutive seasons, and Young is a big reason why. Last year she led the league in rebounding (10.2 RPG) and was second in points per game (17.8) and field goal percentage (59.4%).\nTop competition: Allyson Fertig, 6-4, C, Wyoming Cowgirls\nThe two best players in the MWC might be centers, a rarity in the modern game, but it was Fertig (13.6 PPG, 8.7 RPG, 59.6 FG%) who elevated the Cowgirls to second place in the conference and a WNIT berth.\n \nNy'Ceara Pryor, 5-3, G, Sacred Heart Pioneers\nNo freshman dominated her league the way Pryor did in the NEC. She led the conference in scoring (17.7 PPG), assists (4.3 APG) and steals (3.7 SPG) and became the first in league history to win player of the year, freshman of the year and defensive player of the year in the same season.\nTop competition: Jayme DeCesare, 5-5, G, Merrimack Warriors\nMerrimack enjoyed its best season since moving to Division I in 2019-2020. DeCesare was a big part of it with 10.2 points and 3.5 rebounds per game and a first-team all-league nod.\n \nSharnecce Currie-Jelks, 6-2, F, UT Martin Skyhawks\nExpect the Skyhawks to be back near the top of the OVC like they were in 2020 and 2021 -- and expect Currie-Jelks to lead them. Last season's OVC Freshman of the Year was second in scoring (15.2 PPG), fifth in rebounding (6.9 RPG) and first in field goal percentage (53.9%).\nTop competition: Macy McGlone, 6-3, F, Eastern Illinois Panthers\nWith the graduation of Lariah Washington, expect even more opportunity for the Panthers' second-leading scorer and the OVC's top returning rebounder.\n \nCameron Brink, 6-4, F, Stanford Cardinal\nAs last season wore on it became clear that Brink was Stanford's best player. That will be the case from day one this year, when she will be the No. 1 option for the Cardinal every trip up the floor. She set career highs in points, rebounds and assists in 2022-23, but most notable were her 3.5 blocks per game. Those solidified her status as one of the best defensive players in the country.\nTop competition: Alissa Pili, 6-2, F, Utah Utes\nLast year's winner, Pili led the conference in scoring (20.7 PPG) and field goal percentage (59.0%). In her first year with the Utes after transferring from USC, Pili transformed the Utes into an elite program, earning their highest NCAA tournament seed ever (No. 2).\n \nLex Therien, 6-1, F, Loyola Maryland Greyhounds\nHer team's improvement from a 4-14 league mark might be necessary for Therien's candidacy, but she has done plenty on her own, averaging a double-double in each of her first two seasons.\nTop competition: Caitlin Weimar, 6-4, F, Boston University Terriers\nVoted the league's best defensive player last season, Weimar was also BU's leading scorer (15.5 PPG) and rebounder (10.0 RPG).\n \nRickea Jackson, 6-2, F, Tennessee Lady Vols\nDespite a four-year career in the SEC that has seen her average 17.4 points per game over time with both Mississippi State and the Lady Vols, Jackson hasn't received as much attention as some other conference stars. That might change this season. Her game grew more efficient in her first season in Knoxville. Jackson's 54.8 field goal percentage was a career best, and her 19.2 PPG ranked third in the conference.\nTop competition: Angel Reese, 6-3, F, LSU Tigers\nWith the arrivals of Hailey Van Lith and Aneesah Morrow to LSU, Reese's numbers that were so eye-popping a year ago (23.0 PPG, 15.4 RPG) might take a hit, but she still easily qualifies as one of the best players in the SEC and in the country.\n \nRachel Rose, 5-7, G, Wofford Terriers\nOn Rose's shoulders, the Terriers won their first conference championship in 2023. She led the team in nearly every offensive statistical category, and the conference coaches selected the sophomore as the player of the year. Another season like that and Rose will probably win over the media, too.\nTop competition: Raven Thompson, 5-10, F, Chattanooga Mocs\nThompson's 19-point, nine-rebound performance in the SoCon tournament title game prevented Wofford from reaching its first NCAA tournament. That earned her tournament Most Outstanding Player after she had already won SoCon Freshman of the Year.\n \nAlecia Westbrook, 6-1, F, Texas A&M-Corpus Christi Islanders\nLast season's winner, Westbrook has averaged a double-double and won the SLC's Defensive Player of the Year in consecutive years. As the Islanders' leading scorer and the league's leading rebounder, Westbrook helped Texas A&M-CC win its first conference championship in 2023 (shared with SE Louisiana).\nTop competition: Akasha Davis, 6-2, F, Lamar Cardinals\nDavis followed up a freshman of the year campaign by finishing second in the league in scoring (14.6 PPG) and rebounding (8.8 RPG) and first in field goal percentage (61.4%) as a sophomore.\n \nKacie Borowicz, 5-7, G, North Dakota Fighting Hawks\nThe Summit League's leading scorer each of the last two seasons, Borowicz decided to come back for her bonus year for a three-peat. Borowicz also topped the Summit in assists last season and has been one of the country's best free throw shooters in her four years in Grand Forks.\nTop competition: Hannah Cooper, 5-7, G, Oral Roberts Golden Eagles\nCooper went from 6.5 points per game in 2021-22 to 20.3 last year, good for second in the league to Borowicz. She topped the Summit in steals (2.5 SPG) and minutes (36.9 MPG).\n \nDomonique Davis, 5-6, G, Southern Miss Lady Eagles\nDespite a drop-off in her 3-point shooting, Davis set a career-high in scoring (17.2 PPG), helping the Lady Eagles to a three-way tie for first place, their first regular-season conference championship in 29 years.\nTop competition: Terren Ward, 5-11, G, Georgia Southern Eagles\nOne year after winning Sun Belt Sixth Player of the Year, Ward increased her scoring and rebounding, leading the conference at 18.4 points per game.\n \nTi'lan Boler, 6-1, G, Jackson State Lady Tigers\nThe most versatile player on the league's best team, Boler was especially good down the stretch, scoring in double figures in five of the season's final six games as the Lady Tigers won their third consecutive SWAC regular-season title.\nTop competition: Chanel Wilson, 5-7, F, Bethune-Cookman Wildcats\nAfter getting minimal playing time in two years at Indiana, Wilson transferred to Bethune-Cookman and was the SWAC Newcomer of the Year.\n \nTrinity San Antonio, 5-10, G, Grand Canyon Lopes\nSan Antonio's decision to transfer from Cal Baptist to Grand Canyon could shift the fate of the two programs fighting for a WAC title in 2023-24. San Antonio was a first-team all-WAC selection after filling the stat sheet with 14.1 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 3.7 APG and 2.3 SPG.\nTop competition: Breaunna Gillen, 5-9, G, Utah Tech Trailblazers\nGillen enters her fifth season in St. George as the Trailblazers' all-time assist leader. She was the league leader at 6.5 APG a year ago and finished second in scoring (17.8 PPG).\n \nYvonne Ejim, 6-1, F, Gonzaga Bulldogs\nBecoming a full-time starter for the first-time last season, Ejim led the defending regular-season champs in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage and blocked shots, and was a finalist for the Becky Hammon Mid-Major Player of the Year award.\nTop competition: Kaylynne Truong, 5-8, G, Gonzaga Bulldogs\nEjim's biggest challengers are likely to come from her own team. Truong was last year's winner after scoring 15.8 points per game and leading the WCC with 5.0 assists per game."}
{"title": "The offseason in five minutes: Everything you need to know", "date": "2023-10-05 15:51:36", "text": "The 2022-23 season ended with the most-viewed women's college basketball game on record as the national championship returned to network television for the first time since 1995. Broadcast on ABC and ESPN2, 9.9 million viewers tuned in as LSU beat Iowa 102-85.\nWhat has happened since then? Glad you asked.\nWe head into 2023-24 with LSU ranked No. 1 in ESPN's Way-Too-Early Top 25. For the second straight offseason, coach Kim Mulkey cleaned up in the transfer portal to make the Tigers -- who have Final Four Most Outstanding Player Angel Reese back -- the favorites on the road to Cleveland, where the national semifinals and title game will be played April 5-7 at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.\nDespite big personnel losses, led by WNBA Rookie of the Year Aliyah Boston, South Carolina -- which spent all last season at No. 1 before losing in the Final Four -- will still be in the hunt. With Paige Bueckers, who missed last season because of an ACL injury, and Azzi Fudd, who was limited to 15 games by knee issues, back and healthy, UConn is another front-runner as the Huskies pursue a 12th national championship.\nBut while some things remain the same ... along comes conference realignment. Stanford seeks one more Pac-12 title before the conference as we know it dissolves. Stanford's next stop, incongruous as this is, is the ACC. UCLA, expected to be Stanford's biggest Pac-12 challenger, is headed to the Big Ten next season. But more on that in a minute.\nIowa senior Caitlin Clark, the NCAA tournament supernova and reigning national player of the year, is back -- maybe for more than this season. Clark's incoming freshman class of 2020-21 is the last that can use the COVID-19 waiver to return for a fifth year, so WNBA teams likely will have to wait until the end of the college season to find out exactly which players -- such as Bueckers, Clark, Reese and Stanford's Cameron Brink -- are in the draft pool and potential lottery picks.\nBut before we tip off the new season on Nov. 6, ESPN's Michael Voepel, Alexa Philippou and Charlie Creme look at what has gone on since LSU hoisted the NCAA trophy, and how it impacts the coming season.\n\nJump to:\nHeadlines | Key transfers, coaching news, recruits | Bracketology risers and fallers\nOn \"The Paul Finebaum Show,\" Carolyn Peck explains why the talented Gamecocks and a gritty Tennessee will be stiff competition for the reigning national champs.\nLSU gets even better\nThe transfer portal has been kind of like free agency in college, and more than 1,000 players entered the portal this past offseason. LSU bringing in Hailey Van Lith from Louisville and Aneesah Morrow from DePaul gave the Tigers the \"portal championship\" a year after they did the same with Reese from Maryland in summer 2022. More on the other biggest transfers below.\nUConn back to full strength?\nWhile UConn's absurd streak of 14 consecutive Final Four appearances came to an end, the Huskies seem due for better luck after two seasons of multiple injuries.\nBueckers was national player of the year as a freshman and then battled through injuries to get UConn to the NCAA championship game as a sophomore. The Huskies missed her last season, but she seems to have gone through rehab well, is cleared to play and is ready to regain her status as one of the college game's biggest stars.\nSo long, Pac-12\nWe should have seen it coming when UCLA and USC announced in summer 2022 that they were headed to the Big Ten. The Pac-12 was crumbling, with the walls officially tumbling in summer 2023. With four teams headed to the Big Ten, four to the Big 12, two to the ACC and two others with an uncertain future, the Pac-12's swan song in 2023-24 is an ode to how football and television revenue have rendered geographic ties in college almost irrelevant.\nWell-played, Big 12\nIn summer 2010, the Big 12 appeared on the verge of collapse. It survived with 10 teams, and now will be adding Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado and Utah next season, putting the league at 16 teams after Texas and Oklahoma depart for the SEC. From a women's hoops perspective, the league will miss the Longhorns and Sooners, but the Utes (No. 5 in ESPN rankings) and Buffaloes (No. 22) are having program resurgences. And Arizona is just a few years removed from its appearance in the 2021 NCAA final.\n\nKa-ching!\nThe college world has changed with Name, Image and Likeness opportunities, especially for the bigger stars in women's sports. Players such as Reese and Clark have spent time since the national championship game shooting television commercials and being paid for appearing at events. -- Voepel\nCheck out highlights from No. 1 recruit Lauren Betts as she announces her intention to transfer from Stanford.\nAny discussion of the biggest player and coach news this offseason must start with LSU. Not only did Mulkey get the two best players in the transfer portal, she signed the No. 1 recruiting class, including two -- Mikaylah Williams and Aalyah Del Rosario -- of the top seven players in the 2023 class. Then early last month, the four-time national championship coach got a 10-year, $36 million contract extension, making her the highest paid coach in women's basketball.\nOut west, meanwhile, Lauren Betts' decision to leave Stanford for UCLA could signal a power shift in the Pac-12. The 6-foot-7 center was the top recruit in 2022 (and No. 3 in our transfer rankings) and had a promising showing for Team USA at the AmeriCup.\nAside from LSU, a handful of SEC schools did everything they could to keep up in the transfer portal:\nTennessee, seeking its first Final Four since 2008, when the Lady Vols won their eighth title, added a new backcourt. Destinee Wells (Belmont) and Jewel Spear (Wake Forest) are two scoring guards, something the Lady Vols have lacked in recent years.\nOle Miss brought in three new starters, and coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin didn't even need that many. Fresh off their first Sweet 16 since 2007, the Rebels have Kennedy Todd-Williams (North Carolina), KK Deans (Florida) and Kharyssa Richardson (Auburn) on what is now a deep and versatile roster.\nJoni Taylor joins \"The Paul Finebaum Show\" and reflects on Texas A&M's expectations, while emphasizing the spirit of coaching among the best in the SEC.\nOutside the SEC, TCU underwent the biggest shake-up from the end of the regular season until now. Of the more than four dozen Division I coaching changes this offseason, Mark Campbell from Sacramento State to the Horned Frogs has had the biggest impact so far.\nAfter seven years as an assistant at Oregon in which he spearheaded the recruitment of Sabrina Ionescu, Ruthy Hebard and Satou Sabally, and then two seasons with Hornets, which included the program's only NCAA tournament appearance, Campbell has already reformed TCU without even coaching a game. He plucked Jaden Owens (Baylor), Madison Conner (Arizona), Agnes Emma-Nnopu (Stanford) and Sedona Prince (Oregon) out of the portal, significantly improving a roster that went 1-17 in the Big 12 a year ago. -- Creme\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n‚Ä¢ Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ NBA training camp cheat sheets ¬ª\n More ESPN+ content ¬ª\nAfter South Carolina's Boston, Laeticia Amihere, Zia Cooke, Brea Beal and Victaria Saxton were all selected in the 2023 WNBA draft, a changing of the guard is headed to Columbia this fall. Dawn Staley has plenty of reinforcements ready to take the mantle, such as center Kamilla Cardoso and point guard Raven Johnson, but she also brings in the nation's No. 2-ranked recruiting class and was active in the transfer portal, signing Te-Hina Paopao from Oregon as well as Sakima Walker, the 2023 NJCAA player of the year.\n\nIn the Pac-12, USC returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2014 and will look for its first appearance in the Associated Press preseason poll since 2011. Now the legendary program adds No. 1 overall recruit Juju Watkins and several experienced players from the portal. It is unclear if/when Aaliyah Gayles will make her college debut after recovering from being shot 10 times at a party in April 2022, but social media indicates she has been practicing. -- Philippou\nHow different did our projections look between our April 18 update shortly after LSU hoisted the NCAA trophy to our latest field of 68 on Sept. 19? These were the biggest women's Bracketology movers.\nBiggest riser: TCU\nNR to No. 41/projected Last Four Byes\nAs mentioned above, Campbell has reshaped the Horned Frogs into a veteran, NCAA tournament-worthy team. Once he finished all his work in the transfer portal, TCU was a No. 11 seed in last month's projection.\nOther risers\nMississippi State: No. 37/projected Last Four Byes to No. 21/projected No. 6 seed\nAfter two wins in the NCAA tournament, the Bulldogs upgraded their talent, too. Lauren Park-Lane (Seton Hall), Darrione Rogers (DePaul) and Erynn Barnum (Arkansas) will give the offense more punch. The Bulldogs were already a tournament team, but Sam Purcell pushed his Bulldogs more safely into the field.\nTexas A&M: No. 44/projected Last Four In to No. 28/projected No. 7 seed\nThe Aggies were too young a year ago and finished 9-20. So Joni Taylor made it a priority to bring in some experience. Graduate student Endyia Rogers (Oregon), senior Aicha Coulibaly (Auburn) and redshirt junior Lauren Ware (Arizona) give Taylor some veterans to put around ultra-talented sophomore Janiah Barker.\nBiggest faller: Arkansas\nFrom No. 26/projected No. 7 seed to No. 44/projected Last Four In\nWhen Barnum left the Razorbacks for Mississippi State, she helped elevate the Bulldogs and left Arkansas without a proven go-to scorer.\nOther fallers\nNC State: From No. 25/projected No. 7 seed to No. 33/projected No. 9 seed\nThe Wolfpack got passed by a few teams because of portal inactivity. After losing Jakia Brown-Turner to Maryland, NC State didn't add anyone of impact. -- Creme"}

Zach Edey and other elite big men decided against turning pro and returned for another year. Some of the top stars changed locations (see: Hunter Dickinson to Kansas). Coaches, too. Ed Cooley is at Georgetown now. Micah Shrewsberry is at Notre Dame.\nAll of that and we haven't even discussed the nearly 2,000 players who entered the transfer portal.\nThe change and volatility have made it even more difficult to project who will win conference player of the year honors in each of the 32 Division I men's leagues. But we'll give it a shot.\nSome of the candidates were easy to pick. (The Big South could probably give Drew Pember his second consecutive player of the year honor today if it wanted to.) Others were more difficult to identify.\nBut we're excited to see how it all plays out and how accurate we are at the end of the season.\nHere are our preseason predictions for player of the year in each league -- and the top competition they'll have to beat.\nJump to each conference:\nAmerican | America East |  ACC |  ASUN | A-10| Big 12 |  Big East |  Big Sky |  Big South |  Big Ten |  Big West |  CAA |  C-USA |  Horizon | Ivy | MAAC |  MAC |  MEAC |  MVC |  MW |  NEC |  OVC |  Pac-12 |  Patriot  |  SEC |  SoCon |  Southland |  SWAC |  Summit  |  Sun Belt |  WCC |  WAC\n \nAlijah Martin | 6-2 | G | Florida Atlantic Owls\nAfter averaging 15.2 PPG during FAU's run to the Final Four last season, Martin is back to lead the Owls in their first season in the AAC.\nTop competition: Jordan Brown, Memphis Tigers (19.3 PPG, 8.6 RPG, 1.2 BPG at Louisiana)\n \nClarence O. Daniels II | 6-foot-6 | F | New Hampshire Wildcats\nAlthough he had multiple suitors after entering the transfer portal this summer, Daniels (15.3 PPG, 10.7 RPG) decided to return to New Hampshire. The 2022-23 America East all-conference first-teamer will play under new coach Nathan Davis this season.\nTop competition: Earl Timberlake, Bryant Bulldogs (13.8 PPG, 8.4 RPG)\n \nArmando Bacot | 6-11 | F | North Carolina Tar Heels\nAlthough the Heels failed to make the NCAA tournament despite entering the 2022-23 season as the No. 1 team in America, Bacot (15.9 PPG, 10.4 RPG) undeniably is one of the top returning players in the country.\nTop competition: Kyle Filipowski, Duke Blue Devils (15.1 PPG, 9.0 RPG)\n \nDemarcus Sharp | 6-3 | G | Austin Peay Governors\nLast season's Southland Player of the Year (19.5 PPG, 5.0 RPG, 5.0 APG at Northwestern State now bring his talents to Austin Peay, where he'll try to reenergize a program that finished 9-22 in 2022-23.\nTop competition: Devontae Blanton, Eastern Kentucky Colonels (16.9 PPG, 37% from the 3-point line)\n \nDaRon Holmes II | 6-10 | F | Dayton Flyers\nA year after securing all-Atlantic 10 first-team honors, Holmes (18.4 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 1.9 BPG) hopes to lead Dayton to its first NCAA tournament since 2017.\nTop competition: James Bishop IV, George Washington Revolutionaries (21.6 PPG, 5.2 APG)\n \nTyler Kolek | 6-3 | G | Marquette Golden Eagles\nA thumb injury hindered the reigning Big East player of the year in the 2023 NCAA tournament, but Kolek (12.9 PPG, 7.5 APG, 40% from 3) is back to help Marquette chase its first Final Four appearance since 2003.\nTop competition: Ryan Kalkbrenner, Creighton Bluejays (15.9 PPG, 6.1 RPG, 2.1 BPG)\n \nDillon Jones | 6-6 | G | Weber State Wildcats\nThe all-Big Sky first-teamer last season (16.7 PPG, 10.9 RPG) tested the NBA draft waters and even had a strong showing at the G League Elite Camp and NBA draft combine -- but ultimately chose to return to Weber State, where he aims to lead the program to its first NCAA tournament appearance since 2016.\nTop competition: Aanen Moody, Montana Grizzlies (16.1 PPG, 41% from beyond the arc)\n \nDrew Pember | 6-11 | C | UNC Asheville Bulldogs\nThe reigning Big South Player of the Year (21.0 PPG, 9.2 RPG, 38% from 3) returns to anchor a team that hopes to hit the trifecta again with another league championship, conference tournament title and NCAA tournament appearance.\nTop competition: DaQuan Smith, Radford Highlanders (13.9 PPG, 40% from 3)\n \nHunter Dickinson | 7-1 | C | Kansas Jayhawks\nKansas will follow Dickinson (18.5 PPG, 9.0 RPG, 1.8 BPG), an all-Big Ten second-teamer in 2022-23 and the most coveted prospect in the transfer portal this offseason, as it attempts to win its second national championship in three seasons.\nTop competition: Max Abmas, Texas Longhorns (21.9 PPG, 37% from beyond the arc at Oral Roberts)\n \nZach Edey | 7-4 | C | Purdue Boilermakers\nWith another stellar performance, Edey (22.3 PPG, 12.9 RPG, 2.1 BPG) could become the first player to win the Wooden Award in consecutive years since Ralph Sampson pulled off the feat 40 years ago. He could also help erase the memory of that first-round loss to Fairleigh Dickinson with a deep run in the NCAA tournament.\nTop competition: Terrence Shannon Jr., Illinois Fighting Illini (17.2 PPG, 4.6 RPG)\n \nAjay Mitchell | 6-4 | G | UC Santa Barbara Gauchos\nMitchell (16.3 PPG, 5.1 APG), who led the Gauchos to a conference tournament crown and NCAA tournament appearance last season, will chase his second consecutive Big West Player of the Year award.\nTop competition: Elijah Pepper, UC Davis Aggies (22.5 PPG, 5.9 RPG)\n \nTyler Thomas | 6-3 | G | Hofstra Pride\nThe all-CAA second-teamer last season (16.5 PPG, 41% from 3) has one goal: to carry Hofstra to its first NCAA tournament appearance (the school won the CAA title in 2020 and would have played had the NCAA tournament not been canceled due to COVID-19) since 2001.\nTop competition: Charles Thompson, Towson Tigers (12.2 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 1.7 BPG)\n \nDontaie Allen | 6-6 | G | Western Kentucky Hilltoppers\nIn February and March, the former Kentucky guard began to hit his stride, seeing four games with 17 points or more. That momentum could propel Allen (9.3 PPG, 38% from the 3-point line) to new heights under new head coach Steve Lutz.\nTop competition: Kyle Rode, Liberty Flames (10.9 PPG, 40% from the 3-point line)\n \nBJ Freeman | 6-6 | G | Milwaukee Panthers\nFreeman showed his promise with a 43-point performance in a win over Stetson in last season's CBI. The guard, who averaged 18.22 PPG, could now help lead a program that's on an upward trajectory (22-12, 14-6 league) to its first NCAA tournament appearance in a decade.\nTop competition: Marques Warrick, Northern Kentucky Norse (18.8 PPG, 38% from the 3-point line)\n \nMatt Knowling | 6-5 | F | Yale Bulldogs\nThe all-Ivy League first-teamer (13.6 PPG) headlines a squad of key returners who were instrumental in winning the regular-season title. They missed out on the 2023 NCAA tournament following a nine-point loss to rival Princeton in the conference tournament championship.\nTop competition: Matt Allocco, Princeton Tigers (10.7 PPG, 38.3% from beyond the arc)\n \nMervin James | 6-7 | F | Rider Broncs\nThe all-MAAC second-teamer led Rider to a 13-7 record last season (second place in the league). Couple that with the departure of Rick Pitino and the exodus of transfers out of Iona, and the door is open for James and the Broncs to win top MAAC honors.\nTop competition: Dakota Leffew, Mount St. Mary's Mountaineers (13.1 PPG, 38% from beyond the arc)\n \nEnrique Freeman | 6-7 | C | Akron Zips\nAn all-MAC first-teamer last season, Freeman (16.8 PPG, 11.2 RPG, 1.2 BPG) anchors an Akron squad that could conquer the league and win the regular-season crown for the first time since 2020.\nTop competition: Jaylin Hunter, Ohio Bobcats (13.2 PPG, 41% from 3)\n \nShy Odom | 6-6 | F | Howard Bison\nThe buzz around Odom's MEAC Player of the Year potential in 2023-24 increased when he led notched 15 points (5-for-9) and eight rebounds in the 16-seed's 96-68 loss to 1-seed Kansas in the first round of last year's NCAA tournament.\nTop competition: Martaz Robinson, Delaware State Hornets (11.8 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 1.5 SPG)\n \nTucker DeVries | 6-7 | F | Drake Bulldogs\nIt would be difficult to topple the reigning MVC player of the year, who returns after averaging 18.6 PPG (37% from the 3-point line) and leading his team to the NCAA tournament.\nTop competition: Bowen Born, Northern Iowa Panthers (17.9 PPG, 37% from 3)\n \nJamal Mashburn Jr. | 6-2 | G | New Mexico Lobos\nThe son of former NBA and Kentucky star Jamal Mashburn Sr. is a potent scorer (19.1 PPG, 38% from 3) and hopes to position his team to compete for a Mountain West championship.\nTop competition: Tyson Degenhart, Boise State Broncos (14.1 PPG)\n \nNico Galette | 6-6 | F | Sacred Heart Pioneers\nThe all-NEC first-teamer (15.4 PPG, 6.7 RPG) scored in double figures 30 times and recorded four double-doubles last seasons, making him one of the top returning mid-major stars in the country.\nTop competition: Ansley Almonor, Fairleigh Dickinson Knights (13.6 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 38% from the 3-point line)\n \nMark Freeman | 5-10 | G | Morehead State Eagles\nHead coach Preston Spradlin told ESPN.com this summer that Freeman (15.0 PPG, 3.7 APG) has continued to improve from last season. That's significant for a player who easily won 2022-23 OVC Player of the Year honors.\nTop competition: Ray'Sean Taylor, SIU Edwardsville Cougars (15.5 PPG, 4.1 RPG)\n \nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n‚Ä¢ Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ NBA training camp cheat sheets ¬ª\n More ESPN+ content ¬ª\nOumar Ballo | 7-0 | C | Arizona Wildcats\nBallo (14.2 PPG, 8.6 RPG), an all-Pac-12 first-teamer last season, is a lock to win this award this year -- especially if he connects on 65% of his shots inside the arc the way he did in 2022-23.\nTop competition: Boogie Ellis, USC Trojans (17.7 PPG, 39% from the 3-point line)\n \nKeegan Records | 6-10 | F | Colgate Raiders\nA year after helping Colgate win the Patriot League's regular-season and conference tournament crowns, Records (13.0 PPG, 6.0 RPG, 1.3 BPG) could very well orchestrate a repeat.\nTop competition: Keith Higgins Jr., Lehigh Mountain Hawks (14.7 PPG, 41% from beyond the arc)\n \nWade Taylor IV | 6-0 | G | Texas A&M Aggies\nThe all-SEC first-teamer (16.3 PPG, 3.9 APG) led Texas A&M to the NCAA tournament last season, finishing the 2022-23 campaign with 20 points or more in 12 games. It's likely he can accomplish something similar this season.\nTop competition: Santiago Vescovi, Tennessee Volunteers (12.5 PPG, 37% from the 3-point line)\n \nTre Jackson | 6-1 | G | Western Carolina Catamounts\nJackson (15.8 PPG, 43% from beyond the arc) is the leader of a Western Carolina team that returns the bulk of its starting rotation. With Jackson, the Catamounts will chase the program's first conference tournament championship and NCAA tournament appearance since 1996.\nTop competition: Keyshaun Langley, UNC Greensboro Spartans (14.3 PPG, 42% from beyond the arc)\n \nChristian Shumate | 6-6 | G | McNeese Cowboys\nShumate (15.1 PPG, 9.7 RPG) is a key player for former LSU coach Will Wade's new squad, which hopes to make an immediate turnaround from last season's 6-12 finish in league play.\nTop competition: Jordan Johnson, New Orleans Privateers (18.0 PPG, 48% from the 3-point line)\n \nZeke Mayo | 6-3 | G | South Dakota State Jackrabbits\nThe departure of Max Abmas and other key players in the league has opened the door for Mayo to become the best player this season. But he was already a contender before they left, thanks to a sizzling February and March (20.4 PPG over the last nine games of the 2022-23 season).\nTop competition: Parker Bjorklund, St. Thomas-Minnesota Tommies (22.8 PPG, 8.3 RPG)\n \nAustin Crowley | 6-5 | G | Southern Miss Golden Eagles\nThe all-Sun Belt first-teamer returns to avenge a 4-for-13 performance in a first-round Sun Belt Conference tournament loss to South Alabama -- the same loss that sent the league's regular-season champs home much earlier than anticipated.\nTop competition: Donovan Gregory, Appalachian State Mountaineers (12.5 PPG, 4.3 APG)\n \nPJ Henry | 5-10 | G | Texas Southern Tigers\nFor the last three years, Texas Southern has won the SWAC tournament, and therefore the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. The return of Henry (12.4 PPG) could lead to a fourth consecutive berth for coach Johnny Jones' squad.\nTop competition: Jeremiah Kendall, Alcorn State Braves (11.1 PPG, 6.7 RPG)\n \nRayshon Harrison | 6-4 | G | Grand Canyon Lopes\nHe was an all-WAC first-teamer last season after averaging 17.8 PPG and 4.0 RPG, and leading his team to the NCAA tournament. With his return to college basketball, Harrison hopes to prove his 20-point effort in the Lopes' 82-70 loss to Gonzaga in the first round wasn't a fluke.\nTop competition: Cameron Tyson, Seattle U Redhawks (18.6 PPG, 4.4 RPG)\n \nAidan Mahaney | 6-3 | G | Saint Mary's Gaels\nWith Drew Timme gone, Mahaney (13.9 PPG, 40% from the 3-point line) could emerge as the face of West Coast Conference basketball -- particularly if he can lead the Gaels to another conference title (they shared the crown with Gonzaga last season) and an NCAA tournament berth.\nTop competition: Ryan Nembhard, Gonzaga Bulldogs (12.1 PPG, 4.8 APG at Creighton)"}
{"title": "All the biggest storylines of the 2023-24 offseason", "date": "2023-10-05 15:51:23", "text": "Has it really only been six months?\nThe buzzer sounded on UConn's win over San Diego State in the men's college basketball national championship game exactly six months ago -- but the entire landscape of the sport has changed in that time. Rick Pitino is back in the big time; Bob Huggins is no longer coaching. Arizona will be headed to the Big 12; the Pac-12 is essentially no more. More than 1,800 players entered the transfer portal; another couple hundred turned pro.\nSimply put, there's been an incredible amount of change.\nBut before we turn the page and fully look ahead to the 2023-24 season, which tips off Nov. 6, let's take stock of exactly what happened in the past six months.\nIf the last thing you remember about college hoops is confetti falling from the NRG Stadium rafters after the Huskies won their fifth national championship in 25 years, ESPN's men's college basketball experts -- Jeff Borzello, John Gasaway, Joe Lunardi and Myron Medcalf -- are here to help you catch up.\nJump to:\nBiggest headlines | Coach & player movements | Bracketology risers and fallers | High school recruiting spotlights\n \nLeBron James says his son Bronny has begun his rehab process so he can play with USC this season.\nBronny James suffers cardiac incident\nDuring a July team workout at USC, the 5-star recruit and son of LeBron James collapsed after suffering cardiac arrest. James is recovering and attending his classes on campus. But his basketball future -- his father has said he hopes to one day play with Bronny in the NBA -- is unclear, per a recent statement from the university.\nHunter Dickinson picks Kansas\nIn May, the former Michigan star and top recruit in the transfer portal picked the Jayhawks over multiple suitors coveting the big man who averaged 18.5 points and 9.0 rebounds last season. In interviews, Dickinson implied his decision was partly influenced by name, image and likeness (NIL) opportunities. His arrival likely elevates Kansas, which returns Dajuan Harris Jr. and K.J. Adams Jr., to the No. 1 spot in every reputable preseason poll.\nZach Edey, Donovan Clingan and Kyle Filipowski return\nThe current state of big men in college basketball is strong with three elite players returning for another season. Edey, the Purdue star who won the Wooden Award last season, is back to help a Purdue squad that suffered a historic upset against 16-seed Fairleigh Dickinson in the 2023 NCAA tournament. Clingan, the 7-footer who averaged 1.8 blocks in just 13.1 minutes per game, will attempt to lead UConn to a second consecutive national title. And Filipowski, who is currently recovering from hip surgery, will try to lead Duke to its second Final Four appearance since 2015.\nControversy surrounds Rick Pitino hiring at St. John's\nIn three years at Iona, Pitino led the Gaels to two league titles and two NCAA tournament appearances. Pitino repeatedly stated he was content at the New Rochelle, New York, school and had no interest in other jobs. But he was eventually wooed by St. John's, which is just 30 minutes from his hometown of Oyster Bay, New York. The Hall of Fame coach has already made a massive impact in the transfer portal, adding Harvard star Chris Ledlum (18.8 PPG) and Penn's Jordan Dingle (23.4 PPG) along with other standouts who should immediately boost the Red Storm in the Big East race. But Mike Anderson, St. John's former head coach, has sued the school in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, claiming the school fired him for cause without justification.\nJahvon Quinerly picks Memphis Tigers\nLast season, the guard was critical to Alabama's NCAA tournament run, but he announced he would transfer to his third school when he committed to Penny Hardaway in July. As a grad transfer, Quinerly is immediately eligible for the squad that last season allowed former SMU transfer Kendric Davis to blossom. Quinerly, who averaged 8.7 PPG in Tuscaloosa last season, joins a nucleus that could include 27-year-old DeAndre Williams -- provided he is granted a waiver to play another season.\nChris \"Mad Dog\" Russo sounds off on the lack of rivalries between the teams heading to the Big Ten and Big 12 in 2024.\nBig 12 becomes superconference, rejects Gonzaga, UConn\nIn August, Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark announced that talks with Gonzaga and UConn about joining the league ended after the conference decided to add four Pac-12 squads. While the Zags and Huskies would have strengthened men's basketball in a league that is arguably the nation's best, pound-for-pound, the additions of Arizona, Arizona State, Utah and Colorado in 2024-25 also enhance the league. With Houston, BYU, Cincinnati and UCF all joining this season, the Big 12 will boast seven teams that finished 2022-23 within the top 30 on KenPom.\nMikey Williams' basketball career jeopardized by gun incident\nWith millions of followers on social media, the four-star recruit and Memphis commit was well-known even outside of basketball when he was in high school. But Williams' college hoops career is now on hold. Earlier this year, Williams was charged with six felonies after he allegedly fired a weapon at multiple individuals who had come to his San Diego home. He pled not guilty in the initial court hearing, but Memphis released a statement last week saying Williams will not be with the team until there is a resolution in his legal case.\nEd Cooley leaves Providence for Georgetown\nFor more than a decade, Cooley was the face of Providence basketball in his hometown. Under him, the Friars reached the NCAA tournament seven times. But his bond with the late John Thompson contributed to his shocking decision to accept the head coaching job at Georgetown. Providence officials and fans were blindsided by the move, which now gives Georgetown a proven leader as it attempts to rebuild the program following the turbulent Patrick Ewing era. -- Medcalf\n \nThe biggest movement of the summer was actually an exit. Bob Huggins entered the offseason No. 3 all time in career wins as a Division I men's coach, behind only Mike Krzyzewski and Jim Boeheim. Now, well, he's still No. 3, but that number for wins (935) will stay where it is until further notice.\nHuggins appeared to resign as West Virginia coach on June 17 after he was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence. Then, in early July, he insisted he never formally resigned. Cue the lawyers. But Huggins is out, and Josh Eilert is interim head coach of the Mountaineers.\nNor should we look past a very different and truly historic offseason movement, one 65 years in the making. On June 8, the NCAA announced that all numbers from 0 to 99 will once again be permitted on men's college basketball jerseys. We haven't seen a 6, 7, 8 or 9 on the floor since Bill Russell rocked No. 6 for the San Francisco Dons in the 1950s.\nWho will be the first player to follow in George Mikan's footsteps with a No. 99 in hoops? The new season will literally look different than anything many of us have seen before. -- Gasaway\n \nRick Pitino chats on \"SportsCenter\" about why he decided to become the next coach at St. John's.\nIt's both embarrassing and instructive to look back at where we ranked teams at the start of the offseason versus now, with the tip off of a new season right around the corner. Alas, that is the assignment, and here are the results:\nBIGGEST RISER: St. John's Red Storm (No. 170 to No. 45, projected Last Four In). The Red Storm fired Mike Anderson on March 10 and needed only 10 days to lure Rick Pitino from New Rochelle (and Iona) to Queens. Myron covered the larger St. John's saga above, but suffice to say, Pitino's pursuit of an NCAA tournament bid -- and beyond -- for the Red Storm will be among the major storylines of the 2023-24 campaign.\nOTHER RISERS:\nIllinois Fighting Illini (No. 74 to No. 18, projected 5-seed). Illinois gained ground by essentially standing still, retaining 6-foot-6 senior Terrence Shannon Jr. and 6-10 junior Coleman Hawkins, a pair of standouts who figured to leave the program at the end of last season. Now, the Illini have the experience and production to challenge presumptive Big Ten favorites Purdue and Michigan State.\nMississippi State Bulldogs (No. 78 to No. 29, projected 8-seed). The Bulldogs already overachieved in Year 1 under Chris Jans, reaching the NCAA First Four. The surprising return of 6-2 senior Dashawn Davis, a presumed departure, means the trend line points even further up in Starkville.\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\nNorthwestern Wildcats (No. 76 to No. 32, projected 8-seed)\nOregon Ducks (No. 75 to No. 34, projected 9-seed)\nKansas State Wildcats (No. 70 to No. 41, projected First Four)\nVirginia Cavaliers (No. 72 to No. 43, projected First Four)\nStanford Cardinal (No. 77 to No. 49, projected First Four Out)\nNew Mexico Lobos (No. 95 to No. 50, projected Next Four Out)\nUtah Utes (No. 81 to No. 53)\nSeton Hall Pirates (No. 84 to No. 56)\nLSU Tigers (No. 96 to No. 64)\nNevada Wolf Pack (No. 121 to No. 68)\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n‚Ä¢ Ranking all 32 NHL goalie tandems ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ Ranking CFB's 22 unbeaten teams ¬ª\n‚Ä¢ NBA training camp cheat sheets ¬ª\n More ESPN+ content ¬ª\nBIGGEST FALLER: Washington State Cougars (from No. 42, projected 11-seed, to No. 76). The Cougars' best players are now in Atlanta (Mouhamed Gueye, NBA Hawks), in Cleveland (Justin Powell, NBA Cavaliers), at Villanova (TJ Bamba, transfer portal) and at USC (DJ Rodman, transfer portal). The Cougars also don't have a conference after this season. Other than that ...\nOTHER FALLERS:\nNotre Dame Fighting Irish (from No. 183 to No. 214).

Flagg averaged 25.4 points, 13 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 6.9 blocks at the prestigious Nike EYBL Peach Jam, including three triple-doubles. He then moved from the 2025 class into the 2024 class, and Flagg is in the process of taking his official visits. He went to UConn in late September, and he will head Duke this month. -- Borzello"}
{"title": "Wood: Difficult to keep making weight, moving up after Warrington title defense", "date": "2023-10-05 16:31:25", "text": "Leigh Wood believes Saturday's world title defense could be his last as making the featherweight limit is becoming increasingly difficult for him.\nWood (27-3, 16 KOs), the WBA featherweight champion and ESPN's No. 2 at 126 pounds, defends his title against English rival Josh Warrington (31-2-1, 8 KOs) on Saturday at the Sheffield Arena in Sheffield, England.\nWood, 35, managed his weight perfectly for his last outing in May, which resulted in an impressive performance as he contained and outpointed the dangerous Mauricio Lara after flooring him early on. The Mexican went into the fight as ESPN's No. 1 at featherweight after stopping Wood in the seventh round of their first fight in February, but was stripped of the belt the day before for missing the weight.\n\"It gets harder every time to make the featherweight limit,\" Wood told ESPN. \"The last time against Lara was harder than before and Lara not making the weight made me feel even more sorry for myself. I know what it is like.\n\"I'm 35 now and I've been making this weight for a long time, it doesn't get easier. I think it takes a little bit out of me and I would be stronger at junior lightweight, definitely. There's nothing more I can cut, except if I was to cut an arm off.\"\nFor Wood, the climax of his career could be at junior lightweight even if he beats Leeds native Warrington. Both are two-time world champions in the last phase of their careers looking to set up a big fight for next year.\n\"I said two more fights after I beat Lara, but it's a fight-by-fight basis really,\" Wood said. \"I don't want to retire from boxing until I'm the first boxer to headline at the City Ground in Nottingham. The timing meant we couldn't do the Warrington fight there in the summer -- the ground had a new pitch laid [before the English Premier League season started in August] and even the Nottingham Forest players couldn't train on it.\"\nJoe Cordina (16-0, 9 KOs), the IBF junior lightweight champion, is a possibility for the winner of Saturday's fight in Sheffield, as like Wood and Warrington he is promoted by Matchroom. Cordina defends his belt against Edward Vazquez on Nov. 4 in Monte Carlo, Monaco.\n\"My focus is on Josh Warrington but I'm confident and if I did move up Joe Cordina is a possibility, he's a great fighter,\" Wood told ESPN. \"My dream is to fight at the City Ground, and I have to win this one to make it happen. It would have to be a unification fight or perhaps a rematch with Michael Conlan to keep me at featherweight.\"\nWood's career leapt from domestic to elite level when he knocked out Xu Can in the last round for the WBA world title in July 2021, before doing the same to Michael Conlan in 2022's ESPN fight of the year. Despite his strong recent performances, Wood is aware that Warrington represents a different challenge.\n\"My discipline and patience was what I was pleased most about against Lara,\" Wood told ESPN. \"I had to stay switched on when there was not a lot happening because he likes to jump in and surprise you. I learned that the hard way in the first fight with him. Patience was also key in the second fight, not to go leaving myself open.\nWoods believes he needs a different approach against Warrington because he's a different style of a fighter.\n\"There are things he does well but there are areas I know I can exploit against him,\" Wood said.\nWood insists the pressure is on Warrington this time after Warrington lost the IBF belt to Luis Alberto Lopez a year ago. Warrington, 32, was also stopped by Lara in 2021, broke his jaw in a hard-fought stoppage win over Kiko Martinez in 2022, and then lost a majority decision against to Lopez.\n\"There's a lot of pressure on Josh for this one, he knows it will be very hard to come back from another defeat,\" Wood said. \"He's not fought for a while and it favors me that I have momentum, I'm better when I'm active. This is my third fight inside eight months, activity has served me well through my career. I think Josh is boxing well, I don't think he's on the slide and he lost a close fight versus Lopez.\n\"There's a lot on the line for both of us.\"\nOn the undercard, Cecilia Braekhus -- once the biggest star in women's boxing -- gets a chance to revive her career at the age of 42.\nThe Colombia-born, Norway-based boxer challenges Terri Harper for the WBA and vacant WBO junior middleweight titles after suffering two losses in her last three fights.\nBraekhus (37-2, 9 KOs) lost back-to-back decisions to Jessica McCaskill for the undisputed welterweight championship in 2020 and 2021.\nBut Harper (14-1-1, 6 KOs), 26, from Doncaster not far from Sheffield, will be boosted by home support as well as her recent form and will be making a second WBA title defense.\nShe said: \"I've got to take away her jab and stay busy. I believe I can stop her.\""}
{"title": "VAR doesn't work without enough cameras and angles -- just ask the NWSL", "date": "2023-10-05 14:48:00", "text": "On the same day that the Premier League had what became a defining blunder for VAR in a high-profile match, the National Women's Soccer League was having just another weekend in its bumpy first season using video replays.\nAmong the calls in question were a penalty that was unconvincingly reversed after review in Chicago and, the next day, an equalizing goal in Seattle that OL Reign coach Laura Harvey insisted afterward was offside. The problem with both decisions was not entirely human error, but the lack of technology available with which the hard-working (and underpaid) humans could make the right decision.\nBoth decisions had major implications on the tightest NWSL playoff race in history. A probable 1-0 Reign win was turned into a 1-1 draw. Racing Louisville could've pulled level, but instead the Chicago Red Stars won, 1-0. VAR, or video-assisted refereeing, was introduced to ensure such calls are right, but it may have done the opposite.\nNone of this drama is new for the NWSL, where defining offside calls are made weekly without truly definitive angles. In Seattle on Sunday, Kerolin's equalizer for the North Carolina Courage stood after a five-plus minute review by referee Elton Garcia -- the official had to try to analyze an offside line from a horrendous angle that was anything but in line with the last defender.\nUnlike in that crucial moment of Saturday's Liverpool-Tottenham game, NWSL referees are not armed with two-dimensional lines to draw across a replay. They do not have the benefit of semi-automated offside, which was used at the 2023 World Cup. They also do not have goal-line technology, nor any cameras on the end lines to provide a definitive angle on would-be goals (which, you guessed it, has been an issue in the NWSL this season).\nInstead, they are at the mercy of the camera angles that they have, which often are not enough to truly make a definitive call on where the offside line is. By the letter of the law -- that a decision must include a \"clear and obvious error\" to be reversed -- NWSL referees are often handcuffed to the call made on the field for lack of sufficient video evidence. Except when they are not.\nOn Saturday in Chicago, with Racing Louisville trailing the Red Stars in the second half, Louisville midfielder Savannah DeMelo was taken down in the box by Chicago midfielder Julia Bianchi. Referee Sergii Demianchuk pointed to the spot for a penalty kick, which looked obvious in real time. The next four minutes were spent in consultation with the VAR, Luis Guardia, and included an extended look at the makeshift monitor setup on a rolling media cart at midfield in SeatGeek Stadium.\n\"This is one of the most important VAR decisions of the entire season,\" commentator Mike Watts said on the broadcast during the stoppage. As Demianchuk emerged from the monitor to deliver the verdict, Watts added: \"Here is a season-changing decision.\"\nDemianchuk jogged back to the penalty area, made the universal \"TV\" sign for VAR review, and motioned for a drop ball. No penalty.\nThe decision was shocking, not so much in that it was an egregious error but because there appeared to be no evidence to support the determination of a clear and obvious error. Bianchi most certainly makes contact with DeMelo in the box. Exactly how much and how forcefully -- or whether she mostly gets the ball -- could only be determined by a reverse angle that did not exist. (Viewers at home are privy to the same replays that appear on the monitor for the referee's review.)\nIf the call on the field was a penalty, it should have stood based on the evidence available.\nAsked by a pool reporter after the game why the call was overturned, and what the clear and obvious error was, Demianchuk's written response was: \"The defender played the ball prior to making contact with the opponent.\"\nThis is not about one referee or one incident, to be clear. VAR's rollout in the NWSL has been hit-and-miss since the opening weekend when Angel City FC was twice on the wrong end of harsh decisions that changed the entire complexion of a home match against NJ/NY Gotham FC.\nEarlier in September during a video review of a goal, referee Alyssa Nichols asked whether a player interfered with an opponent and the assistant VAR said, \"We would need a different angle.\" No other angle was shown to Nichols and Angel City was awarded a goal. Professional Referee Organization later said the goal should not have counted because the player did interfere with an opponent.\nVAR is both a solution and another layer of complication -- that is not unique to the NWSL. What is unique to the NWSL is that VAR has arrived without ample technological support.\nAll NWSL games in 2023 use HD cameras and fiber transmission, according to a league spokesperson. The rare games aired on CBS, including Friday's farewell to Megan Rapinoe and the NWSL Championship scheduled for Nov. 11, utilize 14 cameras. Games that air on CBS Sports Network and that are streamed on Paramount+ have only six cameras, two more than they did for most of last season.\nThe slight numerical increase and improvement to broadcast-quality cameras happened in August 2022 in response to increasing problems with match streams. It was a product fix that also ostensibly helped with the implementation of VAR. All those upgrades likely cost seven figures.\nPerhaps we've entered the era of champagne problems for the NWSL, which is part of becoming big-time as the league wants to (and should) be. Thus far, \"more\" is still not enough. Premier League games, to use the most extreme example, are captured by at least 30 cameras. MLS had a previous minimum of eight cameras per broadcast.\nIn that light, some of the issues with VAR in NWSL -- emphasis on \"some,\" because there are still plenty of improvements to be made in the officiating overall -- can be viewed through the lens of the league's inadequate media rights deal.\nLynn Williams joins \"Futbol Americas\" to talk about why the USWNT failed at the FIFA Women's World Cup.\nCBS reportedly paid $4.5 million for a three-year contract that expires in the coming months. (It was extended by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic canceling the 2020 regular season.) The NWSL -- as in, the owner/operators of each franchise collectively, along with whatever sponsorship money comes in from league headquarters -- foots the bill to produce games.\nLast month, NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said she hopes to be able to announce the future of the league's media rights before the NWSL Championship. The league has been in search of a big payday for its next rights deal, but it is seeking that in an unpredictable market filled with media layoffs -- all while new, unproven players in the space unpredictably splash cash on certain properties.\nLeague sources say that a means to an end could involve multiple rights holders to maximize the return from each -- as in, go find the NWSL on multiple channels. Solutions could be confirmed in the coming weeks. Whatever those are, they matter for more reasons than just where fans can find games, and how good the broadcast is.\nVAR has been a good step toward accountability in a league that long lacked it in so many departments. It will require time and continued training to improve the process. It will also require the league to double down on investment in technology to support it."}

Before his move to Inter Miami, Messi admitted he had been in discussions with his former club in Spain, but financial restrictions made a move too complicated.\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga & more (U.S.)\n- Read on ESPN+: Depth charts for every Premier League team\nInter Miami are currently seven spots adrift of playoffs line in the standings with only three matches left, though they have at least one game in hand over the teams they need to leapfrog up the table. The MLS regular season ends on Oct. 21, at which point Messi's season would be over if Miami miss playoffs.\nMoreover, Inter Miami owner Jorge Mas even hinted that he wouldn't stand in the Argentine World Cup winner's way if there was a possibility Messi could seal his dream return to Spain.\nThe Argentine skipper is contracted to Miami until 2025 but he has already stated he has no interest in extending his stay in the MLS beyond that date, per reports. Messi has also recently been linked with a move to his boyhood club Newell's Old Boys when his stay in the U.S. ends.\n- Manchester City hope to fend off interest from Real Madrid in star striker Erling Haaland by holding contract talks soon, according to The Telegraph. Haaland has scored eight goals in 10 games this season after scoring 52 last time around, which is why City are hoping to extend his contract. Reports of Real Madrid's interest in the 23-year-old have been persistent, but it won't be an easy sell -- he is playing for the current European champions and is in excellent form. Los Blancos were hoping to sign one of Kylian Mbapp√© or Haaland in 2024, and for now neither move seems likely.\n- Newcastle United are preparing to battle it out with Liverpool and Juventus for Nice midfielder Khephren Thuram, according to Tuttomercatoweb. The 22-year-old central midfielder has been in sensational form for the fourth-place side and number of top clubs take interest. Thuram is contracted to the club until 2025 but could be available for around ‚Ç¨40 million. Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund are also interested.\n- Juventus continue to scour the market for rising stars, and the latest name linked with the Italian club is Shakhtar Donetsk's Georgiy Sudakov, per Tuttosport. The Bianconeri have been monitoring the 21-year-old midfielder for the last two seasons, and believe he has the attacking capabilities to offer them something different. Sudakov is seen as a possible target for the January transfer window, and Juve scouts went to Belgium to watch him in Champions League action against Royal Antwerp on Wednesday, where he starred in the No. 10 role in a 3-2 victory.\n- Michael Kayode has seized his opportunity at Fiorentina this season following an cruciate ligament injury to teammate Dod√¥, attracting the interest of Arsenal, according to Calciomercato. The 19-year-old, who three years ago was playing in Serie D, has impressed on the right flank, and his efforts have prompted Fiorentina officials to try and extend his contract beyond its current end date in 2025. Arsenal have been monitoring his progress since first watching him at the U-19 European Championship, in which he scored the winning goal in the final.\n- Nico Williams has been a man in demand since the summer, but he could disappoint any potential suitors by extending his contract at current club Athletic Club Bilbao, per Sport. Both Real Madrid and Barcelona are reportedly on the verge of conceding defeat in their pursuit of the 21-year-old winger. Williams' current deal is set to finish at the end of this season, but Bilbao are confident he'll extend his contract before the end of the year."}

(1:37)\nWhile rookies are the most challenging players to project in a given fantasy basketball season, sophomores aren't far behind.

Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nNow, some young players are more ready than others. They are physically gifted, with skill and strong nerves to step in and make an impact right away. Other players never catch up to the NBA game and find their potential unfulfilled. Then, there are the players that just need more time, and at some point in their rookie season or perhaps in the offseason after, the switch flips and they are ready to ball.\nAs you prepare for your fantasy basketball draft, it will be up to you to identify which young players fit into which category and pick accordingly.\nThat's where I come in.\nWe have already gone through the prospects and fantasy basketball draft outlook for this year's rookie class. Now, let's do the same for the second-year players.\nBanchero made good on his status as the top pick in the 2022 NBA draft, winning Rookie of the Year honors. Banchero was the top fantasy hoops producer in his class last season, and is favored to be so again this year. He averaged 20.0 PPG, 6.9 RPG and 3.7 APG as a rookie and did a lot of that with pure talent and physical ability. Banchero created a lot of his own looks off the iso, breaking down his defender on the drive or pulling up for 3-pointers... which he shot at a less than 30 percent clip. As a sophomore, particularly one that spent the last month of his summer playing with some of the best talent in the NBA on Team USA for the FIBA World Cup, Banchero should be a more polished player who is confident and established in what he wants to do. I look for him to potentially make a leap and would consider drafting him starting around the middle of the third round of 10-team fantasy basketball leagues. He has the upside to move into the top-20 of the fantasy rankings by the end of the season.\nProjected line: 24 PPG (45 FG%, 31 3P%, 75 FT%), 8 RPG, 3.5 APG, 1.7 3PG, 1.0 SPG, 0.8 BPG\nKessler surprised many last season. He averaged a double-double on excellent scoring efficiency from the field while blocking three shots per game in 32 games from mid-January to the end of March. Kessler's play earned him a spot on the All Rookie first team, and he joined Banchero on Team USA at the FIBA World Cup to further raise his cachet and confidence entering Year 2. Kessler should come off the board in the sixth to eighth round range of standard fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected line: 11 PPG (73 FG%, 54 FT%), 10 RPG, 1.1 APG, 0.0 3PG, 0.4 SPG, 2.7 BPG\nWilliams entered his rookie season as the less hyped of the Thunder's two lottery rookies. While second overall pick Chet Holmgren missed the season with a foot injury, Williams went on to have an outstanding rookie season which saw him finish second in the Rookie of the Year voting. Williams entered the league with an NBA-ready frame and held his own from the start. Williams averaged 19.0 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 4.2 APG, 2.0 SPG and 1.3 3PG over a 25-game period from Feb. 7 to the end of the season, while shooting 55.1% from the field and 89.4% from the line. He appears set for a big sophomore campaign and is value in the sixth to eighth rounds of fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected line: 18 PPG (53 FG%, 37 3P%, 82 FT%), 5 RPG, 3.0 APG, 1.6 3PG, 1.5 SPG, 0.5 BPG\nSmith Jr. had a very solid rookie season, but still decided to play on the Rockets' Summer League team. He impressed in Las Vegas, scoring 71 points with a whopping 27 free throw attempts in only 64 minutes of action. Smith always had a strong jumper and good shot-blocking ability, but this summer he showed an aggressiveness and ability to attack off the dribble and finish through contact as well as a desire to take and make the big shot that will serve him very well in his second season. Smith projects as an eighth to ninth round fantasy draft pick, but based on how impressive he was this summer, I might slide him more to the sixth/seventh round range in some of my drafts.\nProjected stats: 17 PPG (43 FG%, 33 3P%, 81 FT%), 8 RPG, 2.0 3PG, 1.4 APG, 1.3 BPG, 0.6 SPG\nMurray is another current member of the NBA All-Rookie First Team that rounds out this list. Murray was almost purely a 3-point shooter for the Kings last season, and that was enough to maintain a solid floor value. But Murray should get the chance to show he has a much more polished, well-rounded offense game beyond spot-up shooting in his second season. He also flashed as a rebounder and defender in the second half of his rookie season. I expect him to improve his numbers on that end of the court as well. He is a solid value in the eighth to 10th round of fantasy leagues.\nProjected line: 17 PPG (47 FG%, 42 3%, 77 FT%), 7 RPG, 1.4 APG, 2.1 3PG, 0.9 SPG, 0.6 BPG\nIvey had a strong rookie campaign as a lead/combo guard on the Pistons and has already shown flashes of strong scoring, playmaking and shooting when in rhythm. Those moments should come more frequently as a sophomore, particularly with Cade Cunningham back. The two combine to form Detroit's backcourt of the future. I would consider Ivey in the 10th round of standard 10-team fantasy basketball drafts.\nProjected stats: 18 PPG (43 FG%, 36 3P%, 76 FT%), 4.0 RPG, 5.5 APG, 1.8 3PG, 09. SPG, 0.2 BPG\nMathurin is a pure scorer with 20 PPG upside as soon as this season. He remains on the fringe draft pick in standard fantasy basketball leagues because he doesn't contribute to may secondary categories, which limits his fantasy scoring average. On the other hand, his scoring also keeps his floor relatively high. Mathurin is potentially more valuable as a role player in catalog leagues than points leagues, and if he develops more versatility in his game as a sophomore, he could become more universally valuable to fantasy teams. Mathurin is worth a late round upside pick in standard leagues. In deeper leagues with 12 or more teams, he is a more definitive late-round selection.\nWilliams moved into the starting lineup for the Hornets late last season and averaged a double-double on 63 FG% with more than a block and almost a steal per game. He is worth considering as a defense/role playing center in the last rounds of standard fantasy basketball drafts.\nEason was a regular contributor on the Rockets as a rookie and was another sophomore that I feel was too good to be playing in the Summer League in Vegas. He teamed up with Jabari Smith Jr. to dominate opposing competition, scoring off the dribble and setting up teammates while still focusing on the spot-up 3-pointer that is at the heart of his 3-and-D role in Houston. The Rockets are deep with talented young wings, but Eason should carve out playing time and has fantasy-worthy upside if he is able to be a starter this season.\nSharpe was drafted in 2022 based on his sheer talent and by the end of the season was a starter and producing for the Trail Blazers. He is a key cog in Portland's post-Lillard rebuild, and has explosive upside this season as the game slows down for him. Sharpe exhibited a nice rapport with rookie Scoot Henderson in their one game together at the Las Vegas Summer League. If they can translate that connection to the NBA stage, Sharpe could get better looks playing alongside a talented young point guard.\nI would consider Duren in the later rounds of fantasy drafts, but he more likely will be a free agent worth keeping an eye on. Duren has all the physical tools to be a dominant NBA center, but he's on a deep Pistons' front court and may not get enough minutes to make an impact. Nevertheless, he is on the fantasy radar purely off potential. His excellent per-minute numbers suggest he could be a nightly double-double threat if he/when he earns consistent starter minutes.\nBranham and Sochan both had productive rookie seasons for the Spurs, averaging double digits scoring and displaying flashes of brilliance to suggest they could develop into more. The Spurs were already deep into rebuilding last season, which allowed both to get more playing time in their first seasons. Branham had a 10-game stretch through most of February when he averaged 18.1 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 2.9 APG and 2.2 3PG in 32.7 MPG, then finished the season averaging 16.1 PPG, 3.6 APG and 1.4 3PG in 26.8 MPG in his last nine games.\nSochan had several similar extended runs. He averaged 18.0 PPG, 5.9 RPG, 3.3 APG and 1.6 3PG in 30.2 MPG over seven games in January, then produced 19.8 PPG, 8.3 RPG and 2.8 APG in 30.8 MPG from late February until injuries derailed his season in mid-March.\nNeither Branham nor Sochan enter this season listed as starters on the Spurs depth chart, but both are only 20 years old and have enough talent to earn extended playing time as the Spurs continue their youth movement."}

And who are other sleeper first-year players to keep an eye on as the season progresses?\nWembanyama was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft and is touted as the best prospect since at least LeBron James in 2003. Wembanyama stands 7-foot-5, has the ball-handling and perimeter skills of a forward, but the rim protection ability of an elite defensive anchor. The Spurs are building their entire franchise around him, and based on the combination of his talent, the way that Spurs coach Gregg Popovich deployed his last top overall pick/generational talent in Tim Duncan, and the history of players with the level of hype and/or body types similar to Wembanyama, I project Wembanyama to produce strong fantasy hoops numbers as a rookie. After watching him in the Las Vegas Summer League, both his underwhelming debut and his outstanding second game, I would consider him as soon as the third round of fantasy basketball drafts this season.\nProjected line: 20 PPG (49 FG%, 30 3P%, 78 FT%), 9.5 RPG, 2.5 APG, 0.9 3PG, 0.7 SPG, 2.4 BPG\nHolmgren was the No. 2 overall pick of the 2022 NBA Draft but missed the entire season with a foot injury suffered last summer. Many, including ESPN Analytics' NBA Draft projections, had Holmgren as arguably the top prospect of the class. But there was also a vocal pushback that Holmgren's lack of girth (listed at 7-1, 195 pounds) would keep him from being effective at the next level. Holmgren played at the Las Vegas Summer League in each of the last two seasons, and this summer he looked visibly stronger and more ready for the physical NBA. He will always be thin, but now he looks wiry instead of frail. His game popped as well, with some similar strengths and weaknesses as Wembanyama, and he should also be a nightly double-double threat with strong defensive numbers and 3-point range as a \"rookie\". Holmgren would be good value in the middle rounds of fantasy drafts, between rounds 6 and 8.\nProjected line: 15 PPG (51 FG%, 32 3%, 79 FT%), 9 RPG, 2.3 APG, 1.3 3PG, 0.7 SPG, 1.6 BPG\nHenderson is the heir apparent to the Trail Blazers franchise player throne vacated by Damian Lillard. In Vegas this summer, Henderson's explosiveness and creativity looked ready-made for the pro game. He may have some growing pains as he learns to work around a streaky jumper and defensive pressure that may lead to turnovers, but if the Trail Blazers hand him the reins he should produce flex-worthy fantasy hoops stats. His draft range is 6th through 8th round.\nProjected stats: 19 PPG (43 FG%, 39 3P%, 80 FT%), 7 APG, 5 RPG, 1.1 3PG, 0.4 BPG, 1.4 SPG\nMiller was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, and on paper his length and scoring ability on the wing should pair well with franchise guard LaMelo Ball. And I believe that it will, as the season goes along. But Miller struggled at times in the Summer League, particularly when his shot was off. The physicality and speed of the game could require a learning curve early in the season, but I expect he'll find his level as the season progresses. He is worth consideration in the late rounds of fantasy basketball drafts, as an upside pick once your fantasy starters have already been taken.\nProjected stats: 15 PPG (44 FG%, 35 3P%, 85 FT%), 7 RPG, 2 APG, 1.7 3PG, 1.1 SPG, 0.7 BPG\n\nAmen Thompson looked amazing during the first three quarters of his first summer league game with the Rockets before he injured his ankle and had to sit. His twin brother, Ausar, went on to have a strong summer league performance with the Pistons. Both have excellent size for wings, elite athleticism and the defensive tenacity to produce strong numbers at that end of the court from day one. Their defense could be what earns either/both of them more playing time out the gate. Amen is a better ball-handler than his brother and is niftier at finishing around the rim and drawing fouls, while Ausar may hit the boards a bit harder and may have a more direct path to a starting role on the Pistons. I would consider both players late in drafts as fliers with upside.\nProjected stats Amen: 10 PPG (45 FG%, 33 3P%, 77 FT%), 5 RPG, 3 APG, 1.0 3PG, 1.1 SPG, 0.5 BPG\nProjected stats Ausar: 9 PPG (46 FG%, 30 3P%, 72 FT%), 6 RPG, 2 APG, 0.9 3PG, 1.4 SPG, 0.7 BPG\nWalker is a new-age, do-it-all power forward in the mold of Draymond Green or Aaron Gordon moreso than a scorer or pure banger in the post. On offense, he is more catch-and-shoot than creator, but he plays with a lot of energy and could develop into a leader on the Pacers even as a rookie. Walker gave a glimpse into his versatile game in Vegas, filling the box scores with averages of 14.3 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 3.3 APG, 1.3 SPG and 1.3 BPG. He has an NBA body and the strength to compete right away. Walker enters the season with the chance to earn a starting nod on the Pacers, but he will have to compete with Obi Toppin for that honor. If he does get starter minutes, Walker could be an All-Rookie selection so it is worth it to watch the position battle in the preseason to see if he's worth a roster spot in fantasy hoops leagues.\nBlack has the size of a wing but the game of a guard. He is more strong than explosive, so he has to use craftiness, angles and his body to create scoring opportunities off the dribble. His all-around game is promising, but he needs to work on his shooting and ability to finish in the paint. In Las Vegas, Black made only one of his six 3-point attempts in three games, and he also shot only 54.5% from the free throw line. On a Magic team with a relatively deep backcourt, it is hard to see Black beating out Markelle Fultz or Jalen Suggs, and he still has to potentially contend with Cole Anthony and Gary Harris for backcourt minutes as well. Black has solid long-term upside, but after the Summer League and getting a better feel for how his game would fit on the Magic, I scaled back my projections and have him listed more as a player to watch than a likely fantasy draftee.\nHendricks enters this season with the floor of a 3-and-D stretch-4, but has the upside to eventually develop into a more all-around threat. In college, he led his conference in blocked shots and made 39% of his 3-pointers on solid volume. He has a 7-1 wingspan and high motor, and seems to fit well next to Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen on a potential Jazz frontcourt of the future. But, the Jazz traded for John Collins this offseason, meaning there is no space for Hendricks to start. He could earn good minutes off the bench, though, and is worth watching in case his role grows as the season progresses.\nWhitmore was widely projected to be a top-5 pick in the 2023 NBA Draft but slid on Draft Night to the Rockets at the 20th pick. He showed off his game in Vegas, where he was named the MVP of the Vegas Summer League after averaging 19.3 PPG, 5.2 RPG and 2.5 SPG. But more than the numbers, Whitmore clearly has an NBA body and will be able to physically match up with NBA wings from day one. He is a prototype 3-and-D wing in today's NBA, and the only reason he isn't higher on this list is his path to playing time isn't fully clear on a Rockets team full of young talent on the wing. He will be competing with Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, Amen Thompson, Jae-Sean Tate and Tari Eason for minutes.\nDick made headlines on NBA Draft night by wearing an ostentatious red suit with sequins that analysts said was \"as electric as his 3-point shooting.\" Dick is arguably the best 3-point shooter in his draft class, great at spotting up and knocking down his jumpers with a lightning quick release. He also has great size for a wing at 6-foot-7 ¬Ω inches, which gives him some rebounding potential. He had a similar statistical footprint to Tyler Herro in college, but Dick is taller. He lacks the strength to compete defensively in the NBA right now, but his length gives him defensive upside. Dick had a strong showing in Vegas with multiple 20-plus point scoring performances, but he has a difficult path to playing time on a Raptors squad featuring O.G. Anunoby, Scottie Barnes and Gary Trent Jr. on the wing.\nWallace is a 6-foot-3 guard with a 6-foot-8 wingspan that draft analyst Jay Bilas described as the safest pick in the draft because his game is known and reliable. Wallace can play the point but can also work off the ball. He has a strong all around game but isn't a pure scorer and tends to be streaky. In Vegas, Wallace had a monster debut from downtown with six made 3-pointers and 20 points, but followed that up by going 2-for-12 from the field and 1-for-8 from downtown in the next game. Wallace is behind Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey on the guard depth chart for the Thunder, and will have to compete with several others for backup minutes.\nGeorge was the Big 12 Freshman of the Year last season at Baylor. At 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds, George has excellent size for a combo guard with the quickness and athleticism to develop into a good defender. On offense, he is crafty at creating space, can finish in the paint and has demonstrated shooting range out to about 30 feet. George played six summer league games for the Jazz across multiple leagues, but in the last two games before he injured his ankle he went for 33 points and 10 assists in one game and 26 points with seven assists in the next. He could compete with incumbent starter Collin Sexton for minutes at the point in Utah this season.\nHoward is a knock-down 3-point shooter, and can knock down his shot off the dribble as well as the spot-up. He is great at coming off screens and firing, a skill that will serve him well in the NBA. Howard is about 6-foot-8 and 215 pounds, smaller than his Fab Five father Juwan, but with good size for a forward. While his shooting range is his strength, Howard needs to work on his defense and rebounding. He has the athleticism to do so, if he is willing to put in the work. Howard ran hot and cold in Vegas, with a couple poor outings to start with before bouncing back with 22 points and four 3-pointers in the third game. The Magic were one of the worst shooting teams in the NBA last season, so they could use Howard's sharp-shooting, but he has to compete with veterans like Joe Ingles for minutes off the bench behind Franz Wagner."}
{"title": "Goalie tandem picks: Which player should you draft?", "date": "2023-10-03 12:54:37", "text": "I feel like it's safer trying to predict the rainfall on a day six months from now than it is to confidently state how the goaltender position will play out in the coming fantasy hockey season.\nThat's not to say there aren't safer bets out there -- but you have to pay for them. Igor Shesterkin, Ilya Sorokin, Jake Oettinger, Connor Hellebuyck ... they are likely to be better investments for your fantasy squad, but they'll cost a high draft pick.\nBut winning your league last year was better accomplished by drafting Linus Ullmark and Alexandar Georgiev, which was just a matter of backing the right two sleepers. Who will those sleepers be this season? As implied, that's a tough call.\n\nCreate or join a fantasy hockey league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today!\nSign up today!\nMore than ever, a winning fantasy strategy can be lifted from the world of tandems. When one emerges and dominates, it's a low-cost draft investment that can lead to championships (think Ullmark). But even if the time split remains, goaltenders can earn fantasy value -- Ilya Samsonov placed 108th overall last season with only 50.2% crease share and Filip Gustavsson was 81st overall with only 46.5% crease share.\nWe've listed the teams below most likely to use a tandem this season. Some are more likely than others and some are just a guess given the current status of their goaltenders. There's also a chance we missed some that could emerge. But when doing your draft shopping for your crease, don't overlook the potential value of a goaltender projected to get just 50% of the crease share.\nRelevant stats for each goaltender include their crease share from last season, their overall ranking for fantasy, their fantasy points per 60 minutes, and their average draft position so far this draft season. Remember that an ADP higher than about 220 means they are not being drafted in most ESPN leagues.\nLinus Ullmark: 58.9% crease share, fourth overall fantasy points, 5.38 fantasy points per game (FPP60), 38.2 average draft position (ADP)\nJeremy Swayman: 41.1% crease share, 144th overall, 4.04 FPP60, 108.6 ADP\nThis is the potential tandem that will offer the most headaches for fantasy managers. Ullmark blew away the field last season and would be a no-brainer first-round fantasy pick if we knew he was going to do it again. But so many offseason changes, not the least of which was the retirement of Patrice Bergeron, leaves a lot of questions. Are the Bruins as good defensively? Do they win as frequently? But even beyond those questions, Swayman earned himself a raise and a chance to prove he has a long-term future as a starter for the club.\nI would not advise paying the premium for Ullmark given the question marks, but if he falls in your lap closer to the 70th-overall pick, I could get on board. Given that Swayman is on the weak side of the tandem, his draft price of 108th on average is also on the high end. But let's be clear: Both of these goaltenders have the potential to be fantasy difference-markers in 2023-24. The problem is that we can't say that with heaps of confidence for either one.\nAdin Hill: 33.7% crease share, 451st overall, 3.02 FPP60, 211.3 ADP\nLogan Thompson: 49.1% crease share, 248th overall, 2.99 FPP60, 241.9 ADP\n\nChoose your league size, customize the scoring and set the rules you want to create the fantasy hockey league you want to play in.\nCreate your custom league for free!\nNeither goaltender was a staple of fantasy clubs for most of last season, though Thompson had some nice runs earlier in the campaign. But we all know what Hill did after the regular season in leading the Golden Knights to the Stanley Cup. There's an argument to be made that this isn't a tandem coming into the season, with Hill earning a massive raise, but Hill has never played more than 27 games in an NHL season before, so it's hard to call him a workhorse starter at this stage.\nThis will probably be a \"hot-hand\" crease, with whichever goaltender is having a solid run getting the lion's share of starts. After Hill was so dominant in the postseason, he would be my preference for a fantasy team. That said, there is a chance you can secure both later in drafts and have the crease of the defending champions locked up on your roster.\nStuart Skinner: 58.9% crease share, 132nd overall, 2.86 FPP60, 158.0 ADP\nJack Campbell: 41.1% crease share, 627th overall, 1.29 FPP60, 229.0 ADP\nThis tandem, like the Golden Knights, had a flip-flop from the regular season to the postseason. Skinner was the hero in the regular season, taking the starting job away from Campbell and keeping the Oilers on track for the playoffs. But Skinner stumbled in the postseason, with Campbell coming on in relief multiple times and not looking too bad. That narrative from the playoffs was arguably enough for a soft reset on whose crease this is coming into 2023-24.\nThe Oilers should win plenty of games with their overpowered offense and upgraded defense, but who is going to be in the crease for most of those wins? Skinner's ADP is very palatable, but you shouldn't completely count out Campbell at this stage. In fact, this might be an old school insurance scenario in which drafting Skinner means you should target Campbell in the final rounds to play it safe. There is value to be had here, as the Oilers are a 50-win team these days.\nStarting your own league is easier than ever!

Sign up for free today be the commish!\nFrederik Andersen: 40.1% crease share, 430th overall, 2.34 FPP60, 155.6 ADP\nAntti Raanta: 31.5% crease share, 339th overall, 3.54 FPP60, 230.3 ADP\nPyotr Kochetkov: 28.4% crease share, 506th overall, 2.78 FPP60, 211.1 ADP\nThis is probably the messiest of the creases in the NHL, but also one of the best for a goaltender to generate fantasy value. When both Andersen and Raanta were hurt last season, Kochetkov had a chance to show he could do the job in net. But the rookie faded with his chances later in the season, ultimately leaving the Hurricanes to decide to re-sign both Andersen and Raanta on fairly short-term deals. Kochetkov, now 24, can be sent down to the AHL without risking waivers, so he'll be the No. 3 goaltender for the Canes this season.\nThen there's the Andersen or Raanta debate. Raanta was the better goaltender of the two last season, posting better ratios and almost as many wins in fewer starts, but we are only two years removed from when Andersen finished 24th overall in fantasy in 2021-22 with 3.85 FPP60.\nHealth will be the first and foremost concern, as Andersen and Raanta were both fragile last season and the season prior (recall that Andersen missed the 2021-22 playoffs). That said, the Hurricanes wouldn't invest in Andersen and Raanta again unless they thought one of them could be the guy for at least one more season with Kochetkov still waiver eligible. Andersen's ADP is actually trending low if he ends up getting the bulk of starts here, which is the most likely scenario.\nCam Talbot: 40.1% crease share, 587th overall, 1.57 FPP60 (with Ottawa Senators), 219.5 ADP\nPheonix Copley: 42.2% crease share, 351st overall, 2.56 FPP60, 230.2 ADP\nAs much as Copley saved the Kings from themselves last season, he apparently didn't do enough to get a clear shot at the starter's gig yet. Copley was a huge stabilizer for the Kings last season, winning twice as many games as anyone else on the roster. But his ratios weren't great and faded down the stretch. The Kings brought in Joonas Korpisalo at the trade deadline, but Korpisalo opted for the Ottawa Senators in the offseason. The natural choice from there? Sign the Senators goaltender from last season. Cam Talbot had a rough year, earning almost no fantasy value, and is now 36 years old. The age is a major concern, as Talbot is past the spot on the goaltender curve where they usually remain productive for fantasy. But Copley, adequate, wasn't exactly changing the game for fantasy managers in his 37 games last season.\nTalbot hasn't had as much wear and tear as some other 36-year-old goaltenders, spending a lot of his career as a backup. So there is a world in which he can pull out another solid season behind a solid squad. Copley doesn't have a lot of upside, so the ideal situation here is Talbot hanging on for another year of value and getting the bulk of starts. He's the one to take a chance on.\nVitek Vanecek: 59.0% crease share, 111th overall, 3.08 FPP60, 116.2 ADP\nAkira Schmid: 18.2% crease share, 574th overall, 3.48 FPP60, 228.4 ADP\nJordan Binnington: 71.4% crease share, 541st overall, 1.00 FPP60, 228.1 ADP\nJoel Hofer: 6.4% crease share, 805th overall, 2.16 FPP60, 230.0, ADP\nNeither of these teams look like they will have a tandem on paper. But Schmid and Hofer have both shown glimpses and are both 23 coming into the season, which is about the age goaltenders really start coming on. If you are drafting Vanecek, Schmid is a good idea to handcuff. You probably shouldn't be looking at Binnington for your crease, but Hofer has upside if he pushes for more time.\nReady to play?
