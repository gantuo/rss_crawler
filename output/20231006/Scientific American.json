{"title": "Ancient Footprints Affirm People Lived in the Americas More Than 20,000 Years Ago", "date": "2023-10-05 18:15:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nA new study suggests humans arrived in the Americas before the height of the last ice age more than 20,000 years ago\nFossilized human footprints found in New Mexico’s White Sands National Park were almost certainly made more than 20,000 years ago, during the height of the last ice age, according to new research. The study, published on Thursday in Science, overthrows decades of thinking about when humans arrived in North America.\nThe researchers determined the ages of pollen grains and tiny quartz crystals in sediments beside the footprints, which are buried a few feet below the surface. The work confirms a 2021 study’s findings, which were based on radiocarbon dates from aquatic plant seeds in the sediments. The new results “are statistically indistinguishable from the seed ages,” says Jeff Pigati, a geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey and co-lead author of the new study. “We’ve now got three different dating techniques—radiocarbon dating of the seeds, radiocarbon dating of the pollens and luminescence dating of the quartz—that all show people were there.”\nThe 2021 announcement of the astonishingly ancient age of the footprints, which were found alongside a dried-up lake in the park, created controversy among archaeologists. Until then, many scientists had thought that the Clovis people became the first known Americans when they arrived from the north about 13,000 years ago, as the ice sheets across North America were retreating. (The Clovis are named after a town in New Mexico where their stone spear points were unearthed in the 1930s, but their artifacts have since been found throughout Central and North America.)\nThe White Sands footprints, however, suggest humans had already lived in New Mexico for thousands of years by the time the Clovis culture began.\nSkeptics questioned the dating method used in the 2021 study, which measured the levels of radioactive carbon 14 in seeds of the freshwater plant Ruppia cirrhosa—also known as spiral ditchgrass—in layers of sediment above and below the footprints. The critics argued water might have flowed through ancient rocks before it was absorbed by the seeds and thereby transmitted carbon that could make them seem older than they really were.\nBut the alternative dating methods refute that idea, says co-lead study author Kathleen Springer, a USGS geologist. “It’s a paradigm-shattering result,” she says. “People were in New Mexico during the Last Glacial Maximum, when the massive ice sheets farther north were [impassable]—that just flies in the face of all ideas about migrations and migratory routes,” she adds, referring to the last ice age’s peak, which occurred between 26,000 and 20,000 years ago.\nIn the new study, the researchers determined the radiocarbon age of microscopic pollen grains in the sediment layers, which hadn’t grown in the lake water. They also found the pollen came from plants that no longer grow in the area. “There’s pollen from pine and spruce and fir, which grow at much higher elevations today,” Springer says. “So the flora indicates that ecosystem extended down to the valley floor 20,000 years ago.”\nThe researchers also dated the sediments with a technique called optically stimulated luminescence, which can determine when minerals were last exposed to daylight. Samples for the technique must be processed in the dark, which the scientists achieved by hammering tubes into the buried sediments and studying them under red light that wouldn’t affect the dating, Pigati says. They then measured the almost imperceptible glow of quartz grains in the samples under specific frequencies of light, and the resulting dates matched those from the radiocarbon method, he says.\nThe new dates confirm the picture of a now vanished landscape at White Sands more than 20,000 years ago, when camels, elephants and giant sloths roamed beside a lake and were probably prey for human hunters. And the human footprints suggest people arrived there up to 30,000 years ago, before the ice sheets made migration from the north impossible.\nSome of the White Sands footprints appear on the surface as “ghost tracks,\" which are only visible when the ground is damp. Scientists think they are caused by water evaporating above fossilized footprints that are buried deeper underground. The team dug a trench in the soil to reveal the buried footprints and take samples for testing. “There are thousands of megafaunal and human footprints at White Sands,” Springer explains. “On some days you can’t see anything, but when the moisture content is just right, they fully pop to your eye.”\nGeologist Cynthia Liutkus-Pierce of Appalachian State University, who has studied ancient human footprints in Tanzania and wasn’t involved in the new White Sands research, says the study further supports the presence of humans in North America during the last ice age. “This is exciting and will certainly have scientists rethinking how humans interacted with the North American environment during the [Last Glacial Maximum],” she says.\nAnthropologist Kimberly Foecke of the Smithsonian Institution, who also wasn’t involved in the study, is now “reasonably convinced” of the antiquity of the footprints.* “These results add to the still scant but growing evidence of human presence in the Americas around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum,” she says.\n*Editor’s Note (10/5/23): This sentence was edited after posting.

{"title": "10,000 Pre-Columbian Structures Could Be Hidden beneath Amazon Rain Forest", "date": "2023-10-05 18:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nIf this new estimate holds up, scientists have yet to identify the vast majority of earthworks strewn across the Amazon\nIn the millennia before European colonizers invaded the Amazon rain forest, throngs of Indigenous people moved mountains of dirt to create some 10,000 yet-to-be-identified earthworks across the region.\nThat’s according to new research published on Thursday in Science that identifies two dozen sites where massive amounts of dirt formed circular and rectangular geoglyphs, settlements and religious sites. Based on what the researchers knew about such structures, they estimated the huge number of these mysterious constructions that are likely hidden somewhere beneath still unsearched forest. The model supports theories that hold the Amazon, which covers a huge swath of South America, was densely populated before colonization, and it may strengthen political efforts to uphold the modern sovereignty of the forest’s Indigenous inhabitants.\nTo look for these sites, the researchers found data gathered for other studies of biomass in the northern, central and southern regions of the Amazon rain forest. Those studies relied on a so-called light detection and ranging (lidar) system that bounces an airborne laser off Earth’s surface as it passes overhead, measuring trees’ canopies but also revealing the ground below them. “We thought, ‘Maybe the ground can tell us some stories about the archaeology as well,’” says Vinícius Peripato, a doctoral candidate in remote sensing at Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research and co-lead author of the new study. “At the beginning, it was a complete shot in the dark; we had no idea if we would find anything.”\nBut in that initial data, which represent less than one tenth of 1 percent of the Amazon’s total area, he and his colleagues found 24 novel earthworks to add to the nearly 1,000 previously known examples. The new sites are between 500 and 1,500 years old, and they include a fortified village, other settlement sites and religious structures, Peripato says. The fortified village had a central plaza and would have been part of a local urban network in the southern Amazon, while the geoglyphs included a cluster of ringlike designs. (Geoglyphs are a type of land art in which dirt is shaped into designs that can be viewed from overhead.)\nNext, the researchers used computer modeling to analyze known earthwork sites and predict their spread across the Amazon. That work considered a range of geographical factors such as distance to water, elevation and soil type (sandy soils, for instance, make short-lived earthworks). That work yielded the estimate that there are at least 10,000 earthworks—perhaps even twice that many—hidden across the Amazon. To date, scientists have only found about 1,000 such sites.\nThe sheer magnitude of that estimate supports previous calculations of a pre-Columbian population of eight million to 10 million in the Amazon, says Eduardo Neves, an archaeologist at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, who was not involved in the new research. He’s confident in those population assessments even if the true number of hidden earthworks isn’t quite 10,000. “To be honest, it’s hard to evaluate that number,” he says of the study’s earthwork prediction. “But I think it’s not off the mark; I think it’s a good number.”\nAnd the experience of archaeologists who study the ancient Maya—and have used lidar to uncover entire networks of cities hidden in the jungle in Central America—suggests that as lidar observations of the area develop, their colleagues now beginning such work in Amazonia will indeed find a trove of new sites. “We thought the Maya area was very well studied, but when we started to do lidar work [there], we had lots of surprises,” says Takeshi Inomata, an archaeologist at the University of Arizona, who was not involved in the Science study. “I think there will be more of those surprises in Amazonia.”\nYet all three researchers, however, say that the importance of the study isn’t so much about the precise number of sites. Rather it’s about the scale of human involvement in the Amazon rain forest. Neves argues that the Amazon is not a “natural” region that is purely produced by plants and nonhuman animals and is instead a “biocultural” one that is defined by the interaction of humans with nature. “There’s a still-common popular perception that the Amazon is a vast, wild expanse, but that’s not really true,” Inomata says. “This study really shows well that there was a lot of involvement of humans in this environment.”\nFor instance, the scientists also studied which trees were commonly found near earthworks and noted species that include the Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) and the breadnut (Brosimum alicastrum). That analysis suggests people were cultivating these trees—and their tasty offerings—at sites they frequented. It’s both another clue archaeologists can use to target their search for earthworks and a clear form of people leaving their mark on the forest they lived in.\nThat mark may have real political consequences for their descendants, who are fighting to hold on to the Amazon in the face of agricultural interests and others that could infringe on the forest. Researchers say that the new study supports Indigenous people’s claims of having permeated the Amazon and making it their own, which can strengthen their chances of gaining official stewardship of the forest. “It’s impossible to disentangle the Amazon that we know today from the lives and the history of the Indigenous people who have been living there for millennia,” Neves says. “There’s no future for the forest without a future for the people who have been living there for the last millennia.”\nMeghan Bartels is a science journalist and news reporter for Scientific American who is based in New York City.\nUyunkar Domingo Peas Nampichkai, Juan Manuel Crespo and Jesús Chávez | Opinion\nEmma Bryce\nJennifer Nalewicki and LiveScience\nDiscover world-changing science.

{"title": "95 Percent of Penicillin Allergy Diagnoses Are Wrong. A New Test Could Help", "date": "2023-10-05 17:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nA simplified penicillin allergy test could help reduce false positives, but doctors face challenges in using it\nIf you’ve been told your whole life that you have a penicillin allergy, you’d be forgiven for not giving it a second thought. About one in 10 people in the U.S. report having this condition, making it the most common drug allergy in the country—and seemingly ordinary. In reality, 95 percent of those diagnosed with a penicillin allergy aren’t actually allergic. The impact of the sheer number of misdiagnoses is worthy of attention. When treating patients who have an allergy to the antibiotic on their medical record, doctors must turn to other antibiotics that are less effective and more expensive and can lead to serious health complications.\nA small contingent of health care professionals is working to remove the millions of false penicillin allergy diagnoses from individuals’ medical records. Experts say that educating their medical colleagues and the public about the rampant number of falsely diagnosed penicillin allergies and using an easier new test could curb the issue. But removing so many diagnoses from the health record and changing the larger public concern around penicillin allergy may be challenging. Shaking an incorrect penicillin allergy diagnosis has proved difficult among people who have held onto one “longer than a pet, even longer than a student loan,” says Christopher Bland, an associate professor in the College of Pharmacy at the University of Georgia. “It almost becomes a part of them.”\nPenicillin is not just the name of a single antibiotic—it is also a blanket term for the family of drugs containing chemical relatives of penicillin such as amoxicillin or methicillin. Penicillin antibiotics, which kill bacteria by preventing them from building a cell wall, are used to treat various illnesses such as pneumonia, meningitis, skin infections and dental abscesses. They are also the first-choice treatment for common childhood infections.\nWhen doctors ramped up penicillin treatments in the early 1940s, reports of adverse reactions, such as hives, soon emerged. In 1949 doctors reported the first case of penicillin-caused death from anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that lowers blood pressure and impairs breathing. “That was a shock that both the public and health care workers of all types never really forgot,” says Richard Olans, an infectious disease expert at MelroseWakefield Hospital in Massachusetts. Hives and anaphylaxis are true allergic reactions that result from the immune system producing antibodies that target penicillin like it would if it were fighting a pathogen such as a cold or flu virus. These reactions are rare.\nMost people are misdiagnosed with a penicillin allergy in childhood when they take the drug to treat illnesses such as ear infections. Many kids develop a rash, which can appear like an allergic reaction to penicillin but is actually related to viral infections that often occur alongside bacterial ones. “Now we have so many studies that show that these kids are not ever truly allergic when they get these small rashes,” says Ana-Maria Copaescu, an allergy and immunology specialist at McGill University Health Center in Quebec.\nAdditionally, common side effects of penicillin, such as headaches, diarrhea and nausea, are often mistaken as an allergic response, Bland explains. “Most of the time, the patient has the reaction in their mind,” he says. “Then they just report it as an allergy.” People may also falsely get a penicillin allergy diagnosis because a parent or other relative was allergic.\n“There are a lot of myths about drug allergy that stem back to the discovery of penicillin,” says Elizabeth Phillips, an immunology specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\nPenicillin allergy testing has helped untangle real allergies from misdiagnoses. The current gold standard test—only conducted in specialized allergy clinics—involves pricking the skin and injecting a small amount of penicillin. If the person doesn’t react to the skin prick, they are given a small oral dose of an antibiotic in the penicillin family, usually amoxicillin. Should they tolerate the oral dose, the penicillin allergy can be removed from their medical record.\nTesting has helped doctors realize how few people are truly allergic. Studies have shown that even among individuals who’ve experienced anaphylaxis, 80 percent lose penicillin antibodies after a decade. This is a huge deal for the long-term health and future antibiotic treatment of potentially millions of people who could take the drug safely. “I think one of the worst things to have on your profile as a patient is a penicillin allergy,” Bland says.\nThe alternative medications doctors prescribe to people with a penicillin allergy have more side effects and are less effective. They are usually less targeted, so using them is like casting a net to catch a pathogen rather than shooting an arrow at it. That means they can kill off good bacteria and lead to the overgrowth of potentially dangerous ones such as Clostridium difficile or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Less-targeted antibiotics also give more bacteria the chance to evolve ways to survive, spurring new antibiotic-resistant strains that can have a wider impact on the human population.\nIn addition to the health burdens, there’s also a financial one. A 2018 study found that hospitalized people in several countries, including the U.S., with a documented penicillin allergy paid up to $4,250 more for their visit. Kimberly Blumenthal, an allergist and immunologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, co-authored a 2021 study showing that the cost of having a penicillin allergy overwhelmingly outweighed the cost of running a penicillin allergy test because the alternative antibiotics are more expensive.\nBut even after correcting the penicillin allergy label with the test, it can persist on many people’s health record. Getting rid of an erroneous penicillin allergy diagnosis is a multifaceted issue: “It’s electronic. It’s culture. It’s fear,” says Rita Olans, a nurse practitioner and an associate professor at the Massachusetts General Hospital Institute of Health Professions. Incompletely clearing a penicillin allergy from a person’s electronic health record can cause it to follow them from doctor to doctor. Bland and Copaescu both give people a physical card to show other doctors they tested negative for a penicillin allergy in case it wasn’t completely cleared from the electronic health record. Many people are still afraid to use the drug even after they’ve been cleared, however. One study found that 41 percent of people who had been told they had a penicillin allergy but later tested negative still avoided penicillin.\nMany doctors agree that educating enough people on how to identify potentially incorrect penicillin allergy diagnoses and perform tests is a significant issue. Olans is teaching her nursing students to take more complete allergy histories that could help root out potentially erroneous ones. But even then, allergy tests must be carried out in specialized allergy clinics that are inaccessible to much of the population. “I think the challenges right now are really related to the bottleneck of the process occurring in our specialty clinics,” Phillips says.\nTo try and address the testing bottleneck, Blumenthal developed an algorithm that evaluates patient histories and guides health care workers on the best antibiotics to use so that they can triage the patients that should be sent for allergy testing. The algorithm is now integrated with the electronic health record across all hospital sites in her health system.\nIn people who are unlikely to have a severe penicillin allergy, doctors may streamline the testing process by skipping the skin test and using just the oral dose. People in this low-risk group, which includes approximately 98 percent of penicillin allergies, experienced only mild reactions or unrelated symptoms when given the drug. Oral tests were previously considered riskier because they could cause a severe reaction, but a recent large randomized controlled trial led by Copaescu showed for the first time that oral doses are as effective and safe as skin tests for people who have never had a severe allergic reaction. “More and more, colleagues and allergists that work in a hospital setting are using this direct oral [test] based on studies like ours,” says Copaescu, who published the results of the trial in July.\nCopaescu says that the oral test alone is cheaper and less painful for patients and doesn’t require specialized training. “It expanded who was doing direct [oral tests] in low-risk patients,” says Blumenthal, who wasn’t involved in the trial. With the simplified test, more people could theoretically be freed of their incorrectly diagnosed drug allergy. Blumenthal’s next step is to work with primary care doctors and their patients to use this type of testing in primary care clinics and verify penicillin allergies proactively rather than at the time people need the drugs most.\nBland sees performing proactive testing as a part of routine care, like vaccination, as the ultimate goal. This way, people can have penicillin on standby if they need it. Many people will encounter a bacterial infection in their lives, Bland says. “You’re going to need an antibiotic,” he adds. “It’s very, very likely. And it could be the one that saves your life.”\nAndrew Chapman is a Truckee, Calif.–based freelance science writer who covers life sciences and the environment.\nAmanda Montañez\nKaren Hopkin\nThe Editors\nJaimie Seaton\nDiscover world-changing science.

But 18 states, including hurricane-prone Florida, have no flood disclosure requirements\nCLIMATEWIRE | Prospective homebuyers in more states are being told of the flood risk and history of the properties they want to purchase thanks to an uptick in flood disclosure requirements.\nA new analysis by the National Resources Defense Council shows that the number of states with strong flood disclosure policies has jumped to seven from four since 2021. North Carolina soon could become the eighth.\nThe NRDC and others have urged states to require the disclosure during property sales to help buyers decide whether to purchase flood insurance, protect the property or skip the deal. Research has shown disclosure can devalue flood-prone properties and discourage development in risky areas.\n“More states are recognizing that flood disclosure is a crucial tool,” said Joel Scata, an NRDC water and climate attorney who wrote the recent analysis. “States see it as a good way to help protect people.”\nFlood disclosure is increasingly important as climate change causes more frequent and intense flooding, advocates say. They compare flood disclosure to the federal requirement that property owners tell prospective buyers and tenants about any lead-based paint in a home.\nThe three states with new disclosure policies are New York, New Jersey and South Carolina. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) signed the law Sept. 22, calling it a “monumental step” toward protecting New Yorkers from the effects of climate change.\nNew York and New Jersey had received F grades from the NRDC in its previous analysis, released in 2021, because neither state required any disclosure of flood history and risk. New York had a disclosure requirement, but sellers could skip it by giving buyers a $500 credit on a purchase price. The new law removes the option.\nBoth states now have laws requiring disclosure for prospective buyers and renters.\nSouth Carolina previously received a C from the NRDC, indicating its flood disclosure policy was “adequate.”\nThe new policy was implemented in June by the South Carolina Real Estate Commission, a state agency that expanded the information required on its mandatory disclosure statement.\nThe North Carolina Real Estate Commission is considering a similar move after being petitioned by groups including the Southern Environmental Law Center and the North Carolina Justice Center. The commission is reviewing hundreds of public comments on a revised disclosure form.\nFour states — Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas — retained the top ratings they received in the 2021 NRDC report. Texas expanded its disclosure law in 2022 to apply to rental properties.\nThe top flood disclosure policies require prospective buyers and tenants to receive a form describing whether a home has sustained flood damage, is in a flood zone, is required to be covered by flood insurance or has received any federal money for flood repair.\nDespite the increase in flood disclosure, 18 states remain without any disclosure requirement, including Florida, the nation’s third-largest state and most vulnerable to hurricanes, and Alabama and Georgia, according to the NRDC report.\n\"Florida homebuyers are greatly disadvantaged when it comes to learning of a home's past flood history or potential for future flooding,\" the NRDC report says. The report says a disclosure form created by Florida Realtors is voluntary.\nScata of the NRDC said Florida is showing signs of progress. Four disclosure bills were introduced in the Florida Legislature during its session earlier this year, including one measure that had bipartisan sponsorship. All the bills failed, but Scata said, “You’ll start to see more states push disclosure laws.”\nMany of the states with no disclosure requirement are in New England or the Mountain time zone.\nThe NRDC score card is one of the few analyses of flood disclosure laws in each state.\nIn 2022, the Federal Emergency Management Agency published a reportthat rates each state on a 10-point scale based on the number of required flood disclosures.\nFEMA has been advocating for states to improve flood disclosure and is considering imposing its own requirement, though it is unclear how the agency would do so. Insurance is regulated by state agencies and not the federal government.\nFannie Mae urged FEMA to require flood disclosure, saying that flood awareness \"remains low\" and the government is \"by far the most trusted source\" for flood information.\nFEMA’s report was similar to the NRDC analysis in 2021 and gave Louisiana a perfect score of 10, followed by Texas with a score of 8.\nReprinted from E&E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC.

{"title": "The Latest AI Chatbots Can Handle Text, Images and Sound. Here's How", "date": "2023-10-05 16:30:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNew “multimodal” AI programs can do much more than respond to text—they also analyze images and chat aloud\nSlightly more than 10 months ago OpenAI’s ChatGPT was first released to the public. Its arrival ushered in an era of nonstop headlines about artificial intelligence and accelerated the development of competing large language models (LLMs) from Google, Meta and other tech giants. Since that time, these chatbots have demonstrated an impressive capacity for generating text and code, albeit not always accurately. And now multimodal AIs that are capable of parsing not only text but also images, audio, and more are on the rise.\nOpenAI released a multimodal version of ChatGPT, powered by its LLM GPT-4, to paying subscribers for the first time last week, months after the company first announced these capabilities. Google began incorporating similar image and audio features to those offered by the new GPT-4 into some versions of its LLM-powered chatbot, Bard, back in May. Meta, too, announced big strides in multimodality this past spring. Though it is in its infancy, the burgeoning technology can perform a variety of tasks.\nScientific American tested out two different chatbots that rely on multimodal LLMs: a version of ChatGPT powered by the updated GPT-4 (dubbed GPT-4 with vision, or GPT-4V) and Bard, which is currently powered by Google’s PaLM 2 model. Both can both hold hands-free vocal conversations using only audio, and they can describe scenes within images and decipher lines of text in a picture.\nThese abilities have myriad applications. In our test, using only a photograph of a receipt and a two-line prompt, ChatGPT accurately split a complicated bar tab and calculated the amount owed for each of four different people—including tip and tax. Altogether, the task took less than 30 seconds. Bard did nearly as well, but it interpreted one “9” as a “0,” thus flubbing the final total. In another trial, when given a photograph of a stocked bookshelf, both chatbots offered detailed descriptions of the hypothetical owner’s supposed character and interests that were almost like AI-generated horoscopes. Both identified the Statue of Liberty from a single photograph, deduced that the image was snapped from an office in lower Manhattan and offered spot-on directions from the photographer’s original location to the landmark (though ChatGPT’s guidance was more detailed than Bard’s). And ChatGPT also outperformed Bard in accurately identifying insects from photographs.\nFor disabled communities, the applications of such tech are particularly exciting. In March OpenAI started testing its multimodal version of GPT-4 through the company Be My Eyes, which provides a free description service through an app of the same name for blind and low-sighted people. The early trials went well enough that Be My Eyes is now in the process rolling out the AI-powered version of its app to all its users. “We are getting such exceptional feedback,” says Jesper Hvirring Henriksen, chief technology officer of Be My Eyes. At first there were lots of obvious issues, such as poorly transcribed text or inaccurate descriptions containing AI hallucinations. Henriksen says that OpenAI has improved on those initial shortcomings, however—errors are still present but less common. As a result, “people are talking about regaining their independence,” he says.\nIn this new wave of chatbots, the tools go beyond words. Yet they’re still based around artificial intelligence models that were built on language. How is that possible? Although individual companies are reluctant to share the exact underpinnings of their models, these corporations aren’t the only groups working on multimodal artificial intelligence. Other AI researchers have a pretty good sense of what’s happening behind the scenes.\nThere are two primary ways to get from a text-only LLM to an AI that also responds to visual and audio prompts, says Douwe Kiela, an adjunct professor at Stanford University, where he teaches courses on machine learning, and CEO of the company Contextual AI. In the more basic method, Kiela explains, AI models are essentially stacked on top of one another. A user inputs an image into a chatbot, but the picture is filtered through a separate AI that was built explicitly to spit out detailed image captions. (Google has had algorithms like this for years.) Then that text description is fed back to the chatbot, which responds to the translated prompt.\nIn contrast, “the other way is to have a much tighter coupling,” Kiela says. Computer engineers can insert segments of one AI algorithm into another by combining the computer code infrastructure that underlies each model. According to Kiela, it’s “sort of like grafting one part of a tree onto another trunk.” From there, the grafted model is retrained on a multimedia data set—including pictures, images with captions and text descriptions alone—until the AI has absorbed enough patterns to accurately link visual representations and words together. It’s more resource-intensive than the first strategy, but it can yield an even more capable AI. Kiela theorizes that Google used the first method with Bard, while OpenAI may have relied on the second to create GPT-4. This idea potentially accounts for the differences in functionality between the two models.\nRegardless of how developers fuse their different AI models together, under the hood, the same general process is occurring. LLMs function on the basic principle of predicting the next word or syllable in a phrase. To do that, they rely on a “transformer” architecture (the “T” in GPT). This type of neural network takes something such as a written sentence and turns it into a series of mathematical relationships that are expressed as vectors, says Ruslan Salakhutdinov, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University. To a transformer neural net, a sentence isn’t just a string of words—it’s a web of connections that map out context. This gives rise to much more humanlike bots that can grapple with multiple meanings, follow grammatical rules and imitate style. To combine or stack AI models, the algorithms have to transform different inputs (be they visual, audio or text) into the same type of vector data on the path to an output. In a way, it’s taking two sets of code and “teaching them to talk to each other,” Salakhutdinov says. In turn, human users can talk to these bots in new ways.\nMany researchers view the present moment as the start of what’s possible. Once you begin aligning, integrating and improving different types of AI together, rapid advances are bound to keep coming. Kiela envisions a near future where machine learning models can easily respond to, analyze and generate videos or even smells. Salakhutdinov suspects that “in the next five to 10 years, you’re just going to have your personal AI assistant.” Such a program would be able to navigate everything from full customer service phone calls to complex research tasks after receiving just a short prompt.\nMultimodal AI is not the same as artificial general intelligence, a holy grail goalpost of machine learning wherein computer models surpass human intellect and capacity. Multimodal AI is an “important step” toward it, however, says James Zou, a computer scientist at Stanford University. Humans have an interwoven array of senses through which we understand the world. Presumably, to reach general AI, a computer would need the same.\nAs impressive and exciting as they are, multimodal models have many of the same problems as their singly focused predecessors, Zou says. “The one big challenge is the problem of hallucination,” he notes. How can we trust an AI assistant if it might falsify information at any moment? Then there’s the question of privacy.

{"title": "Nobel Prize Debate Misses the Mark on the Real Culprits Ignoring Scientific Merit", "date": "2023-10-05 15:30:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nThe furor over a Nobel Prize winner’s derailed career lets scientists off the hook for their own responsibilities to fix a broken academic reward system\nNobel Prize announcements have become our own little nerd Super Bowl, an Academy Awards for the pocket-protector crowd. They are the subject of prediction markets and office pools, debated over teatime and happy hour. We ask, what will win: quantum dots, or protein folding? For one week during the year, we are all experts on what breakthroughs warrant our attention.\nAt best, these conversations are fun, even insightful—teachers often discard their syllabi for a day to discuss the technical advances behind the discoveries, and their wider implications. But less productive exchanges also persist, exemplified by the furor over the 2023 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology, given to Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman, for their discoveries that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID.\nReactions to the announcement erupted moments after the prize was announced, much of it focusing on the story behind Karikó’s dismissal from the University of Pennsylvania in 2013. This response highlights how criticisms of the Nobel Prize continue to miss the mark, and are often obscured by scapegoating, moral superiority, and public posturing. What we need instead are deeper, more uncomfortable conversations about innovation, inclusion, and merit.\nNobel announcement disagreements often focus on whether the recipients deserved it, or not. But the 2023 Medicine and Physiology prize has received near universal applause: the science that it rewards has already saved the lives of many millions, and (maybe most importantly) has transformed how we think about emerging infectious diseases and other diseases. But the real intrigue surrounds its backstory. Karikó was forced to retire from her position at the University of Pennsylvania in 2013. The much-discussed reasons are familiar villains: the inability to secure major grant funding from the large agencies, and other markers of success in the biomedicine machine.\nThe news has spawned a necessary community reflection. Some suggest that our instruments for evaluating science are hopelessly broken in academia. Relatedly, those in biotech emphasize that the work demonstrates how private industry can deliver important discovery at a speed that academia cannot. Others highlight the role of sexism, where women in science are rarely respected when it comes to intrepid ideas. In the face of this, some suggest specific interventions: that the University of Pennsylvania should apologize, or at least not take credit for the achievement, as “they” (the school or it’s officials) devalued her work. All these arguments are well-intentioned but are festooned with contradictions.\nFirst, there is the notion that the Nobel Prize equals vindication. Consider the contradiction. We are frustrated that Karikó was misjudged by a room full of people at a prestigious institution, the University of Pennsylvania. And yet, we celebrate her receiving a positive judgement from a room full of people at a prestigious institution, the Nobel Committee (notably, few know how either works). This cognitive dissonance tells us to like the subjective processes that give us the outcome that we want, and to dislike the equally subjective ones that don’t. Instead, we could be equally critical of both.  \nThis relates to the second problem: we ignore our collective complicity in a system that offers rewards based on dubious standards. For example, in identifying suitable graduate students or faculty, we have all almost surely missed out on worthy job candidates based on our own (even benign) preferences. One reason that we haven’t been held accountable for our poor decisions is that the people we denied haven’t (yet) won a Nobel Prize. The reality is even worse: our decisions probably prevented deserving scientists from ever having the chance.\nMy personal defense mechanism for overlooking? I conclude that they (the University of Pennsylvania in this case) were wrong for misjudging Karikó, but I’ve been fair and correct in all my own judgments. \nThis sort of hypocrisy is not only prevalent in science but is a near requirement, to make us feel better about the harm we might have caused. The more uncomfortable truth is that academic science has never been a trade that selects for or supports the best scientific minds in the world. Instead, it has been, and will be for the foreseeable future, an enterprise for smart people positioned within the right professional network, armed with vocabulary to make their ideas legible to influential scientists (not the public), who study things that are just interesting enough to not offend academic sensibilities. And many of us suspect that identities like gender and race (and others) can amplify the signals that trip those wires.\nIn my view, academic institutions are fairly transparent (though not enough) about the fact that the primary duty of their scientists is not to make the world better, but to develop a professional profile and raise funds. It is the job I signed up for, and I’ve reconciled this in the same way that I do with many institutions, say the U.S., with baggage: acknowledge the flaws, while leveraging the windows of privilege to do good. Hopefully, I can meaningfully change a thing or two about it in my lifetime. Thankfully, I’ve had dozens of remarkable mentors and friends who are doing just that, better than I ever could. \nBut it is the changing of a “thing or two” part where the do-gooder-rubber meets the selection-committee-road. I am certain about one thing: hurling invective at the University of Pennsylvania won’t fix academia’s flaws. Change only happens with personal reflection: how many students from nontraditional backgrounds have I ever advocated for? How often do I rely on credentials and proximity to power to make professional decisions? Do I rely on silly, hackable citation metrics to evaluate scientific impact? And how often does innovation truly factor into my evaluations of a scientist? \nThe questions make my heart hurt, mostly because I’m just another random scientist swimming against a tide that prefers that we all become fundraising automatons. In the meantime, I can draw inspiration from the lives of Nobel laureates. They contain thrilling tales of discovery, and lessons about creativity and resilience. The winners will be okay. Rather than hunting for villains in their stories, I’m better off using their inspiration and frustration to help find the next Frances Arnold, Carolyn Bertozzi, or Katalin Karikó, many struggling to find a way to participate in science.\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.\nC.

{"title": "Vaccine Scientist Warns Antiscience Conspiracies Have Become a Deadly, Organized Movement", "date": "2023-10-05 15:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nVaccinologist Peter Hotez explains how the movement to oppose science and scientists has gained power\nPeter Hotez is no stranger to scientific backlash. The esteemed pediatrician and vaccinologist has been working to develop vaccines for neglected tropical diseases for decades and has encountered fierce opposition to his work. But in recent years the backlash has gained momentum and spread beyond vaccines to science and scientists in general.\nHotez, who is dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, chronicles this movement in his new book The Deadly Rise of Anti-Science. The book traces Hotez’s experiences battling the false belief that vaccines cause autism (a condition that his daughter has), the highly partisan backlash to the COVID vaccines (a low-cost version of which Hotez and his colleagues helped develop) and the authoritarian roots of the antiscience movement.\nScientific American spoke with Hotez about the book, the experiences he’s had as a target of antiscience attacks and the things that should be done to combat such threats.\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\nWhy did you decide to write this book?\nI think one of the things the book does is: it helps connect a few dots. People call [the antiscience movement] “misinformation” or “the infodemic” as though it’s just random junk out there on the Internet or social media, and it’s not—it’s organized, it’s well-financed, and it’s politically motivated. It’s really its own ecosystem that’s doing a lot of damage to the country and to American science and scientists. And now it’s reached a new level. It’s become a lethal force. It’s the fact that [at least] 200,000 Americans needlessly perished [between June 2021 and March 2022] because they refused the COVID vaccine during the [Delta and Omicron COVID waves], and they were victims of this organized campaign.\nYour book discusses how the modern antiscience movement grew out of false claims in the late 1990s that vaccines cause autism, right?\nIn some ways, it’s a sequel to one of my previous books, Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism. So, you know, I have a daughter who has autism. As you point out, the original assertion was that vaccines cause autism. And in the previous book, I detailed the evidence showing that there’s no link. So I’ve been in this for a while, confronting antivaccine groups. But what I saw starting about a decade ago was a shift—maybe because we were taking some of the wind out of their sails around autism, [the people in these groups] needed a new thing. And the new thing was to become part of the American political landscape and link themselves up initially to the Republican Tea Party, even before the pandemic, around this concept of health freedom, medical freedom. And that’s what came off the rails during COVID.\nWhy do you feel compelled to speak out now?\nI’ve been the number one or two target of that movement for years or decades. And now I have an insight into how this is unfolding. It troubles me that it’s not only targeting science but scientists. I think it’s undermining the country because we’re a nation built on science and technology and on the greatness of our research universities and institutions, and they are under threat. I felt compelled to be kind of the tip of the spear, to sound that warning, because we’re seeing mostly silence from our university presidents and from our scientific societies. Even the National Academies [of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine] weren’t really out there. I think there was a kind of hope that it would just go away on its own. But we’ve seen from past experience that this kind of stuff doesn’t go away on its own. It’s got to be confronted.\nAre you concerned that confronting anti-vaxxers and antiscience people will only give them more attention?\nThat was the response from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] back in 2017 when I wrote about how the anti-vaxxers are winning. We’re not supposed to talk about it, or we’ll give it oxygen. But it’s got all the oxygen it needs. You might say, “Well, why write it now?” For two reasons: one, it’s become a killer movement. Think about the 200,000 Americans who died because of this—that’s a major societal lethal force right up there with anything else we might be concerned about as a society. And the second is the attacks on the individual scientists and the portrayal of scientists as enemies of the state. This is unacceptable. I mean, this is undermining our national security.\nIt's absurd that the people who are trying to protect us all from this deadly disease are the ones who are being attacked for it.\nYeah. I mean, what’s my crime? I helped develop a low-cost COVID vaccine technology that reached 100 million people and provided a proof of concept that was an alternative to the big pharma companies. It’s really unfortunate. And I think it’s going to get worse as we head into the 2024 election.\nDo you think Donald Trump’s presidency influenced the rise of antiscience attitudes?\nWhat’s happening now, I say in the book at the beginning, is actually not about Trump. Most of this got worse after Trump in 2021 to 2022. Now there’s this effort to rewrite history—maybe in part because I’ve called [antiscience politicians and influencers] out by saying 200,000 Americans died because of their disinformation campaign. They’re doubling down and trying to say, “No, it was the COVID vaccine that killed Americans, and the scientists made the COVID virus.” This revisionist history is playing out now with the [U.S. House of Representatives] hearings that we’re seeing in the [Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic], which are trying to parade prominent scientists in front of C-SPAN cameras to try to humiliate them. It’s very Stalin-like, very [similar to the] U.S.S.R. in the 1930s.\nThat’s an interesting analogy because the far right and the anti-vax movement have compared COVID vaccination efforts to the Nazis’ treatment of Jewish people during the Holocaust.\nIt’s totally offensive, right? I mean, trying to draw parallels between vaccinations and the Holocaust, and the heavy use of Nazi imagery—that, too, is a form of antisemitism. So there are a lot of antisemitic undercurrents. And [those making the comparisons] know I’m Jewish, so that’s also a component.\nDo you think that anti-vax and antisemitic groups overlap and strengthen each other?\nIn the Venn diagram, there’s not a complete overlap between the circles, but there’s definitely overlap. There’s a history to that too. People called what Einstein and Freud did “Jewish science,” so there’s that modern history of linking antiscience to antisemitism.\nThe big issue then is: Where do we go from here, now that we’ve got this sort of entire well-oiled, well-financed antiscience ecosystem? How do we begin addressing it and chipping away at it? That was one of the hardest things for me to get my arms around. What do you do? Because it’s a political movement. The scientific societies and national academies don’t want to talk about it because it takes them into an unpleasant place. I don’t like talking about it either. But you have to report it and describe it so you know what you’re dealing with because maybe it'll autocorrect eventually. But right now, it’s not going away.\nIn the book you also talk about how the U.S. is exporting anti-vax and antiscience sentiment around the world.\nThis is coming out of the authoritarian playbook, with devastating consequences. We’re seeing it not only in the U.S. but also in Brazil with [former president Jair Bolsonaro’s] regime or with [Prime Minister] Viktor Orbán in Hungary. This is part of how authoritarian regimes operate: you denigrate science and scientists.\nI think we’re seeing more of the globalization of what’s happening in the U.S. A lot of it’s not in the biomedical literature. It’s in local newspapers and that sort of thing. But there are enough pieces there that make me believe that this is certainly contaminating Canada and also Germany and Austria and France to some extent—and low- and middle-income countries as well. I think this is going to start affecting all immunizations, including childhood immunizations globally. I’m worried about measles and polio coming back.\nWhat’s happening now with the antiscience movement here in the U.S.?\nI worry about what’s going to happen as we head into the 2024 election. I worry about these House hearings—I think they’re going to ratchet up, and they’re going to continue to target scientists. I worry about what’s going on with some members of the Senate and the rhetoric coming out of the [presidential] campaign. I mean, you already have two prominent antivaccine activists running for president—Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and Ron DeSantis. What’s so chilling is that these are state-sanctioned attacks on science and scientists.\nYou’ve personally experienced some very threatening attacks and even physical confrontations. How do you deal with that?\nThese are multimodality attacks: it’s the threatening e-mails; it’s the stuff on social media. And Twitter’s gotten so awful in the past year that it’s just almost untenable. And then, you know, [people are] stalking me when I speak at scientific conferences or outside my home recently, so it is getting very, very troubling.\nWhat can be done to combat antiscience attitudes and support science and scientists?\nI don’t think the community of scientists by itself can solve this. We’re going to need help, both from the White House and the United Nations because this is now a politically motivated assault. So we need the White House, for instance, to treat this like any politically motivated attack on the country, whether it’s a cyberattack or global terrorism or nuclear proliferation.\nThe first step is bringing in people from the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice and the Department of State because of the role of Russia in amplifying the discord. I think we need an interagency task force [in the U.S.] and the same at the U.N. I don’t think the World Health Organization can solve this problem. I think this needs to go to the attention of the U.N. General Assembly and maybe the Security Council and NATO, perhaps, because it is a security threat, and it undermines democracies and the security of countries.\nTanya Lewis is a senior editor covering health and medicine at Scientific American.

{"title": "Should You Wake Someone from the Throes of a Nightmare?", "date": "2023-10-05 13:40:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNightmares are unpleasant, but waking someone in the midst of one isn’t the best way to handle them—here’s why\nYour bedmate is whimpering in their sleep and perhaps thrashing about. It looks like a nightmare. Should you wake them?\nNope, experts say. As terrible as whatever visions that are running through their head might be, waking someone from a nightmare is more likely to ensure that they’ll remember the bad dream. And if someone appears physically distressed in their sleep like this, it’s more likely that they’re having a night terror than a nightmare; night terrors are different neurological experiences.\nNightmares are a normal part of dreaming, says Deirdre Barrett, a dream researcher at Harvard Medical School and author of The Committee of Sleep (Oneiroi Press, 2001). They almost always happen in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the stage of sleep marked by brain activity that looks very similar to that of an awake brain.\n“Except for being scary, they look like every other dream,” Barrett says.\nDuring REM sleep, the brain areas responsible for long-term memory storage show altered activation, so people don’t tend to remember their nightmares unless those sleep tales are scary enough to wake them up. Once a dreamer awakens, their long-term memory regions come back on line. Most of the time, someone having a nightmare will be indistinguishable from a peaceful dreamer. During a nightmare, heart rate increases by seven beats per minute on average, says Michael Schredl, a dream and sleep researcher at the Central Institute of Mental Health in Germany. Otherwise the sleeper typically lies still in bed: during REM sleep, muscles are paralyzed, which keeps people from acting out their dreams.\nIf someone is moving around, talking in their sleep or sleepwalking while appearing distressed, it’s more likely a night terror, which occurs during non-REM sleep, Schredl says.\nNight terrors are particularly common among kids, says Leslie Ellis, a clinical counselor in British Columbia who treats patients with nightmares. “You shouldn’t wake them up because they’ll be disoriented,” Ellis says. “They won’t have any recollection of the episode if you don’t wake them up.”\nNightmares can be echoes of the stressful experiences people are having in their waking hours. During the early days of the COVID pandemic, people reported more nightmares, according to several studies on the topic. New themes also emerged, according to research published in the journal Somnologie in 2022, including those about sickness, confinement and bugs—the latter subject is perhaps a symbol of infection or contamination.\nPeople also sometimes seemed to be working through the new rules of the pandemic, says Anu-Katriina Pesonen, a psychological researcher at the University of Helsinki, who documented dream changes that occurred in early 2020. “The dreams were often reexperiences of new behavioral rules,” Pesonen says. “For example, hand shaking in a dream was vividly experienced as a major mistake. This could assist in learning new norms.”\nThe occasional scary dream is nothing to worry about, but frequent nightmares can sometimes be part of a larger psychological disorder. The good news, Barrett and Ellis say, is that these nightmares are remarkably treatable. The people who have the most trouble with nightmares, Barrett says, have often experienced trauma. They may relive their traumatic experiences, sometimes with the addition of even darker fears. These nightmares are often so alarming that they interrupt the person’s healing.\n“I’ve never heard anyone say they don’t mind having PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] nightmares much. They say things like, ‘It’s like having the trauma happen again, night after night,’” Barrett says.\nSome of these trauma-related nightmares can occur outside of REM sleep, Barrett says, suggesting that they’re more like PTSD flashbacks than like regular dreams. Waking someone from these nightmares isn’t a long-term solution, but people having them can be coached to take control of the dreams. There are different ways to do this. Some psychologists and counselors will simply talk a person through possible alternative endings for a nightmare. This can be anything from a magical rescue to the person saving themselves. In her practice, Ellis has patients relax into a sort of daydream where they rewrite the circumstances of the bad dream while making sure they feel safe and comfortable.\nIn a 2020 meta-analysis of studies, researchers found that this treatment, called “imagery rehearsal therapy,” was likely as effective as medications for ending post-traumatic nightmares. Anecdotally, the method can also work for repeated nightmares, or bad dreams that recur, sometimes for years.\n“I’ve worked with people who had the same dream for decades, but now the dream is different, or sometimes it doesn’t come back,” Ellis says.\nIt’s possible to try imagery rehearsal therapy on yourself, Ellis says. But, she adds, if your nightmares are particularly persistent or distressing, or if they’re the result of trauma, it’s best to seek professional help.\nStephanie Pappas is a freelance science journalist.

{"title": "A Chance Discovery Uncovered the Remarkable Life of One of the First Female Oceanographers", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nEight pages hidden in an archive led to the discovery of the story of Christine Essenberg\nChristine Essenberg had an unusual life and career trajectory. She was married, then divorced and earned her Ph.D. in zoology from the University of California, Berkeley, at age 41. She went on to become one of the early researchers at what is now the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. We know the story of Christine Essenberg only because of a serendipitous find.\nWhile searching in an archive jammed with the papers of male scientists, host Katie Hafner came across a slim folder, called “Folder 29,” in the back of a box at the University of California, San Diego, Library’s Special Collections & Archives. There were just eight pages inside to use as a jumping-off point to flesh out a life, which raises the question: How many other unknown women in science are out there, hidden away in boxes? \nThis is Christine Essenberg’s journey from researcher to teacher. It’s the first discovery of what we’re calling the Folder 29 Project, a research initiative to uncover the work of lost women of science, hidden in the archives of universities across the country.\nLISTEN TO THE PODCAST\n\n[New to this season of Lost Women of Science? Listen to Episode One here first, then Episode Two, then Episode Three.]\nLost Women of Science is produced for the ear. Where possible, we recommend listening to the audio for the most accurate representation of what was said.\nEPISODE TRANSCRIPT\nLynda Claassen: How much there is to be done, and how little one knows. Yours respectfully, Christine Essenberg.\nKatie Hafner: That's the closing line of a letter that zoologist Christine Essenberg sent to her boss a century ago. \nI'm Katie Hafner, and this is Lost Women of Science.\nA while back, I was poring over papers of a renowned scientist at UC San Diego when suddenly, an accidental discovery. At the very back of a box, there was this. Folder 29. Eight pages of paper. Two letters, written to a Dr. Ritter in 1921 from a Christine Essenberg, and a single letter the following year 1922. There, in fine cursive Essenberg worries about how to help her dying sister back in Switzerland. She considers becoming a school teacher, noting the pay is better. She politely inquires, asking when her research will finally get published. Most intriguing to me: in one letter, she appears to chuck it all and head off to Constantinople. \nWhat? Who? Who was this, and what’s she doing buried in this box? These poignant letters, fragments of a life, survived only because they were part of another scientist's archival collection. Which makes me think, just how many Folder 29s are there out there in archives just like this?\nFolder 29, lost in the back of an archive, haunted me for months. And so I sent producer Claire Trageser back to the UC San Diego archive to dig a little deeper. \nClaire Trageser: Hi. Welcome. Are you Lynda?\nI'm Claire.\nNice to meet you. Nice to meet you. \nClaire Trageser: I made an appointment with Lynda Claassen, the longtime director of Special Collections and Archives. And she has set aside time to delve deeper into Folder 29.\nLynda Claassen: And I only have until 12:25. I'm sorry.\nClaire Trageser: She has set a standard cardboard archive box on the table, labeled box five. It contains the collected papers of Carl Eckart, a geophysicist who Katie was looking into a while back. And Katie's right about this mystery folder. \nLynda Claassen: Eckart. Eckart Ecker. Remind me what we're looking for. What's her last name? \nClaire Trageser: Essenberg.\nLynda Claassen: Oh, of course it's the last folder in this box.\nClaire Trageser: Linda pulls the folder out and the first thing she notices is the swirling cursive on parchment paper. \nLynda Claassen: How wonderful. These wonderfully polite, nice letters that people used to write on paper in, in nice, neat handwriting \nClaire Trageser: It's a letter dated June 18, 1917 to Christine Essenberg. She has just earned her PhD in Zoology, and is working at what is now Scripps Institution of Oceanography on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean in La Jolla, California. She has a passion for research, and is also assisting at the institute’s small library. Lynda Claassen leans in for a closer look.\nLynda Claassen: Let's see. Thank you for your note. And yeah, \nClair Trageser: Can you read it a little bit or just shall I read it? \nLynda Claasen: Yeah, sure. \nClaire Trageser: That'd be great. \nThe letter is from The Academy of Natural Sciences and gives a sense of the kinds of mundane tasks that she did at the library. It seems that she had flagged a missing periodical. And here is the response written to her, all dry and formal.\nLynda Claassen: My Dear Mrs. Essenberg, I thank you for your note regarding the institution’s subscriptions. \nClaire Trageser: And the note goes on to say it was a misunderstanding on the part of the mailing clerk and the error has been corrected. So she was dealing with minutiae, settling up back issues of a journal. It's a far cry from the field research she craved. At least, that's our guess. We only have these eight pages of letters to go on. Just eight pages to try to understand the story of a life.\nAnd that's the point of this project. There are probably so many women like Essenberg, just waiting to be discovered. Each with a unique story, women battling to do their own research in a man's world. \nWe only stumbled on Essenberg because Katie happened to find her letters tucked away in the back of a box.\nSo now our quest is to try to find out as much as we can about Essenberg, with these eight pages as our jumping off point.\nThis much we know. Christine Essenberg came to San Diego after earning her Master's and then in 1917 completing her PhD from U-C Berkeley. Her doctoral thesis was a mouthful, titled “The Factors Controlling the Distribution of the Polynoidae on the Pacific Coast” We’ve since come to learn that Polynoidae are scaly worms that live in the ocean.\nHow did she arrive at this very specific topic? \nWell, for one, many of the early scientists like Christine Essenberg, studying at UC Berkeley, were Zoologists.\nProfessor Joseph LeConte established the department in 1887.\nThen zoology was taken over by William Ritter, who eventually went south to San Diego and established the Marine Biological Association, which became Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\nAnd, more importantly, it appears that both LeConte and Ritter took a special interest in mentoring women, and helping them progress in their scientific careers.\nRitter was married to a physician, who may have influenced his views on women, or perhaps he went into the marriage fully formed as a man ahead of his time. \nWhat we do know is that the newlyweds were an adventurous pair. On their honeymoon, they went to a southern point in San Diego to collect goby fish specimens. We know that their boat capsized, and they had to be rescued.\nWilliam Ritter was Christine Essenberg's boss, and the next letter is written by Essenberg to Ritter in May of 1921, four years after she received her PhD. \nArchivist Lynda Claassen reads from it.\nLynda Claassen: Have you thought about, or have you found out anything about the publication of my appendices or copelata work?\nClaire Trageser: So her research has moved from the scaly worm to the species of plankton . Clearly, the ocean is influencing her. As the letter continues, she's looking ahead, thinking about the next steps in her career \nLynda Claassen: I would like to do some experimental work on the side, so as not to be obliged to sit at the microscope all the time.\nClaire Trageser: Remember, this is 1921. Women had just won the right to vote a year earlier. Very few had careers at all. And so Essenberg was battling not just the idea that she should be working, but that she should be doing the type of work she liked. \nIn this sobering letter, she's surprisingly candid with Ritter. It's clear that she is depending on him both for financial and emotional support. \nLynda Claassen: My sister is sick in Switzerland now. In case she should die, I shall go after her child and raise her. \nKatie Hafner: Amazing. right? Yes. \nClaire Trageser: Katie has been listening in on her cell, following along as we go through the letters. \nWhat we're gleaning from them is that this is a woman determined to make her way in the world as a scientist, but with few prospects despite her PhD. \nNot to mention a very ill sister, with thousands of miles separating them. \nAnd a boss who likely had more pressing concerns than Essenberg's troubles. In her letter, she notes her research would take \"years and years of patient study.\" That would be impossible to set aside once it's started, making it difficult, she writes, to fulfill obligations, both to herself and to her family. Essenberg then makes a not-so-subtle case for better pay. \nLynda Claassen: I may be obliged to go to teaching where I can earn more in nine month’s work. The beginning salary of grammar school teachers is $1,500. It is only fair that I should expect at least similar salary especially when I am under obligations to help my people. It would be selfish of me to follow my dreams and leave them to suffer and die. \nClaire Trageser: It seems Essenberg was treading a thin line with her boss, asserting herself, but not being too assertive. \nLynda Claassen: I am sorry to disturb you with my tales of woe, but you will understand better my attitude and my lack of definitive decision. I hope not to disturb you again in the future. Yours respectfully, Christine Essenberg. \nClaire Trageser: By the end of the year, Essenberg is taking a new tack. In December of 1921 she proposes a one-year leave of absence that will take her to research labs across the globe, and -- likely not incidentally -- within striking distance of her ailing sister in Switzerland. Three months later, in March of 1922, her travel plans are approved. The letter from the President of the University of California is not addressed to her, Dr. Essenberg, but to her boss, Dr. Ritter. It grants \"Mrs\" Christine Essenberg, a one year leave of absence starting that summer, July of 1922 and ending June of 1923.  \nLynda Claassen: Without salary, of course. \nKatie Hafner: What, what did you say, \nLynda Claassen: She's being granted leave, but without salary. \nKatie Hafner: Wow. So how did she support herself during this year, I wonder. \nClaire Trageser: What we do know is that, about two months into her unpaid leave, Essenberg wrote from the most unexpected of places.\nLynda Claassen: A letter in September of 1922 from Christine to Dr. Ritter. \nKatie Hafner: And where's she writing from? \nLynda Claassen: The Constantinople Women's College. In Constantinople, Turkey.  \nKatie Hafner: Wow. How did she get there? How did that happen?\nClaire Trageser: Indeed she was teaching at The Constantinople Women's College. It makes sense. If she stuck with her plan, Dr. Essenberg spent the first two months of her leave traveling to various marine labs. Perhaps she followed through and visited her ailing sister in Switzerland. But remember: It was an unpaid leave. By that fall of 1922 she could very well have exhausted her savings. So teaching, which she earlier noted was more lucrative than her Scripps job, made sense. A teaching position at the Constantinople Women's College would keep her afloat. And it turned her life in an entirely new direction, one she chose for herself. She picked a heady time to be in Constantinople. On the heels of World War One, there was a lot of instability and she walked right into The Turkish War of Independence. But, given what she writes next, she seems undaunted.\nLynda Claassen: I am not the least bit nervous or afraid. Neither does anybody else here at the college pay much attention to the political affairs. . .until the British officers are leaving Constantinople. \nClaire Trageser: Despite the chaos all around her, Essenberg presses on for recognition in her field. \nLynda Claassen: Then she has a paragraph: I hope my paper has gone to print. I sent a brief paper to Mrs. Genter, asking her to hand it over to you. If you find it worthwhile publishing, you will kindly send it to the press. \nClaire Trageser: With a war swirling around her, she updates Ritter in September of 1922, writing about how, despite the chaos, her students are still showing up for her class, and she frets about their future. \nLynda Claassen: I feel sorry for them. After they finish their college, they are discontented with their home life. According to their customs and traditions, there was very little of wholesome pleasures left for the Turkish woman. She's not supposed to do any work either at home nor in public, nor is there any intellectual or social life for her.\nKatie Hafner: Oh, wow. \nLynda Claassen: Right. Some of the women -- and I think she means all of the women in the college, not just the Turkish women -- some of the women are very capable and they are all charming. The education here is making a great influence on the women and will gradually change their position. The change is already noticeable in Constantinople. The girls here suffer a great deal on account of the war rumors and feel as if they had to apologize for some of the actions of their nation. \nClaire Trageser: How would we even know of Essenberg's struggles and triumphs if her letters had not been included in that archival box of papers? Surely there are countless other women like her. To find out about these kinds of lost women, we called MIT where there is another relatively new initiative to recover the lost women. Archivist Thera Webb is working on it. \nThera Webb: I believe it started around 2016 when one of the archivists at that time had been advocating for a focus on collecting the papers of women faculty. \nClaire Trageser: She says one of the big challenges in tracking down women is that they are more likely to change their names when they get married, so she relies heavily on their maiden names.\nThera Webb: There will be like, a folder titled Mr. and Mrs. John C. Smith. And then you're like, oh, okay, well who is Mrs. John C. Smith? And so there's a lot of research being done by archivists and interns, that's sort of tied to genealogy in that we're like tracing back to get to the birth name of these women who are in our collections. There was a folder for Mr. and Mrs. Williams C. Russo. And what I learned was that Mrs. Williams C. Russo was actually Margaret Hutchinson Russo PhD, who was an engineer who designed the first commercial penicillin production plant and was the first woman to become a member of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. But I never would've known that from the name on the folder.\nClaire Trageser: But more broadly, it's a challenge, Webb says, because artifacts from the lives of women in science are typically not as valued.\nThera Webb: Maybe somebody held onto all of the papers of some woman, but they were never accepted by a repository as a collection that people were interested in. So sometimes it is really the case where you can only sort of piece together bits and pieces in collections that belong to men. \nClaire Trageser: Webb says the movement to find and archive the papers of women scientists is just gaining steam. There's more attention to women's contributions and still a lot out there to be found. \nThera Webb: Whether they're at a repository right now at a university or a historical society or in someone's shoebox under their bed, the letters of their great-grandmother who happened to be a scientist, but at this moment, if you don't know what you're looking for, you won't be able to find it. And we don't know what we're looking for a hundred percent of the time.\nClaire Trageser: MIT is one of several schools plumbing their archives. At UC Berkeley, the search is also on to document the working lives of women who have worked there. \nThere, Sheila Humphreys, an emeritus engineering professor at UC Berkeley, has thrown herself into the research. She's very no-nonsense. She wanted to know right away how I'd become interested in the idea of lost women. \nIt's kind of like the jumping off point is a couple letters from a woman scientist in San Diego at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\nSheila Humphreys: But what was her name? \nClaire Trageser: Uh, Christine Essenberg. \nSheila Humphreys: Oh my God, I've, I've researched her for months. I have a whole essay about her. \nClaire Trageser: Oh wow. Okay, great.\nWhat were the odds? What luck! Serendipity had taken me directly to a Christine Essenberg expert! \nAnd she has plenty to say. \nJust ahead…\nDominique Janee: Hi. I’m Dominique Janee, an Associate Producer at Lost Women of Science. We don’t know how many Folder 29’s are out there buried in archives around the world. But we’re guessing there are a lot of them. If you’re interested in helping us with our Folder 29 Project, an ambitious dig through archives, looking for lost scientists like Christine Essenberg, go to lostwomenofscience.org to find out more. \nSheila Humphreys: You, you know, she has the most fascinating, strange story.\nClaire Trageser: That's Professor Emeritus Sheila Humphreys of UC Berkeley, talking about Christine Essenberg. Over a century ago, Essenberg was an early research scientist at what is now the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Humphreys told me that she had researched Essenberg, along with many other early female scientists. She wrote a 168 page essay about these women, so I asked her to send it over. Then, with essay in hand, Katie and I started scrolling through the details of Essenberg's life. \nKatie Hafner: This is quite a find. \nClaire Trageser: This says she was known for her expertise in plankton, which we kind of…\nKatie Hafner:  … figured out. \nClaire Trageser:. Yes. \nKatie Hafner: Right.\nClaire Trageser: She's, born of Swedish parents, which we had sort of had some inkling of, right? \nKatie Hafner: Uh-huh. \nClaire Trageser: Essenberg had a whole life before coming to the United States. She had been teaching for several years in St. Petersburg in Russia, but once in the U.S. went to Indiana, to Valparaiso University where she studied zoology and botany.\nClaire Trageser: And she got married before she graduated, and then later divorced. Interesting. \nKatie Hafner: Was the husband Essenberg, or was her maiden name Essenberg? \nClaire Trageser: Her maiden name was Adamson, and her husband's name was Essenberg. She got divorced, but I don't know if she, maybe she kept Essenberg or, um mm-hmm. \nor just the, what? The letters from the time that we had, she was still married. It doesn't say when she got divorced.\nClaire Trageser with Katie Hafner: She's, oh my God. There's her picture. Where? She looks so different from what I thought she would look like. Um, and this photo of her is just with the broach and she looks , she looks young, This is amazing.\nClaire Trasgeser: The more we pore over in the essay, the more questions we have. So we go right to the source herself: Sheila Humphreys, who had compiled all of this information. But first we had to ask her: What was it about Essenberg that caught your eye? Humphreys had a quick and simple answer.\nSheila Humphreys: The reason that Christine Essenberg came to my attention was that She was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. She was the sixth woman to get a PhD in Zoology, so she was very, very early, and that's why she's one of those women that I profiled.\nClaire Trageser: Humphreys explained that, in an effort to rediscover lost women scientists, each department at UC Berkeley was asked to compile a history of women in their disciplines.\nSheila Humphreys: In the case of oceanography in which Christine Essenberg belongs, she was originally a student in the Department of Zoology, which was one of the first departments established at Berkeley. It was taught from the very beginning. \nClaire Trageser: So...you'd think there'd be plenty of documentation, but you'd be wrong. The search for Esssenberg was complicated. Departments had consolidated over the years. Humphreys says 23 departments were merged into three, so Zoology, Essenberg's specialty, essentially disappeared. There was little institutional memory of her. \nSheila Humphreys: And that's how I personally came to know Christine because I decided to fill the gap that I would take this on. \nClaire Trageser: Sheila Humpreys says that, in researching Essenberg, she learned a lot about the early years of Scripps itself. \nBack in Essenberg's day a century ago, the lab was in its infancy and working conditions brought men and women together under very rudimentary conditions. \nSheila Humphreys: They had a temporary lab, they had set up tents and they had one boat and they camped over the summer. And indeed these early women who did their research there, once they went off to teach at various places like Wellesley College, they would come back in the summer to continue their research under Dr. Ritter.\nClaire Trageser: And come back they did. The less-than-optimal conditions required the kind of close cooperation that encourages collegiality.\nSheila Humphreys: And I attribute, and I think others do too, some of their success to the fact that it was a very congenial colony of people. And Ritter's wife Mary Bennett Ritter was the physician to women's students, but she went down with her husband to help establish this marine biology lab, and she was a trusted maternal presence and advisor and friend to some of these women.\nClaire Trageser: Humphreys says the mutual respect that was nurtured helped to break down barriers.\nSheila Humphreys: These women, even though they were probably the single woman in their cohort, they do not talk about feeling discriminated against or that there was any kind of resentment of them at all. It was a very, seems like a pretty happy place where they had Saturday night suppers of clam chowder on the beach and uh, there was even a small school for people who had families, but anyway, that's how I got to Christine Essenberg.\nClaire Trageser: It all sounded pretty idyllic, but Humphreys says it wasn't always that way. From Essenberg's letters to Ritter, while men in her cohort are moving ahead, it seems she has stalled out. It was a constant push to get her research published. \nSo it didn't seem so far-fetched that she would make good on her veiled threat to take a teaching job for better pay, especially when she saw the war-time need for science teachers at that all women's college in Constantinople. Opening up the world to her students only to see the walls close in on them later when they left, was something she struggled with.\nSheila Humphreys: She talks about what a prison these girls would be in, especially the Turkish girls. After they finished their education, they were not supposed to do any work outside the home. In fact, they were barely meant to leave the home. \nClaire Trageser: And she didn't worry only about her students.\nSheila Humphreys:  There's reference to her creating a, a program for their mothers to come and do, I think physical education using the school building. Overall she wanted to, to educate them and to liberate them.\nClaire Trageser: So it's clear that teaching at the school in Constantinople was really eye-opening for Christine Essenberg. Still, we do know that she ultimately left the Women's College there. But Katie, guess where she went next. \nKatie Hafner: Back home to the United States?\nClaire Trageser: No. Or at least not for long. She went to Damascus, Syria. To start a school of her own. The American School for Girls opened in the fall of 1925.\nKatie Hafner: Oh! Damascus! Did she succeed? Did she make a go of it?\nClaire Trageser: Yes! Yes, the school was unique. It admitted not just Muslim students, but there were some Jewish students and Christians too, according to Sheila Humphreys.\nSheila Humphreys:  This school was very well known at the time, and she had very well known scientists on the board, you know, people from Harvard and all over the place. \nClaire Trageser: People like the Harvard Astronomer Harlow Shapley, who served on her board. \nKatie Hafner: Harlow Shapley? Oh my gosh! He was featured prominently in an earlier Lost Women of Science episode, the one about Astronomer Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin. So Payne-Gaposchkin worked for him at Harvard.\nClaire Trageser: Yeah, that’s right! And we know that, two decades after its founding, during World War Two, the doors of The American School for Girls stayed open. Even during the bombardment of Damascus in 1945, Christine Essenberg did not leave her post. \nSheila Humphreys: And she stayed there and it was bombed. And her school was sort of a center for expatriates who were stuck there.\nClaire Trageser: And not just a center. Humphreys says Christine Essenberg allowed part of her school to be used by the Allied soldiers. \nKatie Hafner: Did her school survive the war?\nClaire Trageser: We know that the year after the war ended, 1946, Shapley from Harvard was chairman of the board of her school. And we know that in subsequent years, Christine Essenberg made multiple trips back to the United States to drum up financial support for her school. \nShe appealed for donors coast-to-coast. There's a local newspaper in New Jersey that talks about one of her fundraising visits, and The San Francisco Examiner noted her stop there to gather support in 1947. By then she was 71 years old. And when questioned about creeping Orientalism, as it was referred to at the time – efforts to teach western values, Christian values – she's quoted as telling a reporter, \"It was never my purpose to endeavor to 'westernize' these girls. My primary objective,\" she said, \"is to educate.\"\nBut Katie. That's pretty much where the trail grows cold. \nWe do know she ultimately did return to California at the end of her life. She spent her final years in San Francisco and died in 1965 when she would have been about 89 years old.\nKatie Hafner: Well, but, do we know whether she ever did get published? I mean, that seemed to have been a recurring sore spot for her in all the letters she wrote back in the 1920s.\nClaire Trageser: Yes, she did. We found at least nine papers from early on. But by the time her last papers were getting published, she was already teaching abroad. Teaching science. To girls and women.\nKatie Hafner: So, this much we do know. Christine Essenberg came to the United States. She ended up in California by way of Indiana as an older student, apparently with a marriage and a divorce thrown in. She got her PhD at 41, becoming one of the early researchers at what is now called The Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\nBut in the end, snippets from her letters tell the story of a female scientist who carved out a niche for herself in the most traditional of all women's professions: teaching school. \nClaire Trageser: So maybe Christine Essenberg became a teacher because she was kept at the microscope and not allowed to do the field research she craved, and so she turned to one of the few occupations open to women back in the day. Or, as Essenberg pointed out to her boss when she was angling for a raise, teachers were simply being paid more than she was being paid, even with her PhD. \nKatie Hafner: Or maybe, finding herself in Constantinople with girls and women who didn’t get the education that she herself got, she then got more satisfaction setting up a school for them. \nClaire Trageser: And who knows. I mean maybe at some point, when she was teaching, she inspired a girl, or two girls, or a dozen, to shine in science.\nKatie Hafner: Yeah. I mean, we'll never really know. All we know is that she was a creature of her time and made her adjustments and appears to have built a satisfying and adventurous life, because really, all we had to go on as a jumping off point were these letters tucked away in Folder 29. \nWell, thank you, Claire.\nClaire Trageser: Katie, you are so welcome.\nKatie Hafner: Claire Trageser produced this episode of Lost Women of Science.

{"title": "Can Lucky Planets Get a Second Chance at Life?", "date": "2023-10-05 12:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nWorlds around red giant stars—and others that don’t orbit any star at all—hint at an unexpected diversity of possibilities for planets and life in the universe\nFor decades, astronomers have endeavored to forecast with confidence the fate of planetary systems, including our own, throughout the cosmos. And these experts’ predictions have one central principle: to confidently guess what will eventually befall a planet, you have to know the size of its star.\nTiny stars don’t really burn out but rather fade away as they shine dimly for hundreds of billions or even trillions of years, likely keeping their planetary companions in tow. Massive stars go out with a bang, expiring as a supernova that leaves behind a neutron star or black hole. Such events tend to be cataclysmic for planetary systems. And stars of middling mass, like our own, expand into a red giant, engulfing or scorching their planets and then dissipating to become a slow-cooling stellar ember called a white dwarf.\nThis dismal fate is expected to befall our sun in some five billion years, setting what has been considered the last-gasp expiration date for life on Earth and perhaps throughout the solar system.\nBut insights from fresh studies of dying stars and doomed worlds elsewhere in the Milky Way challenge this consensus. Increasingly, it seems that the eventual fates of planetary systems, ours included, are not wholly written in the stars.\nSpecifically, two new findings—the discovery of a giant planet closely orbiting around a red giant star and the identification and estimation of the number of so-called rogue planets adrift in our galaxy—have highlighted that there are many more nuanced scenarios to consider. Planets can survive the ruin of their star, and the vast majority of planetary systems shed numerous worlds throughout their history.\nWhen our sun eventually enters its red giant phase, its radius will likely extend well beyond Earth’s present-day orbit. Even if our planet and the solar system’s other inner rocky worlds escape engulfment, the sun’s swelling will probably still spell their end because of the scorching temperatures they will experience. For the former scenario, astronomers have been seeing signs of this demise in the atmospheres of white dwarfs: researchers have found such stars littered with the remnants of dead planets they likely swallowed. \nIn fact, astronomers believed the fate of any planet orbiting a star within its red giant radius was likely sealed. That was until the discovery of the planet 8 Ursae Minoris b (8 UMi b), also known as Halla (after the South Korean mountain Hallasan and in honor of the South Korean astronomers who initially identified it in 2015). \n“We used to think that planets just couldn't survive around stars that become red giants—but this system provides a loophole,” explains Malena Rice, an assistant professor of astrophysics at Yale University, who co-authored new research on Halla postulating how it improbably survived.\nHalla was discovered by the wobbling its orbital tugging induced on its red giant home star, 8 Ursae Minoris (8 UMi). Track the period of that wobble over time, and you can discern the length of a planet’s year and its distance from its star. Such scrutiny showed that Halla orbits a mere 75 million kilometers from 8 UMi—that is, just half the distance between Earth and the sun. But standard modeling of 8 UMi’s red giant phase suggested that the star’s puffy, hot stellar atmosphere should have expanded about 30 million km farther out than that at its swollen peak. That is, Halla appeared to be a planet that shouldn’t exist. It should’ve been consumed and obliterated. Instead it had somehow escaped.\n“This planet was very lucky,” Rice says. “In its past, we think that it may have orbited two stars rather than one, and this helped it to survive what could have been a fiery fate.”\nBinary stars can exchange material back and forth, and they can even merge to become a single star, allowing a rich diversity of novel possibilities for any orbiting worlds. Such major redistributions of mass can alter planetary orbits while also profoundly influencing how a star shines, adding or siphoning away gas to change the nature and timing of its subsequent stellar evolution. According to the careful modeling work of Rice and her colleagues, the most likely explanation for Halla’s survival is that 8 UMi was once accompanied by a smaller close-in companion star, with which it eventually merged. Among other effects, the merger would’ve stifled 8 UMi’s red giant expansion, sparing Halla.\nAlthough this mechanism clarifies how some fortunate worlds might survive their star’s antics, it offers scant hope for our own solar system because our sun lacks a stellar companion to tamp down its eventual evolutionary swelling.\n“It will be tough for our rocky planets to make it through that process if the sun swells beyond their orbits,” Rice says. “But perhaps finding more systems like these might teach us about interesting natural ‘loopholes’ that occur in at least some types of planetary systems.” \nBountiful discoveries of newfound worlds—and with them, perhaps, the revelation of more “loopholes”—could come relatively soon via NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which is due to launch by May 2027. Much of Roman’s potential comes from its planned exoplanet survey, which will rely on a relatively underused technique known as microlensing. In this method, Roman will stare at many stars simultaneously, looking for instances where, by chance, a planet-bearing star will be perfectly aligned to cross in front of another “background” star much farther away. In such cases, some of the foreground star’s planets can act as gravitational lenses and magnify the background star’s light in a way that allows astronomers to reconstruct a lensing world’s mass and orbit. The technique is especially sensitive to planets orbiting far from their stars—a circumstellar region that remains scarcely probed by other planet-hunting methods.\nAnd in fact, it’s also capable of finding worlds that have left their stars behind entirely—something Roman could leverage to discover hundreds of rogue planets in interstellar space. Already preexisting microlensing surveys have found a handful of these free-floating worlds, and the statistics of this largely hidden population suggest most planetary systems have a surprisingly turbulent history.\nThe latest example comes from the MOA (Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics) survey, a project conducted at the University of Canterbury Mt. John Observatory on New Zealand’s South Island by an international team, including scientists at NASA and Japan’s Osaka University. Running for almost a decade, MOA has gathered enough data to weigh in on the galactic abundance of rogue planets down to and even below Earth mass.\n“This number turns out to be somewhat larger than we would have guessed,” says David Bennett, a senior research scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and co-author of two new papers reporting on these findings that were posted on the preprint server arXiv.org. These papers are set to be published in a future issue of the Astronomical Journal.\nSo far MOA has only detected six microlensing events that are consistent with magnification by a low-mass rogue planet, says MOA collaborator Takahiro Sumi, a professor at Osaka University, who co-authored both preprint studies. “Taking into account the low detection efficiency and our detections, we estimated that there are many such low-mass objects in the galaxy,” he adds. \n“We found that there are about 20 free-floating planets per star in the galaxy, and the number is dominated by low-mass planets with a mass similar to or smaller than that of Earth,” Bennett says. Those numbers, in turn, suggest an astounding two trillion rogue worlds in the Milky Way alone—six times more than the planets that are estimated to be bound to stars.\nIf this estimate is correct, it means most planetary systems are essentially dissolving across cosmic time, jettisoning many of their members via dynamical interactions between planets or their host stars that can slingshot unlucky worlds out into the interstellar abyss. It’s possible that when we look out into the solar system and other multiplanetary systems, the remaining planets we see are rare vestiges of once-bustling neighborhoods.\nBennett explains that most rogue worlds likely get ejected during the early stages of planetary formation, after which planetary systems settle into more stable configurations. The probability of ejections should generally decrease throughout a sunlike star’s life, he says. But when it swells into a red giant and begins shedding its outer layers of gas, the resulting shifts in planetary orbits can spark new rounds of world-ejecting instabilities.\nStars that are much heavier than the sun and end their life as a supernova, Bennett suggests, could also provide a rich source of rogue worlds and help to explain MOA’s outsize estimates.\nScott Gaudi, an astronomer and microlensing expert at the Ohio State University, thinks MOA’s surprising results are the best currently available but cautions that they remain very uncertain, so they “should be taken with a grain of salt.” Roman, he says, should beef up the statistical certitude, thanks to the unprecedented sensitivity of its prospective microlensing survey.\nIf MOA’s estimates are accurate, however, the sheer number of rogue worlds raises an interesting question: Could any of them provide conditions favorable to life? Ravi Kopparapu, a planetary habitability expert at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, says life on a rogue planet would be problematic—but not impossible.\n“Without a star, life on a cold rogue world would likely need to get its energy from internal sources,” Kopparapu says. “That could be in the form of tidal/frictional heat like in some of Jupiter’s moons where there are subsurface oceans, from residual energy when the planet formed or from the radioactive decay of heavy elements in the planet’s core.” Such worlds might resemble the large moons of our outer solar system and harbor potentially clement conditions beneath an icy crust.\nFor surface habitability, Kopparapu says a thick hydrogen atmosphere could possibly insulate a rogue planet and keep its surface temperature warm enough for living things to endure. Such atmospheres are easily blown away by stellar radiation, but because rogue planets do not orbit stars, they might be able to cling to an insulating atmosphere of hydrogen far longer than any sunbathed world could.\nAmid so much uncertainty, life’s prospects in such alien environments can seem either dizzying or dim. Might biospheres someday be found eking out existence around post-red giant stars or on worlds without a star at all? The thought is staggering, to say the least—and the fact that we could soon have real data to better answer such grand questions is all the more so.\nConor Feehly is a New Zealand based writer who covers topics ranging from astronomy to consciousness studies and the philosophy of science.

{"title": "Nobel Prizes Are Taking Longer to Award Groundbreaking Research", "date": "2023-10-04 20:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel laureates sometimes wait 20 years or more after making their award-worthy discovery to receive the prize\nThe road to a Nobel Prize, the most prestigious scientific award in the world, is growing ever longer, with almost half of laureates now waiting more than 20 years from making a Nobel-worthy discovery to receiving the prize.\nOne analysis shows that the average time between publishing the work and receiving one of the science prizes has nearly doubled in the past 60 years. Across the three science prizes, chemistry now has the longest ‘Nobel lag’ — an average of 30 years over the past decade — and physiology or medicine has the shortest, at 26 years (see ‘Decades-long delay’).\nAlfred Nobel’s will stated that the prizes should be awarded “to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind.” In reality this has only happened a few times. But in the first half of the twentieth century, it was common for Nobel prize recipients to be in their 30s — and that is unheard of now, says Santo Fortunato, now a computational social scientist at Indiana University in Bloomington, who published a 2014 analysis on Nobel prizewinners since the award’s conception in 1901. His results showed that the time between laureates’ prize-winning research and their Nobel had slowly increased over the years, with a steeper slope after the 1960s than in the early years of the prize.\nThere are a number of possible reasons for this trend, says Yian Yin, a computational social scientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. It could be that the overall number of breakthroughs is increasing each year, so awards cannot keep up with the number of people who deserve to be recognized, he says. It is also the case that the importance of some works, which Yin describes as ‘sleeping beauties,’ are only realized years or decades later.\nAlternatively, the lengthening gap could be a sign that there has been a decrease in ‘disruptive’ science — important studies or discoveries that change the paradigm of their field. This could be causing the Nobel committees to focus more on the past.\nThe number of ‘big-splash’ discoveries are diminishing, but when they do happen, they tend to get recognized quickly, says Fortunato. For example, biochemists Jennifer Doudna at the University of California, Berkeley and Emmanuelle Charpentier at the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens in Berlin, won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry just eight years after their development of the CRISPR–Cas9 system as a genome-editing tool. Some researchers speculate that the inventors of mRNA vaccines, which were rolled out to millions of people worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic, could receive similar recognition.\nFortunato points out that, if the gap continues to grow, prominent scientists could miss out on the award owing to the Nobel Committee’s rule banning posthumous prizes (with the exception of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, a share of which was awarded to physician Ralph Steinman, who had passed away three days before the announcement, unbeknownst to the committee). “It has to stop at some point,” he says, adding that a rethink of the posthumous-awarding ban would allow more people’s work to get the recognition that it deserves.\nThis article is reproduced with permission and was first published on September 29, 2023.\nLilly Tozer is an intern at Nature News.\n\nJosh Fischman\nDaniel Garisto\nLauren J.

{"title": "September Was the Most Anomalously Hot Month Ever", "date": "2023-10-04 19:21:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nSeptember shattered a record for the highest temperature anomaly of any month and could help push 2023 to be the first year to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures\nIn a year already overloaded with so many climate-related superlatives, it’s time to add another to the list: September was the most anomalously warm month ever recorded.\nAnd the steady heat building this year could make 2023 not only the hottest year on record but the first to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial temperatures, or the stable climate that preceded the massive release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels. Under the landmark Paris climate accord, nations have pledged to try to keep global warming under that threshold. “It’s very worrying,” says Kate Marvel, a senior climate scientist at Project Drawdown, a nonprofit organization that develops roadmaps for climate solutions.\nAccording to data kept by the Japan Meteorological Agency, this September was about 0.5 degree C (0.9 degree F) hotter than the previous hottest September in 2020. It was also about 0.2 degree C (0.4 degree F) warmer than the previous record high temperature anomaly—a measure of how much warmer or colder a given time period is, compared with the average—which had been set in February 2016 during a blockbuster El Niño.\nThe September anomaly “is so far above anything we’ve seen before,” says Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist who works at the payment processing firm Stripe and wrote about September’s heat in a recent blog post. On X, formerly known as Twitter, he called the feat “absolutely gobsmackingly bananas.”\nThe milestone reached last month comes on the heels of July setting the record for the hottest month overall. (July is always the hottest month of the year globally because it occurs at the peak of the Northern Hemisphere summer. The Northern Hemisphere has much more landmass to soak up the sun’s rays than the Southern Hemisphere, so it has the bigger influence on the global annual temperature cycle.)\nIn a marker of just how much global temperatures have risen in recent decades, Hausfather observes, “this September will be hotter than most Julys before the last decade or two.”\nTwo main factors are at play in driving temperatures to such extremes: their inexorable increase from burning fossil fuels and an El Niño event that is shaping up to be a strong one. El Niño is a part of a natural climate cycle that features a tongue of unusually warm waters across the eastern Pacific Ocean. Those waters release heat into the atmosphere and can cause a cascade of changes to key atmospheric circulation patterns linked to the weather around the world.\nHeat waves have broken records all over the globe during the past few months, including prolonged events called heat domes that plagued the southern stretch of the U.S. and parts of the Mediterranean. Summerlike temperatures were even felt in South America during the Southern Hemisphere’s winter. Two of the heat waves—one in the U.S. Southwest and one in Europe—were found to be virtually impossible without global warming. And summerlike heat has continued in places into October.\nThe most drastic temperature anomalies typically come in the winter months, when El Niño peaks in strength. In fact, the previous most anomalously warm month was February 2016, during one of the strongest El Niños on record. But this year “we’re seeing these [big anomalies] in the Northern Hemisphere summer,” Hausfather says. That leaves open the possibility of even larger anomalies when this event peaks this winter, particularly if it ends up being another strong event.\nIt is possible there is also some influence from the phasing out of sulfur-containing fuels used by ships because the aerosols spewed into the air from burning those fuels tend to have a slight cooling effect. The eruption of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai volcano in the southern Pacific Ocean last year may also be nudging up temperatures because of the huge amounts of water vapor—also a greenhouse gas—it injected into the atmosphere. But both factors have very small influences, compared with climate change and El Niño.\nGiven that this El Niño is expected to persist and likely to strengthen, there’s a good chance that 2023 or 2024—or both—will become the hottest year on record, besting 2016 (and 2020, which some agencies who monitor climate have tied with 2016). That isn’t surprising, given that there has been a tenth of a degree of warming since 2016, though it is “remarkable just how quickly we’ve seen warmth this year,” Hausfather says. Part of the apparent rapid warming is because 2023 began in the tail end of an unusual string of three back-to-back La Niña events. These tend to have a cooling impact on the global climate, though La Niñas today are hotter than even El Niños of several decades ago.\nBeyond potentially becoming the hottest year on record, 2023 could also be the first year to top 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial temperatures (some individual months have already passed that threshold). But even if that happens, all hope is not lost for meeting the Paris accord goals. That threshold is measured as an average of several decades, and climate scientists have long expected that a single year would pass that mark a decade or so before the world could be considered permanently above that limit. “There is still time to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees,” Marvel says. “It is going to be incredibly difficult. The pathways are narrowing.”\nBut this year should be considered a warning of the future we face if we don’t take rapid, ambitious action. “This is what the world looks like when it’s 1.5 degrees hotter in a year, and it’s terrible,” she says. When the world does permanently pass 1.5 degrees C, the climate anomalies for individual years will reach higher than that mark.\nTo stave off that future, every bit of carbon we can keep, or take, out of the atmosphere is crucial. “Every tenth of a degree matters,” Hausfather says.\nAndrea Thompson is an associate editor covering the environment, energy and earth sciences.

{"title": "Dengue's Spread in Europe Could Spur Vaccine Development", "date": "2023-10-04 17:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nBut dengue in wealthy countries could divert medication away from poorer nations that may need it more\nCLIMATEWIRE | In the early morning of the last day of August, Parisians experienced for the first time a practice normally confined to tropical regions — authorities fumigating the city against the tiger mosquito. The event was a tangible confirmation of what public health stats already showed: Dengue, the deadly mosquito-borne disease, had well and truly arrived in Europe.\nIn 2022, Europe saw more cases of locally acquired dengue than in the whole of the previous decade. The rise marks both a public health threat and a corresponding market opportunity for dengue vaccines and treatments; news that should spur the pharmaceutical industry to boost investment into the neglected disease.\nOn the face of it, this shift would appear to benefit not only countries like France but also nations like Bangladesh and the Philippines that have long battled dengue.\nBut that assumption could be fatally flawed, experts told POLITICO.\nPeople working in the field say the rise of dengue in the West could, in fact, make it harder to get lifesaving drugs to those who need them most, because pharmaceutical companies develop tools that are less effective in countries where the dengue burden is the highest or because wealthy nations end up hoarding these medicines and vaccines.\n“It might look like a good thing — and it is a good thing — that we're getting more products developed, but does it then create a two-tier system where high-income populations get access to it and then we still have the access gap for low- and middle-income countries?” asked Lindsay Keir, director of the science and policy advisory team at think tank Policy Cures Research.\nClimate change and migration mean the mosquitoes that transmit dengue, as well as other diseases such as chikungunya and Zika, are setting up shop in Europe. The most recent annual data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control shows that, in 2022, Europe saw 71 cases of locally acquired dengue: 65 in France and six in Spain.\nWhile dengue usually results in mild or no symptoms, it can also lead to high fever, severe headache and vomiting. Severe dengue can cause bleeding from the gums, abdominal pain and, in some cases, death.\nSo far, the mosquito has mostly been confined to southern Europe, but it's a worry across the Continent. In Belgium, the national public health research institute Sciensano has even launched an app where members of the public can submit photos of any Asian tiger mosquitos they spot.\nThe diseases spread by these mosquitoes have traditionally fallen under the umbrella of neglected tropical diseases, a group of infections that affect mainly low-income countries and struggle to attract research and development investment. But this is changing.\nPolicy Cures Research, which publishes an annual report on R&D investment into neglected diseases, removed dengue vaccines from their assessment in 2013. Dengue was no longer seen as an area where there was market failure, due to the emergence of a market that the private sector could tap into.\nThe organization is still tracking dengue drugs and biologics and their 2022 analysis showed a 33 percent increase in funding for research into non-vaccine products compared to the previous year, with industry investment reaching a record high of $28 million.\nSibilia Quilici, executive director of the vaccine maker lobby group Vaccines Europe, said the most recent pipeline review of members found that roughly 10 percent were targeting neglected diseases. There is more R&D happening in this area, said Quilici.\nAcross the major drugmakers, J&J is working on a dengue antiviral treatment and MSD has a dengue vaccine in their pipeline, while Sanofi has a second yellow fever jab in development. Two dengue vaccines are already approved in the European Union — one from Sanofi and another from Takeda. Moderna recently told POLITICO that it is looking closely at a dengue vaccine candidate and it already has a Zika candidate in the works.\nBut just because there might soon be larger markets for major pharmaceutical companies doesn’t mean the products will be suitable for the populations that have been waiting years for these tools.\nRachael Crockett, senior policy advocacy manager at the non-profit Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), said increased pharmaceutical investment in a particular disease won't necessarily lead to products developed that are globally relevant. “Industry will — and governments are also more likely to — focus on prevention,” she said.\nThat means tools such as vaccines will be prioritized; but in countries where dengue is endemic, the rainy season completely overburdens their health systems and what they desperately need are treatments, said Crockett.\nShe also said a massive increase in investment without a structure to ensure access to resulting products means “we have absolutely no guarantee that there isn't going to be hoarding, [that] there isn't going to be high prices.” Case in point: The U.S. national stockpile of Ebola vaccines, which exists despite there never having been an Ebola outbreak in the country.\nUnderlying many of these fears are the mistakes of the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw countries with less cash and political heft at the back of the queue when it came to vaccines.\nLisa Goerlitz, head of German charity Deutsche Stiftung Weltbevölkerung’s Brussels office, warned if drug development picks up because of a growing market in high-income countries, then accessibility, affordability and other criteria that make it suitable for low resource settings might not be prioritized.\nVaccines Europe’s Quilici sought to allay these concerns, pointing to the pharmaceutical industry's Berlin Declaration, a proposal to reserve an allocation of real-time production of vaccines in a health crisis. Quilici said this was a “really strong commitment … which comes right from the lessons learnt from Covid-19 and which could definitely overcome the challenges we had during the pandemic, if it is taken seriously.”\nReprinted from E&E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC.

{"title": "Entangled Light from Multitasking Atoms Could Spark Quantum Breakthroughs", "date": "2023-10-04 13:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nA colorful quirk of quantum optics could lead to significant advances in quantum communication and computing\nDriving late at night, you come upon a red light and stop the car. You lift your hand wearily to block the red glow streaming through your windshield. Suddenly, both the green and yellow lights come on, hitting your eyeballs at the same time. Confused, you take your hand away, and again only the red color appears.\nThis surreal scenario is what would actually happen if the traffic light was a single atom illuminated by a laser beam, as recently shown experimentally by researchers in Berlin. They looked at the light scattered by an atom and saw that photons—the tiniest particles of light—arrived at the detector one at a time. The scientists blocked the brightest color they saw, and suddenly pairs of photons of two slightly different colors started arriving at their detector simultaneously. They reported their findings in Nature Photonics in July.\nThe reason for this counterintuitive effect is that single atoms are skilled little multitaskers. Through different underlying processes, they can scatter a variety of colors at the same time like a dangerous traffic light that shines all three colors at once. Yet because of quantum interference between these processes, an observer only sees one of the metaphorical traffic light’s colors at a time, preserving peace on the road.\nThis experiment also paves the way for novel quantum information applications. When the brightest color is blocked, the photons that pop up simultaneously are entangled with each other, behaving in sync even when they are separated over large distances. This provides a new tool for quantum communication and information processing in which entangled photon pairs can serve as distributed keys in quantum cryptography or store information in a quantum memory device.\nAtoms can be surprisingly picky about their couplings with light. Based on the varying arrangements of their constituent electrons, atoms of different elements each display clear preferences for which colors of light they strongly scatter. Proving as much is as simple as shining a laser at an atom, with the laser tuned to a particular color that closely matches that atom’s scattering preference. As expected, your detector will show the atom scattering photons of that predominant color. But strangely, the scattered photons will stream into the detector one at a time, as if in a single-file line. Up through the early 1980s physicists generally accepted a naive explanation for this strange effect: the photons arrive as if in a queue because the atom can only scatter one photon at a time.\nIn 1984, however, two researchers dug into the math governing this phenomenon and found that the reality is much more complicated—and much more inherently quantum. They theorized that the atom is actually doing many things simultaneously: scattering not only single photons but also, through an entirely different process, photonic pairs, triplets and quadruplets. Nevertheless, only one photon at a time arrives at the detector because of quantum interference among these processes.\nRegular interference occurs between two waves like ripples on a pond, overlapping in a pattern of crests and troughs. A distinctive feature of the quantum world is that interference occurs not only between actual waves but also between probabilities: a photon sent through two slits has some probability of going through the left slit and some probability of going through the right one. The two possible paths interfere with each other, forming a pattern of crests and troughs. Block either slit, and the pattern disappears. “I like to tell my students, ‘Imagine that you want to prevent a burglar from entering your house and going into the living room. Just leave two doors open, and then you will have destructive interference, and the thieves cannot go into the living room,’” jokes physicist Jean Dalibard, who co-authored the 1984 paper.\nIn Dalibard’s model, however, this interference is not a joke at all. It actually happens between the two underlying processes, the single-photon and multiphoton scattering. And it happens not in space but in time such that a probability trough appears for two photons arriving at the same time. So the atom multitasks, yet it does so in a way that looks suspiciously like doing just one thing.\nDalibard’s complex description of the multitasking atom languished in relative obscurity until recently. “I was very happy that the group from Berlin found this paper. I don’t know how they did,” he says. From their end, the researchers in Berlin were fascinated by the counterintuitive theory introduced by Dalibard and his co-author, physicist Serge Reynaud. “When we started to dig into the old literature from the 1980s, we really got intrigued,” says Max Schemmer, a former postdoctoral researcher at Humboldt University of Berlin and a co-author of the recent work.\nSchemmer and his colleagues saw the potential of recently developed technology to experimentally test this theory. First, they cooled a cloud of rubidium atoms to just shy of absolute zero. Then they used optical tweezers—a tightly focused laser beam strong enough to grab extremely tiny objects—to isolate and hold one atom. Next they illuminated that atom with another laser tuned to rubidium’s scattering preference and placed a lens off to the side to collect the scattered light and channel it into an optical fiber.\nTo block the brightest color, the researchers guided the light into a finely tuned filter created by a ring of optical fiber. The length of the ring was chosen and adjusted precisely to create destructive interference for only one color of light. When this filter was included in the light’s path, they saw the brightest color disappear. And as Dalibard and Reynaud had predicted, photons of two slightly different colors suddenly started arriving at the detector in simultaneous pairs.\nBy blocking the brightest color, thus taking the atom’s single-photon-generating process offline, Schemmer and his colleagues were able to see the other process in action without the destructive interference created by the dominant single atom—much like a traffic light that shines both green and yellow when red is blocked.\nThe atom’s “second task” of scattering photons in pairs could come in handy for quantum computing and communication. Once the brightest color is blocked, the pairs of photons that arrive simultaneously are entangled with each other—entanglement being the not-so-secret ingredient that gives quantum approaches advantages over classical ones.\nEntangled photon pairs could be used to share quantum information across vast distances or to transmit it between different mediums. Conveniently, the photon pairs produced with this technique come in a very precise color rather than being spread across larger chunks of the rainbow like photon pairs produced by conventional methods. This makes them particularly useful for efficiently storing quantum information in a quantum memory device, Schemmer says, which could in turn lead to more robust quantum communication networks.\nAdditionally, these photon pairs possess a unique kind of entanglement that is not offered by other sources: a syncing in time. “There is one existing technique of producing entangled pairs of photons,” says Magdalena Stobinska, a quantum optics expert, who did not participate in the work. “But this is a different degree of freedom and therefore can be used for different types of applications. So it broadens the palette of efficiently produced entangled pairs of photons. And I think that’s cool.”\nAnd theory predicts that photon pairs are not the end of the story. The atom is also simultaneously scattering entangled photons in threes, fours, and so on. Blocking the red on this “traffic light” makes not only yellow and green shine through but also blue, orange, and much more. Clusters of entangled photons created this way could potentially serve as resources for photon-based quantum computing. “This system is like a treasure trove of quantum correlations,” says Fabrice P. Laussy, a professor of light-matter interactions at the University of Wolverhampton in England, who reviewed the recent study but did not participate in the research. “Everything is in there.”\nDina Genkina is a Brooklyn, N.Y.–based freelance journalist and a science communicator at the Joint Quantum Institute.\nKatherine Wright\nChris Ferrie | Opinion\nAnil Ananthaswamy\nDiscover world-changing science.

{"title": "A Popular Decongestant Doesn't Work. What Does?", "date": "2023-10-04 12:00:00", "text": "The popular decongestant phenylephrine is not effective, an FDA panel found. Here’s what to use instead.\nTanya Lewis: Hi, this is Your Health, Quickly, a Scientific American podcast series!\nJosh Fischman: We bring you the latest vital health news: Discoveries that affect your body and your mind.  \nLewis: And we break down the medical research to help you stay healthy. I’m Tanya Lewis.\nFischman: I’m Josh Fischman.\nLewis: We’re Scientific American’s senior health editors. \nFischman: Today, we’re talking about decongestants. Scientists who advise the FDA recently concluded that phenylephrine, a common decongestant in cold medicines, doesn’t work. We’ll talk about what actually does.\n[Clip: Show theme music]\nLewis: I don’t know about you, Josh, but I have bad allergies and my sinuses are blocked pretty often. I’ve tried all sorts of things to help, from nasal sprays and decongestants to to antihistamines to hot showers. Some of these things help, some of them don’t.\nFischman: What helps you the most of all those things, Tanya?\nLewis: I find that the steroid nasal sprays work pretty well, but I don’t like to use them all the time.\nFischman: How come?\nLewis: Um, I just find that sometimes I develop a tolerance to it so it stops having the same effect. Sometimes hot showers do help temporarily, but usually the congestion comes back.\nFischman: Yeah, and there’s only so long you can stand under a hot shower, right? \nLewis: Right.\nFischman: I’ve tried those saline sprays up my nose. They kind of flush things out and I feel more comfortable. But I have to use them for a bunch of days before I feel any difference.\nLewis: Yeah, those saline ones are pretty good. \nFischman: Overall, I tend to go for decongestant tablets, which are supposed to reduce swelling inside my nose, opening up my airways.\nLewis: You’re not alone in preferring tablets. One of the most popular decongestant ingredients is phenylephrine. It’s found in drugs like Sudafed PE, Benadryl Allergy D Plus Sinus, and Vicks Dayquil Cold and Flu Relief.\nBut earlier this month, in a rare move, an FDA advisory panel declared that oral phenylephrine is completely useless at clearing up congestion.\nFischman: That really surprised me. I’ve been buying cold and flu medicines for years. And I always look to see if a decongestant like  phenylephrine is in the capsule.\nLewis: I’d heard for a while that it wasn’t that effective, but it’s in a lot of cold medicines. In fact, it became popular because the standard over-the-counter decongestant, pseudoephedrine —the active ingredient in regular Sudafed—got locked up behind pharmacy counters.  That’s because it can be used as an ingredient in making methamphetamine.\nFischman:  I remember that. In the mid-2000s, all these cold medicines were suddenly put behind plexiglass windows with padlocks on them. I had to ask a pharmacist if I wanted some, and there was a limit to how much I could buy.\nLewis: Exactly. So, more products started using phenylephrine. \nFischman: Basically they were using it as a substitute?\nLewis: Yep. Phenylephrine was actually approved in the 1970s, so it had been around a while. But even back then, the FDA said it wasn’t very effective as a decongestant.\nJennifer Le: There was a cough and cold panel in 1972, in which the panel specifically noted that the data were not strongly indicative of efficacy. So this goes back quite a number of years.\nLewis: That’s Jennifer Le, a professor at the pharmacy school at the University of California San Diego. She was on the recent FDA advisory panel earlier this month that made the decision that phenylephrine wasn’t effective.\nBack in the 1970s, the FDA was more concerned with safety than effectiveness.\nLe: So first and foremost, at the dose that's currently approved, 10 milligram for nasal congestion, it does not appear to provide any safety concerns, except in a very small population who has high blood pressure.\nLewis: Then, in 2007, an FDA advisory panel reviewed the data.\nLe: And in reviewing the data they thought that efficacy was maybe suggestive at higher doses, and so the recommendation at that time was to obtain more clinical data. And the committee who reviewed it withdrew approval for those less than 12 years of age.\nLewis: Fast-forward to today, when another FDA panel—the one Le was one—reviewed the drug’s effectiveness again. They looked at more recent data on both how the drug is metabolized and how well it works in people.\nLe: And the pharmacologic data side indicated that when you take oral phenylephrine, most of it is metabolized to inactive forms, so very little of the active drug—in fact, one percent, based on FDA data—actually gets into the blood.\nFischman: So, most of the drug isn’t even making it to the nose, in other words.\nLewis: Exactly. In addition to that, three trials of oral phenylephrine showed it was no better than a placebo at relieving congestion.\nSo, the committee voted unanimously that oral phenylephrine is basically useless.\nFischman: The FDA panel only reviewed forms of the drug that come in capsules, tablets and syrups, though. So what about things like nasal sprays?\nLewis: They didn’t review phenylephrine nasal sprays. Those might still be effective since they are going right into your nose. But the oral pills won’t do much.\nFischman: But I’ve been taking these cold medications with phenylephrine for years and they do make me feel better. I think. Is that just a placebo effect?\nLewis: Not necessarily. Those meds usually are a combo of several ingredients such as acetaminophen, which helps reduce pain and fever, and antihistamines, which help in the first few days. So the combo may still make you feel better.\nFischman: Overall, though, if oral phenylephrine doesn’t work, what should people use instead of it?\nLewis: I asked Le the same question. She basically said that for short-term congestion with a cold, you should just wait it out.\nLe: The nasal congestion that occurs with the common cold is self-limiting. And so if it's possible, and if it's tolerable—I have a very high tolerance rate when it comes to symptoms— let it resolve, let the symptom resolve. You know, there's nasal saline products that can maybe help with congestion a little bit. A warm, hot, bath, a humidifier can help with some of that too. \nFischman: But Tanya, you said you tried a lot of those things, and often they don’t work. \nLewis: Yeah, I find that most of them only offer temporary relief.\nFischman: So are you just supposed to walk around with your nose blocked or running for a week, and a headache pounding, maybe a box of tissues tucked under your chin? \nLewis: I know, right? It really doesn’t seem great. There are other decongestants, like pseudoephedrine, which you can get by asking a pharmacist, like we mentioned earlier. And that works pretty well. You can also use nasal sprays like Afrin, but be careful—if you use those longer than three days, they can cause your symptoms to rebound.\nFischman: What about other sprays like Flonase or Nasacort?\nLewis: Those steroid nasal sprays work pretty well.

{"title": "2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry Goes to Tiny Quantum Dots with Huge Effects", "date": "2023-10-04 11:21:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nThree scientists won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery of quantum dots, an entirely new class of material that is used in large-screen TVs and cancer surgery\nThe 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded today to three scientists for the discovery of quantum dots. These are nanoparticles so small that their size controls their many properties, such as their color. And that in turns makes them invaluable in applications ranging from large color displays to energy production.\nThe winners are Moungi Bawendi of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Louis Brus of Columbia University and Alexei Ekimov of the firm Nanocrystals Technology in New York State. The three scientists will share the prize of 11 million Swedish kronor, or nearly $1 million.\nProducing a cornucopia of colors, quantum dots are common materials in big television screens today. Essentially they are tiny crystals, but it’s easier to think of each of them as a compressed ball, just a few nanometers in diameter, that contains electrons. The electrons are key to how the dots work. “If you take an electron and put it into a small space, its wave function gets compressed,” meaning the electron has less freedom to move, said Heiner Linke, a member of the Nobel Committee for  Chemistry, at the announcement. The compression allows the electrons to store more energy.\nThe electrons release that energy as photons—packets of light—and those photons will appear as different colors, depending on how much the electrons are squeezed.\nThat change is a quantum effect, one of the mysterious things that happens in the realm of the incredibly small. So, for example, the smallest dots will emit more shorter-wavelength blue light than longer-wavelength red light. Enlarging the dots slightly will change the color composition.\nThe dots are also used in biomedical imaging—to visualize blood vessels feeding tumors—and in solar cells, where they can amplify the energy generated by the panels. Changing their size can also change other properties, such as their melting point.\nBawendi, when reached by phone by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences after the announcement, said he was “very surprised..., sleepy, shocked ... and very honored.” The rest of the world may have been slightly less surprised. Bawendi’s name, along with his two colleagues, was leaked in a document sent out by the academy hours before the official announcement. It was a rare crack in what is ordinarily a highly organized and confidential process. Hans Ellegren, secretary-general of the academy, said the organization did not know what had happened.\nThe news, however it came out, was greeted with applause by other chemists. “These remarkable nanoparticles have huge potential to create smaller, faster, smarter devices, increasing the efficiency of solar panels and the brilliance of your TV screen,” said Gill Reid, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry and an inorganic chemist at the University of Southampton in England, in a recent statement. The Nobel “is really exciting and shows how chemistry can be used to solve a range of challenges,” she said.\nAnd while quantum effects are often considered the province of physics, Judith Giordan, a chemist and president of the American Chemical Society, makes a strong case that dots are chemical products. “We own electrons. They’re on every single atom,” she says. And while the effects of confining electrons in tiny spaces were theorized by physicists, “it was chemists who moved them into novel architectures of atoms, who figured out how to actually produce them in the lab and then in manufacturing settings.”\nThe notion of quantum dots first showed up in theories in the 1930s and then stalled for decades. But in the early 1980s Ekimov put nanoparticles of copper chloride in glass and showed that the particle size changed the color of the glass through quantum effects. Several years later Brus achieved similar color alterations with nanoparticles floating freely in a fluid. \nBawendi, in 1993, developed a way to standardize dot production, which opened the field to many other labs and companies. “He made it easy,” says chemist Rigoberto Advincula, who works on nanoscale technology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Bawendi’s lab created a kind of “soup” of other substances that attached to quantum dot seeds and precisely regulated their growth. This made the seeds very “tunable,” in chemistry lingo, Advincula says. It was a simple way to control their size and thus tune them to produce different levels of energy, he adds.\nIn addition to big screens and solar panels, dots are used to adjust the color of LED lights to make them less harsh. Medical scientists are also exploring their use as sensors and probes for hard-to-find molecules in the body. After the announcement, Bawendi said that “it’s just the beginning.”\nJosh Fischman is a senior editor at Scientific American who covers medicine, biology and science policy. He has written and edited about science and health for Discover, Science, Earth, and U.S. News & World Report.

{"title": "What Colors Do Dogs See?", "date": "2023-10-04 10:45:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nCanine experts weigh in on a TikTok dog vision filter and the rich sensory world of humanity’s best friends\nHave you ever wondered whether your dog could see (and appreciate) the striking pink or nuanced teal color of a new toy? Humans on TikTok are using a dog vision filter to help answer this question. With the filter on, you’ll see the world in shades of blue, yellow and gray—the only colors your pup can perceive.\nBut is this really how our furry friends see the world? Not exactly, experts say—there’s way more to your pet’s vision than color perception.\nScientists once thought dogs saw only in black and white. The idea took off in the public imagination in the 1940s, when optometrist Gordon Walls published his influential book The Vertebrate Eye and Its Adaptive Radiation, in which he claimed that dogs could only weakly see color, if at all. The myth was finally debunked in 1989 when ophthalmologist Jay Neitz, then at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and his colleagues discovered that canines could see blues and yellows but not reds and greens. Some humans, about 8 percent of men and 0.5 percent of women, are similarly red-green color-blind.\nIt turns out that dogs possess two types of color-sensing receptors, called cones, in their retinas. This makes them similar to most mammals—including cats, cattle and pigs—and unlike humans, who have three cones.\n“Our work has had a big influence, and lots of people now understand what color vision in dogs really is,” says Neitz, who is now an ophthalmology professor at the University of Washington.\nBut to really understand how dogs see the world, we need to move beyond color, says Sarah-Elizabeth Byosiere, an animal behaviorist and former director of the Thinking Dog Center at Hunter College. While a green or red ball lying on grass would not stand out easily to your pet, it might challenge them to identify it by its other features—such as its movement, shape and the way it reflects light, Byosiere says. That challenge could either be enriching or frustrating. “It all depends on an individual dog’s behavior,” she says.\nIf you’re really trying to imagine the world through the eyes of your dog, you should picture everything a lot blurrier. Most dogs have 20/75 vision, meaning that they must be 20 feet away from an object to see it as well as a human with clear vision who is standing 75 feet away.\n“Everything looks clear and detailed in those [TikTok] videos, but it wouldn’t look quite as clear to dogs,” Neitz mentions.\nBut unlike humans, who see very poorly in low light, canines have evolved to see well in both daytime and nighttime conditions, explains Paul Miller, a veterinary ophthalmologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Though dogs have fewer color-sensing cones than humans, they have more rods, the cells that help with night vision. They even have a unique structure in their eyes called the tapetum lucidum, a mirrorlike membrane that allows them to see in six times less light than humans can. The tapetum, which some other animals, such as cats and cattle, also possess, sits behind the retina and reflects light back onto it, giving the receptors a second chance to gather more visual detail. It’s also the reason your pet’s eyes glow in photos and in the dark.\nAlso important for dogs’ perception is their sense of smell, which is 10,000 to 100,000 times more powerful than that of an average human. This is as true for chihuahuas and pugs as it is for bloodhounds. While humans have about five million smell receptors, dogs possess up to a billion and can communicate with one another with chemical signals. They can pick up odors as far as 12 miles away.\nAnd canines’ mighty sense of smell is inextricably linked to how they see the world. A study published last year in the Journal of Neuroscience revealed that canines’ brain has a direct connection between their olfactory bulb, which processes smell, and their occipital lobe, which processes vision. This integration of sight and smell had not been observed before in any animal species, the authors stated.\nThe results raise the question of whether dogs’ sense of smell is orienting their sight, Miller says. “It’s pretty wild,” adds Miller, who was not involved in the study. “They [may be able to] smell in 3-D.”\nSo while humans may be attuned to the aesthetics of color, dogs simply aren’t, Neitz says. “I’ve had dogs all my life. And I never really felt like, ‘Oh, my God, my poor dog’s world is limited from a color vision standpoint,’” he says. They live in a very rich olfactory world that humans can’t appreciate, Neitz adds.\nWhen it comes to buying toys for our canine companions, we don’t always have to select the two colors they can see: yellow and blue. Byosiere recommends getting one red and one blue toy to enrich your pet’s play. You may want to throw the red one on the green grass so that your pup uses its nose and then throw a blue one so that it uses its eyes.\n“These animals are not deprived in any way,” Byosiere says. “It’s just that they just see the world in a different way.”\nNiranjana Rajalakshmi is a freelance journalist and a former veterinarian based in Ohio.

{"title": "Cats Are Perfect. An Evolutionary Biologist Explains Why", "date": "2023-10-04 10:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nCats have attained evolutionary perfection\nAnjali Goswami thinks cats are perfect—not in the same way that the average cat person might admire their beauty, athleticism and independence of spirit but from a scientific standpoint. Goswami is an evolutionary biologist at the Natural History Museum in London who studies large-scale patterns of evolution in vertebrate animals through time. She contends that cats—from tabbies to tigers—are quintessential products of evolution. I sat down with her to find out why. Her explanation reveals cats, and the meaning of evolutionary success, in a fascinating new light.\n[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]\nWhen I first came across your argument about cats being perfect, my initial thought as a cat fan was “Well, of course they are. Science confirms the obvious.” But then I realized that this was a really interesting idea. How did it come about?\nI was reading a book by Alex Dehgan called The Snow Leopard Project. In it, he mentioned that in this area in Afghanistan where he was setting up a national park, there are several cat species. I thought that was kind of amazing because ecologically, cats all do the same thing. They’re hard-core predators. They’re carnivores. And there are lots of other places around the world where there are multiple species of cats that coexist—not only today but also in deep time. The thing is, although there are lots of species, they all kind of look the same. They’re just big or small. I started thinking about how cats can be so similar.\nTell me more about how they’re similar. I’m thinking of all the breeds of domestic cat, and even within just that species, there seems to be a lot of variation.\nThey have different coat colors, sure. But they all have the same baby heads. They’re round, and they don’t elongate as the animal matures, which is the standard developmental pattern for mammals. Dogs have short, round faces as puppies but long, snouty faces as adults. An adult cat looks pretty much like a baby cat but bigger. With dogs, breeders play off of that developmental variation to create breeds with different face shapes. But because cats don’t have that developmental variation, there isn’t much to play around with other than coat color.\nThis all goes back to the fact that cats are extremely specialized. Every member of the order of mammals known as the carnivorans, including cats and dogs, has an upper fourth premolar and a lower first molar that form what we call the slicing pair, which slices meat. A lot of carnivorans retain molars behind the slicing pair that can grind up stuff such as vegetation. But cats have lost pretty much everything behind their slicing teeth. They might have a little nub, a peg tooth, but it can’t process stuff. This is why foxes are perfectly happy going through garbage, whereas leopards will kill livestock instead.\nIt doesn’t matter if they’re a tiny Bengal cat or a gigantic lion or tiger. They’re still gonna basically look the same. If you handed me a lion or tiger skull, I could not—as a person who’s a pretty solid expert in carnivorans in general—tell you which one it was. Most people would be hard-pressed to tell you. They look nearly identical. That’s how similar cats are. There’s a teeny amount of allometry [disproportionate change in one body part relative to the whole as a consequence of size] if they get really big: a small elongation of the face and an increase in muscle mass. But the variation is nothing compared with what you see in other groups, such as dogs. Ultimately big cats are really similar to small cats, far more so than you would predict.\nWhat does this have to do with being perfect?\nCats have nailed this one thing so well that they all do it and just come up with slightly different sizes. That’s why they’re perfect, evolutionarily. They don’t need variation. They might get bigger or smaller, but they don’t change anything else because they’re doing it just right otherwise. They’re not jacks-of-all-trades; they’re masters of one.\nBears are the anticats. There are only a few species of bear, and they do different things. You’ve got your superspecialized, weird herbivore, the panda [which basically only eats bamboo]. And then you’ve got spectacled bears [which favor fruits and bromeliads]. You’ve got polar bears, which are hypercarnivorous marine mammals, and the omnivorous black bears and grizzlies. And then there are sloth bears, which mostly eat social insects. So almost every single species of bear does something totally different. And they’re just okay at all of it [laughs]. I really do like bears a lot because of that opposite side of things. They’re interesting because they’re so ecologically diverse.\nPeople usually talk about a group’s diversity as a mark of success. But you’re saying it’s the sameness of cat species, their lack of variation, that indicates that they’re evolutionarily successful, or “perfect.”\nCats challenge standard biases in evolutionary biology. People have said to me, “What about bats? What about rodents? These groups have so many species doing all kinds of things.” And I’m like, “Yeah, because they suck.” They haven’t figured out how to do anything well, so they keep trying different things.\nDo any other vertebrate groups measure up to cats in this way?\nMonitor lizards are as awesome as cats. They are the cats of the reptile world. They vary hugely in body size—they have maybe an even bigger body size range than cats do—and they are all utterly identical. They’re also hard-core carnivores.\nYou and your colleagues have been studying skull evolution in a bunch of animals, and you recently published a paper on what you found in mammals. Did you discover anything interesting about cats in the course of that research?\nWe’ve been trying to measure skull shape in a similar way across all tetrapods (vertebrates with four limbs). We’re looking at salamanders and frogs, birds and crocodiles, dinosaurs and mammals and then trying to understand the variation that we see, the speed at which things evolve and the factors that are associated with how fast things evolve. Within mammals, specifically, being social or solitary affects how fast you evolve. Social mammals evolve faster. Cats are notoriously solitary, except for lions. And cats don’t evolve quickly. Compared with other groups, cats are slowly evolving animals.\nThere are lots of things that have tried to be cats—other groups of mammals that have evolutionarily converged on cats. Marsupials have tried to be cats. An extinct group of carnivorans called creodonts have tried to be cats. Weasels have tried to be cats. There’s all kinds of stuff that has tried to be a bit catlike in different ways—mongooses, things like that. But they kind of dip in and dip out of being cats, and they can’t really outcompete cats in their space. They haven’t lasted. All of those things that have tried to be cats, they do other things, too, and those things are fine. But there aren’t a lot of things that are around today that do a very good job of being a cat.\nSo cats are not only perfect but also inimitable.\nYou can’t just casually try to be a cat. You have to commit. Cats have committed to being cats. Everything else is just sort of dabbling, and it doesn’t work.\nKate Wong is an award-winning science writer and senior editor at Scientific American focused on evolution, ecology, anthropology, archaeology, paleontology and animal behavior. She is fascinated by human origins, which she has covered for more than 25 years. Recently she has become obsessed with birds. Her reporting has taken her to caves in France and Croatia that Neandertals once called home, to the shores of Kenya's Lake Turkana in search of the oldest stone tools in the world, to Madagascar on an expedition to unearth ancient mammals and dinosaurs, to the icy waters of Antarctica where humpback whales feast on krill, and on a \"Big Day\" race around the state of Connecticut to find as many bird species as possible in 24 hours.

{"title": "How AI Could Help China and Russia Meddle in U.S. Elections", "date": "2023-10-03 18:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nChatGPT and similar AI programs give propagandists and intelligence agents a powerful new tool for interfering in politics. The clock is ticking on learning to spot this disinformation before the 2024 election\nThe following essay is reprinted with permission from The Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research.\nElections around the world are facing an evolving threat from foreign actors, one that involves artificial intelligence.\nCountries trying to influence each other’s elections entered a new era in 2016, when the Russians launched a series of social media disinformation campaigns targeting the U.S. presidential election. Over the next seven years, a number of countries – most prominently China and Iran – used social media to influence foreign elections, both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. There’s no reason to expect 2023 and 2024 to be any different.\nBut there is a new element: generative AI and large language models. These have the ability to quickly and easily produce endless reams of text on any topic in any tone from any perspective. As a security expert, I believe it’s a tool uniquely suited to internet-era propaganda.\nThis is all very new. ChatGPT was introduced in November 2022. The more powerful GPT-4 was released in March 2023. Other language and image production AIs are around the same age. It’s not clear how these technologies will change disinformation, how effective they will be or what effects they will have. But we are about to find out.\nElection season will soon be in full swing in much of the democratic world. Seventy-one percent of people living in democracies will vote in a national election between now and the end of next year. Among them: Argentina and Poland in October, Taiwan in January, Indonesia in February, India in April, the European Union and Mexico in June and the U.S. in November. Nine African democracies, including South Africa, will have elections in 2024. Australia and the U.K. don’t have fixed dates, but elections are likely to occur in 2024.\nMany of those elections matter a lot to the countries that have run social media influence operations in the past. China cares a great deal about Taiwan, Indonesia, India and many African countries. Russia cares about the U.K., Poland, Germany and the EU in general. Everyone cares about the United States.\nAnd that’s only considering the largest players. Every U.S. national election from 2016 has brought with it an additional country attempting to influence the outcome. First it was just Russia, then Russia and China, and most recently those two plus Iran. As the financial cost of foreign influence decreases, more countries can get in on the action. Tools like ChatGPT significantly reduce the price of producing and distributing propaganda, bringing that capability within the budget of many more countries.\nA couple of months ago, I attended a conference with representatives from all of the cybersecurity agencies in the U.S. They talked about their expectations regarding election interference in 2024. They expected the usual players – Russia, China and Iran – and a significant new one: “domestic actors.” That is a direct result of this reduced cost.\nOf course, there’s a lot more to running a disinformation campaign than generating content. The hard part is distribution. A propagandist needs a series of fake accounts on which to post, and others to boost it into the mainstream where it can go viral. Companies like Meta have gotten much better at identifying these accounts and taking them down. Just last month, Meta announced that it had removed 7,704 Facebook accounts, 954 Facebook pages, 15 Facebook groups and 15 Instagram accounts associated with a Chinese influence campaign, and identified hundreds more accounts on TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), LiveJournal and Blogspot. But that was a campaign that began four years ago, producing pre-AI disinformation.\nDisinformation is an arms race. Both the attackers and defenders have improved, but also the world of social media is different. Four years ago, Twitter was a direct line to the media, and propaganda on that platform was a way to tilt the political narrative. A Columbia Journalism Review study found that most major news outlets used Russian tweets as sources for partisan opinion. That Twitter, with virtually every news editor reading it and everyone who was anyone posting there, is no more.\nMany propaganda outlets moved from Facebook to messaging platforms such as Telegram and WhatsApp, which makes them harder to identify and remove. TikTok is a newer platform that is controlled by China and more suitable for short, provocative videos – ones that AI makes much easier to produce. And the current crop of generative AIs are being connected to tools that will make content distribution easier as well.\nGenerative AI tools also allow for new techniques of production and distribution, such as low-level propaganda at scale. Imagine a new AI-powered personal account on social media. For the most part, it behaves normally. It posts about its fake everyday life, joins interest groups and comments on others’ posts, and generally behaves like a normal user. And once in a while, not very often, it says – or amplifies – something political. These persona bots, as computer scientist Latanya Sweeney calls them, have negligible influence on their own. But replicated by the thousands or millions, they would have a lot more.\nThat’s just one scenario. The military officers in Russia, China and elsewhere in charge of election interference are likely to have their best people thinking of others. And their tactics are likely to be much more sophisticated than they were in 2016.\nCountries like Russia and China have a history of testing both cyberattacks and information operations on smaller countries before rolling them out at scale. When that happens, it’s important to be able to fingerprint these tactics. Countering new disinformation campaigns requires being able to recognize them, and recognizing them requires looking for and cataloging them now.\nIn the computer security world, researchers recognize that sharing methods of attack and their effectiveness is the only way to build strong defensive systems. The same kind of thinking also applies to these information campaigns: The more that researchers study what techniques are being employed in distant countries, the better they can defend their own countries.\nDisinformation campaigns in the AI era are likely to be much more sophisticated than they were in 2016. I believe the U.S. needs to have efforts in place to fingerprint and identify AI-produced propaganda in Taiwan, where a presidential candidate claims a deepfake audio recording has defamed him, and other places. Otherwise, we’re not going to see them when they arrive here. Unfortunately, researchers are instead being targeted and harassed.\nMaybe this will all turn out OK. There have been some important democratic elections in the generative AI era with no significant disinformation issues: primaries in Argentina, first-round elections in Ecuador and national elections in Thailand, Turkey, Spain and Greece. But the sooner we know what to expect, the better we can deal with what comes.\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

{"title": "Bringing Mars Rocks to Earth Could Cost an Astronomical $11 Billion", "date": "2023-10-03 16:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNASA’s Perseverance rover has collected valuable samples, but a new report says the plan to fetch them is unworkable\nHumanity’s biggest and most ambitious plan to search for extraterrestrial life is about to go back to the drawing board.\nNASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) have been working on a strategy to fly a set of Mars rocks, carefully collected by the Perseverance rover, back to Earth for study. But a new independent assessment of the plan says it can’t be done on current budgets and schedules. The entire project will probably cost between US$8 billion and $11 billion — far more than the roughly $4 billion estimated in a previous independent review report, issued three years ago. And there’s a “near zero probability” of the missions launching in 2027 and 2028, as the space agencies had hoped. Even pushing the launch dates out to 2030 would still cost between US$8 billion and $9.6 billion, the report estimates — comparable with the cost of building the James Webb Space Telescope, the single most expensive astronomy project in history.\nThe report, released on 21 September, stresses that Mars sample return is strategically important to the space agencies, in that it would demonstrate US and European ‘soft power’ at a time when China has also announced plans to bring back rocks from Mars. The mission is also scientifically important: it is the culmination of a decades-long quest to search for life beyond Earth. But the current plan is unworkable, according to the report, which was commissioned by NASA and led by a former NASA manager, Orlando Figueroa.\nNASA says it will put current plans on hold and come up with an alternative strategy by early next year. “It’s going to take a little time for us to assess the path forward,” says Lori Glaze, head of NASA’s planetary-science division in Washington DC. The recommendations from the report are “big”, she says. “They’re not things that can be answered overnight.”\nIn a statement, ESA said it is evaluating how it can adjust its plan while still achieving the overall mission objectives. “We are conducting preliminary studies to assess all options given the various scenarios and will inform member states and coordinate with NASA on the outcome as soon as possible.”\nAs currently envisioned, a Mars sample-return mission would involve NASA building a lander that would fly to the Red Planet to grab up to 30 rock samples, as well as a rocket that would blast off from the Martian surface to carry them into orbit around Mars. ESA would build the spacecraft to retrieve the precious cargo from orbit and fly it back to Earth.\nScientists can analyse the rocks in much greater detail in laboratories on Earth than with the compact instruments available on robotic rovers. The analysis would include hunting for ‘biosignatures’, molecules or other signals of past life in the samples. “These measurements are difficult to do remotely,” says Daniel Glavin, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “You really want the samples back and in the lab.”\nNASA’s Perseverance rover has already collected a bevy of samples from Mars’s Jezero Crater and has even placed ten sealed tubes, containing rock cores, on the ground for possible retrieval. The rover continues to travel around Jezero, gathering more samples that make its collection increasingly valuable as time goes on, the report says. The rocks gathered so far formed in an ancient river delta and lake that were probably once similar to life-friendly environments on Earth.\nMars sample return was one of the highest-ranked priorities recommended for NASA in the last two planetary ‘decadal’ surveys — reports, put together with input from the research community, that aim to guide the direction of US planetary science for the following ten years. But the project has struggled to remain affordable as engineers have refined the designs for the various spacecraft that would be part of the mission. The earlier independent review, which NASA commissioned from experts outside the agency specifically to head off problems with unexpected cost increases, recommended spending $3.8 billion to $4.4 billion on the sample-return project.\nBut that was before engineers had a full sense of what would be involved and hence how much it would cost, Glaze says. And NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, which would lead much of the Mars sample-return project, has struggled with an overstretched work force. This led NASA to delay last year’s planned launch of a separate mission, a spacecraft destined for the asteroid Psyche.\nThere are also questions about how to balance the cost of Mars sample return against other missions in the $3.2-billion budget for NASA’s planetary-science division. The most recent decadal survey, released in 2022, recommended limiting the cost of Mars sample return to no more than 35% of the division’s overall budget. That’s a big challenge as the agency also tries to keep funding going for other priority projects, such as the Dragonfly mission to Saturn’s moon Titan, slated for later this decade, and a mission to Uranus next decade.\nThat means all eyes remain on how to pay for Mars sample return. “The community knew that prioritization of a multi-mission effort and the single most ambitious effort in the history of planetary sciences would have challenges,” says Bethany Ehlmann, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena who helped to lead the most recent decadal survey. “That’s why the [survey] highlights the importance of NASA working with Congress to augment the budget and figure out the appropriate funding profile to get Mars sample return done.”\nThis article is reproduced with permission and was first published on September 27, 2023.\nAlexandra Witze works for Nature magazine.\n\nShannon Hall\nRobin George Andrews\nLeonard David\nJonathan O'Callaghan\nDiscover world-changing science.

{"title": "Beyond Pluto, New Horizons Gets a Reprieve from NASA", "date": "2023-10-03 15:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNASA has reversed course on plans to curtail the New Horizons spacecraft’s planetary science studies following a rebellion among the mission’s leaders\nIt’s lonely out there in the desolation that reigns where NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft now cruises on its one-way trip out of our solar system, with little to pass the time besides sniffing whiffs of plasma and stargazing. After nearly two decades of deep-space operations, the probe is currently more than eight billion kilometers from Earth. And much like our planet itself, the mission’s heyday—a historic encounter with Pluto in 2015 and a 2019 flyby of Arrokoth, the most distant object yet visited by a spacecraft—is receding ever further in the rearview.\nBack on Earth, a battle has raged over the spacecraft’s future. Pluto and Arrokoth alike reside in what’s known as the Kuiper Belt, a remote and mysterious orbital region of icy objects in the outer reaches of our solar system. New Horizons—humanity’s first and so far only robotic emissary to explore the Kuiper Belt—still traverses its depths, dutifully gathering data and somewhat desperately searching for another object to intercept. Yet last year NASA suggested it would end these investigations in an effort to save money, sparking an outcry from astronomers, given that no other spacecraft will explore the Kuiper Belt for decades.\nThat decision, it seems, has been partly reversed. In a statement from NASA posted on September 29, Nicola Fox, associate administrator of the agency’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C., announced some of New Horizons’ Kuiper Belt science would continue. “The agency decided that it was best to extend operations for New Horizons until the spacecraft exits the Kuiper Belt, which is expected in 2028 through 2029,” Fox said. NASA’s statement noted that the agency would “assess the budget impact of continuing the New Horizons mission so far beyond its original plan of exploration” and that other missions may be affected by the decision. “Future projects may be impacted,” the statement added.\nAlan Stern, a planetary astronomer at the Southwest Research Institute, who leads the New Horizons mission, welcomed the decision. “It is good news for Kuiper Belt exploration and very much welcomed by our team and also by the planetary science community,” he says. Pontus Brandt of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) was similarly jubilant. “The community and I are thrilled that this logjam is finally broken,” he says. “This was the right decision for Kuiper Belt science.” Stern notes that some of the finer details are yet to be ironed out, however. It’s not clear, for example, to what extent New Horizons’ studies of the Kuiper Belt will continue, with NASA’s recent statement noting that the agency’s decision “allows for the possibility of using the spacecraft for a future close flyby” of a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO).\nNASA launched the nearly $1-billion New Horizons mission in 2006 on its pioneering voyage to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt. The probe’s arrival at the dwarf planet nine years later was a stunning moment in space exploration, with New Horizons returning breathtaking images of a surprisingly complex world of craggy mountains of ice and seas of frozen nitrogen, as well as snapshots of Pluto’s equally enthralling red-tinted moon Charon. The additional visit to Arrokoth was a lucky bonus, achieved by dint of the KBO’s timely discovery when it was still within reach of the approaching spacecraft’s dwindling propellant reserves. The two flybys produced “spectacular results,” says Jane Luu of the University of Oslo, who co-discovered the Kuiper Belt in 1992.\nAlthough New Horizons’ day-to-day operational needs are modest, they add up to a cost of nearly $10 million per year. Last year NASA approved a mission extension—but only through September 2024 rather than 2025, as requested by Stern and his team. At that point, NASA had planned to end the spacecraft’s planetary science studies in favor of a focus on heliophysics by repurposing New Horizons to exclusively examine how our home star shapes conditions in the outer solar system and toward the hazy boundary with interstellar space. That transition would swap the mission from NASA’s Planetary Science Division to its Heliophysics Division. And given that Stern and his team did not heed the space agency’s request to submit a proposal by November 2022 to dedicate New Horizons solely to heliophysics, the transition would remove them from the mission, too. “We refused to write a proposal that terminated the Kuiper Belt science,” Stern says. “It’s outrageous that you would terminate the only mission purpose-built and sent to the Kuiper Belt while it’s still collecting unique data.”\nSuch a heliocentric shift would have greatly limited the mission’s scientific output, says Jim Green, NASA’s former chief scientist and former head of its planetary science efforts. “It basically pares down the science team to next to nothing and really operates the spacecraft with a minimal cadre,” he says. “From my perspective, if I was the division chief, I would not have made that decision.” He says the reversal was “a good decision” and will “allow the right science for the mission during the right times.”\nThe decision to halt New Horizons’ Kuiper Belt studies originally emerged in 2022 from NASA’s annual review of most of its planetary science missions, a process in which the space agency assesses their current status and future potential. Although this review acknowledged many benefits of New Horizons continuing its current mission, the report also flagged a key weakness. In the absence of a suitable rendezvous target, the spacecraft can only study KBOs from afar—and in far fewer numbers than what various ground-based telescopes can achieve, perhaps less than a dozen. “The proposed studies of [KBOs] are unlikely to markedly improve knowledge,” the review stated, noting the spacecraft’s priorities “should focus on heliophysics and astrophysics.”\nFaith Vilas of the Planetary Science Institute, who led the team that assessed New Horizons for the review, says she and her colleagues did not intend their work to justify ending the mission’s planetary science studies. The team was “being credited, or blamed, for the mission potentially losing the planetary science side of things,” she says. “We didn’t say that. We simply said that all the science together is greater in magnitude than the one portion of science.”\nStern says the mission still has much to offer as it moves through the Kuiper Belt, including feats that cannot be replicated on Earth, such as observing the changing brightness of KBOs as they rotate. “When you do that repeatedly from different angles, you can determine the shape,” he says. “But you can never do that from Earth because you never see the KBOs from significantly different angles.” The spacecraft can also search for binaries—co-orbiting KBOs—in a way Earth-based observers cannot and can collect dust scattered away from distant Kuiper Belt objects. The prospect of visiting a third object remains ever present, too, if a viable target can be found.\nThe spacecraft is projected to exit the known boundaries of the Kuiper Belt in 2028, at which point Stern agrees the Kuiper Belt science could end. “Then I don’t see a reason to continue a planetary science mission,” he says. By some estimates, the spacecraft could continue operating until 2050, when it will be far beyond the generally accepted boundary of interstellar space. At present, no other spacecraft bound for the Kuiper Belt is in development. The next possibility might be Interstellar Probe, a proposal from APL to send a spacecraft to interstellar space. Optimistically assuming Interstellar Probe becomes a reality and launches in 2036, “that would get you out to the same region of space as New Horizons probably within a decade or so,” says Ralph McNutt, who helms the proposal team at APL, “so potentially up to the mid-2040s.”\nIn June Green and other members of the space science community signed a letter to NASA urging the space agency to reconsider its decision and noted “alarm” at the proposed abandonment of Kuiper Belt science. “We ... ask NASA, the Administration, and Congress to reverse course,” they wrote. In September the U.S.-based National Space Society made a similar appeal in its own letter. “Continue New Horizons so we don’t miss out on new discoveries from this rare, perfectly positioned, and fully functional mission,” the letter stated.\nNot all astronomers agree that New Horizons’ remaining Kuiper Belt investigations will be worthwhile, however. Luu says transitioning the mission to a focus on heliophysics and astrophysics would be “a reasonable decision” because ground-based telescopes can surpass the spacecraft’s Kuiper Belt capabilities in many respects, especially by studying many more KBOs at a much faster cadence. “If you just want to use the spacecraft for monitoring KBOs, I would argue it might be better done from the ground,” she says. And the prospects of a third flyby are becoming increasingly remote because no obvious targets have been discovered. “If they find a new candidate, great, but the low-hanging fruits have been picked,” she says.\nMike Brown of the California Institute of Technology, who discovered the object Eris in 2003, which led to Pluto’s demotion from a planet to a dwarf planet, has similar concerns. “These decisions are always tough,” he says. “There is a spacecraft there! It can do unique things! But ultimately it is a zero-sum cost-benefit analysis. Unless there is a new target for a close flyby, it’s hard for me to see why spending a ton of money is justified. If the science can be done on a shoestring, then perhaps that’s fine. But of course, a shoestring in space is probably many full scientific programs on Earth.”\nFor now, New Horizons will continue its studies of the Kuiper Belt—and will remain the only spacecraft likely to do so for many years to come. What knock-on effects its ongoing operations will have on “future projects” alluded to by NASA remains to be seen. Far beyond Pluto, one of our most distant emissaries still speeds on into the unknown.\nJonathan O'Callaghan is an award-winning freelance journalist covering astronomy, astrophysics, commercial spaceflight and space exploration.

{"title": "How Can We Trust AI If We Don't Know How It Works", "date": "2023-10-03 14:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nTrust is built on social norms and basic predictability. AI is typically not designed with either\nThe following essay is reprinted with permission from The Conversation, an online publication covering the latest research.\nThere are alien minds among us. Not the little green men of science fiction, but the alien minds that power the facial recognition in your smartphone, determine your creditworthiness and write poetry and computer code. These alien minds are artificial intelligence systems, the ghost in the machine that you encounter daily.\nBut AI systems have a significant limitation: Many of their inner workings are impenetrable, making them fundamentally unexplainable and unpredictable. Furthermore, constructing AI systems that behave in ways that people expect is a significant challenge.\nIf you fundamentally don’t understand something as unpredictable as AI, how can you trust it?\nTrust is grounded in predictability. It depends on your ability to anticipate the behavior of others. If you trust someone and they don’t do what you expect, then your perception of their trustworthiness diminishes.\nMany AI systems are built on deep learning neural networks, which in some ways emulate the human brain. These networks contain interconnected “neurons” with variables or “parameters” that affect the strength of connections between the neurons. As a naïve network is presented with training data, it “learns” how to classify the data by adjusting these parameters. In this way, the AI system learns to classify data it hasn’t seen before. It doesn’t memorize what each data point is, but instead predicts what a data point might be.\nMany of the most powerful AI systems contain trillions of parameters. Because of this, the reasons AI systems make the decisions that they do are often opaque. This is the AI explainability problem – the impenetrable black box of AI decision-making.\nConsider a variation of the “Trolley Problem.” Imagine that you are a passenger in a self-driving vehicle, controlled by an AI. A small child runs into the road, and the AI must now decide: run over the child or swerve and crash, potentially injuring its passengers. This choice would be difficult for a human to make, but a human has the benefit of being able to explain their decision. Their rationalization – shaped by ethical norms, the perceptions of others and expected behavior – supports trust.\nIn contrast, an AI can’t rationalize its decision-making. You can’t look under the hood of the self-driving vehicle at its trillions of parameters to explain why it made the decision that it did. AI fails the predictive requirement for trust.\nTrust relies not only on predictability, but also on normative or ethical motivations. You typically expect people to act not only as you assume they will, but also as they should. Human values are influenced by common experience, and moral reasoning is a dynamic process, shaped by ethical standards and others’ perceptions.\nUnlike humans, AI doesn’t adjust its behavior based on how it is perceived by others or by adhering to ethical norms. AI’s internal representation of the world is largely static, set by its training data. Its decision-making process is grounded in an unchanging model of the world, unfazed by the dynamic, nuanced social interactions constantly influencing human behavior. Researchers are working on programming AI to include ethics, but that’s proving challenging.\nThe self-driving car scenario illustrates this issue. How can you ensure that the car’s AI makes decisions that align with human expectations? For example, the car could decide that hitting the child is the optimal course of action, something most human drivers would instinctively avoid. This issue is the AI alignment problem, and it’s another source of uncertainty that erects barriers to trust.\nOne way to reduce uncertainty and boost trust is to ensure people are in on the decisions AI systems make. This is the approach taken by the U.S. Department of Defense, which requires that for all AI decision-making, a human must be either in the loop or on the loop. In the loop means the AI system makes a recommendation but a human is required to initiate an action. On the loop means that while an AI system can initiate an action on its own, a human monitor can interrupt or alter it.\nWhile keeping humans involved is a great first step, I am not convinced that this will be sustainable long term. As companies and governments continue to adopt AI, the future will likely include nested AI systems, where rapid decision-making limits the opportunities for people to intervene. It is important to resolve the explainability and alignment issues before the critical point is reached where human intervention becomes impossible. At that point, there will be no option other than to trust AI.\nAvoiding that threshold is especially important because AI is increasingly being integrated into critical systems, which include things such as electric grids, the internet and military systems. In critical systems, trust is paramount, and undesirable behavior could have deadly consequences. As AI integration becomes more complex, it becomes even more important to resolve issues that limit trustworthiness.\nAI is alien – an intelligent system into which people have little insight. Humans are largely predictable to other humans because we share the same human experience, but this doesn’t extend to artificial intelligence, even though humans created it.\nIf trustworthiness has inherently predictable and normative elements, AI fundamentally lacks the qualities that would make it worthy of trust. More research in this area will hopefully shed light on this issue, ensuring that AI systems of the future are worthy of our trust.\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

{"title": "Climate Disruptions Are Especially Dangerous for the Opioid Epidemic", "date": "2023-10-03 12:00:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nDrug users must be considered in health and climate preparedness efforts\nAs debates rage over how we can best protect those more directly affected by climate change, one group remains absent from the discussion: people with an opioid addiction.\nAround three million people in the U.S. have an opioid use disorder or are dependent on heroin. More than 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses from April 2022 to April 2023, most of which were from illicit fentanyl opioids. Cities with high overdose rates, such as New York City, San Francisco, Calif., and Phoenix, Ariz., are also at the highest risk of extreme heat, drought and flooding, and the opioid epidemic is likely to peak just as climate change’s most brutal effects start to take root.\nDuring environmental crises, drug users frequently experience more social and economic hardships than the rest of the population. These hardships often snowball into poor health outcomes, including death. Climate change will likely disrupt the illegal drug supply chain—making dangerous drugs even more variable and deadly. Soaring temperatures will make people more vulnerable to overdose. Despite this, drug users are typically not considered in public health efforts related to climate change preparedness. This urgently needs to change.\nAuthorities must start thinking about the intersection between climate change and drug use. They must design climate literacy programs for drug users, build a housing policy that considers climate change’s impact and make harm reduction programs more widely available.\nAs part of the Helping to End Addiction Long-Term (HEAL) Initiative, I research various aspects of America’s ongoing opioid epidemic. Despite all the useful data the project is producing, climate change’s influence has been of little interest to researchers in the initiative or scholars in the field. It wasn’t until last year that the National Institutes of Health announced the availability of funds to support research that specifically examines the intersection between climate change and substance use. Unsurprisingly, there has been very little published on the topic, significantly limiting the opportunity to study and develop solutions to stem the unique risks that drug users face. This inertia comes as the United Nations has yet again warned of the dire need for implementable, cost-efficient solutions to climate change and after the opioid epidemic’s status as a public health emergency was renewed earlier this year. The staggering economic costs have also been overlooked: climate-fueled disasters cost the U.S. roughly $151 billion per year, while the financial impacts of the opioid epidemic land at roughly $1.5 trillion per year, about seven times the annual cost of addressing heart disease in this country.\nThe link between environmental disaster and drug use became clear in 2017 when Hurricane Maria caused an estimated 5,000 deaths in Puerto Rico. Amid the typical flurry of media images of flooded homes, downed power lines and uprooted trees, drug use and overdose rates dramatically increased, as did needle reuse, a key driver of HIV, which has been soaring in Puerto Rico. While groups such as older and homeless people or those with disabilities often receive special outreach and tailored resources during weather-related disasters, virtually nothing is done to formally forecast and address the needs of illicit drug users during these events. Indeed, the U.S. government’s health authorities currently provide no official guidance or support for preempting this disastrous domino effect.\nClimate change will exacerbate overdose and death risk through the increasingly intricate opioid supply chain. As supplies become harder to transport, drug users, like other consumers, could see steep increases in their product’s costs and decreases in quality. More opioid users will likely switch to cheaper but far more potent and potentially lethal synthetic substances, such as fentanyl. Also, extreme heat can create a deeply sedative effect, making lethargy, muscle breakdown and dehydration worse, all of which significantly increases the risk of fatal overdose.\nTo get ahead of the collision course, it’s essential for public health authorities to first build greater climate change literacy among drug users. This effort must begin by providing them with tailored educational materials that highlight climate change’s core causes and consequences. Most importantly, these materials must identify drug users’ specific vulnerabilities, given their socioeconomic and geographical circumstances.\nNext, we need to build climate-related emergency reserves for home maintenance programs and for rent and mortgage payment deferrals. Housing insecurity is not only intimately connected to drug use onset but also to overdose risk. America’s housing crisis—which intensified during the COVID pandemic—will deepen as property damage from extreme weather accelerates and unemployment rises. More people will be displaced and unhoused. Housing officials have implemented policies to prevent this before. During the more intense waves of the pandemic, officials turned toward eviction moratoriums, which were highly effective before they were rolled back last year.\nFinally, we need deeper support for harm-reduction services and treatment such as naloxone, an emergency opioid-overdose-reversal medication, and highly effective drug treatments such as Suboxone, which are harder to obtain for people in Black and low-income communities. We can anticipate that by the early 2030s there will be an increasing need for these resources and the safety net that propels them. In addition to increasing overdose rates, a lack of investment in harm reduction will spur a rapid increase in HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections.\nThere is no simple solution to address the intersecting crises of climate change and opioid misuse. The best-case scenario is that local governments and industry can collaborate to improve the flow of resources to drug users and those at risk of developing an opioid use disorder. The hyperstigmatization that drug users experience is likely to keep them right in climate change’s crosshairs. This is an altogether different type of pollution that is nonetheless as elusive as the one driving climate change.\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.\nJerel Ezell is an assistant professor of community health sciences at the University of California, Berkeley.

{"title": "Mars Sample-Return Missions Could Reduce Tensions with China on Earth", "date": "2023-10-03 11:30:00", "text": "Nobel Prize Sale!\nNobel Prize Sale!\nThe U.S. may not beat China at retrieving Martian rocks first, according to an independent review board’s conclusion. But the U.S. can still lead with an exchange of samples here on Earth\nIn September NASA’s Mars Sample Return (MSR) independent review board (IRB), led by the agency’s former “Mars czar” Orlando Figueroa, released findings and recommendations about the MSR project, a collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) that means to return the first samples from the Red Planet. The IRB members did a terrific job analyzing, in their words, the “near zero probability” of its current plans and budget succeeding.\nMars Sample Return matters to our nation and space program and to science, the board emphasized. The return of carefully selected samples, such as ones weathered by geothermal vents, as well as sedimentary and aggregated rocks, will allow scientists on Earth to extensively examine their geochemistry and microscopic composition. It could possibly reveal signs of life, or at least the ingredients of life, on Mars. The mission therefore directly addresses the principal question of space exploration—the nature of life in the universe. But the report’s key finding makes it clear that the mission needs a stretched-out, more robust architecture that would delay its launch into the 2030s and the return of samples to the mid- or even late 2030s. “The current MSR architecture is highly constrained and is not sufficiently robust or resilient,” the panel said in its report. NASA’s current sample-return mission plan relies on the aging Perseverance rover, launched in 2020, to collect its samples. A second rover from Europe was planned, but its development was cancelled. There is a backup plan in case Perseverance is not working, but it relies on brand-new helicopters doing something novel: picking up and carrying the samples. A delay and stretch-out of the schedule will make the rover older when it is needed and move the mission into less favorable trajectory opportunities in the 2030s. That raises the cost and risks of the mission and lowers its chances for success. The report concludes, “Other [return mission] architectures may be more robust and more resilient to schedule risk.”\nIn other words: back to the drawing board. If NASA and ESA continue with MSR (and the report strongly recommends that they should), then a more robust plan involving the collection of more samples and including additional hardware (possibly another rover) must be devised. This plan would stretch well into the 2030s. The panel also noted China’s development of its own, much simpler Mars sample-return mission for 2028 or 2030, which is likely to bring samples back to Earth several years before the NASA-ESA mission returns. (The Chinese mission is more of a “grab sample” mission, in which a lander takes samples from the immediate vicinity of its landing site, and it is much shorter in duration than the NASA-ESA one.) This need not be a negative. We can make the most of our more robust mission by engaging with a putative rival. This will allow us to serve diplomacy while serving science.\nAccording to the report, the NASA-ESA plan is much better scientifically. It will be able to obtain many more extraordinarily well-selected samples, based on both years of in situ experience from previous missions and a careful and extensive sampling campaign by the Perseverance rover. The sampling will be far more wide-ranging than that of the Chinese plan, which is limited to one small region around the mission’s landing spot. Nevertheless, it would be beneficial for American and European scientists to be able to analyze a bit of those first samples—both to uncover the intrinsic science they contain and to exercise the extensive plans of the NASA sampling procedures. Similarly, Chinese scientists would benefit enormously if they had some access to the NASA-ESA samples. A sample exchange would benefit both the U.S. and China. And therein lies the opportunity.\nExamining each other’s samples poses no conceivable strategic threat to either country—the likelihood of a microscopic secret inside a Martian rock helping either nation in their military or economic competition is around zero. But cooperating on this Martian investigation could build up a benign and positive scientific relationship that would serve both countries. It would add to our exploration of Mars, and there are no downsides to advancing China’s exploration of Mars. It plays into American strength—our vigorous and successful science experience on Mars—and mitigates the more trivial worry about who will conduct a Mars sample-return mission first. And it provides resiliency to further delays or mission problems.\nOne obstacle would be reluctance springing from a 2011 law barring even the barest NASA cooperation with China without FBI approval. Exchanging samples involves no dangerous interactions with sensitive hardware or software. But this draconian law has so inhibited agency scientists that one privately told me that they were reluctant to even have a cup of coffee with Chinese researchers at space events. The policy allows the U.S. to cooperate in space with Vladimir Putin while ruling it out with the world’s other leading economy. That might suggest that we need to rethink it.\nChina and the U.S. are at an impasse right now—one filled with hostile, mistrusting, edgy geopolitics. Space cooperation among rivals has a distinguished history. Even now, the U.S. and Russia cooperate on the International Space Station, and in the middle of the cold war, we exchanged lunar samples from the Apollo and Luna missions. Moreover, neither the U.S. nor China want to let current foreign policy tensions move toward confrontation. Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping have expressed interest in developing cooperative initiatives, and in the past three months several U.S. Cabinet officials have gone to China to seek such initiatives. Mars certainly could provide one consistent with the long history of international cooperation in space that would support peace and geopolitical stability.\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.\nLouis Friedman holds a Ph.D. in aeronautics and astronautics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
