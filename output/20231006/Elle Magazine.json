{"title": "A Complete Timeline of Zendaya and Tom Holland’s Romantic Relationship", "date": "2023-10-05 21:59:00", "text": "Spider-Man: No Way Home co-stars Zendaya and Tom Holland finally confirmed they are in a romantic relationship after years of off and on rumors that they were dating. They've been playing love interests Peter Parker and MJ in the franchise since 2017, but met on set in 2o16. They've obviously been close, but it was in July of 2021 that the paparazzi caught them kissing at a stop light, giving those rumors some more legitimacy. \nThe couple still plays their personal lives very privately, but these are the notable moments in the timeline of their relationship so far. \nHolland was the first to post a photo of Zendaya, but soon they were appearing on one another's Instagram feeds regularly. In July 2016, he shared a pic of them with another friend at the pool, captioned, “Summer Sunday's.”\nZendaya posted their shared Hollywood Reporter cover just a few months later, writing, “Amidst all the chaos and sadness...this one good thing did happen to me today. Honored to share it with the very best...Spider-Man himself.” \nHolland and Zendaya's chemistry onscreen transferred easily to the red carpet, and photos of them being playful with one another at the San Diego Comic-Con were widely circulated by fans.\nIn May 2017, they start attending events together, possibly because of promotional opportunities, but photos taken of them show a more personal relationship, like this photo from the MTV Movie and TV Awards.\nThroughout the month, they're frequently photographed together as they promote Spider-Man, but it seems like the easy chemistry of two familiar colleagues. \nIn July 2017, a source confirms to People magazine that they are together.\n“They started seeing each other while they were filming Spider-Man,” the source said. “They’ve been super careful to keep it private and out of the public eye, but they’ve gone on vacations with each other and try and spend as much time as possible with one another.”\nA second insider added, “They’re both really ambitious, and they challenge each other—but, most importantly, they make each other crack up. They seem to have a really similar sense of humor and love joking around together. They have great banter back and forth.” \nBefore the Spider-Man: Homecoming premiere in June, Holland was gushing to People about his friendship with Zendaya, saying, “We are like the best of friends. She’s so great and amazing. I’m a little worried [about dealing with fame … [but] Zendaya is super famous and she’s been through this and I just call her up and say, ‘How do I manage being famous?’ I’m very glad I have a friend like her.”\nThe pair addressed the dating rumors above by tweeting to one another about the idea they've gone on vacation together.\n“Wait wait...my favorite is when it says we go on vacations together HA! I haven't been on a vacation in years! hbu?” Zenday wrote to Holland.\nHe joked back, “Does the press tour count?”\n@Zendaya Does the press tour count 😂😝 https://t.co/2WsstZPyde\nThe next month, Zendaya denied the rumors again in an interview with Variety.\n“We are friends,” she said. “He’s a great dude. He’s literally one of my best friends. This past how many months we’ve had to do press tours together. There’s very few people that will understand what that’s like at 20 years old.” \nThe next month, Zendaya told fans she'd been cheated on in the past and why it left her a bit skeptical about relationships early in life. The actress is currently 25-years-old, so at the time she was just out of her teen years.\n“I’m so anti being in a committed relationship when you’re young and people are learning and growing, because when people are young, they make bad decisions sometimes because they don’t know any better,” she explained. “It doesn’t mean they don’t know the difference between right and wrong—it just means that they’re still in the experimental phase in their life where they haven’t made the right decisions yet…it’s very hard to be in a relationship when the both of you are still figuring out life. You cannot change anybody. You cannot make someone grow up faster than they’re supposed to.”\nAt this point, Holland has met Zendaya's parents, meeting them at a steakhouse in New York.\nIn March 2018, the two stars sat together at the Oscars, though they walked the carpet separately. They were seen later that month at a comic book store in Los Angeles.\nZendaya attended the Met Gala, wearing a Joan of Arc-inspired chainmail Versace gown, and Holland posted a photo of her to his Instagram writing, “All hail the queen. Killing it mate.”\nThe next month, Zendaya posted a video of Holland goofing off with a lightsaber to wish him a happy birthday. She captioned the video: “Happy birthday loser…” \nIn September, Holland celebrated Zendaya's birthday with a paparazzi photo from their date at the comic book store and a statue of Spider-Man. \n“Me, myself and the birthday girl. Happy birthday mate - keep killing it and paving the way for the rest of us,” he wrote adding a heart. (Seems like he likes calling her “mate” a lot.)\nBut then a few days later, Skai Jackson’s mother said on Instagram that they are, in fact, a couple.\n“Yes. It's true. They been on the low for a while,” she wrote.\nShe then denied she was the commenter using her screen name., “Nothing posted or said was me. I could [sic] care less or know who was dating who. Please stop asking.” Okay then!  \nHolland and Zendaya begin their Spider-Man: Far From Home press tour, and when Holland posts an Instagram of himself, Zendaya, and co-star Jacob Batalon, he accidentally tags her name in a very suggestive place.\n“I'm assuming because you don't know how to work ig, that's the reasoning behind my name placement,” she commented with five laughing emojis.\nHolland  edits the tag and writes, “Thanks @zendaya for making me aware of my obvious blunder.” \nHolland shoots down the Zendaya dating rumors again. The actor tells ELLE in an interview that he is single and not romantically involved with anyone. He admits he is “definitely a relationship person. I’m not the fleeting type at all; it’s not my way of life.”  \nZendaya is seen with her Euphoria costar Jacob Elordi and they  are spotted together on vacation in Greece. Again, Zendaya never confirms she's dating Elordi, but paparazzi did catch Elordi giving her a kiss in New York City in February 2020. By September of that year, Elordi seems to be dating Kaia Gerber (but they broke up in November 2021.)\nTom Holland appears to go Instagram official with his girlfriend Nadia Parkes, who he was supposedly spending lockdown with in London. \nThen, two years after denying they're a couple, the Spider-Man co-stars were spotted together in Holland's car sharing a kiss at a red light in LA. They were then seen in the Silver Lake neighborhood the same day, leaving Zendaya's mother Claire Stoermer's residence. \nHolland and Zendaya are photographed at a friend's wedding for an Instagram story. In the photo, Zendaya is leaning into Holland and he has his hand on her sleeve in an intimate gesture. \n📸 | NEW picture of Tom Holland and Zendaya at a friends wedding tonight most likely in Oakland. Via: estebancamarillo Instagram stories pic.twitter.com/spFCMu4w1v\nTom Holland shares a mirror selfie of himself with Zendaya on the set of Spider-Man, captioning it, “My MJ, have the happiest of birthdays. Gimme a call when your [sic] up xxx.” \nLater that month, Zendaya posts photos of herself on the red carpet for the Venice Film Festival in her Balmain dress, looking stunning. Holland commented with three flame emojis, because she's definitely looking hot hot hot.\nHolland once again posts Zendaya to his timeline, this time with a photo of her on the red carpet for Dune, captioned with a hearts-eye emoji.\nA day later, Zendaya was also promoting Dune, this time with co-star Timothée Chalamet. The pair were testing one another's friendship knowledge for a BuzzFeed video when Chalamet was asked who Zendaya's biggest crush is. \n“Easy, Tom Holland!” Chalamet answers immediately, setting Zendaya off into a fit of giggles.\nIn an interview with GQ, Tom Holland talks to about relationships and the importance of privacy.\n“One of the downsides of our fame is that privacy isn’t really in our control anymore, and a moment that you think is between two people that love each other very much is now a moment that is shared with the entire world,” Holland said. \nZendaya told the outlet something similar, saying, “The equal sentiment [we both share] is just that when you really love and care about somebody, some moments or things, you wish were your own.…I think loving someone is a sacred thing and a special thing and something that you want to deal with and go through and experience and enjoy amongst the two people that love each other.”\nDuring the London photo call for Spider-Man: No Way Home, Holland is  interviewed and points to Zendaya, saying, “There she is—looking beautiful, might I add.”\nOn December 13, the Los Angeles premiere of the film includes this adorable moment when Holland sees Zendaya walk in and gets stopped in his tracks. They do look stunning together on the red carpet, too.\nLater that week, Zendaya posted photos of Holland as Spider-Man at two different ages, writing, “My Spider-Man, I’m so proud of you, some things never change and good thing.”\nZendaya came to meet Holland's family in London, attending with his brothers Harry Potter and the Cursed Child on West End on January 22. The next day, Holland and Zendaya were at Holland's family's house in casual clothing.\nTom Holland and Zendaya seen in New York City as Holland promoted his new film Uncharted, and held hands as they left their hotel together. Matching in dark tones, Zendaya wore a belted gray shirt dress while Holland wore a light gray suit and black top. Both wore black masks amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\nLater that month, Holland flew to Rome to surprise Zendaya with a date at Antica Pesa in the city’s Trastevere neighborhood, Page Six reported. Multiple sources told the outlet about the couple’s date, which started at 7 P.M. there and went until 10:30 P.M.\nOne eyewitness said, “She seemed visibly thrilled. They sat in a corner by the fireplace and were adorable together. They looked in love.” Insiders described the two as being “in deep conversation” there.\n“Zendaya looked stunning, even as simply dressed as she was. They are adorable together,” the source said, adding they were later joined by friends. “[They] laughed all night while being cute with each other.”\nThe restaurant shared a photo of Zendaya and Holland with chef Francesco Panella on its Instagram. \n“Thank you @tomholland2013 for coming back again to @anticapesa for your surprise night with @zendaya & friends,” he captioned the shot.\nHolland also traveled to Boston to visit Zendaya as she was shooting the romantic drama The Challengers in the city, Boston.com reported. The couple were seen having a coffee day date together at Tatte on Boylston Street. Zendaya was dressed down in a white top and glasses, and in one shot shared on Instagram, was seen looking adoringly at her partner:\nGreat Day in BostonSaw @Zendaya and @TomHolland1996 casually having a day in the city. Y’all take care and I’ll see you around. pic.twitter.com/OPE0CDehW8\nIn early September, Zendaya celebrated her her 26th birthday in Manhattan with Holland at MAMO Italian restaurant. The actress looked casual and chic in low-waisted denim jeans and a black crop top with long sleeves and a V-neck, which was held together with a few buttons in front. Zendaya dressed the outfit up a bit with suede pumps and a pair of diamond earrings and a pendant. \nHolland arrived at the restaurant in a blue plaid button-down, dark teal pants, and white sneakers. They were joined by several of Zendaya's co-stars, including her Euphoria cast mate Hunter Schafer. Zendaya's mother Claire Stoermer was also in attendance. \nLater in September, Zendaya spoke about Holland when she was interviewed by E! News just after winning an Emmy Award for her performance as Rue on Euphoria. After they asked who she texted first after winning she replied, “Well, I didn't have to text my mom because my mom was already there, she's here tonight, which is very special. And I texted my boyfriend.”\nZendaya and Tom Holland visited the Louvre in Paris, walking hand-in-hand through the famous museum's galleries. They were both dressed casually for their day out, Zendaya wearing a large light blue blouse with her sleeves rolled up, her hair up in a bun with a few curling tendrils around her face. She wore a pair of glasses for the tour, a black bag, and carried a small camera.\nHolland was in a white and black striped shirts with long sleeves and black pants, his short hair tousled. Zendaya was in the city for Paris Fashion Week, which ended on October 4. \nJust before Thanksgiving, a source tells US Magazine that the two Spider-Man stars are getting closer all the time and seem “serious and permanent.”\n“They’re both in settling-down mode and are absolutely planning for a real future together,” the source added.\nAfter taking a break from social media over the summer, fans noted Holland's exploring Instagram again. A fan edit of Zendaya looking fantastic in a million outfits was popular on the algorithm, and it eventually reached her boyfriend. The clip is captioned, “just zendaya owning the camera,” and clearly he agreed because he hit the like button.\nFans noted his “heart” on the images and were thrilled to see he is as in love as ever.\nEarlier that month, they made an appearance on Instagram together after Holland accompanied Zendaya on a visit to her old high school in Oakland. Pictures of the meet-and-greet were shared by her theatre teacher Tavia Percia.\nNeither Zendaya nor Holland attend any award season shows with each other, but during Oscars weekend, the couple is seen in London, where Holland's family is based, and days later together at a grocery store in the city.\nFans noticed later that month that Zendaya was wearing a ring with Holland's initials. They also noted that Holland has been wearing pants with a “Z” initial on the back pocket in sweet sartorial tributes to each other.\nZendaya spotted wearing an engraved gold ring with boyfriend, Tom Holland’s, initials in her manicurist’s Instagram story. pic.twitter.com/Vbw9pMYLNw\nIn May, the couple were visiting Venice together, and photographed getting into a private boat as they left the Gritti Palace hotel. Holland was wearing khaki pants and a white button down with the top button open to reveal a thin gold chain. His girlfriend wore a grey body-hugging knit dress with a thigh slip under a black jacket. On her feet were matching black leather boots, and she was also wearing a gold necklace for the Italian outing. Holland got into the boat ahead of his girlfriend and she navigated it a bit more slowly.\nTom Holland joked about his “rizz” during a BuzzFeed, slang for “charisma,” and why he's glad he already has a girlfriend.\n“I'm happy and in love, so I've got no need for rizz,” he said. “I have no rizz whatsoever; I have limited rizz... I need you to fall in love with me, really, for it to work.”\nHe added, “So, long game. Probably making a movie with each other — it definitely helps when the characters are falling in love with one another; you can sort of blur the lines a little bit.”\nHe also shared that his girlfriend Zendaya was was also his childhood celebrity crush.\n“Zendaya. Easily,” he replied after they asked for names.\nHolland appeared that same month in a cover story for The Hollywood Reporter, and he discussed why the couple keeps their life private. It's partyly because they are “two very busy people.”\n“Our relationship is something that we are incredibly protective of and we want to keep as sacred as possible,” he explained. “We don’t think that we owe it to anyone, it’s our thing, and it has nothing to do with our careers.”\nHe also joked about how his Spider-Man co-star sends him constant content on social media.\n“She sends me too much, it's like, I can't keep up,” Holland said. “I delete my Instagram for days at a time. I download it to post and then I have to check my messages, and I'll have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of things from her.”\nOn the July 3 episode of the Wondery podcast Smartless, Holland spoke with hosts Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes, and Will Arnett about why he and Zendaya work so well.\n“I'm lucky that I have someone like Zendaya in my life,” Holland said. “It's interesting being in a romantic relationship with someone that is in the same boat as you.”\nHe continued, “You can share your experiences and all that sort of stuff — and that's worth its weight in gold.”\nZendaya spoke to ELLE about whether fan liking her and Holland as a couple so much makes it easier to accept the public’s interest in them.  \n“Parts of my life, I accept, are going to be public,” she replied. “I can’t not be a person and live my life and love the person I love. But also, I do have control over what I choose to share. It’s about protecting the peace and letting things be your own but also not being afraid to exist. You can’t hide. That’s not fun, either. I am navigating it more than ever now.”\nFor Zendaya’s 27th birthday on September 1, Holland shared a tribute to her on his Instagram Story. “My birthday girl 😍,” he captioned a shot of her getting ready to scuba dive.\nZendaya and Holland spent some time cuddling up with newborn puppies in early October...and Holland shared an Instagram grid post from the outing featuring both him and his girlfriend. “Puppies,” he captioned it. “🫠🥺,” Zendaya commented.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "All About Dylan Meyer, Kristen Stewart’s Screenwriter Fiancée", "date": "2023-10-05 21:56:00", "text": "As Kristen Stewart and Dylan Meyer’s relationship continues way past the two-year mark, things between them are stronger than ever—to the point where they’re ready to get married. On November 2, 2021, Stewart revealed the two are engaged to Howard Stern, and Meyer popped the question.\n“We’re marrying, we’re totally gonna do it,” Stewart said. “I wanted to be proposed to, so I think I very distinctly carved out what I wanted and she nailed it. We’re marrying, it’s happening.”\nIt’s a decidedly new chapter for Stewart, who opened up in a recent issue of InStyle about being “sort of cagey” in previous relationships. Meyer and Stewart were first romantically linked in summer 2019, but the couple actually met six years before on a movie set, Stewart told Howard Stern last November. They later reconnected at a birthday party for a mutual friend. “The day that I met her, all bets were off,” Stewart remembered. “I was like, ‘Where have I been and how have I not known you?’ She's been, like, living in LA alongside my life somehow but not ever converging?”\nThe actress even told the radio host that she was ready to propose in November 2019, two years before it actually happened. \nIn July 2021, the two even sparked secret marriage rumors when they were photographed wearing rings on their left ring fingers, although they never even announced they were engaged. In September 2021, the two were photographed together again, signaling their relationship remains on and strong.\nAhead, everything we know about Meyer, including her screenwriting career and how she paid tribute to Stewart during her birthday and Valentine's Day in 2023.\nStewart told Stern that she met Meyer on a movie set six years ago. While she didn't specify which one, Meyer has written and co-starred in multiple films and TV shows. She co-wrote and executive produced the 2016 Netflix movie XOXO, starring Sarah Hyland. She penned episodes of the sci-fi series Miss 2059. Meyer also wrote the short films Loose Ends (2015) and Rock Bottom (2019), which you can watch right here:\nAs for her acting credits, Meyer has appeared in short films including The Death and Return of Superman (2011), Wrestling Isn't Wrestling (2015), and Jem Reacts to the New Jem and the Holograms Trailer (2015). \nRumors about Meyer and Stewart's relationship began in August 2019 when the pair was seen kissing on a New York City stoop. The sighting came less than a month after Stewart was photographed kissing on-off girlfriend Stella Maxwell on a yacht in Italy. A source told E! at the time that while \"it will always be very easy for Kristen to fall back with Stella,\" she's focused on her new relationship with Meyer. \n\"Kristen is spending time with Dylan and very happy about it,\" the insider told E! News. \"She was seeing Stella for a little bit while it worked, but now she has moved on with Dylan.\" The source added, \"Kristen isn't holding back at all and loves being with her. They are moving quickly and always together.\"\nStewart confirmed the fast-paced nature of their romance during her November interview with Stern, revealing to him that she told Meyer she loved her two weeks into dating. \"It was like really late, and we were in some shitty bar, and her friends were there or whatever, and they like walked out, and I was just like, 'Oh man, I’m so f*cking in love with you. Done,'\" she recalled. \"It wasn't like a thing, and also it was like so obvious. It just is.\" Stewart later added of their connection,  \"We're both from L.A. and we really love L.A. We're both kind of like, scumbags. We both felt like trolls as kids. We're so similar but different. She's a writer; she's brilliant.\"\nAlthough Stewart herself doesn't have a public Instagram, Meyer shared a first glimpse into the couple's relationship last October. She posted a black-and-white snap of a polaroid where the couple can be seen kissing. \"Find me under the covers hiding from the happiness police. 🖤,\" she captioned the post.\nSix months later, Meyer shared a birthday tribute for Stewart on the 'gram, writing, \"It’s my absolute favorite person's birthday and I’m wishing everyone the volume of beautiful feeling I feel toward her. It's a short ride on this earth, spend your time with someone that inspires you to be the best version of yourself and lights your shit on fire.\"\nWhen Meyer isn't gushing about Stewart, her social media is filled with a ton of nature and animal photos. You'll find pictures of her cats Zsa Zsa and Snack in various scenarios, as well as outdoor shots from around Los Angeles.\nThe couple may keep their romance private, but that doesn't mean things aren't serious between them. During her November 2019 interview with Stern, Stewart got very candid about her feelings toward Meyer. She told Stern that she \"can't f*cking wait\" to propose to Meyer and said she would \"absolutely\" get married. \n\"Yeah, I want to be, like, somewhat reasonable about it, but I think good things happen fast,\" Stewart continued, telling Stern she has a plan for how she'll pop the question. \"I can't say right now, because she'll find out.\" Stewart also said that her matrimony plans weren't \"tied to any weird sort of convention; it's just, like, when you know, you know.\"\nMeyer and Stewart kept a low-profile during stay-at-home orders but made made a rare outing in June 2020 for a coffee run in L.A. The Daily Mail captured photos of the couple wearing casual gray and black outfits, masks, and sunglasses while on their errand.  \nThe outlet also published photos of the couple participating in a Black Lives Matter protest in Los Angeles earlier this month, following the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and others at the hands of police. \nSources told  E! in October 2020 that Stewart and Meyer attended an intimate baby shower for Emma Roberts and Garrett Hedlund. (Stewart and Hedlund co-starred together in 2012's On the Road.) They joined the likes of Camilla Morrone (Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriend) and Lily Kershaw to celebrate the upcoming arrival of Roberts and Hedlund's son.\nStewart, who next stars in the LGBTQ holiday rom-com Happiest Season, doesn’t have a ’gram. However, she used her girlfriend’s platform to urge people to vote in the upcoming election. “I turned the mic over to Kristen because she had some things to say and doesn’t have her own account. Happy #nationalvoterregistrationday!” Meyer captioned a selfie of Stewart in a “VOTE” tee on September 22. Kristen wrote, via Meyer's account:\nMeyer also shared a black-and-white photo of herself and Stewart to encourage voting. “I think I might chew my fingers off from nerves today but here’s a sweet photo @lindseybyrnes took. I really hope you vote. There are lots of crucial issues on your ballot besides the presidency and your voice truly does make a difference. The opportunity to have a say in the laws that govern you is precious, please don’t waste it,” she captioned the snap.\nOn April 9, Stewart’s 31st birthday, she and Meyer were out grocery shopping (masked). \nShe also posted on Instagram to celebrate her girlfriend’s birthday. \n“Life sure is sweeter with this cute little family,” she wrote. “Happy birthday, kiddo. You knock my socks off.”\nLaineyGossip pointed out that Stewart and Meyer were photographed at LAX in July 2021 wearing rings on their left ring finger. The two never confirmed wedding rumors or that Stewart even proposed to Meyer at this point. Meyer and Stewart, throughout their relationship, have managed to keep most details private and out of the limelight.\nOn November 2, Stewart told Howard Stern that Meyer popped the question.\n“We’re marrying, we’re totally gonna do it,” Stewart said. “I wanted to be proposed to, so I think I very distinctly carved out what I wanted and she nailed it. We’re marrying, it’s happening.”\nDuring her appearance on Stephen Colbert's talk show, Stewart addressed wedding planning—and how they may just elope. “I want to have a big party or something,” she said. “I’m so unceremonial. I think we might just go do it this weekend or something, I don't know, and then, like, just hang out with everyone afterwards,” Stewart said.\nIt isn’t often Stewart and Meyer's private life with friends is documented on social media, but Ashley Benson gave the world a rare glimpse into their dynamic in January 2022. The former Pretty Little Liars actress shared a group shot of Stewart and Meyer alongside each other and friends at Disneyland. “Family trips to Disney @cjromero @spillzdylz @sweetsuzieq @michael,” Benson captioned the shot, tagging Meyer's Instagram.\nStewart is nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars this year, and ahead of the ceremony, Meyer joined Stewart on the events circuit. On March 8, Meyer attended the Oscars nominee luncheon with Stewart and The Hollywood Reporter’s Oscar nominees night. Meyer matched her outfits to Stewart’s for both events, wearing a black Alessandra Rich mini dress for the luncheon and a white tank in the evening.\nThe two then attended the Critics’ Choice Awards together, where Stewart was nominated for Best Actress for her portrayal of Princess Diana in Spencer. At the show, Stewart wore a nude, glittery Dolce & Gabbana gown with Messika jewelry and Jimmy Choo shoes and Meyer wore a complimentary white August Getty Atelier and Chanel ensemble.\nStewart spoke this month about how blessed she feels having her personal life and career thrive at the same time. “I’m living a simulation, it’s too good,” Stewart told E!. “You run through the list, and I go, like, is that possible? Right now, I’m definitely feeling it. It’s not lost on me any second of any day. I will tell you that.”\nTo top off an eventful awards season, Meyer and Stewart stepped out together at the 2022 Academy Awards, where Stewart is nominated for Best Actress for her role in Spencer. The duo, matching in black and white suits, posed together in the red carpet and engaged in some PDA in front of the cameras. They held hands as photos snapped and shared a quick kiss before Meyer let Stewart pose solo. \nKristen Stewart and at fiancée Dylan Meyers share a kiss on the red carpet at the #Oscars. https://t.co/abMq1BYSsP pic.twitter.com/5FObv4pm1D\nOn Saturday, December 3, the pair were spotted tooling around Los Angeles in their Dodge van like any suburban couple. They were headed to a friend's house and dressed comfortably for the afternoon. Stewart was behind the wheel and smoking a cigarette as she navigated the quiet streets. The Twilight actress was wearing black Adidas sweatpants with white stripes and a black sports bra under a hoodie. She paired the look with white Nike sneakers and sunglasses. After being a blonde for quite a while, Stewart has gone brunette with a short chop. \nMeyer was also dressed casually and in sunglasses. Sunday, December 4, was Meyer's 35th birthday, so there may have been fancier plans ahead for the couple. \nWhile the pair have kept their relationship mostly under the radar, Meyer posted a tribute to Stewart on her Instagram on February 14, 2023. Meyer wrote: “One time I turned a hundred dollars into fourteen hundred dollars at a casino in Pittsburgh. I was playing craps (my first time ever) and when it was my turn at the dice I didn’t roll a seven for forty five minutes straight. Strangers were getting rich off of my hot streak, tipping me chips and tequila shots. Cheering for me, clapping me on the back. Calling their gambling addicted friends/co-workers/ex-wives to regale them with my extraordinary feat. I was the hero of the people, an instant legend. Bennie and the Jets was playing. My hair looked great, too. And even this, the clear peak of my short time on earth, does not remotely come close to how it feels to spend a Monday night in sweatpants with you, valentine.”\nOn April 9, 2023, Meyer took to Instagram to share her love for Stewart again in honor of the actress' birthday. Meyer wrote, “Cheers to my favorite Shrimp on her birthday! Sweetheart, I love you more than all the shades of green, all the phases of the moon, all the cats in LA. Love you more than chunking express, or Denis Johnson’s already dead, or the stooges’ raw power. I love you more than a dominos pizza when you’re stoned, a Ricky’s fish taco when you’re hungover, and EVEN more than a plate of wings ~ hot and extra crispy ~ from rustic, aka the pinnacle of my capacity to love. Some might say that’s too much love but I say those people are squares. Go big or go home! Happy birthday dude I love you so much.”\nMeyer and Stewart continued to keep their relationship mostly private during summer 2023, although paparazzi captured the couple grabbing dinner with friends on August 4, 2023 in Los Angeles.\nMeyer herself last posted a shot of her with Stewart on Instagram in June:\nMeyer and Stewart kept a low profile through September. Paparazzi captured them getting lunch together Little Dom’s in Los Angeles on October 2 though. Both matched in blue looks, with Stewart wearing a light blue cardigan with a white top and light-wash jeans. Meyer was in khaki pants, an open navy blue button-up, and a white top.

{"title": "All About Malcolm McRae, Anya Taylor-Joy’s Husband", "date": "2023-10-05 21:49:00", "text": "Anya Taylor-Joy has kept her personal life as private as she can manage as her Hollywood profile grows. But ahead of The Queen’s Gambit actress’s Saturday Night Live hosting gig in May 2021, Taylor-Joy was photographed making out with musician Malcolm McRae in New York City. The photos sparked dating rumors—and come after Taylor-Joy spoke about having a partner in her ELLE May 2021 interview.\nTaylor-Joy didn’t initially explicitly confirm that she and McRae are dating, but they didn’t exactly hide their romantic connection in the city. According to Page Six, the two were seen holding hands and kissing multiple times while walking around the Big Apple.\nIn September 2021, the two were photographed kissing again, this time in Venice. And in March 2022, Taylor-Joy spoke about her romance with McRae in an interview and made her red carpet debut with him at the Vanity Fair Oscars after party. In July 2022, the two went further, secretly tying the knot, a source told Page Six. The two ultimately made their first award show debut as a couple at the Golden Globes in January 2023.\nIn September 2023, the Daily Mail reported they would be having their wedding in Italy. Photos came out on Monday, October 2 of the Venice festivities.\nHere, all about McRae’s career and what's known about his relationship with Taylor-Joy.\nPer McRae’s IMDB bio, McRae “was ‘discovered’ at the AMTC (talent competition) among 1,100 hopeful actors at age 12, where he won Over All Young Actor, 2006.” McRae starred in a short film, Brotherly, in 2008 and played Gene Grady in 2020’s How'dy!.\nMusic is McRae’s real focus though. His IMDB bio cites him as playing “guitar and piano” and singing “pop, folk, rockabilly, rock and musical theatre.” On his Instagram, McRae plugs his rock band More’s music, most recently posting footage of himself playing his song “Settled In” in April.\nMore is a two-member group that McRae and Kane Ritchotte (formerly of Portugal The Man) created and that is signed with Warner Records. The band is verified on Spotify and has been together for over three years now. They released the first half of their two-part EP, 1/2, last summer.\nIn a July 2020 interview with Rain magazine, McRae spoke about his history with Ritchotte and the creation process for 1/2. “The writing process was a span over three or so years,” he said. “Kane and I were doing solo projects individually and had a few songs we had written and recorded separately. We met up and decided it was fun to write together and bring our songs together. So we finished 10 songs over about three years.”\nAccording to More’s Spotify bio, McRae came to Los Angeles from the South a few years ago. As the band wrote, “Malcolm had only recently fallen in love with a young woman and followed his foolish heart, dropping everything to move to Los Angeles. Well, his heart was mistaken. The relationship was a disaster. But the music that followed wasn’t. Within a week of meeting, the two [McRae and Ritchotte] realized that the music they made together transcended what either was doing alone.”\nMcRae spoke to American Songwriter 10 months ago about how he worked as a paralegal in Pasadena, California, and wrote song lyrics for “Elaborate Attraction” while at his desk job.\nIn his Rain interview, McRae spoke more about the inspiration behind “Elaborate Attraction” and how his late father influenced its lyrics. “My dad was an investment banker,” McRae said. “He passed away when I was eighteen, but that song revolves around and is based on some of his life. He studied classics at an Ivy League school and so the reference to Joseph Campbell, that’s what we took the video from. We wanted it to be an antihero’s journey. All 17 points of Campbell’s hero journey… we wanted to make them super menial tasks with an incredibly small reward for each task. It symbolizes what the song is about which is nature versus nurture.” McRae’s brother Keene McRae directed the music video for the single, and its YouTube video has gotten more than 93,000 views.\nMcRae told Rain that music helped him and Ritchotte get through the coronavirus pandemic mental health-wise. “I’m grateful for the outlet and you don’t need many resources to write music, you know?” he said. “If we didn’t have that in this quarantine, I would be entirely morbidly depressed and unfulfilled. I mean, I don’t know how anybody’s survived. I don’t know how not everybody is writing an album right now.”\nTaylor-Joy and McRae’s exact timeline is not clear nor has either explicitly confirm they're dating. But the 26-year-old actress spoke to ELLE three days after the Golden Globes, indicating she had a significant other in March 2021 while explaining why she was doing her Zoom interview from her bathroom.\n“My partner’s just come back from work, and he’s moving around all of his equipment, so this was the safe spot,” she said. She didn’t offer any more details on who he is, how long they’ve been together, and didn’t confirm outright that they were living together.\nTaylor-Joy did open up to Vanity Fair earlier this year about a past relationship ending right before she began production on Emma in March 2019, meaning her relationship with McRae is likely more recent.\n“Prior to filming [Emma] I’d just had a devastating breakup, and it had challenged everything,” she said. “I was just incredibly insecure and very, very unsafe in my own skin.” Taylor-Joy had been working constantly during that time, immersing herself in the characters she played while not taking the time to learn about who she is.\nShe could go into an art gallery and recognize the pieces each character she played would like, “but I had no idea what I liked,” she said. “I had no clue of what I would choose for myself. I’m sitting here talking to you, and for the first time, I’m like, I know what I like. I know what I, as a person, enjoy!… The whole of 2019 was me becoming a woman, essentially.”\nOn July 23, The Sun reported that McRae “has practically moved into [Taylor-Joy’s] L.A. home.”\n“They are inseparable and spend all of their time together,” a source close to Taylor-Joy told the outlet. “Her schedule is really hectic because she is so in demand following The Queen’s Gambit, but he is always there for her.”\nThe source added that “Malcolm is practically living with her at her home in L.A. now, and they spend every night together.”\nTaylor-Joy and McRae proved their relationship was still going strong post-Labor Day when the two were photographed kissing in Venice by paparazzi. Taylor-Joy was at the festival to promote her upcoming film Last Night in Soho.\nMcRae and Taylor-Joy posed side-by-side at Vanity Fair’s Oscars after-party. Taylor-Joy was dressed in a black sheer Dior corset dress alongside her partner.\n\nAhead of their Oscars red carpet debut, Taylor-Joy reflected on dating McRae to British Vogue in her cover story with them. “I said to my partner [the musician and actor Malcolm McRae] the other day that he was my hobby,” she said. “I see reading as something that I have to do. He loved it because he’s the same. I’ve finally found someone who will happily sit in silence with me reading. We’re basically 80 years old and seven at the same time and it works really well.”\nShe reflected on being long distance with him, as she owns a house in east London and is regularly traveling for film projects. “Yes, it is [hard], but it’s also kind of great because when you’re together you’re really valuing the time that you have. Everyday mundane activities are so full of joy. I love going to the petrol station with him and filling up the car and going to get breakfast.”\nCasual dating just wasn’t her style either, she added: “I was not a good dater and I’m quite glad to not be. I hear stories from my friends and I’m like, ’God, I would suck at that.’” \nTaylor-Joy and McRae didn't shy away from showcasing their love for each other during the screening for her film The Northman on April 5 in London. Both dressed chicly, Taylor-Joy and McRae kissed in front of photographers in one of their most public displays of affection yet.\nIn a subtle sign of their ties to each other, both Taylor-Joy and McRae follow each other on Instagram. Until recently, neither Taylor-Joy nor McRae posted about each other though or liked the other’s Instagram posts, but Taylor-Joy recently tagged McRae in a photo implying he was at the scene. Then McRae went Instagram official!\nOn October 20, 2021, McRae shared two shots of he and Taylor-Joy standing in a window’s reflection, smiling and holding hands. He captioned it, “Oof supremely happy.”\nIn the photos, Taylor-Joy is wearing a red razor-back tank top with white piping, and a long checkered shirt over it, her blonder hair pushed back with a pair of sunglasses. McRae is in a white t-shirt and black jeans. \nTaylor-Joy was photographed arriving at the Sydney airport in Australia in late June via private jet. As she reached up to brush her hair from her face, a sparkling rock was spotted on her ring finger. Rumors quickly spread that she is engaged to McRae.\nA person at the scene said, “She bounded off the plane and then seemed to flash the ring at her driver before getting in the car. She was either showing off the ring or doing a dance move. Either way, she looked ecstatic.”\nHer plane outfit included matching purple slacks and shirt and she was carrying her new cat, Kitsune, in a backpack with a window for her pet to enjoy the scene.\nTaylor-Joy and McRae may secretly be husband and wife. A source told Page Six that the couple quietly got married in an intimate courthouse wedding. On July 18, Taylor-Joy was photographed walking with McRae, wearing her engagement ring on her left ring finger. Neither McRae, Taylor-Joy, or Taylor-Joy's rep have yet to commented on the wedding reports as of July 19.\nOn Thursday, September 1, Anya Taylor-Joy and Malcolm McCrae enjoyed a little PDA as they walked through the streets of Los Angeles during a heat wave. The couple held hands as they walked, and were photographed embracing and sharing a kiss here and there on their date night in West Hollywood.\nTaylor-Joy was wearing a pale pink sundress with a square neckline with flower details down the front for each button. She carried a green sweater over her left hand, which obscured any potential sighting of a wedding or engagement ring. McRae was wearing a vintage green Nascar shirt over khaki pants.  \nTaylor-Joy and McRae were seen in Sydney's center for a Saturday night out, leaving popular party spot Frankie's in two stylish ensembles. The actress was wearing a bright purple mini dressed with a leather jacket and lace-up boots. She left her long blonde hair loose down her back, and wore dark red lipstick. By her side, McRae was rocking a grown out shag and a green turtleneck under a blazer with jeans. \nThe actress has been filming in Australia since may for the film Furiosa, of which she is the lead. After leaving the night club, they were escorted into a car and headed off.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, October 18, the couple enjoyed a lunch in Sydney at Mark And Vinny's spaghetti. As they waited for their food to arrive, they couldn't keep their hands off each other, leaning in to steal kisses and hug. At one point, McRae even gave Taylor-Joy's hand a chivalrous kiss in a romantic gesture.\nThe actress was wearing a vivid with matching lipstick and a pair of white mules with black designs. She covered it in a navy bomber jacket and pair of cat eye sunglasses. McRae was dressed in black jeans, a white t-shirt, and a grey button down over it. \nOn Sunday, December 25, Anya Taylor-Joy shared a glimpse of her holiday plans on Instagram, posting pictures of herself in bed with MacRae. \nMacRae was wearing a dark sleeping mask up on his forehead, and Taylor-Joy seemed to be in a fluffy white hat with ear flaps. On closer inspection, it is actually a white cat with gray ears. They both cuddled under the white sheets of their bed, looking sleepy and happy. \n“Merry Christmas to all you filthy animals, from our home to yours,” she wrote in the caption. \nThe couple made their award show debut on January 10, posing together at the Golden Globes, where Taylor Joy was a nominee. They showed PDA in front of the photographers.\nTaylor-Joy was photographed on Sunday, January 15, with McRae backstage at the 2023 Critics Choice Awards in Los Angeles, held at the Fairmont Century Plaza Hotel. The actress was presenting an award at the ceremony alongside Top Gun: Maverick actor Miles Teller. The couple were photographed sharing an intimate moment before the festivities where McRae appears to be adjusting her necklace.\nFor the event, Taylor-Joy wore a sheer, nude netted dress over a matching body-suit of opaque fabric and had her long hair piled into a tall knotted updo. She accessorized with diamond jewelry around her neck and one wrist and a pair of sandal heels with a rhinestone strap across her toes. McRae was wearing a traditional suit with an untraditional ribbon cravat under a white button-down shirt.\nTaylor-Joy gave her partner a romantic shoutout on her Instagram on Valentine's Day 2023, sharing footage of them kissing, and writing, “Mi amor, I'm all yours.”\nTen days after, the couple was photographed holding hands while out at London's Chiltern Firehouse on February 24, 2023. Taylor-Joy had been in town for the BAFTA Awards that previous weekend.\nMcRae and Taylor-Joy put their couple style on display and signaled things were on and strong between them when they attended the Tiffany & Co The Landmark store reopening in New York City on April 27, 2023. Taylor-Joy wore a red lace dress while McRae was dressed in a black suit with a black choker.\nOn Thursday, Taylor-Joy and McRae were seen walking outside a friend's house in Los Angeles. It appeared that the musician was comforting the Queen's Gambit star, wrapping her arms around her and kissing her forehead. The pair arrived at the house with guitars and were accompanied by McRae's bandmate Kane Ritchotte.\nTaylor-Joy was wearing a sleeveless white top and an asymmetrical mini skirt and black leather Maison Margiela loafers. \nTaylor-Joy and McRae never specified if they were actually married. Multiple sources close to the couple told the Daily Mail on September 29 that they would be wedding that weekend in Italy in front of 150 guests.\nA source said, “Anya and Malcolm are incredibly private and wanted to ensure their wedding was kept away from prying eyes. They both love Italy and always dreamed of tying the knot in a beautiful setting surrounded by their nearest and dearest. There will be no expense spared and their guests are bound to have an incredible time.”\nTaylor-Joy appeared in a beige bespoke Dior gown embellished with birds and flowers in photos of her posing on a window balcony. She wore her platinum hair half up, half down with a white veil.

{"title": "All About Ethan Slater, Ariana Grande’s New Boyfriend and <i>Wicked</i> Co-Star", "date": "2023-10-05 21:44:00", "text": "Just days after Ariana Grande's separation from her husband of two years, Dalton Gomez, was widely reported, news broke that Grande found love again...on the set of Wicked.\nGrande and her co-star Ethan Slater, who is also separated from his wife, started dating recently, as People, Entertainment Tonight, and TMZ reported on July 20, 2023. Slater and Grande's commonalities go beyond their work in Wicked, though: Both are Broadway alumni (Grande for her work in 13: The Musical, Slater for his in the Spongebob musical).\nHere's what to know about Slater and his history with Grande.\nSlater is a Gemini and celebrated his 31st birthday on June 2; he grew up in Washington, D.C. and attended Vassar College. His most high-profile role so far was starring as Spongebob in Broadway's SpongeBob SquarePants: The Musical. It was a project he was involved in for years, starting when he was just 19.\n“Working on SpongeBob changed the way that I approach everything because I started working on it when I was 19, and it was seven years of development—from starting development until closing on Broadway,” he told Pop-Culturalist.com in August 2021. So it was like my full education, which is awesome. We approached it from this perspective, which came from [director] Tina [Landau], that this isn’t a show that is talking down to kids. This is a show that is funny; it’s funny, it’s visually stimulating, it’s physical humor. Kids like it because it taps into this optimism and heart; and adults like it because it taps into things they remember from their childhood. But it’s not a show that is solely designed for kids. It was meant to make us laugh while we were making it.”\nBoq notably has a big crush on Grande's character Glinda in Wicked. Slater and Grande have been shooting the film adaptation in the U.K. since December. Slater's casting in Wicked was announced in December 2022.\n.@ethansaslater has joined the @wickedmovie as Boq! https://t.co/hkOCQBVZCb\nBoth Slater and Grande are newly single after being married. People reported that Slater and his wife Lilly Jay were separated after news of his dating Grande broke on July 20. Jay and Slater started dating in 2012 and got married in November 2018. They welcomed their first child, a son, in August 2022.\nSlater celebrated Jay this Mother's Day on his Instagram account. He wrote, “Happy first Mother’s Day to the most loving caring and wonderful mom/person in the world. - from me and this little guy.” Grande had liked the post.\nHe also posted a tribute to her in November 2022, writing, “My best friend. 4 years married, 10 years together. And this is easily the best (and most *bizarre*) year yet.” Grande liked that post too.\nOn Saturday, July 22, a source who knows Lilly told ET that the new mother is “devastated” and that “this is not the future she had in mind.”\nThey added, “She's doing her best to get back on her feet. She's incredibly smart and driven...she is truly the best mother.”\nSlater had a public Instagram account when reports initially broke of his and Grande's dating. But shortly after the news stories spread, Slater went private on his Instagram. He had already limited comments on some posts beforehand.\nAfter filing for divorce from his wife Lilly Jay in late July and spending a month laying low, Slater returned to Instagram at the beginning of September to promote his role in Spamalot on Broadway.\nGrande liked the image in a show of support that got media attention.\n\nA source told People, “Ariana and Dalton separated in January. She and Ethan recently began dating, and he is separated from his wife.”\nUs Weekly received similar intel from its source: “Ariana and Ethan are dating; however things are fairly new. Ariana and Dalton split in January, and Ethan is separated from his wife. Ariana and Ethan have only recently begun seeing each other but they have a lot of fun together and are enjoying each other’s company.”\nEntertainment Tonight's source also stressed that this is very recent: “Ariana and Ethan recently started dating. They have a lot in common and have a lot of fun,” the source said. “They didn't start dating until both were broken up with their significant others. Ariana and Dalton remain friends.”\nTMZ, meanwhile, reported that Slater and Grande had been dating “several months ago during production” of Wicked, per its multiple sources. The insiders stressed that Slater and Grande did not start dating until after they were separated from their spouses. They were photographed sitting next to each other while celebrating Wicked co-star Michelle Yeoh's Oscar win in March.\nOn July 28, a source emphasized to ET that Slater and Grande started as friends, saying, “Ariana and Dalton both realized they were very different people and quietly separated earlier this year. Ariana and Ethan connected as friends first because they have a lot in common and many similar interests.” \n“While this entire situation has been blown out of proportion, it’s much different than what has been portrayed in public,” a friend close to the couple told People. “They are just trying to navigate their new relationship in private.”\nAnother source added, “They are doing their best to balance the fact that they are in the public eye with the desire to be respectful to all parties involved.”\nA source alleged to the Daily Mail in September 2023 that things had escalated between Grande and Slater, and they were living together in New York City as Slater prepares for his Spamalot role on Broadway. Neither Grande nor Slater confirmed the rumor.\nOn October 4, a source told Us Weekly the same. They said, “Ethan informed his friends and soon-to-be ex-wife [Lilly Jay] that he’s living with Ariana full-time in New York. They’re really happy and really good for each other. All of her friends love him.”\nIn an August 2021 interview with Pop-Culturalist.com, Slater discussed how he co-wrote the musical Edge of the World based on that loss. “One of the big things is the mining [of] my personal experience for writing,” he said. “When I was 7 years old, my mom died, and so that’s been a really big, formative thing in my life. She had left this huge imprint on me, even though I had so few memories. And that’s what happens to this character, Ben. He grows up not knowing his mom, being raised by a single dad, and yet the impact she has on his life and his life trajectory is immeasurable. So those are the two inspirational elements that came together.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "All About Chris Evans’ Wife Alba Baptista", "date": "2023-10-05 21:38:00", "text": "On November 10, People's newest Sexiest Man Alive Chris Evans revealed that he has been dating 26-year-old actress Alba Baptista for at least a year and “it's serious,” according to a source, who added,“They are in love, and Chris has never been happier. His family and friends all adore her.”\nIn January 2023, a source reiterated that to Us Weekly, describing them as having “gotten serious.” On Valentine's Day 2023, Evans himself shared a very public look inside their private relationship. He posted a video of photos from time together to honor his girlfriend.\nHappy Valentine’s Day! ❤️Chris Evans via Instagram Stories ✨ pic.twitter.com/kixfEDiZWv\nAnd in September 2023, the couple quietly got married, People reported.\nHere, everything to know about Baptista and their relationship timeline so far.\nThe actress is best known for her role on Netflix's Warrior Nun, her English-language debut. \nBaptista is from Portugal and was born in Lisbon. She has starred in several popular Portuguese films and TV shows, including A Impostora, Filha da Lei, A Criação, and Jogo Duplo. After Warrior Nun, she starred in the 2022 dramatic comedy, Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris.\nOutside of acting, she has a passion for charity work and in 2018, worked at an orphanage in Cambodia focusing on education. She also speaks five languages, including Spanish, French, German, English, and her native Portuguese.\nThe almost a year estimate is partially based on some fan detective work. The couple follows each other on Instagram, though they haven't yet gone “Instagram official” by sharing photos of each other. Cosmopolitan reported that Baptista's mom used the same pumpkins seen on Evans' Instagram as her profile photo for the social media platform, tipping off the sleuths. He has also been liking all of Baptista's photos since October 13, as well as a few back-dated ones from July of this year and August of 2021. \nIn his interview for the Sexiest Man issue, Evans didn't get too specific about who he wanted to settle down with, but he did talk about wanting to take things further in his romantic relationships than he has so far.\n“That's absolutely something I want: wife, kids, building a family,” Evans said. “When you read about most of the best artists, whether it's actors, painters, writers, most of them [admit] it wasn't the work they made [that they are most proud of], it was about the relationships; the families they created, the love they found, the love they shared.”\nHe continued, “So it's also something through my long 41 years that also rings true. Those things are the most important. I love the idea of tradition and ceremony. I had a lot of that in my life, so the idea of creating that—I can't think of anything better.”\nLater in January 2023, a source told Us Weekly that he and Baptista were very serious as a couple. “Chris and Alba have gotten serious,” the source said. “This is the most committed anyone can remember him being in a very long time, if not ever.” \n“They spend most of their time at his place in Massachusetts and love the quiet life there, surrounded by nature and away from the spotlight,” the source added. “Chris was very open that he wanted to take his time before settling down.”\nPeople reported that Evans and Baptista got married at a private estate in Cape Cod over the weekend of September 9 and 10, 2023. Evans’ Marvel co-stars were seen at the ceremony, including  Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, in addition to actors John Krasinski and Emily Blunt. The couple’s reps did not immediately confirm the wedding news.\nAllegedly yes, per Page Six. The outlet reported on September 12 that the couple would be having a ceremony in Portugal. “There is going to be a second gathering in Portugal for members of Alba’s family who couldn’t be in Massachusetts,” a source said. “Sometime this week, I believe. Then they’ll depart from Portugal for their honeymoon.”\nA source spoke to People on September 11 about how Evans knew quickly after meeting Baptista in Europe that she was the woman with whom he wanted to build a life.\nEvans “has been ready to settle down for a while. He can’t wait to have a family. He was just waiting for the right girl,” the source said. Baptista “is beautiful, smart and just a good person. She is involved in charity work and truly cares about doing good. She is a very positive and happy person. It’s rubbed off on him. It's the best news that they are married.”\n“They got serious very quickly,” the source said of their relationship.“He kept saying he knew she was the one.”\n“[He] has been the happiest since they met,” the source added. “[She is] everything to him.”\nYes. A source told Entertainment Tonight on September 13, 2023, “Chris has been in love with Alba for a while. They share a special connection and are so happy to be husband and wife. Chris is in a really great place in his life. He feels happy with his career and was ready to settle down. He’s thrilled about this new chapter and is so excited to have a family with Alba one day.”\nHis biggest was on Valentine's Day 2023. He shared multiple Instagram Stories featuring videos and photos of them together.\nHappy Valentine’s Day! ❤️Chris Evans via Instagram Stories ✨ pic.twitter.com/kixfEDiZWv\nHappy Valentine’s Day! ❤️Chris Evans via Instagram Stories ✨ pic.twitter.com/P0VxoMphAs\nEvans has kept their relationship mostly private. He did discuss Baptista briefly in his September 2023 GQ interview, when explaining why he has been acting less.\nIn 2022, he worked nonstop on three different movies, something he regrets. That’s when he brought Baptista up: “My girlfriend that I’ve had for a while, when we began dating, I was like: ‘Yeah, I do one movie a year. I try to never work now.’ And then, after like a few months of dating, boom, guess what? We’re living in Atlanta for a year. Get ready. And even when that year was happening, I was like, man, never again.” \nHe also offered a little about her personality when discussing the reporter’s energy: “My girlfriend’s really big into people’s energies and first impressions,” he said. “I’m not so much, because I feel that I don’t always give off the same thing out of the gate. So I try to really reserve judgment. But you had a very, very nice energy when you first came in.”\nApparently! A source told Page Six that Meghan and Harry, who were visiting Portugal in late September 2023, ran into Baptista and Evans at a bar or restaurant there. It was not planned, the insider said, describing the run-in as “completely coincidental.” The couples didn’t know each other prior but ended up hanging out.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "The Complete Timeline of Prince William and Kate Middleton’s Relationship", "date": "2023-10-05 21:31:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe last few years have seen a lot of enormous changes in the British Royal Family, an entity known more for tradition than rapid growth. After the loss of Queen Elizabeth II, who ruled over the U.K. most of the 21st century, some people may be looking for some stability. If there's any couple in the family who offers that, it's Prince William and Kate Middleton.\nWilliam and Kate have had what appears on the outside to be a bit of a fairytale romance, from the storybook wedding to the picturesque family of five they have now. Sure, the full details of that fairytale aren't known, and some of what's been shown may be in part to help the royal family's image. But optics aside, there’s something about them that has captivated people since the beginning of their relationship. Here’s a look back at their journey, from college sweethearts to royal power couple.\nPrince William and Kate Middleton meet while both studying at St. Andrews University in Scotland. Rumor has it that William was won over after seeing Kate modeling at a student fashion show for charity (a show for which he reportedly paid £200 for a front row seat).\nOther rumors suggest that her reason for being at St. Andrews was entirely related to meeting her future husband.\nThe Crown historian Robert Lacey wrote in his 2020 book Battle of Brothers: William and Harry—The Inside Story of a Family in Tumult, that Kate was trying to manifest her future relationship with William when she was only 19.\n“Kate was very strategic,” Lacey said. “She gave up her place at one of Britain’s premier universities, Edinburgh, and opted for another one [St. Andrews] that probably didn’t have the same academic standard. She had already been to Edinburgh to get her flat accommodations sorted out but switched universities and switched her courses to history of art because that was William’s. She delayed her own education by a year and even takes the chance she won’t get into St. Andrews.”\nShe was not the only person making these choices. Applications to the school reportedly went up by 44% after it was announced that was William's choice of university. They might not all have been marriage hopefuls, but some probably were like Kate.\nHello! magazine reported that Prince William was moving from his dorm into a flat with three college friends, one of them “a pretty 20-year-old brunette” who, as you might guess, turned out to be Kate Middleton.\nHe allegedly started out as just her friend, before seeing her walk in a fashion show in this see-through dress on March 26, 2002.\n“She’s there and about to walk down the runway on the fashion show, and she strips off an extra layer of clothing,” Lacey explained. “Here is a very strategic lady who knows what she wants and has got it.”\nThey began dating soon after.\nWilliam and Kate are photographed together for the first time during a ski trip in Klosters, causing then-Prince Charles to threaten to sever ties with The Sun, the outlet that published the photos. Charles was said to have been “very disappointed” by the breach in an agreement between the press and Buckingham Palace that ensures royal children can continue their education without having their privacy intruded upon.\nBoth William and Kate graduate from St. Andrews. The Middletons later share a photo of them together on the day.\nThe couple attend Camilla's daughter Laura Parker-Bowles’ wedding, marking one of their first big public appearances together, and sparking speculation that they were serious enough to one day walk down the aisle together themselves.\nIn 2007, William and Kate took a time-out and broke up for a couple months. Kate took a vacation to Ireland with her friends afterwards, while William awkwardly fielded questions about “how things are going” with Kate.\nKate later said in 2010 during an interview after their engagement that in hindsight, she thinks it was healthy for them to have time apart.\n“I think I at the time wasn't very happy about it, but actually it made me a stronger person...You find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn't realized,” she said. “Or I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you're younger. I really valued that time for me as well although I didn't think it at the time, looking back on it.\"\nBy July of that same year, rumors began to swirl about a possible reconciliation as Kate is seen attending a Princess Diana tribute concert—though she sat two rows behind William with her sister Pippa.\nThe two are seen together again, back where it all began: the ski slopes. Photos show Kate and William together in Klosters as sources told newspapers that they were very much back together.\nWilliam graduates from his RAF training, with Kate at his side.\nWilliam proposes to Kate while on a trip to Kenya, with Princess Diana’s sapphire engagement ring. “We had a little private time away together with some friends, and I just decided it was the right time really,” William later said in their engagement interview. “We'd been talking about marriage or a while, so it wasn't a massively big surprise, but I took her up somewhere nice in Kenya.”\nPrince William and Kate Middleton get married in a fairytale ceremony at Westminster Abbey witnessed by nearly 72 million people worldwide. The bride did her own makeup, the groom wore sweat pads so that he wouldn’t sweat out of his uniform, and Ellie Goulding performed at the reception.\nIn marrying William, Kate gained the title Duchess of Cambridge, the Countess of Strathearn, and Lady Carrickfergus.\nAfter the wedding, the married couple settle in Wales and adopt a dog, an English Cocker Spaniel named Lupo.\nSt. James’ Palace announces that Kate is pregnant with the couple’s first child. During her pregnancy, she’s hospitalized for hyperemesis gravidarum, or severe morning sickness.\nKate gives birth to Prince George, and steps out for post-baby photos.\nKensington Palace announces that Kate is pregnant with their second child. Kate had not reached the 12-week stage, but the Palace made the announcement because they felt they couldn’t keep the pregnancy under wraps from the press for much longer. Once again, Kate suffers from extreme morning sickness.\nKate gives birth to Princess Charlotte, who becomes fourth in line for the throne after Prince Charles, her father Prince William, and her older brother Prince George. She’s also the first to take up the title of Princess in 25 years, and is the highest ranking female in line for the throne.\nThe coupled made their red carpet debut at the British Academy Film Awards, where Prince William presented a BAFTA Fellowship award to Mel Brooks. Kate wore an off-the-shoulder tiered Alexander McQueen gown in a floral print.\nKensington Palace announces that Kate is pregnant with the couple’s third child. As with her previous two pregnancies, she suffers from hyperemesis gravidarum.\nKate gives birth to Prince Louis, who is now fifth in line for the throne. Though tradition dictated that Louis, as a male, would overtake Princess Charlotte for a place on the throne, the policy was amended prior to George's birth with the Succession to the Crown Act 2013. That made Charlotte the first female royal to trump a younger male sibling.\nKate and Prince were front and center at the marriage of his little brother, Prince Harry, to Meghan Markle.\nThe couple helped Harry and Meghan celebrate on their wedding day at their nuptials at St. George's Chapel in Windsor, England. “William was in a jokey, wonderful mood at the party,” a wedding guest told People at the time, adding that Kate was also in “great form.”\nThey added, “She and William were saying how thrilled they were to have their children there taking part.”\nAt Princess Eugenie's wedding, Kate and William are seen showing each other a little affection. Eugenie was marrying her husband Jack Brooksbank when the royal couple were seen holding hands in the pew.\n#RoyalWedding Aaahhh! My heart! 💕💞💑😍😍😍😍 #DukeandDuchessofCambridge pic.twitter.com/Xup5ouu67a\nKate and William tend to be hands off when out in public.\nAfter lockdown began in the U.K., the couple spoke with the BBC in a rare joint interview, discussing what it's like to parent through a pandemic.\n“It's been ups and downs, like a lot of families self-isolating,” Kate said. “The children have got such stamina, I don't know how. Honestly, you get to the end of the day and you write down the list of all the things that you've done in that day. So, you pitch a tent, take the tent down again, cook, bake. You get to the end of the day—they have had a lovely time—but it is amazing how much you can cram into one day, that's for sure.”\nNine years after welcoming their cocker spaniel, Ludo, into their lives, the couple announced they had bid him farewell. They shared a handsome portrait of the dog on Instagram with a heartfelt goodbye.\n“Very sadly last weekend our dear dog, Lupo, passed away,” the post read. “He has been at the heart of our family for the past nine years and we will miss him so much. - W & C.”\nApril of 2021 was the 10-year anniversary of the couple's marriage, otherwise known as the tin anniversary. To celebrate, they shared some new portraits by Chris Floyd at Kensington Palace.\nThey also posted a video of themselves with their children walking through the sand dunes in Norfolk, England, thanking everyone for the well wishes on the occasion of their anniversary.\nQueen Elizabeth appoints Kate Middleton as a sponsor of the naval battleship HMS Glasglow. The office requires Kate to maintain a “strong and enduring personal connection to the vessel and her crew, often supporting milestones, events and deployments.”\n“Her Majesty the Queen has approved the appointment of my wife Catherine as Sponsor of the superb ship we see taking shape outside—HMS Glasgow,” Prince William said in the announcement. “I know that Catherine will be delighted to join you here in Glasgow for the naming ceremony in due course.” \nThe couple got all dressed up for the No Time to Die premiere in London, posing with Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. The royal family members were guests of honor at the event. \nKate wore a Jenny Packham capelet gown covered in gold sequins. \nKate and William enjoyed their first Earthshot Awards, at Alexandra Palace in London. The environmental initiative was launched by William, and he was tasked with giving a speech at the ceremony. A photo shows them sharing a sweet moment together behind-the-scenes.\nAlso at the event was Emma Thompson, Emma Watson, David Oyelowo, and Mo Salah. Ed Sheeran, Shawn Mendes, KSI, and Coldplay performed.\nEnjoying another fun premiere, the coupled hit the red carpet for Top Gun in the U.K. \nKate wore a black Roland Mouret gown, with an off-the-shoulders, white wraparound detail. \nThe couple's first official portrait was unveiled at the University of Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum. Originally commissioned in 2021 by the Cambridgeshire Royal Portrait Fund, it was painted by Jamie Coreth. Coreth is an award-winning portrait artist.\nThe Duke and Duchess take their three children to visit the Lambrook school, where they will be newly attending. The preview day offered the family a chance to get to know the facilities and teachers.\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis were all wearing their school uniforms. \nQueen Elizabeth II dies on September 8, sending the family into mourning. There is also a great deal of change in terms of titles and responsibilities. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge became the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and of Rothesay, and on September 9, his father conferred the title of Prince and Princess of Wales. \nIn his address to the nation following the immediate news of his mother's death, King Charles III said, “With Catherine beside him, our new Prince and Princess of Wales will, I know, continue to inspire and lead our national conversations, helping to bring the marginal to the centre ground where vital help can be given.”\nThe Princess of Wales was a title once held by William's mother, Princess Diana. \nAlong with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, William and Kate visit Windsor Castle to view flowers and gifts left by citizens to honor the late Queen.\nThe couple attends Queen Elizabeth's funeral at Westminster Hall after escorting her coffin from Buckingham Palace.\nThey post their farewells to her on Twitter with a photo of the procession.\nGoodbye to a Queen, a mother, a grandmother and a great grandmother. pic.twitter.com/hKEI9RcAOp\nKate and William attended the Festival of Remembrance, a ceremony dedicated to the day the Allies and Germany signed the armistice that ended World War 1 in 1918 for Europe.\nAt the commemorative concert at the Royal Albert Hall later that evening, Kate paid tribute to the late Queen by wearing some of her famous jewelry: her Japanese pearl choker necklace along with her Bahrain diamond and pearl drop earrings.\nThe Princess of Wales shared her Together at Christmas carol service on ITV after filming it at Westminster Abbey, for the second year in a row. The event was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth's memory and attended by William, George, and Charlotte.\nHarry and Meghan's docuseries is released on Netflix, and it was reported that Kate and William refused to watch it.\nVanity Fair wrote, “While aides will be watching the series closely, along with the royals’ lawyers, the palace are reluctant to comment on the show because they don’t want to feed what has become a media frenzy.”\nAnother source told Page Six that William and Kate haven't watched the series.\n“William and Kate’s aides have briefed them on the show, but don’t expect the couple to sit down in their cottage with a bowl of popcorn to tune in themselves,” the insider said.\nLater in the month, they must have acquired more details, because a source told Us Weekly on December 22 that Kate felt “betrayed” by the situation.\n“Kate feels hurt and betrayed that Harry would do this to her, too, especially as the pair used to be so close,” they said.\nAs for William he “isn’t planning to give his side of the story or openly retaliate.”\nAfter the docuseries, Kate and William were hit with another wave of bad publicity when Harry's memoir Spare was officially released, making things even icier between the two couples. A source who knows both couples told Entertainment Tonight in a report published January 12 that “[their] relationship has completely broken down.”\nA separate source said Kate felt “hurt and disappointed” over what Harry shared about her in Spare because she believed “private matters had been made public.”  \nKate and William marked British Mother's Day on their Instagram, sharing new photos of Kate with the couple's three children. “Happy Mother’s Day from our family to yours ❤️,” the couple wrote.\nThe royal couple celebrated their 12 year anniversary with an adorable photo on Instagram in which they're sitting on matching bikes and the prince has his arm around the shoulder of his princess. They're both dressed casually in jeans, and Kate is wearing a lacy white button down while William is in navy blue.\n“12 years ❤️,” they captioned the photo.\nA source spoke to Us Weekly about how Kate and William’s relationship is going, saying “more than anything, they’re proud of their marriage and beautiful family.”\n“William and Kate are more in sync than ever,” a palace insider told the outlet. “They cherish what they have with each other. For them, family comes first, and it always will.”\nThe source said the challenges the couple has faced in the last year, including the death of Queen Elizabeth II, have strengthened their relationship. “They’re in awe of each other,” the source said. “William tells anyone who will listen that he couldn’t do it without Kate, and she echoes that right back.”\nThey’ve also become slightly more comfortable showing PDA, although they are still very reserved in public: “William used to be quite awkward about showing too much affection, but Kate’s helped him relax.”\nA source told Us Weekly that Kate and William’s marriage isn’t complete smooth sailing. “Kate and William have been having ups and downs in their marriage like everyone else,” the source said. “But they’re focused on their royal duties and doing that as a unit.”\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com.

{"title": "Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner’s Complete Relationship and Divorce Timeline", "date": "2023-10-05 21:14:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nIt seems like from almost the moment Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas met, they knew they found their person. They were engaged a year after they started dating, and married a few years after that. They've had two children together since, and seem to be constantly supporting one another through all of their projects and big life moments.\nHere's the complete relationship timeline of the Game of Thrones star and DNCE musician so far.\nFans noted Turner in the background of a group shot posted to Instagram, wearing bunny ears and standing just below Jonas, who seems to be a dog of some kind.\nJonas' band DNCE performs at the MTV EMAs, and he is seen sitting next to Turner at a pre-MTV Europe Music Awards Kings of Leon concert at the Oude Luxor Theater with his arm around her. They allegedly were kissing.\nOh and they were kissing too @joejonas @SophieT #mtv #sorrynotsorry #rotterdam #MTVEMAs #netherlands @KingsOfLeon pic.twitter.com/aGaJDAWga5\nThey're also spotted at a friend's wedding in Malibu along with his brother Nick Jonas.\nBy December, their relationship seems to be official, but they're still keeping things pretty private. A source tells People, “They’re dating exclusively. He was playing the field, but he really likes her and is willing to settle down for her.”\nTo start the new year, Turner makes things Instagram official! Turner posted a photo of Jonas riding on the back of a boat while smoking a cigar, captioning it, “Miami daze.”\nA week later, Us Weekly reports that the pair were seen kissing at a Golden Globes after-party.\nTurner posts a photo of herself looking fantastic in Louis Vuitton at the BAFTAs, as Jonas is in L.A. for the Grammys. He leaves her a fire emoji just to let her know how he feels about her look.\nThey were allegedly seen kissing at the Met Gala afterparty but did not walk the red carpet together.\nStarting in July of that year, the couple slowly started talking more about their relationship.\n“I'm in a relationship, but it's a very private relationship,” Turner told the U.K.'s Sunday Times on July 4. She didn't say much else, except for sharing that she recently had become much more extroverted under the influence of... someone.\n“I very much isolated myself for a while and forgot what was fun. Going out with friends, going out to eat, not really having a care,” she explained. “And people I've met recently in my life have drawn me out of that. It really helps you own those insecurities. The things I tortured myself about before, I can forget about.”\nOn July 21, at Comic Con, Turner calls Jonas “a good accessory” before getting flustered. \n“I don't know, I don't know,” she tells Entertainment Weekly of Jonas rooting for her Thrones character Sansa Stark. “We don't talk about it...You made me blush! Oh god, yeah! I'm sweaty, I can't tell.”\nThe next day, she arrives at LAX wearing a denim jacket embroidered with “Kissing Strangers,” the name of a DNCE single.\nThen, on July 25, Turner shared in an interview with Marie Claire UK that she was “very happy” with Jonas, but it's not easy being in public.\n“You do feel like you're living in a fishbowl! It's frustrating [that] it's the most mundane things that make the news—how boring! There are really no other headlines?” Turner said.\nThey adopt a puppy together, a Siberian Husky puppy named Porky Basquiat who currently has almost 100k followers on its own Instagram account. \nAfter just about a year together, they announce their engagement with matching Instagram posts featuring the pear-cut diamond on Turner's finger.\n“She said yes,” Jonas captioned his pic. \nTurner wrote, “I said yes.”\nIn a comment, Nick Jonas wrote, “Ahh! Congratulations to my brother… and sister in law to be on your engagement. I love you both so much.”\nTurner opens up about being engaged to People, saying it was fulfilling in a whole new way.\n“It's lovely to be engaged,” she said. “Not like I achieved anything, but I found my person, like I'd find a house that I love and want to stay in forever. There's a sense of peace that comes with finding your person. But there's a drive that comes with your career.”\nOn October 3, the couple make their red carpet debut at the Louis Vuitton show during Paris Fashion Week, though it was more of a street corner. \nTurner shared a pic from inside the event, where Jonas is kissing her on the cheek.\n“With my love in Paris,” she captioned the image.\nThe pair spent the holidays in London with Jonas' family, including the newly-married Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra. \n“Family,” Turner captioned the group pic of everyone enjoying dinner.\nTurner says in a cover story with Glamour UK that Jonas helped her find herself again after she had an “identity crisis” from growing up too fast amid her Games of Throne stardom.\n“A lot of [my happiness now] is to do with being with a person I've fallen in love with, who loves me more than he loves himself, and who wants to see me find my own happiness,” she said. “That was probably the biggest thing that pushed me to find who I am—and find my happiness in things other than acting.”\nThat same month, Turner starred in the Jonas Brothers' music video for “Sucker” along with Kevin Jonas' wife Danielle and Nick Jonas' wife Priyanka. \nLater, she told USA Today that making the video was “a lot more chaotic” than usual.\n“[With Game of Thrones] you have to be done with this scene by a certain time, and you have to say these words and stand at exactly these spots, because otherwise it wouldn't work. Whereas with a music video, it's just much more kind of free and loose and improvisational,” she explained.\nIn an interview with the Sunday Times, Turner admitted they secretly broke up for about 24 hours before getting back together.\n“It was the worst day of our lives. For a second we both had cold feet, then 24 hours later we were both, like, ‘Never mind,’” Turner said.\nThat month, they committed hard and had a last-minute wedding in Las Vegas at the famous A Little White Wedding Chapel just a few hours after the Billboard Music Awards. Diplo live-streamed the event on his Instagram, Dan + Shay played music, and they said their vows with Ring Pop wedding rings. While his brothers were there, they forgot to invite the parents.\n“We had to get legally married in the states, so we thought it'd be really fun to get all of our friends, invite them out, and do an impromptu wedding,” Jonas later told GQ. “And we actually had some people that I didn't really even know that well there.” \nThat month, they also walked the Met Gala red carpet together again.\nOn June 29, they get married again in France for a more official ceremony with everyone gathered together.\nThe event was held at Le Château de Tourreau in Sarrians, France, and Turner's Game of Thrones costar Maisie Williams was her maid of honor. Nick and Kevin stood up with their brother. \nThey don't share many pics but occasionally dole out one or two for the fans. \nTurner is spotted out with Jonas in Los Angeles, and it sure looks like she has a baby bump. A source tells People, “They are definitely preparing for the baby... She and Joe are both very happy.”\nOn July 22, 2020, Turner gives birth to the couple's first child, a baby girl named Willa. Their reps tell People, “Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas are delighted to announce the birth of their baby.” \nOnce Willa is born, Turner seems to be comfortable finally sharing pregnancy pics. She posts one in her pool with their dog, another with Jonas placing his hands on her stomach, and one of her sitting on a couch outside in her bikini.\nFor the couple's second wedding anniversary, Turner decides to let loose with the French wedding pics, revealing that it included a DJ set from Diplo, music from the Jonas Brothers, and a beautiful pool\nJonas makes an appearance on CBS This Morning and talks about how “amazing” things have been during quarantine.\n“It's been forced time at home,” he explained. “I'm always moving and traveling and touring. And to be in one place for a solid amount of time and just have my feet on the ground and be with my immediate family, is time I don't think I'll get back. I'm so thankful and grateful.”\nThe pair sell their Los Angeles home and move to Miami. Turner later tells ELLE UK that she hopes they end up in England.\n“We're very lucky to live in Miami. We have good weather and live by the water,” she shared. “I really love living in America but, for my mental health, I have to be around my friends and my family. And also for my daughter—I would love her to get the education and school life that I was so lucky to have. England would ideally be the final destination, but [Joe] might take quite a bit of convincing!”\nThe couple celebrate the 5th anniversary of their first date, with Jonas posting on TikTok with a montage commemorating meeting Turner for the first time.\nOn May 2, Turner and Jonas walk the red carpet at the Met Gala, and they're accompanied by Turner's new baby bump.   \nA day later, they officially confirm the news when Turner talks about how much she loves being a mother with ELLE UK.\n“It's what life is about for me—raising the next generation,” Turner explained. “The greatest thing in life is seeing my daughter go from strength to strength. We're so excited to be expanding the family. It's the best blessing ever.”\nJonas is interviewed by People for a cover story with the Jonas Brothers, and discussed being a dad again, saying, “You really don't know what to expect. I think [I'm] maybe a little less nervous [this time], but I'm just excited...It's such an amazing part of life.”\nReps tell People that the couple has welcomed another baby girl, saying, “Joe and Sophie are happy to announce the arrival of their baby girl.”\nJonas discusses the “adjustment period” of work and family balance with People, admitting he's still “learning.”\n“It's an adjustment period,” Jonas said. “Just something that I'm learning as I go, I think I can now work a little bit harder to take time off. I'm still trying to figure it out. Some weeks are a little bit more challenging than others, but it makes it a lot easier when you enjoy your gig … I wake up every day just thrilled to be able to go make music or act and create different projects and have a beautiful family, so it feels like a dream come true.” \nTurner and Jonas attend the premiere of the singer's new movie Devotion at the Toronto International Film Festival, their first red carpet appearance since the birth of their second child.\nIn an interview with MR PORTER, Jonas explains why privacy in his relationship with Turner is so important.\n“I want to feel like an open book,” he said. “But when we started dating, I realized that I didn't have a ton of stuff that was just for me. And in the end, it makes me a better person to have something for myself.”\nWhile talking with Ryan Seacrest, Jonas  said he asked Turner's dad for her hand in marriage, and it was nerve-wracking.\n“I was probably more nervous to ask her dad than I was to ask her,” he said. “You throw it out there, and you hope that the response is good. Luckily, it went well.”\nLater that month, Turner accompanied her husband as the Jonas Brothers received their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. During his speech at the ceremony, Jonas shouted Turner out by saying, “Sophie, what up homie. You're my partner in crime. You keep me motivated and inspired every day. I strive to be as cool as you. You got any plans after this?”\nHe then mentioned his daughters, saying, “To my little ones at home, Daddy loves you to the moon and back.”\nJonas and Turner had a very public date night, attending the Vanity Fair Oscar after-party together on March 12.\nTurner accidentally posted a video of her and Jonas' older daughter Willa briefly to her Instagram Story. She explained in a post after why she and Jonas still intend to keep their daughters' lives as private as possible. She wrote:\n“Earlier today I made an honest mistake accidentally posting a video of our daughter on instagram stories. We have always advocated for our kids’ rights to privacy so sharing this publicly is something that is against anything I stand for. Our children deserve the right to grow up out of the public eye, to learn and grow in private. If I ever were to post anything of our kids, know that it is unquestionably a mistake. I would greatly appreciate if anyone who has reposted on any other platform, please delete the video.”\nIn a lighter moment for the couple toward the end of May, Turner made a special appearance during Jonas' Chicken Shop Date video.\n\nTurner posted a birthday tribute to Jonas for his 34th birthday on August 15, featuring the couple in matching pajamas. “Happy birthday handsome,” she wrote, tagging Jonas.\nFans of the couple noted that they'd both been recently seen without their wedding rings during the first few days of September 2023. On September 2, Jonas shared a picture with his brothers on Instagram in which his wedding ring is visible.\nOn September 3, TMZ reported that the couple are seeking a divorce following six months of difficulty in their relationship. Jonas has supposedly reached out to lawyers and a source claims he has been responsible for the kids the last few months while on tour as Turner films in London. The couple also recently sold their mansion in Miami after buying it just a year ago, marking a season of change.\nOn September 5, Jonas filed for divorce in Miami, stating in court documents that “the marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken.” The couple has a prenup in place, and Jonas requested joint custody of their two daughters.\nLater on September 5, sources spoke to People and Page Six about what led to Jonas and Turner’s split.\n“They were not separated but they’ve been living separate lives for months,” a source who knows the couple told People, adding that they spent the summer apart. “[They] haven’t gotten along in a while, but they’re hoping to resolve this all amicably.” \n“As far as custody goes, this literally all just happened, so they’re figuring it out in real time,” People’s source continued. “They did have a prenup. As a family, they were based in Florida. The kids were with him the last few months, traveling with him with family while he’s been on tour. Sophie’s been working in the U.K.”\nThe source added that their divorce does not come as a “surprise” to those who know them.\nPage Six spoke to a source close to the Jonas family, who described the divorce being the result of “many disagreements” just adding up.\n“Divorce was a last resort for Joe,” Page Six’s source said. “He never wanted to break up his family, but he had to take what he felt was the best course of action for his girls.”\n“An unhappy home isn’t a home, and the truth is that he and Sophie were going through it this year,” the source continued. “There’s a lot of noise out there, but it wasn’t a straw-that-broke-the-camel’s-back situation like it’s being reported. [The disagreements] just kept building, and Joe finally reached a point where he felt that he had exhausted all options to salvage the marriage.”\nDuring the morning, Jonas and Turner released a joint statement on their Instagram accounts confirming their separation. “After four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage,” they said. “There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.”\nFans also noted that during his concert in Phoenix, Arizona, on Wednesday, September 6, Jonas changed the lyrics to “Hesitate,” a song he wrote in honor of Turner.\n“Don’t be scared because I’m on her side,” Jonas sang in footage posted to social media. The original line was “Don’t be scared because I’m on your side.”\nHe stated in the Jonas Brothers’ 2020 documentary, Chasing Happiness, what the song was about.\n“‘Hesitate’ is a song I wrote. It’s like my vows before I wrote my vows. It’s my promise to Sophie,” he said. “I can see in the audience when it’s definitely those other people’s songs. I see couples holding each other. I see somebody, that song got them through something.”\nHe continued, “For me, it takes me to a whole other universe, I’m seeing her walk down the aisle again every time I close my eyes.”\nOn Saturday, September 9, Jonas seemed to walk back some of the statements that have been circulating about the split between himself and Turner. While on stage for a Jonas Brothers concert in Los Angeles at Dodger Stadium,  the singer stated, “I just wanna say, look: if you don’t hear it from these lips, don’t believe it. Okay? Thank you everyone for your love and support. Me and my family love you guys.”\n“It’s been a tough week,” Joe Jonas says at the Jonas Brothers’ Dodger Stadium Show. “I just wanna say, look: if you don’t hear it from these lips, don’t believe it. Okay? Thank you everyone for your love and support. Me and my family love you guys.” pic.twitter.com/6BW4ugrQ5N\nTurner filed a lawsuit in New York City on September 21, claiming that Jonas was withholding their two children’s passports and keeping them from their “habitual residence” of England. \nOutlets widely report on the court documents and all they revealed about Jonas and Turner’s relationship and how quickly their marriage dissolved. \nTurner claimed in them that she learned about Jonas filing for divorce through the media and that they had agreed in December 2022 to make England their “forever home.” She detailed how they had taken steps in the months after to make that transition. She also indicated her intent to file another suit in England for custody.\nJonas’ rep responded to her filing with a long statement to TMZ. The rep claimed that Jonas needs to keep the children in the U.S. so he does not violate his divorce filing in Florida. “The Florida Court has already entered an order that restricts both parents from relocating the children,” the rep said.\nAttorneys not associated with Turner and Jonas’ case told Page Six that due to their filing in two different jurisdictions, the matter isn’t likely to be resolved easily or quickly. “It’s going to be a long court battle,” New York trial lawyer Aaron Richard Golub said, adding it is one that “is going to swing like a pendulum.”\nOn Friday, September 22, actress Jessica Chastain reposted a tweet from author Roxane Gay. It read, “The way Joe Jonas miscalculated his popularity with his transparent attempts at PR manipulation, particularly when the North remembers is FASCINATING.”\nShe added, “And holding the children’s passports to keep them from their mother? Bruh. And the thing is, these are not people I know or follow. I just read the ‘news.’ He has handled this SO badly that now I’m paying attention.”\nChastain shared the first tweet, adding a reference to Gay as “The Oracle.”\nThe Oracle @rgay 🤍 https://t.co/RosjKuXW0m\nBoth Jonas and Turner signed an interim consent order that multiple media outlets obtained where they agreed to have their children remain in New York as they work through their custody case. The court agreement prohibits either from removing their daughters from the state. Page Six noted that the former couple is due to appear in court on October 3 for a pretrial conference.\nIn July, Jonas and Turner were looking to buy a property in Wallingford, England. As part of their attempt to close on the house, Jonas wrote a letter to the then-owner to persuade them to sell to the celebrity couple. \nThe letter was shared by Page Six, and it includes a rave review of living in the U.K. from Jonas.\n“When my wife and I decided we were going to spend more time in the UK and search for a permanent home, our daughter expressed three unwavering requirements: having chickens, a pony and a Wendy house,” the musician allegedly stated. “While many of the houses we viewed met this criteria, the moment we turned the corner and caught sight of the charming blue shutters adorning [redacted], we experienced a sense of magic unlike anything we had felt before.”\nHe went on to discuss how he and Turner would live in the house, building out a music studio and working on the garden.\n“We could tell that your family have truly loved living here and we can envision our children growing up here and making this our forever home,” the letter supposedly goes on. “I really think Sophie and I will be able to look after [redacted names] and for many years pay homage to the magic you have created here.” \nThe sale has not closed, and their divorce commenced two months after putting down a ten percent deposit on the property.\nJonas and Turner started their 4-day mediation for child custody and their divorce. A source told Page Six that Jonas was hopeful about the mediation going in. “Joe is committed to making it work with Sophie in mediation and doesn’t want to put up a fight—as long as they can come to a fair agreement on the kids,” the source said. No source associated with Turner spoke out on her perspective.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

{"title": "Francia Raisa Says Selena Gomez Friendship Had a ‘Rocky’ Moment: ‘It Had Nothing to Do With the Kidney’", "date": "2023-10-05 19:46:00", "text": "Selena Gomez’s longtime friend Francia Raisa attended Gomez’s first Rare Impact Fund benefit last night and candidly addressed their friendship history during a red carpet interview. \nRaisa donated one of her kidneys to Gomez in 2017 when she was in dire need of one due to her lupus condition. Fans speculated that Gomez and Raisa may have had a falling out after Raisa posted and deleted a shady comment following Gomez’s Rolling Stone interview last fall, where Gomez said Taylor Swift was her only friend “in the industry.”\nIn July this year, Raisa shut down feud rumors, telling paparazzi, “There’s no beef, guys.”\nAt the Rare Impact Benefit, Raisa explained to Extra that her and Gomez’s relationship, which started when they were teenagers, has had its ups and downs.\nRaisa said she believed they met in 2008 “when I was on Secret Life of the American Teenager on ABC Family at the time, she was on Wizards of Waverly Place. Disney had the stars of their shows come down to Children’s Hospital and visit all the kids. They put us all in groups, and she was in my group. She came up to me and was like, ‘My mom had a teenage pregnancy, she was 16, and we love your show.’ I was like, ‘Oh, my God, thank you! I love your show.’ And then we started talking, we both had boyfriends at the time, we started kiki-ing… And then around the time that my boyfriend and I broke up, and her and her boyfriend broke up, she called me and was like, ‘I’m going through some stuff. You’ve always been so nice to me. I’m going through a breakup.’ I was like, ‘Girl, me, too,’ and we were just inseparable after that ever since.”\nRaisa said she didn’t anticipate their journey to evolve the way it did. “We trauma-bonded, which is beautiful, but also it can get rocky and tricky,” Raisa continued. “People grow, relationships change. But obviously, I treat her like my little sister, she treats me like her older sister. I don’t know any relationship that’s perfect. They all go through things. So when our situation came up [with me donating her one of my kidneys], I mean, no, I never pictured that, but obviously I never regretted it. I am happy that we are here today, celebrating and supporting each other.”\nRaisa added that she and Gomez have both changed a lot too. “I am a different person today than I was last year or even when I turned 30,” she said. “I’m 35 now. Even when Selena turned 30, I’m like, ‘It’s different, isn’t it?’ and she was like, ‘Yeah.’ I said, ‘Welcome to your 30s. Now we can get to know each other again.”\n“Sometimes I feel people need to spend time apart to grow individually and then come back together. I think that’s what relationships are about,” Raisa added. She and Gomez “had to almost go on our own journey and grow,” she continued, “and now I am really happy in my career now and my endeavor. I don’t know if I would be able to do that if I didn’t really take some time for myself and figure out what the hell was going on with me, because I wasn’t okay.”\nRaisa clarified that her personal struggle was rooted in her childhood, not in her donating a kidney to Gomez. “I am okay now, and just for the record, it had nothing to do with the kidney because I don’t want any clickbait,” she said. “It had nothing to do with that. I went through a lot in my childhood and I’ll be talking about it very soon about exactly what happened. She has been such a huge support through all of that.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "All About Rich Paul, Adele's Boyfriend and One of the Biggest Sports Agents in the NBA", "date": "2023-10-05 16:53:00", "text": "The tables are turning for pop superstar Adele, who—despite keeping a low profile following her divorce from Simon Konecki, which was finalized in March 2021—has found love stateside. \nOn July 24, 2021, she and sports agent Rich Paul were seen out on a date at NYC hotspot Cipriani; The Sun obtained photos. The PDA-filled photos seemed to confirm the romance, which was also confirmed by Page Six on July 20, 2021.\nOnly a few days before the Page Six post, they were seen together for the first time. On July 17, 2021, British singer was spotted laughing and cheering alongside Paul at Game 5 of the NBA Finals, in which the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Phoenix Suns.\nPaul was apparently there alongside his client LeBron James to support friend Chris Paul, a player for the Suns. On a late-night podcast following the game’s conclusion, ESPN's Brian Windhorst seemingly confirmed the relationship between Paul and the “Rolling in the Deep” singer.\n“Rich Paul brings his girlfriend to the game to sit next to LeBron. His girlfriend is Adele,\" Windhorst said. \"This is the first time that they’ve come out in public together.”\nPage Six confirmed the two were involved on Tuesday, July 20, with a source telling the outlet that Adele and Paul are “100 percent” dating.\nNot much is known about the relationship nor its impetus, but it's possible the two have been an item since as early as May 2021. In a profile of Paul for The New Yorker, interviewer Isaac Chotiner detailed the following exchange between the sports agent and Adam Mendelsohn, a friend and adviser to both Paul and James.\nThe “major pop star” in question is almost undoubtedly Adele, and it appears the two have made their relationship official in the months since the article's release. And while Adele has, of course, received the majority of the press since the couple was spotted at Game 5, Paul has a storied career of his own. Here's what we know about the agent's background. \nBorn and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, in the neighborhood of Glenville, 41-year-old Paul became a sports agent after meeting a teenaged James at the Akron-Canton Airport in 2002. Paul was wearing a Houston Oilers jersey that caught James's eye, and the two of them stayed in touch, eventually becoming such close confidantes that Paul went to work at Creative Artists Agency, under James's then-agent Leon Rose. Developing a strong business savvy, he was eventually able to strike out on his own.\nToday, Paul has his own agency—Klutch Sports Group, which he started in 2012—and is one of the most well-known agents in sports. His clients include James, Philadelphia 76ers player Ben Simmons, Los Angeles Lakers star Anthony Davis, and Golden State Warriors player Draymond Green, among a slew of others. \nWindhorst—the podcaster and ESPN reporter who revealed Adele was Paul's “girlfriend”—has written several books about James and has developed a close relationship with Paul as well. He told the New Yorker's Chotiner, “The burden that Rich faces is that people question his legitimacy. They want to delegitimize him because of his race, because of his lack of education, because he used to sell jerseys out of the trunk of his car. If that’s the best they can do, they have to do a lot better.”\nIn March 2021, around the time Paul supposedly started “hanging out” with Adele, The Hollywood Reporter announced that the sports agent would release a memoir titled Lucky Me. The book is a coming-of-age story to be published by Roc Lit 101, the publishing division of Jay-Z's entertainment company Roc Nation. \nThe memoir will apparently follow Paul's upbringing in Cleveland, his relationship with his family, as well as his rise to the top of his field in sports. \n“Lucky Me is more than my story,” Paul revealed in a press statement. “Lucky Me is the story of every young Black man who grew up like me. I want to use my story to uplift and inspire those who lived this and educate those who didn’t. I cannot tell you what it means to partner with my friend and mentor Jay-Z on this project. Lucky Me was the name of the book before I even spoke with Jay because his music was my life’s soundtrack.”\nThe first photos of the couple together were taken during the NBA Finals, though they certainly looked at ease court-side.\nAn eyewitness at the game told Entertainment Tonight, “They had their eyes on each other almost as much as they did on the game!”\nIt took just days for media outlets to confirm the news that Windhorst broke: Adele and Paul truly are a couple. Page Six was told by a source that “they are [definitely] dating,” on July 20. Details about what their relationship is like or how they met remain private at this point.\nPeople got a little more insight on July 20 about Adele and Paul's timeline. The outlet was told by a source that their relationship isn't brand, brand new. A source said that they've actually been dating for “a few months.” Paul and Adele's reps didn't respond to the outlet's request for comment, a hint that the two are likely keep their relationship details as private as possible.\nE! spoke to a source close to Adele in early August about why the singer has been more willing to have her romance with Paul in the spotlight. The source called their relationship “bit of a whirlwind.”\nThat said, “she's very happy and loves being with him.” Paul is “outgoing” and wants to  “out and about,” which Adele has “embraced,” the outlet's source said. “She's not as concerned about being private with her life because she's very happy with Rich.”\nPeople was told by a source on September 1 that Paul and Adele's relationship isn't just causal anymore. “They went to LeBron James' party together,” a source told the outlet. “He often brings her around his friends. She seems to be getting along with everyone. They act like they are getting more serious.”\n“She is having fun dating Rich,” the source added. “They spend a lot of time together. Adele seems very happy.”\nAdele slipped a picture of herself posing with Paul at a party into a slideshow of her beautiful strapless dress on Instagram. The two were at a the wedding LA Lakers star Anthony Davis.\nThe photo booth image shows them smiling and happy and very much in couple mode.\nRich Paul accompanied Adele to London, where she is preparing for her show at the London Palladium next week, E! News reports. This will be Adele's first show in the U.K. in four years and it's the first time Paul has joined her in her own country. They have also met one another's kids, and a source told E! in September that their relationship has “become more serious in the last few months” and the singer is “very much in love with Rich.”\nTaking him back home with her to England does seem serious. Her show will be available as an ITV special, An Audience With Adele, beginning November 21.\nAdele opened up a little about Paul to Rolling Stone in the magazine's cover story about her ahead of 30's release. Celebrity gossip Instagram DeuxMoi outed her relationship with the sports agent, Adele said. “I didn’t really tell many of my friends at the beginning because I wanted to keep it to myself,” she said. The two first appeared together at a discount mall. “None of them believed it!”\nShe added that Paul has met her son, and their relationship is “incredible, openhearted, and [the] easiest [one]” she has ever been in because of the self-growth and healing she’s done.\nIn an interview with Oprah Winfrey during her Adele: One Night Only TV special, the singer opened up about her relationship with Paul and what makes it so special. She said it's the first time she’s truly “loved myself and been open to loving and being loved by someone else.” So, Winfrey asked, is the lucky sports agent getting a different Adele than everyone else has gotten?\n“Yeah,” Adele answered hesitantly. “By arriving and turning up [for myself], maybe I’m getting a different version of him at all. It’s just timing. It’ll be interesting to see what my reaction will be like in general to anything that hurts me now that I feel so secure in myself. And I’m talking outside of romance as well.”\nAdele showed off her new kicks on Instagram Stories, a pair of white New Balance 550s that are a collaboration between the brand and her boyfriend, Rich Paul, even featuring his name on the sneakers' tongue.\n“Congratulations @richpaul,” she wrote across the post.\nThe collaboration between Paul and New Balance will also include apparel. These white shoes have a classic look and feature blue and yellow accents. Adele shared yet another image of them from further away, posting hearts over the photo.\nShe was also wearing a pair of cream sweatpants with blue stripes, matching the shoe's color story. \nOn Thursday, December 16, the couple appeared at SoFi Stadium with Jay-Z and LeBron James' business partner Maverick Carter in a luxury suite. They were photographed holding hands by ESPN as they enjoyed the Kansas City Chiefs-L.A. Chargers game.\nWho the heck are Jay-Z and Adele’s +1s???? 🧐 https://t.co/36XFD9Xajv\nJames joked about the photos on his Twitter account, quote-tweeting the images and asking, “Who the heck are Jay-Z and Adele’s +1s????”\nObviously, both Paul and Carter are quite well-known the the NBA star.\nAdele and Paul's relationship quietly remains on and strong. While the two were apart on Adele's 34th birthday, People reports the couple had dinner in Napa Valley on May 8.\n“Adele is still seeing Rich,” a source said. “They are both very busy though. She is working on her residency and Rich is busy with his clients. They see each other when they can.”\nOn June 25, Adele and Rich Paul attended Cleveland Cavaliers star Kevin Love and Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model Kate Bock’s wedding at the New York Public Library. A photo of them in their full glam was posted to LeBron James' Instagram account. They stood as a couple across from James and his wife, Savannah James.\nAdele wore an off-the-shoulder black gown that ended at just her ankles and which was draped with sheer tulle fabric. She was wearing pointed black pumps and carried a black clutch. Paul was in a black tuxedo tailored to fit the Great Gatsby theme of the evening with a classic fit.\nJames captioned the photo, “ICONIC.” \nOn June 11, 2022, during interview with E! News, Paul seemed to hint that he'd be open to having more children and being an “older dad.”\n“As a young dad, growing a business, it was pretty tough,” he said. “But now looking as an older dad and my kids being much older, and obviously, if I was to have more kids ... I'm looking forward to being a different dad, a more patient dad.”\nIn an interview with BBC Radio Four's Desert Island Discs on July 1, 2022, Adele said she'd “definitely like a couple more kids” with Paul. She has one child now, nine-year-old son Angelo, who she shares with her ex-husband, Simon Konecki.\n“I would definitely love a couple more kids,” she said. “It would be wonderful. If not, I've got Angelo.”\nAdele has mentioned wanting to have more children before, saying in an interview on the Graham Norton Show in February that her recently cancelled Caesars Palace Las Vegas residency would “absolutely 100% happening this year.”\nShe explained, “It has to happen this year because I've got plans for next year. Imagine if I have to cancel because I am having a baby!”\nDuring a late August Las Vegas residency show, Adele spoke to two fans about her hope to have another child on the sooner side. “I really want to be a mom again soon, so every time I see a name I like, I write it down in my phone,” Adele said, via Entertainment Tonight. “I can't say Parker because Rich likes that name.” Adele noted that she likes the names Ray and Spencer.\nAdele was featured on the cover of ELLE's September issue, where she gushed about how her relationship with the sports agent is unlike anything she's ever experienced.\n“I've never been in love like this. I'm obsessed with him,” she announced. When asked if she'd consider remarrying following her divorce from ex-husband Simon Konecki, Adele answered, “Yes, absolutely.”\nShe went to say, “I definitely want more kids. I'm a homemaker and I'm a matriarch, and a stable life helps me with my music. But right now, all I got in my brain is [my upcoming Las Vegas residency]. I wanna f*cking nail it.”\nPaul celebrated his 41st birthday on December 16, 2022. Adele serenaded her sweetheart while on stage at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. She sang him \"Happy Birthday,\" and naturally, it went viral. Fans took to Twitter to share the wholesome moment.\n“It’s my boyfriend’s birthday today, and I love him more than life itself,” she said. “Can we wish him happy birthday?”\nsinging happy birthday to rich. That was actually so beautiful🥺♥️ pic.twitter.com/yeJyBffJS6\nAdele played coy when she sparked Paul engagement rumors last February by wearing a diamond ring on her left ring finger to the BRIT Awards. She said, days after on the Graham Norton Show while still wearing the ring, “If I was [engaged], would I ever tell anyone if I was or wasn't?” \nA year later at the end of February 2023, unverified celeb gossip Instagram DeuxMoi claimed that Adele and Paul really were engaged and planning to get married in the summer, per a “reliable source.” DeuxMoi did not disclose who this source was or what makes them reliable, however, and Adele has not ever confirmed her engagement. It's just more fodder to the engagement rumor.\nAdele and Paul had a casual date on Friday, April 28, attending the NBA game at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles where the city's Lakers and the Memphis Grizzlies were facing each other in the playoffs. The singer was wearing a grey tracksuit from Klutch Athletics, her fiancé's sportswear brand he co-authored with New Balance. Though the outfit was relaxed, she had on some glam makeup, including a smokey eye and dark lipstick. \nPaul was also in a tracksuit set, this one in patterned white and green with a zippered jacket.  \nOn Saturday, May 6, the couple were seen on another date at the Crypto Arena in Los Angeles for the 2023 NBA playoffs. The singer was wearing a two piece made of flowing tan fabric with loose slacks and matching button down. She paired the look with black sandal heels and hold hoops that matched her necklaces and bracelets. Paul wore a black tracksuit with green details over a white t-shirt underneath and a pair of colorful sneakers. They were seated next to actress Nia Long and the stadium was full of other celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian, Rob Zombie, Kevin Hart, and Michael B. Jordan.\nThe couple has been regularly calling each other husband and wife despite not being married, and Adele has made headlines for doing it during her Las Vegas residency.\nA source told Us Weekly that Paul actually started calling Adele his wife two months into dating.\n“They aren’t married but they do call each other husband and wife and have been for a while now,” the source said. “Adele loved the security [of it] and how much he adores her.”\nHilary Weaver is a freelance writer based in New York who writes about politics, queer issues, Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, and every woman the Queen has ever made a dame.

{"title": "The Real Reason Adele Has Been Calling Rich Paul Her ‘Husband’", "date": "2023-10-05 16:45:00", "text": "Adele has regularly been calling Rich Paul her “husband” during her Las Vegas residency, sparking rumors that the couple may have secretly tied the knot. But they haven’t, a source told Us Weekly. It’s just a term of endearment. In fact, Paul started calling Adele his “wife” two months into dating, the source said.\n“They aren’t married but they do call each other husband and wife and have been for a while now,” the source continued. “Adele loved the security [of it] and how much he adores her.”\nAdele and Paul have been dating since 2021. They sparked engagement rumors in February 2022 when Adele wore a big diamond ring on her left ring finger at the BRIT Awards. When asked about the rumors while wearing the ring again during her Graham Norton Show appearance, Adele said, “If I was [engaged], would I ever tell anyone if I was or wasn’t?”\nELLE asked Adele about the engagement rumors months later in August 2022. At first, she dodged the question, saying: “Well! Well. Well, I’m not married. I’m not married.” Then she added, “I’m just in loooove! I’m happy as I’ll ever be. I might as well be married.”\nShe later clarified in another conversation for the piece that “I’m not engaged. I just love high-end jewelry, boy!” \nAdele most recently sparked secret marriage headlines when she rejected a fan’s proposal to her during her Vegas residency. “You can’t marry me, I’m straight, my love. And my husband’s here tonight. He’s here,” she said. \nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nSelena Gomez hosted her first Rare Impact Fund benefit last night, and the singer leaned into extravagant dressing. The star wore three dresses throughout the night, starting with a custom Valentino silver floor-length gown on the red carpet with Messika dangle earrings. \nGomez switched into minidresses for the rest of the night. Next, she wore a purple floral one by Rahul Mishra  on the red carpet.\nInside the gala, she switched into a floral Monse minidress with a zebra print when speaking on stage.\nHer friend and kidney donor Francia Raisa wore a matching silver gown with her on the red carpet. Raisa told Extra the two hadn’t coordinated outfits on purpose: “The only thing we coordinated was our spray tans, [which we got together],” she said. “We didn’t talk about our dress.”\nShe also addressed their friendship following past feud rumors, saying, “We trauma bonded [when we first met as teens over exes], which is beautiful, but also it can get rocky and tricky. People grow, relationships change, obviously I treat her like my little sister she treats me like her older sister. I don’t know any relationship that’s perfect. When our situation came up—no, I never pictured that, but obviously I never regretted it. I am happy that we are here today celebrating and supporting each other.”\nOf their evolution, she said, “I am a different person today than I was last year or even when I turned 30, I’m 35 now, even when Selena turned 30, I’m like, ‘It’s different isn’t it?’ and she was like, ‘Yeah.’ I said, ‘Welcome to your 30s, now we can get to know each other again.”\nGomez spoke to People at the event about feeling more at ease in her 30s. “Now that I’m 30, I care less, so it’s actually nice,” she said. “I get to focus on the things that actually matter, and I’m not worried about things that were holding me back.”\nRegarding the benefit, Gomez said, “It is my first time throwing something and I hate asking people for money, so I don’t know. It’s like a weird concept, but I know that we’re doing a good thing and I couldn’t be more lucky to have the platform to do that.” \nHer Rare Impact Fund donates to mental health organizations, which you can learn more about here.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nRihanna and her longtime friend A$AP Rocky became much more than friends about three years ago; they welcomed their first child together in 2022. The two have been close since A$AP joined Rihanna’s Diamond Tour in 2013. The singer also starred in A$AP's music video “Fashion Killa” later that year.\nRumors of A$AP and Rihanna's romance first started shortly after Rihanna split from billionaire boyfriend Hassan Jameel in January 2020, after three years together. A source told People then that “their lives were too different, and it was hard to maintain a relationship.” Shortly after their breakup, Rihanna was seen hanging out with A$AP Rocky more often. A$AP previously dated Kendall Jenner in 2016; their relationship ended in 2017 \nHere's everything we know about the power couple, from when they were first speculated to be in a relationship to how they're doing as new parents at the start of 2023.\nOn December 2, the pair walked the British Fashion Awards red carpet in London. Rihanna wore a Fenty mint green satin dress with matching gloves and wrap, paired with a diamond-studded choker necklace. A$AP sported an all-black tux with sneakers. Janet Jackson presented Rihanna's first fashion award for her Urban Luxe nomination.\nRihanna and A$AP sparked tabloid dating rumors days after her split from Hassan Jameel was reported. According to Entertainment Tonight, Rihanna and A$AP attended the Yams Day Benefit Concert in Brooklyn together.\nA source suggested the two were dating to The Sun, telling the British outlet, “they’re really enjoying each other’s company and taking things easy as it’s still early days.”\nShortly after The Sun's report came out, E! shut down the romance speculation. A source told E!, “Rihanna is single. She just got out of a long intense relationship with Hassan. She's wants to be single and isn't going to jump into something. She's hanging out with A$AP Rocky, but she is not dating him. They have a long history and she's just having fun.”\nMonths after dating rumors were initially denied, A$AP appeared alongside Rihanna in Fenty Skin's ad cameo. The ad also featured Lil Nas X, Tommy Genesis, and Halima Aden.\nRihanna interviewed the “Everyday” rapper in a GQ YouTube video. A$AP answered questions about his skincare routine, throwback outfits, and Fenty Skin. When asked about the most challenging part of working with Rihanna, the rapper said, “I think the hardest part about working with you is not goofin' off and laughing the whole time. Like, this shit is comedy.” A$AP continued, “The hardest part is not having too much fun. You just forget that it's still work at the end of the day.”\nOn November 28, the rumored couple was spotted out with a group of friends at the Beatrice Inn in New York. According to Page Six, the two were “seated discreetly behind a curtain.”\nA couple of days later, People confirmed that Rihanna and A$AP Rocky are officially dating. The source did not provide details about the couple's timeline or how serious their relationship is.\nOn December 1, a source gave Entertainment Tonight details about Rihanna and A$AP's relationship.\n“They have always had amazing chemistry, and Rihanna relates to A$AP, and it [their relationship] feels natural, easy and fun,” the source said. “She feels very comfortable around him since they’ve known each other for such a long time and also feels a connection to him because his dad is from Barbados.”According to People, the couple had been inseparable for weeks. A source told the outlet that “it's a new relationship, but they both seem very into it.” A$AP's lifestyle as a famous musician worked with Rihanna's. “They've always seemed to have a great time together,” the source said. “They have a lot in common.”\nUs Weekly reported that the “Goldie” rapper “has been very into Rihanna for years and was always the instigator in their flirtatious connection,” according to a source. The source also mentioned that Rihanna “would brush off his advances and kept him in the friend zone” until now.\n“Things changed over the summer, and they finally hooked up. They've been together ever since,” Us's source said.\nThe couple became more serious as the Grammy-nominated rapper flew to Barbados to join Rihanna and her family for the holidays. According to People, the pair spent Christmas together.\nEntertainment Tonight was told by a source that “spending Christmas together was an obvious step” for their relationship. The source said being longtime friends makes it easier to “get along, travel together, and be involved in each other’s lives to the full extent. They always have such a good time together and definitely seem in love.”\nOn December 24, the low-key couple was photographed by paparazzi in Barbados. TMZ shared a photo of the pair hand-in-hand as they walked to the pier, seemingly confirming their relationship.\nLater that month, paparazzi caught more affectionate moments between the new couple. Rihanna and A$AP were spotted sharing a kiss while enjoying their Catamaran cruise, according to TMZ. The outlet shared a video of the pair jet skiing and tubing alongside Rihanna’s friends.\nOn January 18, the couple and friends celebrated Yams Day, an annual celebration of A$AP Rocky’s late friend and business partner A$AP Yam, who died in 2015. E! reported details of the night as the couple arrived separately.\n“Rihanna arrived with a group of friends and met A$AP Rocky there,” a source told the outlet. “They entered the restaurant through different doors and tried to be discreet. A$AP Rocky entered behind a bodyguard and ducked inside quickly. Once everyone arrived, they sat together with a group of friends.”\nThe source said that the group had dinner and shared stories throughout the evening: “There was lots of food passed around the table and laughter coming from inside. They stayed for over two hours before leaving separately.” Rihanna and A$AP left separately.\nThe couple made a rare sighting in Los Angeles on April 12. The paparazzi photographed the pair leaving dinner at Delilah in matching leather outfits. Rihanna wore a brown leather coat, and A$AP wore a black leather jacket paired with leather pants. It was confirmation that their romance remained very much on a year into the coronavirus pandemic.\nIn a GQ interview, Rocky opened up about his relationship with the Barbadian singer for the first time. In the interview, he referred to Rihanna as “the love of my life” and “my lady.”\nThe rapper did not share when the two began their relationship, but he did discuss what dating Rihanna is like versus playing the field. It's “so much better when you got the One. She amounts to probably, like, a million of the other ones,” Rocky said. “I think when you know, you know. She’s the One.”\nHe also spoke about their trip together to Barbados during the holidays. “It was crazy. I always imagined what it would be like for my dad before he came to America. And I got to visit those places, and believe it or not, and there was something nostalgic about it. It was foreign but familiar,” he said.\nOn June 23, the couple was photographed sharing a kiss at Barcade in New York City, a rare PDA moment for them. Rihanna wore a sheer pink high-leg slit dress with a furry hot pink hat. Rocky wore a leather jacket, maroon tank, and leather pants. Later that night, the paparazzi captured the couple leaving the venue as Rihanna wore Rocky’s leather coat with his arms around her.\nA few days later, TMZ posted a video of the couple depicting one of Rocky's grand gestures for his lady. TMZ posted Rocky sweeping Rihanna off her feet as he carried her through New York City’s Lower East Side. According to the outlet, the couple spent the night and early morning partying together.\nRihanna and A$AP went for a date night in Miami at the World Famous House of Mac, where they took photos with the restaurant’s owner, Derrick Turton, who is also Pitbull’s former manager.\nThey cuddled up for photos, obtained by The Daily Mail, in which A$AP wrapped his arm around Rihanna’s shoulder. She put both arms in a hug around his waist. It looked like a very happy night out.\nIn August, the couple enjoyed a date night in NYC, which eventually led to the night club Pergola, where they were photographed leaving at 5 A.M. Rihanna wore a Harley Davidson handkerchief top with very ripped jeans and sandal heels.\nRihanna and A$AP Rocky walked the red carpet of the Met Gala together, an event where the singer would typically make a splash on her own. The theme for the 2021 Met Gala was American Fashion. Rihanna wore a dramatic black ruffle dress from Balenciaga with a beanie and over 267 carats worth Bulgari diamonds. Rocky arrived wearing a patchwork, blanket-like ensemble that looked very cozy.\nRihanna and A$AP Rocky revealed they're expecting their first child together. The two appeared out in New York City, Rihanna showing off her pregnant stomach to paparazzi at the end of the month.\nRihanna showed off some of her famously sexy and flattering maternity wear at the photocall for her Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin party held at Goya Studios in Los Angeles. Rocky was by her side, and the couple smiled and embraced one another for the cameras on the red carpet.\nRihanna wore a shredded green halter top with a backless design, over a pair of pants of the same material in a silver-to-purple ombré pattern. Rihanna's jewelry for the night included amethyst drop earrings, a silver bracelet with violet stones, and a series of Messika rings, including their Wild Moon ring, the Bague Diamond Catcher, and the Messika Bague Exotic Charm ring.\nFor her makeup, the singer and beauty mogul wore a bright red lip, shimmering gold eyeshadow, and her long hair down and parted to the side.\nA$AP Rocky wore Louis Vuitton, a letterman jacket with a matching shirt, a purple Yankees hat to match his girlfriend, and a pair of shredded denim jeans with green sneakers.\nThe event came with an announcement that Savage x Fenty would be launching retail stores with flagships in Los Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia, and Virginia, according to Forbes, and planned to open ten stores. \nEngagement rumors circulated when the pregnant singer was photographed out wearing a stunning diamond ring on her left ring finger.\nWhen photographed with the ring, Rihanna was out shopping for baby clothes in Los Angeles' Kitson, in a vintage Grave Digger monster truck T-shirt with jeans, a statement hat that read “Sex is safer than smoking,” and a Gucci Balenciaga purse. \nA couple days later, paparazzi asked Rihanna about the ring she was wearing and she laughed and teased, via The Daily Mail, “This old ring?”\nThis was a tough month for the couple after Rocky was arrested for a connection to a shooting in Hollywood in November 2021. He was taken in by the Los Angeles Police Department on April 20. The arrest came shortly after the couple landed back in California after visiting family in Barbados. He posted his $550,000 bail and was released just hours later. \nAfter the arrest, Rihanna allegedly canceled her baby shower, and a source told Us Weekly that she “hasn't spoken much about [the arrest]. She's truly focused on her pregnancy and not trying to get too stressed.”\nThe insider added, “She is very confident about everything and has told friends she just hopes for a positive outcome.”\nA$AP was accused of being involved with a shooting near Selma and Argyle Avenues following an argument. A man alleged that he was approached by the rapper at around 10:15 P.M. on November 6 and that A$AP fired a handgun at him three or four times. The victim's left hand was grazed by a bullet, and he sought medical treatment. \n“Rihanna was there when Rocky was arrested and has been crying non-stop,” another source claimed to The Sun. “She's heavily pregnant and these are very serious accusations, it's a nightmare scenario for her...It was meant to be Rihanna's baby shower in LA on Wednesday night, but they had to cancel.”\nThe source said, “Rihanna was very, very upset and stressed by Rocky's arrest. It's not the best time for her to be on such an emotional rollercoaster.”\nThat same month, gossip spread on Twitter that A$AP Rocky cheated on his pregnant girlfriend with shoe designer Amina Muaddi during May's Paris Fashion Week, but TMZ got clarification from a source directly connected to Rocky and Rihanna on the rumor's validity. It's absolutely not true, the source said.\nThe source said, “100% false on both counts,” adding again that it's “1 million percent not true. They're fine.” \nRihanna and A$AP Rocky's  “very fly” baby arrived. Rihanna gave birth to a baby boy on May 13 in Los Angeles, TMZ reported. The baby's name  was not immediately shared.\nA source close to the couple told People that the two were home in Los Angeles with him. “Rihanna is doing well. They are very excited to be parents. Rihanna is already a wonderful mom,” the source said.\nIt's announced that Rihanna will be headlining the Super Bowl Halftime Show in 2023.\n“Rihanna is excited for her Super Bowl performance,” the source told ET. “She is trying to stay on the healthier side and feel good and fit ahead of it.”\nRihanna herself told ET's Rachel Smith that she had a form of buyer's regret after the halftime news was announced.\n“I can’t believe I even said yes,” she explained. “It was one of those things that like, even when I announced it I was like, ‘I can’t take it back now. It’s final. I can’t believe... what did I just get myself into?’ Because the Super Bowl is one of the biggest stages in the world. It’s an entertainer's dream to be on the stage like that, but it's nerve-racking. You wanna get it right. You know everybody's watching. And they're rooting for you, and I wanna get it right. It's a challenge I was willing to accept. Being a new mom, nothing would have gotten me out of the house if it wasn't a challenge like that.”\nShe added, “It was now or never. Yeah, for sure. For sure. You can get real comfortable at home as a mom.”\nShe then shared a little about what her daily mom experience has been like and her favorite part.\n“Oh my god, the mornings, like, seeing his morning face!” Rihanna declared. “Seeing a baby with, like, little bags and waking up and they're just, like, startled. They're trying to figure out where they’re at. It's the cutest, it's my favorite part of the day.”\nThe Grammy-winning singer walked the red carpet with A$AP at the premiere of Marvel's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, their first time at a red carpet event since the birth of their son. Rihanna's singles “Lift Me Up” and “Born Again” appeared on the soundtrack for Ryan Coogler's Marvel sequel.\nThe premiere was held at the Los Angeles' Dolby Theatre, where Rihanna wore a sparkly, strapless dress by designer Rick Owens and a pair of opera gloves and matching pointed-toe heels.\nRocky matched his girlfriend in tone with an  oversized khaki jacket and matching pants with a black T-shirt underneath. \nA source told Entertainment Tonight that Rihanna hopes to expand her family with A$AP Rocky someday.\nThey added she has “dreamed of being a mom,” and would “love nothing more” than to have more kids with the rapper.\n“Rihanna and A$AP are so in love and have the best time together,” the source added. “They are also a great team when it comes to being parents to their baby boy. Rihanna always dreamed of being a mom and she takes a lot of pride in it. She would love to have more children with A$AP in the future.”\nRihanna shared her baby's face for the first time with a debut TikTok video.\nIn the adorable video, the baby is strapped in his car seat and smiling and gurgling as Rihanna speaks to him off-camera. She asks him, “You tryna get Mommy's phone?”\nHe smiles in response.\nRihanna captioned the video, “Hacked.”\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, Rocky shared what it's been like to be a dad and share a family with Rihanna.\n“Oh, man,” he said when first asked about Rihanna's upcoming halftime show. “I’m just as excited as you guys, if not more. Yeah, I’m super excited. This is as huge. This is incredible. I’m so glad that my lady’s back making music again and whatnot, and getting back out there. It’s just incredible. Especially for both of us, it is a good year for both of us to be more active and be out there. But the Super Bowl is huge, and her being the creative she is she going to bring it, man. I’m excited. I’m more excited than everybody else, honestly.”\nHe went. onto say about fatherhood, “It’s so unexplainable. It’s just one of those things. I’m a member of our club now, like the dad club. You see a dad, you see me. I’m playing on, I’m a full dad now. Being outside and working and being creative, it drives more energy for you…to think and soak things up like a sponge now that I’m a dad, because I have a whole ‘nother perspective. But it honestly helps you get home to your family and get home to your baby. And I can’t even explain it, man. You come home to heaven every day. I’m so thankful. God is good, man.”\nThat same month, the couple made a glamorous appearance at the Golden Globe awards, where Rihanna was nominated for Best Original Song, Motion Picture. Rihanna wore a gorgeous black gown by Schiaparelli couture and accessorized with Giuseppe Zanotti shoes and a Cartier diamond necklace and earrings. \nOkay, this is major now. Rihanna and Rocky are in the building.

She really kicked things into gear and got right to work after she received the call.”\nThey also explained she's been non-stop in the studio and has been “very hands on with every detail throughout the entire process.”\n“It is super exciting for her to get back out there and perform since having her son and she feels rejuvenated after taking some time off,” they explained. \nTo do all of this, especially with an eight-month-old son, Rihanna has been receiving a lot of support from her boyfriend. \n“A$AP has been very supportive throughout her preparation and has really been stepping up his parenting game while she has been busy with rehearsals,” the source said. “[A$AP] and her son plan to be there supporting her during her big day.”\nDuring the Super Bowl, Rihanna announced her second pregnancy with A$AP Rocky.\nShe spoke in a British Vogue interview published days later about their relationship being strengthened with the arrival of their baby boy. “We’re best friends with a baby,” she said with a laugh. “We have to be on the same page, but we’ve always kind of had that in our relationship. Everything changes when you have a baby but I wouldn’t say it’s done anything but made us closer.”\nRihanna and Rocky continued making appearances out and about as a couple. Rocky joined Rihanna at the Oscars where she performed, and footage went viral of him cheering for her at the ceremony.\nIt’s Asap Rocky always cheering her on for me😍😩🥹🤩 #Oscars2023 #Oscar #Oscars pic.twitter.com/PV1j5zlwYb\nThey were also photographed together backstage, with Rocky touching her baby bump:\nRihanna gave fans a rare look at her and Rocky's son for his first Easter with the family: \nRocky dropped his second hint of summer 2023 that he and Rihanna may be married with the release of his song “Riot.” His lyrics included, “My wife is erotic, I'm smokin' exotic (Woo, woo) / My whip is exotic, my crib is a cottage (Woo, woo, woo).” In the second verse, he teased a potential music project with her: “New collab' with my baby mom (Woo, woo, woo),” and he also name-dropped her later in the song: “Pass on a sweetie, I got me a RiRi.”\nNeither Rocky nor Rihanna commented on the marriage rumors or confirmed them. In June, Rocky had called Rihanna his “wife” during a Cannes performance.\nOn July 31, a source spoke to Entertainment Tonight about how the couple was now in Los Angeles, awaiting the birth of their second child who was due any day at that point.\nRihanna and Rocky “are each other’s rock,” the source said, adding that they have “been really great about prioritizing their relationship even as busy parents,” per the outlet.\nRihanna and Rocky welcomed their second son on August 1 in Los Angeles. The news came out publicly weeks later.\nA source told People on August 22 that “Rihanna feels her family is now complete.” Being a parent to two children, “it’s something she’s always wanted.”\nOn August 24, a source told Entertainment Tonight that “Rihanna and A$AP will spend the early days of parenthood out of the public eye and won’t make any immediate plans to debut the new baby,” the source said. \n“Rihanna and A$AP are great right now,” the source continued. “They’re so excited to grow their family and are so united when it comes to parenting. They have so much fun together and are very in love. They already shared a special connection and parenting together has made their bond even stronger.”\nFive weeks after Rihanna gave birth to her second son, his name was revealed.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nIt’s a love story that could actually be a Hollywood rom-com: The top American pop singer and the top American football player meet up, sparks fly, and they end up dating with the world watching. Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce have dominated headlines since their romance was first rumored to be a thing, with Swift’s first appearance at Kelce’s game in Kansas City becoming one of the year’s most buzzed-about moments. \nWhile the two may not be official just yet, things are escalating quickly, and anything is possible in the future, sources have made clear.\nHere, the full history of their relationship that is known so far.\nKelce plays “Kiss, Marry, Kill” in an interview, with the choices being Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, and Taylor Swift. “Damn, that’s messed up. I don’t want to kill any of them,” he prefaced. He then answered, “Ariana is kill, unfortunately. I love you, but you’re gone. And then Taylor Swift would be the kiss, and then Katy Perry would be the—what’s the last one? Katy Perry would be the marry.” The interview resurfaced in 2023 as the dating rumors with Swift began to gain traction.\nKelce discusses shooting his shot and missing while attending Swift’s Eras Tour show in Kansas City, Missouri on his New Heights podcast with his brother Jason, an NFL player for the Philadelphia Eagles. Kelce’s remarks get media pickup.\n“I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings. So I was a little butthurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her,” Kelce said. “If you’re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are a friendship bracelets and I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it. All right now.”\nJason asked if his brother meant his jersey number or phone number. \n“You know which one,” Kelce answered. “She doesn’t meet anybody and at least she didn’t want to meet me so I, um, I took that personal. But it was an unbelievable show and I’ve only seen Arrowhead filled like that for Chiefs games with that much excitement, and yeah, everybody was dressed in pink and purple going crazy. It was a wild show.”\nSwift and Kelce’s romance takes off this month. Here’s the play-by-play (pun very much intended).\nSwift goes out in New York City, wearing Foundrae’s Forever & Always a Pair Pendant, which has an opal teardrop stone on it. Fans note later that opal is Kelce’s birth stone (he is a Libra), and the necklace may have been an easter egg.\nThe Messenger reports that Swift and Kelce have been spending time together. “Taylor and Travis have been quietly hanging out,” a source told the outlet. “She saw him when she was in NYC a few weeks ago.”\nThat same day, another source told Entertainment Tonight that Kelce isn’t Swift’s secret new boyfriend: They are “not officially dating.” Sources will continue to stress this in the coming weeks.\nKelce’s brother Jason adds fuel to dating rumors during his appearance on the TNF Nightcap’s post-game interview.\n“I’ve seen these rumors…I cannot comment,” he said, noting that “ever since Catching Kelce [Kelce’s 2016 E! dating series], everyone’s been infatuated with Travis’ love life, so, I don’t really know what’s going on there. I know Trav is having fun, we’ll see what happens with whoever he ends up with.”\nTony asked Jason about the Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift dating rumors 😂@TonyGonzalez88 | #TNFonPrime pic.twitter.com/iHHqDvWC9B\nThat same day, Kelce dodges questions about Swift during an interview with Andrew Siciliano. \n“I’m not gonna talk about my personal life,” Kelce said. “I know what you writers wanna hear, and you wanna hear more about that, and I’m not gonna give you anything.”\nJason jokingly confirms the Taylor-Travis dating rumors on Audacy’s SportsRadio 94 WIP. When asked about the gossip surrounding his brother and Swift, Jason said that “it’s hard to answer because I don’t really know a lot about Travis’ love life. I try to keep his business kind of his business, stay out of that world. But having said that, I think he’s doing great, and I think it’s all 100 percent true, and I hope this thing goes a mile.” Then he made it clear he was just kidding: “No, I’m joking, I don’t know what's happening.”\nThe Messenger also gets more intel on the relationship from Swift’s side that day.\n“She and Travis have hung out twice, and it’s nothing serious,” the source said. “She thinks he is very charming, and they have been texting this last week. He is a little embarrassed at how much attention they are getting, but he has told her he would love to continue seeing her.”\n“They are seeing where things go,” the source added, noting that Swift’s “friends are always playfully suggesting people to set her up with. [She’s] in her fun girl era and strictly having fun right now.”\nKelce says he invited Swift to his game during an interview with The Pat McAfee Show. She later does attend it.\n “It’s hilarious how much traction this has actually gotten, right now it’s like a game of telephone,” Kelce said of the dating rumors. “No one actually knows what’s going on, especially when you got [my brother] Jason Kelce on live television telling people both sides—he doesn’t know, it’s true, this and that.” \nRegarding his status with Swift, Travis gave a frank answer: “I threw it out there, I threw the ball in her court. I told her, you know, I’ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead [Stadium], you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one’s a little more lit. So, we’ll see what happens in the near future.”\nA source close to the situation tells E! that Swift and Kelce have no plans to see each other imminently, downplaying their closeness. \n“[They] met up once in New York,” the source said. “They’ve been texting and talking here and there but [have] no set plans to see each other again. It’s been very low-key as he’s been in season.” Obviously, that changes two days later.\nSwift takes up Kelce’s invitation and attends his game in Kansas City. She is photographed in the stands with his mom. Sources reveal later that it was her first time meeting his family, and it went well.\nSwift and Kelce are filmed leaving the game, marking the first video of them together.\nDaily Mail later reveals that Swift met Kelce’s friends and family at his home before going to the game. The outlet wrote that she spent an hour with them before boarding a party bus with them to the stadium. \nA source told Daily Mail, “Travis wasn’t at his house, but it was filled with his friends and family. He has a personal chef and several friends from high school and college who use his place as a crash pad whenever they are in town.”\nA source told People that day that, once again, Swift and Travis aren’t serious, but she was happy to see him play. \n“Taylor is very focused on work right now and hanging out with her girlfriends. Travis invited her to the game, and of course she said ‘yes,’” the source said. “She just thought it was a fantastic way to spend Sunday.”\nA source later added to People that “they’re having fun. This was Taylor’s first time meeting his mom and dad, and everyone was enjoying themselves. She was super chill and low-key hanging out with his friends and family.”\nKelce and Swift end their day celebrating with his teammates and family at Prime Social Rooftop. They get affectionate there.\nOutlets get more information on the post-game date. \nInitial reports claim that Swift and Kelce paid to rent out Prime Social Rooftop. In reality, they had a reservation.\nAn eyewitness told Entertainment Tonight, “Travis bought out the restaurant for his family and team. Taylor arrived, wearing a denim dress, and was seen snacking, having some cocktails and dancing alongside Travis. The two were very affectionate with one another but kept things fun and lighthearted. Travis’ teammates also showed up to the after-party, as well as his mom, Donna Kelce. The party lasted until 2 A.M.”\nTMZ was also told that Swift and Kelce were affectionate at the game’s after-party. “Sources say they were holding hands at the restaurant he rented out for his family, friends, and teammates after the game. At one point Taylor was sitting on Travis’ lap,” TMZ wrote.\nIn addition, multiple sources discuss Swift and Kelce’s current relationship status.\nTMZ was told by sources that Swift and Kelce’s relationship is not a publicity stunt, first of all. The sources shared that Swift and Kelce have seen each other “several times” over the last few months, but are not officially dating yet. Previous in-person meetings have been in a “very private setting,” per the sources.\nEntertainment Tonight’s insiders said that things between Swift and Kelce remain casual, but he has potential to be a good match for her. Swift specifically liked that he pursued her.\n“Travis has never shied away from his desire to give dating with Taylor a try, which he even said during a press conference a few months ago after seeing Swift in concert,” one source said. “Travis and Taylor are taking things slowly and not rushing into anything serious. Both are very career-focused, so the focus is on that for now, but that’s not going to stop them from enjoying life when it’s the right moment.”\nA second source added that “Travis and Taylor have a lot in common and they are having a great time getting to know each other. They have similar values. She likes that he pursued her and it has been easy and exciting for both of them.”\n“Taylor is enjoying some time off from touring and it’s been fun hanging out with Travis during this break,” the source continued. “Taylor wants a guy that’s into his career, does his own thing, but is also supportive and understands her, and Travis fits those qualities.” \nLast of all, a source told People that Swift and Kelce’s romance is in the “super, super early days.” That source added of their future, “They’re just hanging out, and there’s no pressure.”\nSwift is seen arriving at the airport in Kansas City around 10:30 A.M. to fly back home. Daily Mail reported that security vehicles were seen parked on Kelce’s street on Sunday and Monday nights in a clear sign that the two stars spent some private time together post-game.\nMultiple sources speak to Us Weekly that day about Swift and Kelce’s relationship. Once again, they say it’s not serious.\nOne Us Weekly source said that Swift met Kelce through a mutual friend: “They have been on a few dates, and Taylor is smitten with him. It is not serious, and Taylor is having fun right now.”\n“[She’s] working hard right now and not looking for anything serious,” the source continued, citing her tour schedule and his NFL schedule as reasons why a more committed romance would be more difficult. “But anything is possible. They’re getting closer and closer every day.”\nKelce speaks on his podcast New Heights for the first and maybe last time about his relationship with Swift.\n“I know I brought all this attention to me, right?” Kelce started. “I did the whole friendship bracelet thing and told everyone how butt-hurt I was that I didn’t get to meet Taylor.”\nAt the same time, he has no any regrets. “You miss 100 percent of [the shots] you don’t take, baby, so yeah,” he said, then adding, “What’s real is it is my personal life, and I want to respect both of our lives. She’s not in the media as much as I am doing this show every single week and you know, having fun during the NFL season and on other guys’ shows like the McAfee Show, and any other show that I go on from here on out.”\n“I’m enjoying life, and I sure as hell enjoyed this weekend so everything moving forward, I think me talking about sports…will kind of have to be where I keep it,” he said.\n“I’m on the roller coaster, the roller coaster of life,” Kelce added of the experience dating Swift. “Yeah, I notice a few things [are different], like paparazzi outside my house.”\nKelce gave Swift two shout-outs on the program: “Shout-out to Taylor for pulling up [to the Chiefs game],” he said first. “That was pretty ballsy, that was pretty ballsy, yeah. I just thought it was awesome how everyone in the suite had nothing but great things about her, you know the friends and family. She looked amazing. Everybody was talking about her in a great light, and on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans, of course. We script it all, ladies and gentlemen. It was just impressive.”\nOf the game generally, he said, “It was definitely a game I’ll remember. That’s for damn sure. And then we just slid off in the getaway car at the end.”\nHis second shout-out to Swift was simple: “Shout-out to Taylor for coming through and seeing me rock the stage.” \nLater that day, TMZ runs the first photo of Swift and Kelce showing PDA from the post-game party.\nAfter rumors emerge that Swift could be attending Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs game against the New York Jets at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium, a source confirms it to Entertainment Tonight. “Taylor Swift is planning on attending the Jets game this Sunday,” the source said.\nA second source added, “The Jets haven’t been notified specifically about Taylor coming to Sunday’s game, but are prepared to welcome her if she decides to come. Patrick Mahomes booked a suite for his family and friends and Taylor could be joining that suite.”\nIn a separate report, a different source told Entertainment Tonight that Swift wasn’t initially expecting much from her and Kelce’s time together, but things are changing. “When Taylor and Travis first connected, Taylor was looking to have fun while enjoying some downtime,” the source said. “So far, it’s been a nice change of pace for her. Now, as things progress between Taylor and Travis, they’re both looking to keep it more private. They’re both excited about where things are headed.” \nThe Daily Mail reports that the couple has allegedly discussed doing a Halloween costume together and potentially attending Heidi Klum’s famous Halloween party, a celeb-packed event. The “insider” said they joked about dressing as Barbie and Ken. \nThat source gave more detail on their dynamic, claiming that “the whirlwind that this relationship has started is something that Taylor is familiar with, and Travis is okay with. He wants to get in as much time as possible with her before she embarks on her international tour.”\nAs rumored, Swift attends Kelce’s Sunday night game against the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium. She brings a pack of celeb friends including Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Sophie Turner, Hugh Jackman, and Sabrina Carpenter.\nSwift and Kelce aren’t photographed or filmed together during the game, truly keeping things more private. They left the stadium separately after the game. Page Six reported that Kelce was photographed leaving Swift’s apartment earlier in the day, although not because he spent the night Saturday. \nA source told Page Six that the two had a Sunday morning hangout, as Kelce adhered to his team’s 11 P.M. curfew on Saturday. He left Swift’s apartment around 11 A.M.\nAfter the game, Swift went to Zero Bond with her brother Austin Swift and his girlfriend Sydney Ness. Kelce was not photographed there with her.\nMultiple sources tell People that Swift and Kelce’s relationship is undefined.\n“[They’re] still just getting to know each other,” the first source said. “It’s nothing too serious.”\nA second source added that their relationship is casual and unlabeled: “He is a charming guy. It’s more of a hanging out situation than dating,” that source said. They added that while Kelce is spending time with Swift, “he’s focusing on football like he always has. During the NFL season, his priority is the Chiefs, and it’s all about the team.”\nSources speak to Us Weekly about Swift’s feelings for Kelce and how her approach to their romance is differing from hers with ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn. \n“Taylor has decided she’s not going to hide anymore,” one source said. “She’s going to be her authentic self and enjoy life.”\nKelce and Swift “talk every day,” the source added. “Taylor’s really enjoying getting to know Travis. They’re taking it day by day, but she has high hopes. She likes that he’s a normal, nice guy. He’s down-to-earth and isn’t affected by fame. She also thinks he’s hot.”\nA second source said Kelce feels similarly: “Travis is completely smitten.”\nA third source said, “Taylor is at a point in her life where she’s no longer willing to hold back. If something feels right—like it does with Travis—she’s jumping in with both feet. She’s very happy and loving life right now.”\nKelce, meanwhile, discusses how he wasn’t expecting his relationship with Swift to blow up the way it did during his appearance on Chasin’ It with Trey Wingo and Chase Daniel. “I had no idea, man,” he said. “I had no idea. You can’t tell me that anybody else did either, but I can’t be mad at how it’s all played out. I’ll say that.”\nSwift is seen leaving New York City the day before Kelce’s birthday, sparking rumors she may be traveling to spend the day with him. \nKelce, meanwhile, spoke about the attention his romance with Swift has gotten from the NFL during his New Heights podcast. “They’re overdoing it a little bit, for sure,” he said of their promotion. “Especially my situation [with Swift]. I think they’re just trying to have fun with it.”\nAfter Kelce’s remarks go viral, the NFL defends their social media approach. “We frequently change our bios and profile imagery based on what’s happening in and around our games, as well as culturally,” the organization tells People. “The Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce news has been a pop cultural moment we’ve leaned into in real time, as it’s an intersection of sport and entertainment, and we’ve seen an incredible amount of positivity around the sport.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "Taylor Swift Was Spotted Flying Out of NYC the Day Before Travis Kelce’s Birthday", "date": "2023-10-05 13:25:00", "text": "Travis Kelce turns 34 today, and Taylor Swift, his new love interest, may be spending the day with him. Multiple sources told Page Six that Swift was seen leaving New York City yesterday. They saw her luggage being loaded into a vehicle outside of her apartment that ultimately went to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey.\nA separate source told the outlet that Kelce is in Kansas City, Missouri this week and has no set plans for his birthday due to a “previous work commitment.” Swift has traveled to Kansas City before for Kelce, attending his game there two weeks ago. She stayed until Tuesday morning.\nWhile it isn’t yet confirmed that Swift traveled to see Kelce, she did wear his birth stone, opal, on September 8—potential proof that his birthday was on her mind then. Specifically, the necklace was Foundrae’s Forever & Always a Pair Pendant. Fans later connected the piece of jewelry to Kelce, as dating rumors between the pair started on September 12.\nUs Weekly reported earlier this week that Swift plans to be at Kelce’s games whenever she can and that she isn’t interested in hiding their relationship. The approach is a stark contrast to Swift’s last relationship, which ended in March. During her six years dating Joe Alwyn, the two were almost never seen out together as they embraced privacy.\n“Taylor is at a point in her life where she’s no longer willing to hold back,” one source said. “If something feels right—like it does with Travis—she’s jumping in with both feet. She’s very happy and loving life right now.”\n“Taylor has decided she’s not going to hide anymore,” a second source said. “She’s going to be her authentic self and enjoy life.” Kelce and Swift “talk every day. Taylor’s really enjoying getting to know Travis. They’re taking it day by day, but she has high hopes. She likes that he’s a normal, nice guy. He’s down-to-earth and isn’t affected by fame. She also thinks he’s hot.”\nAs for Kelce, a third source said, “Travis is completely smitten.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "Melissa Broder on Why Writing <i>Death Valley</i> ‘Almost Killed Me’", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe poet-turned-novelist talks death, the divine, and getting lost in the desert.\nWriting her latest novel almost killed Melissa Broder—or, anyway, that’s how it seemed when the Milk Fed and So Sad Today author realized she was lost during a solo hike at Death Valley National Park’s Zabriskie Point. The Los Angeles-based Broder had come to this trail to research what would eventually become her third novel, Death Valley. How she ended up lost in “the most touristy area” under the hot April sun with no cell reception, no water, and a bottle of Diet Coke, was thanks to both misdirection and tragedy. \nIn December 2020, Broder’s father was in a car accident, and his resulting injuries required a months-long stay in the intensive care unit. Living on the other side of the country and unable to visit him due to the hospital’s COVID precautions, Broder spent hours driving back and forth between her home in Los Angeles and her sister’s in Las Vegas, “trying to escape a feeling.” \n“I was driving through Baker, [California], which is approximately where the fictional town [in the novel] would be, and the first line of the novel came to me,” Broder says. (The book starts: “I pull into the desert town at sunset feeling empty.”) “I was like, ‘OK, this is it.’ I was working on another novel, and I put it down and started writing this.”\nThis epiphany led to her taking a “desert recon trip” to research Death Valley for her book, where she roamed astray around Zabriskie Point, panicked and cut-up from climbing rocks to find her way. Around 40 minutes after becoming lost, Broder found her way back to her car. “When I got out, I was like, ‘This is a gift.’” she said. “Now I know what’s going to happen in my novel.”\nIn Death Valley, a woman drives to a small desert town under the pretense of researching a book—though, underneath the guise of work, she’s running from feelings of emptiness and doom caused by a chronically ill husband and her injured father in the ICU. But when what’s supposed to be a casual hike turns perilous, the woman encounters a giant cactus, talking rocks, and a huge mustachioed oriole over the course of her multi-day fight for survival. Death Valley, even more than Broder’s past novels, makes powerful use of poetic diction and lyricism as the narrator works to orient herself—both in a physical and emotional sense—to the terrain, the new reality of her “probably dying” father, and the nearly decade-long constant of her sick husband.\nAfter six months in the ICU, and one month after her desert misadventure, Broder’s father died. Now, two and a half years later, Broder sat down with us to discuss why writing this novel felt like such an essential homage to him. \nMy father died over a year before I finished the book. When I finished the book, I had a new experience with grief because the book had been a real connection with him. The day that I sent it off to my agent, I was like, “Oh, he’s not coming back.” \nThere was a lot of similarity. The first few months he was in the ICU, we weren’t allowed to see him because of COVID. I didn’t want to make the book a COVID narrative, but I felt like the distance was really important, the separation and the FaceTime. Because when my father was in and out of consciousness, my sister and I would just talk to him on FaceTime. But there would be times when he didn’t want to talk to anyone. He was fighting for his life. And that was a new learning curve: to not take someone’s ill health personally, and that we have to let people die in their own way and that it isn’t personal.\nWith this book, and actually with a lot of my writing, I can’t not do it. Writing this book almost killed me, but also not writing it would have almost killed me. I just had to do it. It’s really like, cows make milk; writers write. It’s how I orient myself to the world. It’s how I exist and survive in the world. \nThere’s a big difference between writing and editing and publishing. The publishing is more challenging in terms of my perception of the reader. In my writing process, I just go. I try to dismantle any perfectionism and any voices, because otherwise I’ll never write about anything. Editing is when I start to think about clarity, lucidity. \nThe publishing is like closing your eyes and jumping into a pool. I can definitely feel, years after a book comes out, very invaded by something I put out in the world. Like, my 80-year-old Aunt Judy tells me she read So Sad Today and I feel invaded. But it’s like, I put it out there!\nWhat was fun about this book is that it’s totally a sendup of autofiction. Obviously there’s a lot of differences, but someone could read it and say, “Oh, the narrator is the author.” Then you start to get further and you’re like, “Um, did the author go into a magic cactus?” Probably no. That was really fun to do because people are always trying to figure out in novels, “Did this really happen?” Even when I was recording the audiobook, the audio engineer was like, “Is this a true story?”\nI don’t, intellectually, believe that you have to suffer to make art. And even for myself, in a theoretical sense. I would love nothing else more than not to suffer. There’s nothing I would love more, truly. And perhaps a lot of my suffering—and I address this in this book—is caused by a desire of wanting to be at peace. The human experience will have its ups and downs. The alchemy of writing is a way to bring in light and creativity and, in a way, a higher power—if a higher power is (and it is for me) a creative force and not a destructive force.\nWhen she has the vision of the bird, she’s so convinced that her father is dead. That’s a projection of her own experience, however mystical, however divine. I do have a relationship with signs and certainly with a higher power, but I believe that what we believe exists if we choose to believe that it exists. But we can’t project that on other people; faith only goes as far as ourselves. I think it was another lesson for her. Her interpretations and the way she perceived catastrophe were her own projection—it was something coming from herself. And that, to me, was really strong. \nMy father was very funny, very dry, very sarcastic. So a book that is my homage to him has to be funny. And I have to have a good time when I’m writing, especially prose, because it’s such a marathon.\nI feel the same way about incorporating humor as I do with sex scenes. When I write sex scenes, I have to turn myself on. If I don’t turn myself on, there’s no way I’m going to turn on the reader. It’s the same with humor in the sense of, you can feel when you read a book that the writer is having a good time writing it. And I think there’s something really beautiful about that. \nLife and death are also funny in their strangeness. It’s hilarious that we exist and it’s hilarious that we have to die. Both are really dark, but also really funny. \nI did a bunch, dictating, and then I scrapped the whole thing and started again. This was the first piece of prose that I’ve written by typing. I usually don’t edit that hard in my first few drafts—it’s mostly getting the clay out. But with this, because it was for my dad, I wanted it to be a diamond every step of the way. \nI realized dictation wouldn’t work; I edited this like I edit a poem, with the intensity and care. There’s a risk to editing on a sentence level that precisely early on, because, if the structure doesn’t work, a lot of those sentences are going to be thrown away. But I wanted whatever was on the page to be beautiful.\nThis conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nClaudia Guthrie is a freelance writer based in Denver.

{"title": "Inside the Sézane Tote Black Market", "date": "2023-10-05 13:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe free totes that come with each purchase from the French fashion brand have become so covetable there’s a burgeoning resale community.\nIn Paris, it’s nearly impossible to go within a one-mile radius without spotting a Sézane tote bag. The fashion brand, founded by Morgane Sézalory in 2013, is sort of like the French girl’s Madewell: ubiquitous, utilitarian, but undoubtedly trendy. Like French style, its wares are slightly more feminine—think: bows and florals and lady-like brocade sandals in colors like gold and rosy beige. Though Sézane began as an e-commerce enterprise, it has since expanded into brick-and-mortar locations, and each store is designed to feel like your chicest friend’s apartment on the Left Bank (not unlike Sézalory’s own home, recently profiled in Architectural Digest). Perhaps the most memorable part of a Sézane shopping experience is the free tote bag you get to carry your purchases in, which can instantly become as crucial a part of your style rotation as the clothes and accessories that fit inside it. \nFifteen years ago, when Sézalory was first starting the brand, she wanted to find a way to provide each shopper with a memento—a small token that felt unique. Eventually, she decided on a tote bag. A sustainable linen bag could replace the plastic bags used in French grocery stores at the time, while also serving as valuable real estate space for marketing. “I was thinking, okay, Paris is small, so if you have something that is very visual, and all the girls have it…if you don’t know the brand and you see someone wearing something very cool a few times in the same week, at some point you’re going to think: what is that? And then you look and you end up on the website,” Sézalory told ELLE.com. \nThe idea worked—and a decade and a half later, it’s still working. Sézane fans are unequivocally obsessed with these tote bags. They collect them Facebook groups, on Mercari and French classified ads website Leboncoin, with offers to sell, buy, and trade the free totes. These “Sézane Addicts,” or “Sézanettes,” as they call themselves, are more than 72K strong—and that’s just on Facebook. For limited-edition tote bags, especially those that are part of a special collab like the one the brand recently did with Farm Rio, users will offer cash or a trade to get their bag of choice. “Hello, I’m throwing a bottle to the sea: I fell in love with this tote bag Farm Rio collab but would like to buy it at a reasonable price (15 to 20 euros). If anyone wants to help me?” reads one recent post by a woman named Sandra. (Good luck to Sandra, as that tote, of which Sézane made limited runs, is selling on Vestiaire Collective for more than 135 euros.)\nIn fact, sites like Vestiaire Collective, Poshmark, The RealReal and Mercari are full of people hawking the free Sézane tote bags they got for upwards of 20, 30, even 100 euros. That Farm Rio bag that Sandra’s on the hunt for was the most expensive one we spotted, but others, like this banana-themed one, were selling for 87 euros, and this one—which I actually have two of and had no idea until now it was valuable!—is “on sale” on The RealReal for 92 Euros.\nKimberley Blanchot, one half of the sister duo behind the French-American PR agency August 28 Studio, is one such avid collector (and, full disclosure, a good friend). On a recent trip to her apartment in Neuilly, she opened a cupboard to reveal several shelves packed with dozens of neatly folded tote bags. Though there were ones from brands her firm reps and others she’d collected in New York, the Sézane pile was the most prolific: this woman, and I am not exaggerating, had 20 Sézane tote bags, and with each one she had a little excuse for keeping it: “This one’s great for the beach; I use this one a lot to carry my computer.”\n“I didn’t really set out to collect them, I was just an avid Sézane follower and got one every time I shopped there,” Blanchot said. “ I was living in New York at the time and the brand wasn’t international yet, so there was a bit of a cool factor—I liked that each collection gave life to a new design collab so just naturally started to accumulate them and now here we are.” \nBlanchot isn’t alone. “It started when I became a VIP customer, I received a tote bag as a gift, then during certain orders, I also received free tote bags, and little by little my collection grew,” said Tatiana, a 31-year-old pediatric nurse from Lille. “Today I have 25 tote bags. They are so beautiful and all different, and I continue my little tote bag hunt to unearth rare pearls.”\nAs the bags have grown in popularity, Sézane has begun partnering with others to package and advertise wares together. One recent summer collab featured the French issue of Vanity Fair packaged with a yellow and white striped beach tote; another advertised the gelato brand Amorino. \nThe fact that she started an ongoing Parisian-wide trend doesn’t seem to faze Sézalory, who says she spots the totes around Paris all the time but doesn’t “internalize it.” She recently had her third child, so her own collection of totes has been repurposed. “The quality of [the bags] is great,” Sézalory said. “I put my diapers in it—my Sézane tote is my baby bag.”\nJessica Roy is the former Digital Director of ELLE.com.

{"title": "Life as El Chapo’s Wife", "date": "2023-10-05 12:00:00", "text": "The real story of Emma Coronel Aispuro.\nEmma Coronel Aispuro looked straight into the camera as the sheriff’s deputy booked her into the Alexandria Sheriff’s Office in Virginia: shadows pooling across her full lips, dark circles ringing her eyes, and her dark hair, parted at the center, falling over her denim blue and green prison shirt. In the mug shot law enforcement dispatched to international media, announcing the capture of El Chapo’s wife, Emma looked as she felt: tired but resolute. \nHer Feb. 22, 2021, arrest was an anniversary of sorts: foreshadowed seven years before on the exact same day when Mexican marines escorted her husband in handcuffs, after having apprehended him in a Mazatlán apartment where they were staying with their twin daughters. Within days of her own arrest, media rumors would swirl that the 31-year-old was cooperating with federal agents. As she sat in her cell, she’d worry about her family back home and what the future might hold for her. Because she had known this day would come. The present had finally caught up to the hypothetical: She, too, was going down for her husband’s crimes.\nThe Casanova Cantina in Culiacán, a city in northwestern Mexico where Emma had moved after marrying one of the world’s most notorious drug lords on her 18th birthday, was packed. Hundreds of young people danced to blaring reggaetón, and the drinks were flowing. Servers carried flaming trays shaped like life-size flamingos and gigantic American Express cards, delivering bottles of champagne and drinks in brightly colored glasses. \nThe cantina was known for attracting buchonas, women with surgically enhanced curves. Tonight, there were murmurs that a niece of Joaquín Guzmán Loera—El Chapo himself, imprisoned for life en el otro lado (in the United States)—was there ahorita mismo. This very moment! Julio César Chávez Jr., the famous Mexican boxer married to the widow of Chapo’s assassinated son, roamed the crowded room.\nNearby, young women were deep in discussion about a hot topic in Culiacán: the impending sentencing of Emma Coronel Aispuro, due in a few days in a courthouse in Washington, D.C. Emma was a celebrity here. El Chapo had plucked her from a beauty pageant some 14 years before, when she was just 17, selecting her as his wife. As the leader of one of the world’s most prolific drug cartels, he could do that. Now, with Emma facing punishment for helping her husband and the cartel, everyone had an opinion.\n“Honestly, I don’t think it’s fair, because she isn’t directly involved,” Karla Castro said in Spanish of Emma’s incarceration. “We have to consider that she’s a mom, and, as his wife, remained silent about what her husband was doing.” \n“I believe that more than anything, she did it for her kids,” added Iskra Burgueño, another patron of the club. She was referring to Emma traveling to the United States earlier that year, where she was almost guaranteed to be arrested.\nThe women shook their heads, wondering aloud whether the brazo largo (“long arm”) of the U.S. government was reaching too far into their country under the guise of protecting American citizens from deadly narcotics.\nTo some, Emma was a victim of the cartel who had no choice but to do what she was told, including breaking the law. To others, she was a victim of overzealous U.S. prosecutors eager to make an example of her, likely knowing she couldn’t cut a deal with the U.S. government without worrying about the worst kinds of consequences from the cartel if she ever returned to her homeland. And to others still, she wasn’t a victim at all, but rather a grown woman who made it rich through her looks and contribution to an international drug syndicate.\n“Once you enter, how do you leave that world?” Castro said, first in Spanish, then in English. “It’s all she knows.”\n“It’s very difficult to leave that,” Burgueño said. “So, I believe that more than anything, she—”\n“She’s scared,” Castro interrupted.\n“I think she’s afraid of losing her family more than anything,” Burgueño said, nodding. \nAfter covering El Chapo’s trial for the New York Times, I traveled twice to Mexico, trying to make sense of his wife—and her life and marriage. Emma was arrested in February 2021 on drug trafficking charges, accused of passing communications between her husband and four of his sons to help her drug-lord husband escape from prison. She even knew of the plan to slip him a GPS device, with her youngest brother helping him escape through a tunnel. She chose to do these things. But considering she is a product of the machismo culture of the cartel, she arguably never had a choice.\nAnd yet, she never claimed victimization. She came from a culture in which women can become the most tragic kind of victim: one who doesn’t know she’s being used at all.\nEmma pleaded guilty to all three counts she was charged with, waiving her right to a trial, and was released from U.S. custody in Los Angeles County on September 13 of this year, after serving about two and a half years. (She will have four years of supervised release.) She did what she did willfully. But does a woman in her situation, married at 18 to a powerful killer three times her age, truly have a will to speak of? \nTucked into the folds of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains and rimmed in verdant green foliage, the town of Canelas glowed honey-lemon in the winter sunlight. A few weeks before the annual festival known as La Feria del Café y la Guayaba, named for the region’s beloved coffee and guava, Emma, then a girl of 17, was campaigning against four other girls to be crowned that year’s reina—the queen of the festival in a town of about 800 people.\nEmma’s was no ordinary family—her father, Inés Coronel Barreras, worked for the Sinaloa cartel, along with some other family members. Although the truth was that while her family was particularly enmeshed, in the area where she grew up, a cartel connection made them more ordinary than unusual.\nAround 20 small planes and helicopters flew in guests for a Three Kings Day dance in honor of Emma’s candidacy. The winding, mountainous streets were crawling with horses, motorcycles, Hummers, and other expensive cars carrying la gente más importante—from prominent traffickers to local politicians, including a member of the Federal Police—into the small pueblo. One plane carried a man whose reputation and deadly reign as a leader of the Sinaloa cartel had made him one of the most wanted men in the world, and years later would prompt the U.S. State Department to offer a bounty of up to $5 million for his capture: Joaquín Guzmán Loera, better known as El Chapo. Another carried Ignacio “Nacho” Coronel Villareal, a powerful cartel leader who oversaw its meth business. \nEmma was dating a local boy from the ranch—her first boyfriend. But she was “very serious, very centered, not much of a dating type,” her cousin, Alfonso López, who lived near Emma’s family for much of their childhood, recalled in a November 2021 WhatsApp interview from his jail cell in the neighboring state of Sinaloa, where he was serving a sentence for illegally importing military weapons.\nEmma knew Chapo the way any teenager might “know” someone famous. She had first caught his eye when they were introduced at a local dance in 2006, and she was aware of his wealth, his flashy, abundant lifestyle, his notoriety among drug lords. (Emma was 11 the first time he broke out of jail, in a laundry cart from one of Mexico’s most secure prisons.) Chapo was also a homeland hero, running a cartel many felt better supported the people and their public safety than the government itself. This was especially true in a town like Canelas, where girls and their families were often anxious for them to marry into financial security and safety. \nChapo—who, according to allegations that he raped girls as young as 13 and called young girls his “vitamins” because they gave him “life”—wanted Emma. As the Three Kings Day dance got underway, he ordered the band to sing one of his favorite songs, “Cruzando Cerros y Arroyos” (“Crossing Hills and Streams”). “You are a flower and you are beautiful,” the singers crooned. “You are a perfumed rose and you were born for me.” When they finished, Chapo ordered it sung again. And again.\nHe and Emma talked for half an hour. Before leaving, Chapo gave Emma’s father a Chevy Cheyenne 4x4 and a Mercedes-Benz topped with a huge bow for Emma. In the mountains, where it’s still customary for families to be paid for their daughter’s hand, a kind of reverse dowry, Emma was now—quite suddenly—the drug lord’s intended wife.\nTwo days later, 150 members of the 72nd Infantry Battalion descended on the area, searching for Chapo, having received intelligence that he was nearby. According to a local paper, over the next several weeks they stood guard over two airstrips and set up checkpoints on the road in between. But the battalion left just days before the feria—in time for Chapo to wend his way back to Canelas, and to Emma’s side.\nA community newspaper article noted that Emma had enjoyed a “great morbid popularity” in the days leading up to the Valentine’s Day election for queen. The competition was steep, Alfonso recalled. Acknowledging the other “very pretty candidates,” he said he suspected Chapo paid people off to vote for her.  \nAmong the honored guests on the day of the election was Chapo, who hired three bands to serenade Emma. Each opened with the same song, one after the other. “Señor Chapo paid a lot of money to make it a grand event,” Alfonso said. That feria was far grander, he believes, than any before or since.\nEmma won the competition with exactly half of the 800 votes and was later crowned queen in a silky yellow dress, her hair in ringlets, her kohled eyes wide. \nOn July 2—her 18th birthday—she was married to Chapo, in what she described as a simple ceremony at her childhood home, surrounded by family and close friends, chickens clucking in the background. Emma wore a diamond-encrusted wedding dress, Chapo a black suit. For the next three days, bands and parties filled the streets of Canelas, ringed by la guardia, uniformed cartel members carrying automatic weapons.\nThe newlyweds escaped to the hill town of El Carrizo and a simple one-story wedding home: yellow with a terra-cotta roof, slender columns reaching up to wooden planks, a bare bulb hanging from the ceiling. Inside, Chapo and his teen bride waited out the authorities. Through the window there was a panoramic view of Canelas and the surrounding towns tumbled along the lonesome horizon. Alone with one of the most wanted men in the world, Emma was very much his—and only his.\nAfter the wedding, Chapo moved Emma to a home in Culiacán, the cartel headquarters, population then around 630,000. She had grown up in a place even smaller than Canelas—La Angostura, with just a few dozen inhabitants—in the northwest state of Durango. Culiacán was a shock.\nEmma was often alone while Chapo helped run the cartel—and, it was widely known, he was often with other women. She was just one in a never-ending conveyor belt of beautiful girls, with marriages that seemingly ran one into the next without the punctuation or officiality of divorce. Another of Chapo’s wives, Griselda López Pérez—who was nearly three times Emma’s age—still lived in Culiacán.\nIn those early years of her marriage, Emma began to change. Not in her demeanor, repeatedly described by family and residents of northwestern Mexico as simple and nice. But as her husband accumulated mistresses, the slight young girl shape-shifted into the full-bodied, tightly clad woman of her husband’s desires. \nEvery time her cousin saw her, she was more transformed. Cosmetic surgeries are typical in the region, with women often remolding their faces and enlarging their breasts and butts. \nThen, when she was 21, Emma’s body changed in an entirely different way: She became pregnant. With twin girls.\nAs Chapo’s wife, Emma always felt safe. Untouchable. But her marriage to him assured protection only so long as he was still alive, a matter of whim in the narco world of shifting power dynamics. With Chapo still in power, she felt she and their children would be safe from the violence of the drug world. But if and, inevitably, when something happened to him, she feared she would be left unprotected. Emma wanted to give her future children at least a chance at some measure of lifelong safety. \nEmma was born near San Francisco, a dual American and Mexican citizen, with all the benefits and privileges American citizenship carried. And so, according to a 2011 Los Angeles Times article, nearing her due date and without her husband, Emma crossed the border into Southern California in July of that year, U.S. federal agents reportedly tracking her every move. Around a month later, she gave birth to daughters, born one minute apart at Antelope Valley Hospital in Los Angeles County: American citizens. Following her husband’s strict instructions, on their birth certificates Emma left blank the space for their father’s name, bestowing on them instead her own last name.\nBut she preserved their full parentage in their first names: Emali and Maria Joaquína. One for each parent. \nIt was a lonely time. “Are you going to chat with me all day long or will you be busy?” Emma texted her husband just months after giving birth and preparing for a postpartum surgery. When the twins were six months old, Chapo narrowly escaped capture at a mansion in Los Cabos, Mexico. He and his secretary had escaped over a fence, cutting themselves on some nearby shrubbery. He told his wife about the arrests of two associates, but left out the third arrest of another mistress, Agustina Cabanillas Acosta. “A bit scratched up but fine, thank God,” he texted Emma—relaying a similar message to another mistress, Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López, who would later win a seat in the local legislature. \nIn Mazatlán, Sinaloa, the entrance to the Miramar, a lemon-yellow seaside apartment complex, was guarded by a single employee. Above him were 11 stories, the balcony of each apartment etched with a single eye, eerily glinting at the soft, rolling waves of the Pacific.\nChapo, wearing sunglasses and slumped in a wheelchair—and just out of view of video cameras—wheeled through the residence in the darkness. Soon after, Emma slipped by the infinity pool and up to the fourth floor. Her twins and several attendants, whom a maintenance worker later told me had lived in the building without the parents on and off for months, were also in tow. Rounding a secluded corner by the staircase, she pushed open the paneled door of apartment 401 and joined her husband.\nIn the early morning hours, the couple jolted awake to the sound of Mexican and American law enforcement barreling through their front door and charging past the sleeping two-year-olds, guns drawn. \nThis moment, Emma had always known, was inevitable. Chapo grabbed a Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle from his bedside table, leapt into the bathroom, and crouched inside, according to Alan Feuer, author of El Jefe: The Stalking of Chapo Guzmán.\n“Don’t kill him!” Emma screamed as law-enforcement authorities swarmed the couple’s bedroom. She glanced at the bathroom where her husband—her lifeline—was hiding.\n“Please, don’t kill him!”\nWith his wife pleading from the bed and their daughters nearby, Chapo surrendered without fire. “Calm down, I’m here,” Emma recalled her husband saying in an interview with the L.A. Times. Emma knew—she had to know—in that moment that this was the beginning of the unraveling. Both her father and oldest brother had been arrested less than a year before. Many of the men in her life—the very men who had pulled her into this world—were leaving her. \nChapo was incarcerated at Altiplano, a maximum-security prison. At least two women visited him there: Emma and Lucero (by now an elected official, visiting the prison using a fake ID). Both women also met—separately—with Dámaso López Nuñez, a lieutenant in the Sinaloa cartel who had worked in the first prison Chapo escaped from when Emma was a child, and who was helping plan his boss’s second escape. Emma had meetings with López Nuñez and Chapo’s sons to disseminate Chapo’s orders as he masterminded the getaway, López Nuñez said later, including the plan to slip him a GPS device disguised as a food item, establishing the coordinates of the kingpin’s cell and the tunnel to be dug beneath it.\nChapo’s detainment was relatively short-lived. Just 504 days after his arrest, he dropped down a hole in his cell shower to a waiting makeshift motorcycle railcar, which he rode through a nearly mile-long tunnel dug under the prison to a warehouse. The escape plan had taken more than a year and approximately $1 million to execute. \nEmma’s youngest brother, Édgar, a teenager, was allegedly waiting there in the tunnel to accompany his famous brother-in-law. Within hours, Chapo was taken to a clandestine airstrip, where he boarded a plane, and disappeared into the mountains. But he would spend that New Year’s Eve not with Emma but Lucero, celebrating the start of 2016 together.\nJust eight days later, Chapo was captured yet again by Mexican authorities and extradited to New York, on six separate indictments filed in states across the country, including running a drug cartel and conspiring to push narcotics across the border. The charges carried a sentence greater even than his own life.\nInside Brooklyn federal court on Jan. 17, 2019, a guest star took the stand: Lucero Guadalupe Sánchez López. Dressed in a drab blue prison uniform, the only female cooperating witness to testify against the drug kingpin, Lucero had pleaded guilty to her part in his narco-trafficking conspiracy just months prior.\nFor all the world to hear, she referred to Chapo as “my husband, Joaquín.” The prosecution asked her to detail a years-long romance with the drug lord, which had started in the early days of Emma’s pregnancy. \nIn a narco world in which power is measured in part by the number of girlfriends belonging to a capo, a loyal husband was more than Emma could have hoped for. But having his brazen infidelity internationally publicized must have felt humiliating.\nSeated on a courtroom bench, separated by a divider from her husband, Emma, dressed in a black jacket over a white collared shirt, struggled to maintain her usual stoicism. Lucero spoke in Spanish, and Emma removed her translator headset, listening directly to the woman with whom she’d been sharing her husband.\nThe same age as Emma, with long, dark hair and almond eyes, Lucero, who grew up in a small Sinaloan town, had similar features and a similar background. But when she met Chapo at age 21, she was—unlike Emma—not burdened by the physical and emotional demands of pregnancy. Over two days of testimony that winter, Lucero detailed how she’d run Chapo’s money-laundering operations and overseen drug shipments secreted away on airplanes.\nWhen Anthony Nardozzi, a prosecutor in El Chapo’s case, asked Lucero about the nature of her relationship to the kingpin, she answered: “Well, up until today I’m still confused, because I thought our relationship—we were romantically involved as partners.” Emma bit her thumb.\nAnd in a 2018 televised interview on Telemundo, Emma wondered aloud whether the media “think I’m not human or something,” given the way she felt the media objectified her. “I’m made of meat and bones.”\nThe day after Lucero began testifying, Emma took steps to more permanently secure her place in her husband’s narrative. She had a company registered: El Chapo Guzman JGL, LLC, the rights of which were placed in her name to start a clothing line.\nWhen Emma returned to court for Lucero’s remaining testimony the following week, she and her husband dramatically appeared wearing matching maroon velvet jackets. Lucero, who’d broken down in guttural sobs while testifying, concluded her time on the stand facing a twinning couple. \nWhen Lucero finished, Emma paid an artist more than $1,600 for an exclusively drawn pastel rendering of her and her husband in their matching jackets. Per her explicit instructions, the other woman, in prison garb, was not included. \nPulling off the mountain road, the SUV slashed down a dusty embankment to a white stone-filled creek and into the secluded town of La Angostura. Farther in, past a grove of grapefruit and lemon trees and tucked under the boughs of a towering orange tree, sat a pale yellow, one-story home roofed in terra-cotta.\nThe car pulled to a stop. A man with a gray mustache, white sombrero, and purple-trimmed hoodie slid from the passenger’s side, a puff of sandy dirt clouding his black loafers. This was Victorio Aredo Coronel, a nephew of Emma’s father. Victorio’s son, Gerardo Raudel Hernández Carrasco, popped out the back.\nOn the front porch, several children watched a flat-screen television, the din of a soccer game punctuated by the crowing shrieks of roosters waddling about the front yard.\nClaudia Coronel, in her mid-twenties with a soft voice and long, dark hair, emerged from the house to greet her relatives. A long-ago portrait of her elder sister, Emma, smiled down at them from the porch: dark hooded eyes and plucked brows, with Emma wearing jeans and a mustard tube top, a cross necklace dangling from her neck.\nI’d talked to Emma about going to her childhood home even before her husband’s trial ended. While everyone else in court studied her husband’s every move, I watched Emma, a woman about my age and yet so different. I wanted to better understand her life before her husband. \nNo one will hurt you here: You’re safe, I was told when I arrived in Canelas. About 200 masked men with assault rifles ringed the town’s perimeter—la guardia, serving as guards for the annual coffee and guava festival.  \nNow, outside Emma’s childhood home, where she’d lived until her marriage, Claudia greeted me with a kiss on the cheek: “I follow you on Instagram,” she said, smiling.\nBlanca Estela Aispuro Aispuro—mother to four, including Emma and Claudia—stayed in the kitchen, preparing lunch. \nThe family gathered in a room adjoining the kitchen, a tower of warm flour tortillas mounting through lunch, the fresh piled atop the cooling on an embroidered place mat. Passing a platter of fried bistec and spooning crumbly cotija cheese onto their plates, Emma’s family exchanged news from the recent feria and the crowning of this year’s queen.\nBlanca asked about the festival’s official reina: Was she pretty?\nFrom the other side of the table, Victorio nodded emphatically: Of course! The queen is always pretty, he said.\nGerardo hurried past photographs on his phone, stopping on one of the contestants in an aqua dress, gold-lettered sash, and soaring rhinestone tiara. \nBlanca hunched over the phone, considering. Then, after a while: “My queen is prettier,” she said with a teasing smile.\nWith Chapo’s lifelong incarceration all but certain, Emma, for the first time as an adult, had to think about what her family’s life would look like without him. She made a guest appearance on VH1’s Cartel Crew in November 2019. She created an Instagram account, @therealemmacoronel. On it, she rarely mentioned her husband, instead documenting her own exploration of New York. She also continued experimenting with her hair: golden highlights for Mother’s Day 2020 and on her 31st birthday. By December, she had gone bleached blonde. Her hairstylist said later in an interview at his salon in Culiacán that Emma wanted to “cambiar el look”—change her look. She even posed in a fashion campaign for his salon, wearing a white lace wedding dress, rhinestones scattered down the pleats, a floral hair clip tucked into her long blonde locks.\nIn February 2021, just a few months later, she returned to the salon one last time, had her hair dyed back to its original color, and boarded a plane to Virginia for what one of her lawyers called a business trip. \nShe was arrested at the airport.\nEmma was charged with participating in a conspiracy led by her husband to import cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and marijuana into the United States. The complaint against Emma also noted that she had aided and abetted his now-infamous break from the high-security prison in Mexico via the tunnel—likely a crime in Mexico, but not among the charges she faced in the U.S.\nThe conspiracy charge—a legal maneuver that can snag mobsters not easily caught in actual trafficking deals without requiring that they commit the offense themselves—is a wonderfully complicated legal construction. In Emma’s case, conspiring to import drugs was as inconsequential as passing text messages between her husband and father without ever actually touching drugs themselves. In open court, even the main prosecutor on her case called her a mere “cog in a very large wheel of a powerful criminal organization” whose “primary significance on a criminal level” was her “proximity” to her husband.\nFor the next 14 days, Emma was kept under strict COVID-19 protocols in a quarantine unit. When her period started shortly after her arrest, guards provided her with only two sanitary napkins for the next four days. She went just as long without a shower, the word becoming one of the first she learned in English, spelled out letter by letter by her Spanish-speaking lawyer so that Emma could repeat the request to guards in the hope of eventually getting one. In March of that same year, Emma was moved to solitary confinement. \nSnow flurries flitted against a slate-colored sky in Washington, DC. Inside a district courthouse on Constitution Avenue, a bomb-detection dog sniffed the courtroom. “Everything’s good,” the guard declared. Just after noon, flanked by U.S. marshals, Emma, who had been in U.S. custody for nine months, strode in, dressed in a fitted gold-buttoned black pantsuit and heels.\nAppearing solemn behind her black mask, Emma took a seat at a table split by pandemic partitions and swiveled to face Judge Rudolph Contreras. When the judge invited her to speak, Emma adjusted the podium microphone and glanced at her approximately three-and-a-half-minute speech. “I know that you may find it difficult to ignore the fact that I am the wife of Joaquín Guzmán,” she said in Spanish, her voice softly strained. “And for perhaps—” \nThe translator cut her off. Emma sighed and paused, continuing after her words were put into English for the judge: “For this reason, you feel that there is a need for you to be harder on me. But I pray that you not do that.” She told the judge that her daughters, then 10 years old, were “the most important reason why I’m here before you,” adding she hoped to lead by example in encouraging them to own their mistakes: “I accept the mistakes that I have made and I am sorry for them.” \nHer voice cracked as she noted the pain she had put her family through. Her daughters might never have their father, she said, but “I beg you, please do not allow them to grow up without the presence of their mother.” \nAcknowledging the government’s higher sentencing guidelines for the crimes she committed, Judge Contreras, instead, described Emma’s involvement in Chapo’s operation as paling in comparison to that of other Sinaloa cartel members who had passed through his court, and sentenced her to three years behind bars with time served, and the forfeiture of $1.5 million. “Good luck to you,” he said. “I hope that you raise your twins in a different environment than the one that you’ve experienced.”\nFulfilling her sentence in a federal prison in Texas, Emma was transferred to Los Angeles County over the summer and then released. She’s 34—half a lifetime since first meeting El Chapo at that dance, when she caught the eye of a killer and the whole course of her life seemed preordained. \nReturning to her family in Mexico is almost out of the question. In a life with few choices, it turned out she may have made one that would ultimately matter most: seemingly turning a prison sentence into an escape route. \nAnd as Emma walked out of the courtroom on the afternoon of her sentencing, the end of one life promising the start of another, she turned briefly back to her supporters sitting in the audience—and winked.\n“I hope for many good and beautiful things in my life,” Emma would tell me later in her only interview since getting out of prison. She was feeling excited to be with her daughters again, and enjoying “quality moments,” like when her family cooked steak for her upon her release. She said she was focused on her career plans, which are still evolving. “I still can’t say the plans, because then later they won’t come to be,” she added with a laugh. “But many and beautiful.”\nCredits: Emma Coronel Aispuro; lead image: Todd Heisler/Redux.\nEmily Palmer is an investigative reporter, covering courts and crime.

A source told Us Weekly that Swift “instinctively wanted to reach out” to Turner when she heard news of her and Jonas’ split. \nTurner and Jonas are keeping their daughters in New York City as they work through their child custody case. Swift’s home is now Turner’s for the duration of the process. The singer is “letting Sophie stay there as long as she needs and is supporting her however she can,” the source said.\nIn a separate story, a source told Us Weekly that “Sophie is free to stay at Taylor’s investment property in NY until the custody case with Joe [Jonas] has been finalized.”\nWhile Swift herself dated Jonas for a few months when she was 18, she is very much respecting boundaries now. Her priority is being there for Turner. \n“[She] doesn’t know all the details [of the divorce] because she doesn’t feel like it’s her place,” a source said on September 29. “All she is concerned with is being there to support her friend.”\nTurner and Jonas started mediation today for their custody case; it is slated to continue for four days. A source told People on September 28 that Turner “is doing okay.” The source added, “Taylor has opened her home to Sophie. Sophie is welcome there any time. Taylor continues to be a great friend.”\nWhile Turner hasn’t spoken about her friendship with Swift, the two have been photographed out together frequently.

{"title": "Zaya Wade Is Showing the World Who She Is", "date": "2023-10-04 20:46:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nA conversation with Miu Miu’s biggest muse during Paris Fashion Week.\nZaya Wade is finally old enough to get her driver’s license, but she’s been a driving force in the fashion industry for some time now.  The 16-year-old daughter of former NBA player Dwayne Wade and stepdaughter of actress Gabrielle Union has already walked runways, sat front row at fashion week, and posed on red carpets. “I’m having so much fun with fashion,” she tells ELLE.com.  \nSince coming out as transgender in 2020, Wade says she has discovered the special—and uniquely affirming—type of joy that comes with expressing yourself through what you wear. “It’s a way to show the world that all the negativity isn’t going to bring me down,” she explains. “To me, it’s about showing the world and myself that I’m just me. I’m still who I am and who I continue to want to be.” \nAt Paris Fashion Week, Wade took in Miuccia Prada’s highly-anticipated spring 2024 collection wearing the brand’s leather harness biker boots, leather handbag, and a golden faux fur coat. After the show—and before heading out to the Miu Miu dinner party exclusively for editors, celebs, models, and stylists—we caught up with Wade to talk about her foray into fashion.\nELLE: Tell me about getting ready for the Miu Miu show.\nZaya Wade: Well, in all honesty, I was a little nervous. I woke up very early this morning at 5 A.M., and couldn’t go back to bed. But it was the good kind of nervous. Then, I ate some breakfast. Glam came over round 11 A.M. It was really fun. It was low-key, but, you know, we wanted to slay, of course.\nELLE: Of course! What inspired your glam look? \nZW: For the most part, I like to keep it very like clean, just neutral. But today, for the lip, we really wanted to do a lip line and go more bold with it. I wanted to bring some extra spice to the outfit, but there wasn’t a particular or specific inspiration—just the energy that we decided to bring.\nELLE: Let’s talk about the outfit. How did you decide on what to wear? \nZW: So it was very layered, all stuff from the new Miu Miu collection. Well, not the new collection, but you know, from the most recent collection. I had this faux fur coat, it was so chic and very warm. I wore these mid-calf boots. Oh my God, they are to die for. I’m like, can I keep them? \nELLE: I’m manifesting that for you. \nZW: Thanks! Then we filmed a lot of content [for social media], and by 12:30 P.M. we were on our way to the show. It’s been a day, a good day though. \nELLE: You’ve said in the past that fashion is a really important part of expressing yourself and expressing your identity.\nZW: Yes, growing up, my parents were both really, really fashionable. They always went out in some look, and I think that started it for me. It was so inspiring, because I feel like I am able to channel a lot of their energy and personality through clothes. Fashion is one of the most successful ways for me to express myself. I really wanted to get into the fashion world, because I’m not much of a painter. I was like, art is not for me—but what I can do to express myself is wear a great outfit. I decided to get into this world and I’ve been growing and learning and experimenting and trying to express myself every day through my clothing.\nELLE: And what have you learned so far?\nZW: I feel like the biggest thing I’ve learned about the fashion industry so far is that there’s a lot more to it. Every single day I learn something new, but it’s so fun. I think a lot of people have preconceived notions about fashion and modeling, but at least to me it’s really fun. I mean, I get to go to Paris. Like, I’m here in Paris. I feel like everyone’s like, “Oh, modeling, you’re just walking down the runway.” But it’s so much more than that. It’s an entire world. I still have so much to learn.\nELLE: What have you learned about yourself since getting into the fashion industry? \nZW: My confidence has grown. I’ve stepped into myself, especially starting out. I obviously came out as trans, and it was a very confusing time. I didn’t know everything about myself, but having that expression through clothing allowed me to come into my own. It gave me a level of confidence that I have needed and will probably need forever. It gave me the confidence to thrive.\nELLE: Do you think fashion can be used as a tool for communication? \nZW: I always like to say that for me fashion is a form of expression. It’s a way to show the world that all the negativity isn’t going to bring me down. To me, it’s about showing the world and myself that I’m just me. I’m still who I am and who I continue to want to be.\nELLE: And who is that? \nZW: I’m a lot of things. A really big part of me is my love for education and my strive to better the world in different ways. Obviously a big part of my life as a trans person is to be impactful in my community. I continue to take the question of “who am I?” and foster it and grow and, you know, evolve. Every day I ask myself, “Who am I?” And, like, how can I continue to move forward and better answer that question every single day?\nELLE: Speaking of evolvement and growth...in what ways do you think the fashion industry can continue to grow? \nZW: Fashion has grown so much, and we’ve obviously come so far. I would say most notably when it comes to gender fluidity and perceptions of sexuality and all these forms of expression, fashion is heading in the right direction. For too long, there was a very limited stance on what was worn and what was presented. Now, we’re breaking through that barrier and it’s [moving in the right direction]. \nELLE: Which designers do you think are putting in the work to move the needle? \nZW: There’s a world of brands out there doing great things, but Miu Miu really speaks to the image that I’d like to present to the world. Miu Miu is the moment. \nELLE: Miu Miu is definitely the moment. What’s the best piece of fashion advice you’ve gotten?\nZW: It hasn’t been a singular lesson. It’s more about how I carry myself with the clothes that I wear and less about the literal clothes that I wear. Because I think a lot of outfits can be pulled off with just attitude. My stepmom [Gabrielle Union] has given me that conversation about what confidence can do for you and how the clothes that you wear can help you get there. I think about that and embody that every time I put on an outfit. \nELLE: What outfit makes you feel the most like yourself?\nZW: It’s kind of a mix. It really depends on the mood that I’m in, or what I’m feeling. Sometimes I’m here in sweatpants and a baggy sweatshirt and I’m in my bed doing my homework and I’m like, this is me, like, this is who I want to show up as. Other days I am here in Paris wearing Miu Miu, and I’m like, this is who I want to show up as and this is how I’m feeling. I don’t think there’s ever really one answer to what makes me feel most myself.  \nThis conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. \nRose is a Senior Editor at ELLE overseeing features and projects about women's issues.

{"title": "Ariana DeBose Lived Her French Fantasy at Paris Fashion Week", "date": "2023-10-04 20:07:00", "text": "Paris may conjure up images of the Eiffel Tower, people-watching at cafés, and no-holds-barred shopping sprees on the Champs-Élysées. For Ariana DeBose, leaning into her French fantasy means waking up early and “wandering around a bit aimlessly while listening to Édith Piaf.” And that’s exactly what she did before her pre-show prep for Chanel’s spring/summer 2024 show at the Grand Palais Éphémère yesterday.\n“I love that you can basically walk into any restaurant in Paris and have amazing food,” she adds. “Truly. It feels like there’s this incredible standard that comes with French cuisine and yet the environment can feel so casual and full of joie de vivre.” The same can be said of French style. Case in point: DeBose’s look, a color story of gold, black, and maroon—specifically, a hooded shawl, a going-out top layered under a vest, and pants with metallic detail and an elastic waist (ideal for decadent meals).\n“Chanel really came into my consciousness in 2004 with Baz Luhrmann’s No.5 the Film featuring Nicole Kidman. I was 13. I had been fascinated by Moulin Rouge, so that collaboration drew me in and began a love affair with the romanticism that exists across the brand.” Apart from attending the show, largely considered the top billing of Paris Fashion Week, what else is on DeBose’s bucket list in the capital city? “Visiting the salt marshes of Île de Ré, going to Gabrielle Chanel’s apartment on Rue Cambon, and having a martini at Bar Hemingway inside the Ritz. “Ernest was a great writer,” she says. \nBelow, DeBose takes ELLE.com along as she gets ready for Chanel’s spring/summer 2024 show:\nClaire Stern is the Digital Director of ELLE.com.

{"title": "Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater Are Reportedly Living Together ‘Full-Time’ in NYC", "date": "2023-10-04 19:24:00", "text": "Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater’s relationship has become more serious. Nearly one month after Daily Mail first reported that Grande and Slater were living together, a source told Us Weekly that it’s true. \n“Ethan informed his friends and soon-to-be ex-wife [Lilly Jay] that he’s living with Ariana full-time in New York,” the source said. “They’re really happy and really good for each other. All of her friends love him.” That source didn’t specify when the private couple moved in.\nIn Daily Mail’s initial September 12 report, a source close to the situation claimed: “Ariana is living with a married man right now while she is still married [to Dalton Gomez, from whom Grande filed for divorce on September 18]. It seems as if Ariana is holding onto Dalton in case things with Ethan don’t work. It is just so strange that she is living with Ethan and has not filed documents to end it with Dalton.”\nGomez filed for divorce immediately after Grande on the 18th. Sources told TMZ that Grande and Gomez worked everything out before they filed, and Grande will “cut Dalton a check, and that will be that.”\nGrande and Slater were first seen together in Disney World days later on September 22. They were with family and friends, including Grande’s mom and brother, and had a private tour guide take them around the Orlando theme park.\nNeither Grande nor Slater have commented on their romance or posted about it on their social media. The couple met while working on the movie musical Wicked and were friends before they dated.\nBoth are currently in the process of divorcing their previous partners, Jay and Gomez. Sources stressed that they did not start seeing each other romantically until after they were separated from their spouses. \nA source additionally told People in early September, “They are doing their best to balance the fact that they are in the public eye with the desire to be respectful to all parties involved.”\nJay is the only one of the four to say anything publicly. She told Page Six in late July: “[Ariana’s] the story really. Not a girl’s girl.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nSelena Gomez is doing great, but it was a journey to get there. Gomez spoke to Vogue and People recently about how she feels at 31 after navigating her bipolar diagnosis in 2018, physical and mental health struggles, and of course, fame throughout her childhood, teens, and 20s. \nGomez has been giving interviews this week following news that on October 10, Sephora will be donating 100 percent of all Rare Beauty sales to her makeup brand’s Rare Impact Fund, which supports mental heath organizations. \nGomez told People that she is a fan of her 30s. “I have to say, turning 30 was a good moment for me. I’m 31 now, and I actually truly feel like the older I’ve gotten, the more I’ve really appreciated the struggles that I’ve had,” she said. “And I don’t necessarily feel like I’m held back by anything. I just feel like I’ve been honest with the world, I’ve been honest with myself, I’ve called myself out, and I just want to be the best version of myself.”\nIt took time for Gomez to get to the good headspace she is in now. “I know it seems easy [to look confident], but I promise you it’s been years of constant back and forth in my head, and now I’m just really happy, and I guess it’s showing, which I’m really honored.”\nGomez shared similar comments to Vogue, saying, “I don’t feel good all the time.” But spending time with her 10-year-old sister Gracie Elliott does help: “She reminds me of a perspective in life that can be a bit simpler and pure. Even just having a moment with her makes me feel better.”\nWith friends and new people in her life, Gomez is more discerning now too: “I can gauge the difference between someone who wants to actually get to know me versus someone who just wants to know me as a person. I’m grateful that I can tell.”\nShop Rare Beauty products on Sephora here on October 10.\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe latest cool-girl accoutrement is fresh off the field: the high-fashion sports jersey. \nStyle Points is a weekly column about how fashion intersects with the wider world.\nPop culture feels a lot like high school homecoming these days, especially with Taylor Swift turning two Kansas City Chiefs games into celebrity moments (and fashion moments, complete with a cherry-red team jacket). Not to mention helping drive a nearly 400 percent spike in Travis Kelce jersey sales. And fashion isn’t far behind, with sports jerseys proliferating on both the runways and the street style runways outside of them. \nWhy is the jersey everywhere these days? Perhaps it’s because standard athleisure has started to feel a little stale, leaving room for fashion to pass the spirit stick to actual sportswear. You can also credit the growing fashion footprint of everything from soccer to Formula 1 racing, the fashion-ification of pastimes from tennis to golf and skiing, or our collective anticipation for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. Throwing on a jersey has never been more au courant, not to mention a way to signal that you’re in the know. And like a suit with sneakers, or a blazer with a sports bra, it adds some jock inspiration to a look without tipping into full tailgate territory. \nKim Kardashian has been spotted in soccer jerseys that are equal parts blokecore and Europecore, including a ’90s A.S. Roma uniform and a Paris-Saint Germain style from the 2000s, both of which reportedly caused spikes in interest for the styles. Addison Rae has repped Brazil’s soccer team in bright yellow silk, while Hailey Bieber recently wore an oversized Dime jersey as a dress. For a recent Dolphins game, Alix Earle cut the front of her jersey in half, spurring countless TikTok imitators to do the same. Julia Fox has sported a Yankees shirt and a sheer jersey from Willy Chavarria emblazoned with the word “CATECHISM” (and paired, naturally, with matching pants that say “SPORTS”). And, of course, Rihanna has been a longtime practitioner of the high-fashion jersey look, wearing a variety of takes over the years.\nThe NFL announcers presuming that Swift and her fan base might not know the rules of the game would do well to realize that there are plenty of young female fans out there, (including Swift herself, who’s rocked her Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt before).\nAnd those fans seemingly included New York Fashion Week attendees, who paired their team colors with more high-end pieces and accessories for a look that says sure, I’m a fashion person, but I don’t take myself too seriously. Koché, Martine Rose, and Off-White were among the designers incorporating jerseys into their shows for spring 2024. And not far afield from their runways, at Paris’ Musée Des arts Décoratifs, you can see the ultimate grail on view as part of the exhibit “Mode et Sport”: Zinedine Zidane’s game-winning jersey, immortalized in a glass frame. \nVéronique Hyland is ELLE’s Fashion Features Director and the author of the book Dress Code, which was selected as one of The New Yorker's Best Books of the Year.

{"title": "24 Fashion Trends From the 2000s That Aged Surprisingly Well", "date": "2023-10-04 18:24:00", "text": "How celebs stayed on trend then versus now, plus where to shop modern versions of your favorite styles. \nGrowing up in the early aughts was such a wild time. Britney Spears, Kelly Clarkson, and boy bands like NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys filled our Hip Klips. The coolest Bratz dolls were dressed in the most iconic 2000s fashion trends, inspiring us to unlock our inner rock stars and our passion for clothes.  Chunky platforms of any style were magic, and mini bags for Tamagotchi toys were necessary. To top it off, the combination of low-rise bottoms or baggy, wide-leg jeans and an off-the-shoulder top was a must. \nWe often lose sight of what was once trendy. But, after some time, it often comes back in style with a brand-new take. Right now, the 2000s are proving to once again shine, as seen on all the today’s most fashion-forward celebs. For those of you who want in on the fun, we dug the best early aughts trends from what may feel like a time capsule—but fret not, they’re just as fashionable today as they were back then. Shop them all below.\nAt this point, it’s hard to go wrong when it comes to sunglasses. Big frames are back en vogue, as are teeny tiny lenses. Dark, light, colored, bedazzled, heart-shaped, reflective, futuristic, funky—nothing is out of bounds. Revel in it with a semi-clear pair adorned with gems, because why not?  \nIf you ask us, it was unjust for cargo pants to ever go out of style. Literally everyone loves pockets, and the more the merrier. While in the early aughts, you might have rocked cargos à la Avril Lavigne with sweatbands and skater shoes, modernized silhouettes such as cropped tops and fitted bodysuits help give the style a contemporary twist.  \nGrowing up, we all had our favorite pair of ballet flats—sparkly, classic, or doll-like (or maybe all of the above). This season, these flats are back to elevate our outfits and perhaps keep us off our toes. We may not be wearing them like Ashley Tisdale anymore, but let’s be real, who doesn’t wanna feel like a ballerina?\nThere’s a Goldilocks metric to be used when it comes to purses. Some are way too big, others way too small, both of which we had way too many, stuffed into the nooks and crannies of our closets. But a small-to-medium baguette that fits perfectly under your shoulder? Just right.  \nVelveteen tracksuits were a truly unexplainable phenomenon of the 2000s. Everyone seemed to know how absurd they were, yet they blew up in popularity regardless. The sight of one still harkens back to the Mean Girls era. The resurgence of the monochromatic tracksuit in recent years is a testament to the status symbol that Juicy Couture remains. And honestly, respect to Juicy for having that kind of staying power.  \nDivisive, we know, but there’s enough room at this party for all varieties of waistlines. While we’re not sure we’ll ever fully integrate back to the lower-belly baring cuts of the early aughts, it certainly is a fun style to mix into your wardrobe every now and then.  \nThis comeback is a personal favorite. Flaunting shirts emblazoned with “MILF in training” or “I’m a Virgin! (But this is an old T-shirt),” Britney Spears was the bona fide queen of snarky tanks and baby tees. In more recent history, Gigi Hadid rocked a “lol ur not zayn malik” shirt in reference to her at-the-time beau, and wild child Cara Delevingne sported one that read, “Twerking is not a crime.” \nObviously, these hair accessories have never really gone out of style, but they’re having a moment right now, nonetheless. Whether you opt for a larger, more artisan adornment or go for the traditional small plastic butterfly clips, these are simple ways to add flair to any outfit. \nCamouflage has been in for decades and continues to make us pretend we’re incognito (if only, right?). In the 2020s, we believe camo is best paired with a kitten heel and a tube top.  Or, turn those baggy pants into a stunning streetwear vibe with a great pair of sneakers and an oversized jacket.  \nKind of a random trend, no? Still, the mesh paneling of a trucker hat is incredibly reminiscent of the early aughts. Top off your pink highlights with a Von Dutch hat, throw on some DC skater shoes, charge up your Sidekick, and you’re ready for a baller night with your peeps.  \nAdmittedly, the 2000s were a pretty toxic time for women’s beauty standards. Point blank. Let’s not regress in that direction. But! One redeeming quality of the decade was that stylish women often experimented with menswear or menswear-inspired looks. Case in point: vests. Today, wear one with matching suit pieces or on its own.  \nWhile waist beads are far more than a trend for many cultures (namely, West African ones), they have come and gone from the popular zeitgeist throughout the years. They’re back, obviously, or else they wouldn’t have a spot on this list.  \nIn the same vein as vests, neckties are another garment traditionally associated with menswear that ladies of the 2000s made their own. All we have to say about ties is this: Don’t knock it ’til you try it. They’re surprisingly flattering and have the potential to be oh-so-chic. \nHold for applause. Yes, mini skirts! They’re everybody’s favorite. As Shania Twain so poetically sang in “Man! I Feel Like A Woman,” there really is something about a short skirt that feels simply feminine in all the best ways. All leg and sex appeal.  \nWe never thought we’d see the day when UGGs looked appropriate for New York Fashion Week, but I guess that’s what I get for underestimating Elsa Hosk. There’s no denying that the UGG brand practically owned the 2000s. The way these boots and slippers had a grip on American youth... \nRhinestones, gems, sequins—all that glitters is sartorial gold. Cross your fingers and hope your mother didn’t toss your bedazzler in the giveaway pile because this trend is alive and well, my friends. \nYou may have called them gauchos or even high-waters. Essentially, they’re wide-legged capris. Post-aughts, sporting a pair probably would have been considered less than fashionable, but not anymore. A flowing pant that hits mid-calf is now considered whimsical and cool.\nWhen I think of cowl necks, I think of the ladies of Sex and the City. As a show that started just before the turn of the millennium and ended in 20004, it’s is invariably linked to the fashions of the early 2000s. Like...wildly so. If you’re looking for a sign of the times, you know what to stream. \nAlmost Famous has sprung up our inner Penny Lanes, and we are ready to make a statement. Fall is here, so why not stay warm while looking as chic as miss Olivia Rodrigo, who has literally poured her GUTS into the 2000s? You already know her tour will be filled with the best Y2K pieces.\nIt’s giving manic pixie dream girl; it’s giving Amanda Bynes in What A Girl Wants; it’s giving leftover Chinese takeout in the fridge because she’s quirky. Slip skirts are the key to channeling your inner chaotic cool girl.  \nAny trend that hinges on multi-use items or DIY-ing is sure to be a winner. A top that’s also a scarf, hair wrap, belt, bag accessory, and sarong? Say no more. We hereby declare that scarf/tube/handkerchief/halter tops shall never go out of style.  \nIf you look up “bandage dress” in the dictionary, you’ll find a picture of Serena van der Woodsen in a Hervé Leger dress. Okay, not really, but you might as well. These dresses and skirts were everywhere—and I can’t stress this enough: everywhere—in the late 2000s. It appears their time has come again, as Herve Leger and Law Roach recently collaborated on a resort 2023 collection.   \nBefore there was Barbiecore, there was just plain pink. We could try to make up a name for when it trended back in the day, but let’s just call it like it is. Pink is all-powerful. Pink is everywhere, everything, all at once. Pink is then, now, and forever.  \nBecause why wouldn’t you want to look like you just left the boardwalk with a sweet personalized hoodie?  \nMeg is the Associate Fashion Commerce Editor at ELLE.com where she researches trends, tests products, and looks for answers to all your burning questions.

In fact, a source said Kate is less open than William is to reconciling with Harry and Meghan at this point. \n“Kate has no desire to communicate with Harry nor Meghan,” the source explained. “There has been too much that has happened, and she’s not ready yet.”\nWilliam, meanwhile, is more concerned about his relationship with his younger brother. “William wants his relationship with his brother to improve, but they’re not speaking right now,” the source continued. “So when that will happen is still uncertain.”\nAs for Kate and William’s own relationship? The source said it hasn’t been all that rosy. “Kate and William have been having ups and downs in their marriage like everyone else,” the source said. “But they’re focused on their royal duties and doing that as a unit.”\nKate’s disinterest in engaging with Harry and Meghan doesn’t come as a huge surprise, at least in regards to Meghan. The two royal wives have never been close. In April, a source said Kate was “relieved” Meghan was not attending King Charles’ coronation.\nHarry also wrote in his memoir, Spare, that Kate felt uneasy about Meghan from the start of their relationship. During their first royal event together, Harry wrote that Kate was likely “on edge,” understanding that she was now “going to be compared to, and forced to compete with, Meg.”\nBefore that, royal reporters Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand wrote in their Meghan and Harry biography, Finding Freedom, that as Meghan settled into the royal family, things between her and Kate did not improve.\n“Meghan would agree with the assessment that the duchesses were not the best of friends,” the authors wrote then, noting that Kate and Meghan weren’t feuding either. “Their relationship hadn’t progressed much since she was Harry’s girlfriend.” \nThey reported that Kate felt she and Meghan had little in common other than their connection to the royal family. As such, the now Princess of Wales didn’t really make a deep effort to become close to Meghan.\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe Rocket Collection was inspired by Elton John.\n“Christmas is my favorite time of year,” Charlotte Tilbury, founder of her eponymous makeup and skincare line, reveals. During this time, the beautypreneur gifts “trinkets, treasures, and treats” to her friends and industry colleagues, which is a stocking full of personalized products from her “secret, magic, innovation lab.” And while you may not be one of her celebrity friends, she’s launched a dazzling holiday collection, “Charlotte’s Magic Gifting Universe,” where you can step into beauty magic and spread the love and give the gift of glow. However, the standout stars in the holiday extravaganza are none other than Kate Moss, who transforms into a ‘Rocket Girl’ via the inspiration of Elton John (yes, you read that right).\nThe two stars shine in the campaign, with Moss showing off her dynamic modeling skills as she bounces between posing seductively for the camera and an energetic, party girl aura with glittery eyes as Elton John joyfully plays on the piano. “I love the rocket girl look Sofia Tilbury created for me for this campaign. It’s the most gorgeous, hypnotizing, party look that takes you anywhere,” she shares exclusively with ELLE.com.  \nThe Rocket Collection features two new Rock Lips Lipsticks and the Rock Star Bag. The lipsticks shades include Rocket Girl, a cool nudey-pink slightly reminiscent of the cult loved Pillow Talk shade and Ready for Lust, a deep berry red, perfect for the holidays. And while Moss may be the face of the campaign, she’s been a longtime supporter of both Tilbury and her brand. “I’ve worked with her since I was like 20 and created Nude Kate lipstick and was using all my products before I even officially created the brand,” Tilbury shares. The self-contouring formula for Rock Lips hugs your lips perfectly and leaves what Tilbury calls, “a glam rock shimmer.” \nThe collection is defined by stars on the packaging and the makeup bag (that can also double as a going out bag) was a way to bring Elton John’s iconic stage outfits to consumers. “He’s so known for his outfits and his costumes and clothing. The bag gives that Elton John glam rock—that 70s cool rock,” Tilbury says. And while the collection is great, the gift and spirit of giving, is truly what’s behind this collaboration. Tilbury made a personal contribution to The Rocket Fund, which will support The Elton John AIDS Foundation in helping over 40,000 young people at risk of HIV and AIDS to access life-saving services and support. “We have the tools to end HIV and AIDS—it’s the stigma that’s holding us back and I can’t thank Charlote enough for using her holiday campaign to shine light on The Rocket Fund. Together we can end AIDS forever,” John exclusively shares with ELLE.com. \nOutside of The Rocket Collection, the holiday collection includes a limited edition 12-piece advent calendar and her Beautyverse palette, which Moss says is “honestly every trend in a palette.” The palette features a lilac chrome shadow, a silver shadow, neutrals, including browns and pinks, and just the right amount of shimmer. \n“What I love about Charlotte is she is always starting and creating trends,” says Moss, who is a huge fan of the Beautyverse palette. “I’m obsessed with how the cyber silver shade plays with the light to give that cool-girl effect at the same time as giving me bigger, brighter eyes. It’s the perfect combination of vintage and modern.” \nIf you’re looking for the perfect gift for the rockstar in your life (or living out your best on stage dreams), this is the collection for you.

The outing marks the first time Rihanna has been photographed out since giving birth to the couple’s second son, Riot, on August 1.\nIt is also a prime example of Rihanna’s sexy dinner date dressing. The singer paired a tulle black top with a cropped black jacket and leggings. She wore her hair up and accessorized with big silver hoop earrings, a choker, and sunglasses.\nFew details have come out about Rihanna since she and Rocky welcomed their second child. The couple has managed to spend the first couple weeks away from the limelight for the most part.\nIn mid-September, Rihanna and Rocky chose to share the first photos of Riot, along with the first images of him with 1-year-old big brother RZA.\nA source told Entertainment Tonight when the couple released their family-of-four photos that Rihanna and Rocky are very hands-on parents. “They’ve got their hands full,” the source said. “RZA loves being a big brother. And Ri and A$AP make a point to still spend special one-on-one time with him.”\nImmediately following Riot’s birth, a source told Entertainment Tonight that Rihanna and Rocky had “no immediate plans” to show their new son to the world and planned to stay “out of the public eye.”\nAs a couple, they were doing wonderfully though. The source said, “Rihanna and A$AP are great right now. They’re so excited to grow their family and are so united when it comes to parenting. They have so much fun together and are very in love.

She isn’t afraid to be seen with the people she cares about, be it Kelce or her friends, including Sophie Turner.\nFollowing her March breakup from Alwyn, “Taylor has decided she’s not going to hide anymore,” a source told Us. “She’s going to be her authentic self and enjoy life.”\nKelce and Swift “talk every day,” the source continued. “Taylor’s really enjoying getting to know Travis. They’re taking it day by day, but she has high hopes. She likes that he’s a normal, nice guy. He’s down-to-earth and isn’t affected by fame. She also thinks he’s hot.”\nKelce feels similarly about Swift, a second source said: “Travis is completely smitten.”\nA third source said Swift has decided to live her life far more openly in general.\n“Taylor is at a point in her life where she’s no longer willing to hold back,” that source said. “If something feels right—like it does with Travis—she’s jumping in with both feet. She’s very happy and loving life right now.”\nA fourth source added, “Following her heart comes naturally to Taylor, and she doesn’t think about the consequences or the optics of [cheering him on]. She’s doing what she wants to do, and it’s a breath of fresh air all around.”\nAlwyn, by contrast, was not a fan of the spotlight. A source told People in April, “Joe has struggled with Taylor's level of fame and the attention from the public. The differences in their personalities have also become harder to ignore after years together. They’ve grown apart.

The building could easily be repurposed as a haunted house or a Spirit Halloween by now. But this is New York, and tenants here know how to suck it up through the worst conditions for a good deal. So that must be the only explanation: The Arconia rent must be so cheap (and stabilized!) for the residents to stay put season after season—including this next one. \nWith a fourth season of Only Murders in the Building on the way, yet another murder has taken place in Charles, Mable, and Oliver’s Upper West Side apartment complex.

Hulu announced the renewal on October 3, the morning of the season 3 finale. “The trio's journey is far from over,” the series announced on social media. \nOnly Murders in the Building is returning for Season 4! The trio's journey is far from over. #OMITB pic.twitter.com/Xv2BxdCWfR\nGoing off of Hulu’s announcement, our lead trio is set to return: Steve Martin (Charles), Martin Short (Oliver), and Selena Gomez (Mabel). \nHowever, the rest of the cast is still unconfirmed. It’s likely we’ll see some favorites, like Da'Vine Joy Randolph (Detective Williams), Michael Cyril Creighton (Howard), Ryan Broussard (Will Putnam), Tina Fey (Cinda Canning), Jackie Hoffman (Uma), Jason Veasey (Jonathan). \nWe’d love to see this past season’s guest stars, like Meryl Streep, Paul Rudd, and even Matthew Broderick, return for more, but that’s also still unclear. \nThe season 3 finale sets up the next whodunnit: At the opening night celebration of Oliver’s musical, Charles’ body double Sazz Pataki (Jane Lynch) swings by Charles’ apartment to pick up another bottle of wine when they run low on booze. However, upon arrival, she is seemingly shot through the window. (A close-up shows a bullet hole through the glass.) Sazz falls to the ground bleeding and dies in Charles’ kitchen. In season 4, the group will surely have to solve not only who killed Sazz, but also whether Charles was the real target and why. \nThere could be some development for the characters’ personal lives too. Mabel and Oliver’s love interests, Tobert and Loretta, move to L.A. for work with the chance of them going long distance. Partners don’t stay for long on Only Murders, but we won’t rule out the possible return of these two (plus Charles’ ex-fiancée Joy) in season 4. \nErica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.

{"title": "Why Jodie Turner-Smith and Joshua Jackson Are Divorcing: They’ve ‘Been Having Issues’", "date": "2023-10-03 22:06:00", "text": "Sources spoke to multiple outlets about what led the couple to split and why Jackson is “heartbroken.”\nJodie Turner-Smith filed for divorce from Joshua Jackson on Monday after nearly four years of marriage. The breakup was unexpected, given that the couple was recently photographed together during New York Fashion Week. However, sources have made it clear to Us Weekly, Entertainment Tonight and Daily Mail that, privately, it’s been on the horizon for some time on Turner-Smith’s end.\n“Jodie and Joshua have been having issues lately,” a source told Entertainment Tonight. “They celebrated Jodie’s birthday on September 9 at The Flower Shop in NYC but arrived separately and left separately. It was a big party, and they were distant throughout the night and barely around each other. Jodie spent majority of the evening downstairs.”\nWork was also a factor, a separate source told Entertainment Tonight. “Jodie and Joshua’s hectic work schedules started to weigh on their relationship starting over a year ago when they were both filming projects and not always in the same place,” that source said. “They tried to make things work and were taking steps to help their relationship and deal with managing their busy schedules. From an outside perspective, things looked great for a while, but privately, they were slowly growing apart.”\n“They are trying to be amicable as they move forward with their divorce and trying to avoid any feelings of animosity,” the source continued. “They’re both respectful of each other and focused on co-parenting their daughter. They want to have a positive relationship for her sake and for themselves.”\nAnother source gave Daily Mail much more detail about Jackson’s feelings regarding the split. He didn’t want it, that insider claimed, but the couple just didn’t work romantically anymore and are better as co-parents to their three-year-old daughter.\n“Joshua is heartbroken over the impending divorce. He always thought that he would be married and grow old with his family, and everything would be happily ever after,” the source said. “He had the dream scenario in his mind, and Jodie was his person and the person he thought he would be with forever.” \nJackson would reconcile, the source claimed: “He would have loved nothing more than to still be with Jodie and in a perfect world would probably even take her back if she were to stop the divorce, but now that they have got to this place, he is going to have to accept it.”\nThat source said no “bad behavior” caused the split: “Nothing horrible happened between the two like infidelity, the relationship just went its course, and it is just a sad time.”\nA source gave similar intel to Us Weekly later on October 3. “Joshua was clearly caught off guard by Jodie’s decision to divorce,” the source said. “They had their issues, as many couples do—especially two busy actors who are also juggling a child. Joshua obviously didn’t realize it was this bad, that Jodie was this unhappy.”\nTheir friends don’t see their “whirlwind romance” as being what caused the split as much as just lifestyle changes. “They became glued to each other after the first night they met, and then parenthood soon followed,” the source said. “It was a huge lifestyle change, especially for a free spirit like Jodie. But they seemed so devoted to each other, so everyone is shaking their heads.”\nWhile their friends hope they reconcile, the source said Turner-Smith “seems quite sure of her decision. The ball is in Joshua’s court, though right now he’s likely trying to sort things out himself.”\nTurner-Smith listed “irreconcilable differences” as their cause of divorce and their date of separation as September 13, right after their fashion week appearances. Neither she, Jackson, nor their reps have commented on the news.\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake’s Full Relationship Timeline", "date": "2023-10-03 22:00:00", "text": "Actress Jessica Biel and pop star Justin Timberlake have been married for ten years and together for almost 16, and they're still going strong. The pair have had their ups and downs, including a brief breakup and even briefer photo scandal. But they recently renewed their vows and share two sons, one of whom was born during COVID-19 lockdown. \nHere's the complete timeline of their relationship thus far.\nShortly after his break up with Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel are seen snowboarding together with a group of friends in Park City, Utah, and some might say even flirting. Biel had just broken up with baseball star Derek Jeter. A source told People that Timberlake was only “trying to have a good time.”\nThey added, “He is in no way looking to be in a relationship. He's single and he's happy.”\nAnother source says that Timberlake is “in love” with Biel, adding, “He wants to be with her all the time. He's ready to be serious.”\nOn the cover of British GQ, Biel calls her very private relationship with Timberlake her “one sparkly present” that she doesn't “want to open in front of strangers.”\n“It's the one part of my life that is my own and not for anyone else,” she said at the time.\nRumors start circulating that the couple have broken up, but a source said, “They're together...They're not breaking up. Any time they spend time apart it's because they're working.”\nThey did add, “Things have been a bit up in the air recently. They've been spending more time apart—more time with each of their friends, and they've been reevaluating [their relationship].”\nA few years later, things go from assessing to ending. They decided to end their relationship, but a source stated there were “no hard feelings” and it “was completely mutual, and they both decided it was time to move on.”\nReps confirmed the break up, saying, “Addressing the media speculation regarding Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake's relationship, we are confirming that they mutually have decided to part ways. The two remain friends and continue to hold the highest level of love and respect for each other.”\nIn the July issue of Vanity Fair, Timberlake is effusive about his ex.\n“She is the single-handedly most significant person in my life,” he says. “In my 30 years, she is the most special person, okay? I don’t want to say much more, because I have to protect things that are dear to me—for instance, her.”\nThe pair were seen in Toronto enjoying time together at an art deco diner on Queen Street West. An eyewitness said, “They were in good spirits....They seemed happy. They had brunch together. They were talking. They enjoyed their food. They had a nice time.”\nA source explained, “They always remained friendly after the split and spent time together.”\nThe break didn't last too long, though. That November, Biel hinted in an interview with ELLE magazine that they may have reconciled after being asked about her dating life.\n“A girl doesn't kiss and tell,” she said. \nA month later, they were engaged. Timberlake proposed to Biel when they visited Montana, which she recounted years later on The Late Late Show.\n“We were in Montana on a piece of property that we owned at the time,” Biel recalled. “We had snowboarded all day. It was in the middle of the winter. Waist-high snow. We were [in] head-to-toe snowboarding outfits—hats, gloves, everything.”\nBiel continued, “And we go up to the property to just check out how the foundation is looking. And all of a sudden, he gets down onto his knees and just sinks into the snow.” \nIn a cover story for InStyle, Biel says Timberlake picked out the ring himself and often helps her style choices.\n“I had no say whatsoever [in the ring]. I don’t micromanage,” she said. “He is fearless in his choices and has a real eye for design. And I’ll be honest: He has better taste than I do.”\nOn October 19, 2012, the couple marry in southern Italy, and like most of their moments, it's quite private.\n“I had a little bit of butterflies,” Biel told People about the ceremony. “I was about to stand up in front of my friends and family and bare my soul for the person I love. It was terribly emotional.” \nTimberlake confirmed Biel's pregnancy on January 31, which was also his 34th birthday. He shared a pic of himself kissing Biel's belly, captioning it, “Thank you EVERYONE for the Bday wishes! This year, I'm getting the GREATEST GIFT EVER. CAN'T WAIT. #BoyOrGirl #YouNeverKnow #WeDontEvenKnow #WeAreTakingBets.”\nTimberlake celebrates Biel's birthday on Instagram. \nIn April, the birth of their baby was confirmed by the couple's publicist to People. The rep added that “mom and baby are doing well and dad is ‘ecstatic.’”\nThe baby boy was named Silas Randall, and his first photo showed him wearing a Memphis Grizzlies shirt. \nBiel shared something about motherhood with E! News, saying her most magical moment with Silas thus far was “probably the moment he wakes up from a nap. He's sort of looking around and you sort of creep up and look over the crib and he looks up and he goes [big sigh] just a gummy mouth, no teeth, just a big smile, happy that you're alive, and you're just looking at him.”\nShe added, “You quickly move on from it because there is a dirty diaper in your palm.”\nBiel told ELLE.com at the Tiffany Blue Book gala that parenthood changed her style.\n“Some days it does feel as though there's no time for anything. Fashion sometimes feels like it goes to the bottom of the list,” she said. “I do feel like I have to make a little bit more of an effort, because it's very easy to just throw on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt and sneakers and just run out the door, because you're doing a million things at once.” \nShe continued, “You have to just say: You know what, I'm going to put on my heels, I'm going to put on my dress, and I'm going to do it. You do have to make an effort, I think.”\nWhen asked about Timberlake's style, she replied, “No, nothing's changed for him, he's fine...He always looks great, even when he's sloppy!”\nJessica Biel's 7th Heaven costar Beverley Mitchell told Access Hollywood Live that she was there when they met and sparks flew.\n“I was there like the moment the love connection happened,” said Mitchell. “I was like, ‘Okay, this is happening.’ They met, it was at the Golden Globes. It was so cute because they were like—it's that moment like I like you, I think you like me. It was very, very sweet. They were definitely flirting. They were really cute.” \nThe actress spoke with ELLE.com at the premiere of her TV series The Sinner, saying her character was informed by her son Silas.\n“It's personal for me,” she said. “I wouldn't be able to do this role if I didn't know what it was like to be a mom. If I wouldn't be able to see my son every day...I get emotional just thinking about it.”\nThat same month, she told Marie Claire, “You think you're a selfless person, and then you realize you're not. These little people come around, and they require so much, and your schedule is really not your own, nor is it important anymore, and it's very clear that it's your life now, revolving around this dude. I'm not that person who feels like, Oh, my whole life changes for my kid, but it does.” \nBiel starred in the video for Timberlake's single “Man of the Woods,” being the babe of the song.\nIn an interview with Entertainment Tonight Timberlake opened up about needing to go on vocal rest, and how Biel helped him cope with the disappointment of canceling shows.\n“I think anybody out there, you know, you go through anything, to have somebody by your side to really go through it with you and get in the mud with you, so to speak, I'm sure you know what that's like,” he said. “It's like once you find that person, it's like a baptism, where you're like, ‘I can't go back,’ you know what I mean? Like, I don't, I can't go back, so, which is what fatherhood's like too.”\nBiel also spoke to Entertainment Tonight, and shared how she knew that Timberlake was the one. \n“I knew that he was my person early on, but we were so young,” she said. “There wasn't any big risks being taken. There wasn't anything... really putting anything on the line. We were just hanging out. I think before we got married, that's when I was like, ‘Oh yeah, this is the person I want to be in the boat with when we hit the rapids, because we're going to hit the rapids and we're going to have to hold on tight. Can you row? Because I can row, I think you can row, let's try this.’”\nBiel added, “It was like that early on in our relationship and when you're married for the first time you go, ‘Okay. You can't just jump out of this thing.’”\nIn 2019, pics were leaked of Timberlake holding hands with his Palmer co-star Alisha Wainwright, and Us Weekly reported that Biel pushed him to apologize publicly.\n“Jessica encouraged Justin to put out his statement on Instagram because she felt embarrassed by his actions and wanted him to take accountability,” a source said. “Jessica was very upset and embarrassed by Justin's behavior. [But] they are still united, very much together and strong.”\nWainwright's rep denied anything happened between them, as did he in his statement. He wrote:\nBefore the couple confirmed it, The Daily Mail reported the couple had welcome a second child. \nA few months later, Timberlake's former *NSYNC colleague Lance Bass told Entertainment Tonight,  “The baby is cute of course; it's Justin and Jessica!”\nWhile he spilled those beans, he did not reveal the baby's name, adding, “Justin would kill me!”\nTimberlake's friend and collaborator, Brian McKnight also confirmed the child's existence in an interview with Hollywood Life.\n“Having kids and having his family, I think [Justin] took some time to focus on those things because those things are very important,” he said. “I think if he’s going to do music, he’s going to make sure that that's secure, and then he'll bring us into his music. And being inspired! He just had a new baby. I think that's going to be really inspiring for him and he'll have some new music based on that, I'm sure.”\nTimberlake confirmed he had a new baby himself while speaking to Ellen DeGeneres on her former talk show, a son named Phineas.\n“He's awesome and so cute. Nobody's sleeping,” Timberlake said. “But we're thrilled. We're thrilled and couldn't be happier. Very grateful.” \nIn June, Biel went on Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert podcast, and talked about having a baby during lockdown. \n“I had, like, a secret COVID baby,” she explained. “It wasn't like it was supposed to be a secret. It was just COVID happened, and then I went to Montana with my family and never left.”\nWith the pandemic, the couple spent more and more time in Montana and ended up listing their home in the Hollywood Hills home for $35 million.\n“They're rarely in L.A. and are happy to live in Montana,” a source told People. “They also still have a place on the East Coast.”\nTimberlake posted on Instagram for Biel's 40th birthday, and wrote on his Story, “Whether it's laid up on a couch, kicking my ass at the gym or, dressing up at ridiculous costume parties... you make it all look good. I love you and I celebrate you every day.”\nBiel revealed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that her husband threw her a huge birthday party for the milestone birthday and covered a bunch of her favorite songs.\n“He's just my favorite....He threw me such an amazing, amazing party. And he flew his band in and he performed for me,” she gushed. “Look, I will go head-to-head with everybody, but I'm his No. 1 fan. And I mean, who do I want to see on my birthday? It's him and his band. He's my favorite.”\nShe added, “Everything from Feist to Radio Head to Donny Hathaway ... it just goes on and on.”\nDuring the premiere of her Hulu series Candy, Biel told Entertainment Tonight why her relationship with Timberlake is going strong ten years later.\n“It's a really good question, right?” she said. “Well, I'll have to give Justin the credit in this moment, for this one thing that he always says to me: ‘We might be married, but we have to keep dating,’ and it's so true. You just have to keep making time for each other and you have to keep making each other a priority. And do the things that you love together.”\n“It's not always easy, as we all know, but those touch point moments make all the hard times palatable,” she added.\nTimberlake even made a cameo in the series as Deputy Steve Deffibaugh, a part he volunteered for after reading the show's script.\n“He said, ‘Oh, who's playing this character?’ I said, ‘Oh, I don't know, probably somebody local. We don't have any money left,’” Biel said. “And he goes, “I want to play it.’”\nThe official anniversary of ten years of marriage was that October, and Timberlake posted,  “10 years ain't enough! You make me a better husband and father every day! I love you so much you beautiful human! Run it back!”\nBiel shared a carousel of images as well, writing, “Being married to you is the adventure of a lifetime! Run it back, baby. RUN IT BACK. I love you.”\nBiel's post revealed that the couple had a vow renewal ceremony when she reshared it in a Story, writing, “From our wedding vow renewal this summer—in Italy where it all went down.”\nShe went on Today and described the ceremony as “very intimate” with just a “couple of friends.”\n“We almost canceled it,” Biel said. “We thought, ‘This is silly, are we going to feel goofy doing this?’ And actually, it was so moving. I felt like, ‘Wow, we're going to keep doing this. Look at us!’ It felt really nice.”\nShe added  of her marriage, “It feels so, I don't know, a combination of incredibly safe and just deep understanding of another person.”\nBiel celebrated Timberlake's 42nd birthday, writing, “Happy birthday to the person who challenges and inspires me every day. The person who keeps me laughing and creating and risking it all. The person who makes the ordinary extraordinary. You know who you are. I love you.”\nTimberlake fêted Biel's 41st birthday with his own Instagram tribute to her, featuring a carousel of couple pics. “Let me tell y’all about this human… she is the most badass, most graceful, most gorgeous DREAM of a partner I could have ever wished for,” he wrote in his caption. “And today is her bday! I’m so glad you were born, my love. And, I’m so lucky that you are choosing to do this thing called life with me. Aging like a FINE🍷!!!! I love you to the moon and back. —Huz.”\nLater that month, on Thursday, March 23, the pair were at the final night of SZA's SOS Tour in Los Angeles. On his Instagram Stores, Timberlake shared a photo of their tickets to the concert at The Kia Forum, with the words “Date night” over it, even tagging SZA herself. There were also some video shots of them dancing and enjoying themselves during the show.\nPhotos come out of Biel and Timberlake on a vacation in Rome. Activities included exploring the city’s catacombs and going shopping.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

{"title": "A Complete Timeline of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Relationship", "date": "2023-10-03 21:49:00", "text": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's big Netflix docuseries has arrived. Titled Harry & Meghan, the six-episode series focuses on the life and love story of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and promises an unprecedented, intimate look into the couple's relationship. It also promises a lot of inside intel on the royal family in general. Volume I of the six-episode series is now streaming, with the second volume arriving on Dec. 15. \nIn one trailer for the project, Harry admits, “It's really hard to look back on it now and go, ‘What on earth happened?’”\nHarry & Meghan. A Netflix Global Event.Volume I: December 8Volume II: December 15 pic.twitter.com/WpFzVEC7Yx\nTo help make sense of it all, here's a short primer on the couple's relationship so far.\nAll the couple would say at first was that they were introduced by friends in the summer of 2016, but two years later E! News revealed it was Harry's childhood friend Violet von Westenholz who introduced him to Meghan.  \nVon Westenholz had met Meghan while working in PR with Ralph Lauren. The Suits actress had been in London for a while and making friend with “the high society set really easily,” the source explained. After Harry confided his dating issues in his friend, Meghan came to her mind. The Prince had actually never watched Suits, and was very pleasantly surprised when he met his future wife for the first time. There was an instant attraction.\nIn Harry & Meghan, the couple clarified that they first interacted on Instagram before going on their first date. \n“Meghan and I met over Instagram,” Harry said. “I was scrolling through my feed and someone who was a friend had this video of the two of them, it was like a Snapchat, and it’s … with doggy ears and ... that was the first thing, it was like who is that?”\nHe added, “And then we got each other’s numbers and we were just constantly in touch, and I went, ‘Let’s meet.’” They ultimately met at 76 Dean Street in London. Meghan recalls that her now-husband was half an hour late, but he was “so sweet” and “genuinely so embarrassed” for his tardiness. “He was just so fun,” Meghan added. “Just so refreshingly fun. And that was the thing, we were like childlike together.” \nIn an interview just after their engagement, Harry shared the story of their first few dates. \n“We met once and twice back-to-back, two dates in London, last July,” he said. “Beginning of July. Then, it was three maybe four weeks later that I managed to persuade her to join me in Botswana, and we camped out with each other under the stars.”\nMeghan added, “It was definitely a set up, it was a blind date.”\nShe added that the fact that Harry was a member of the British royal family wasn't the most important thing to her — she just wanted to date a nice guy.\n“Because I'm from the States, you don't grow up with the same understanding of the royal family,” she said. “And so, while I now understand very clearly there's a global interest there, I didn't know much about him, so the only thing I asked her when she said she wanted to set us up—I had one question—I said, ‘Well, is he nice?’ Because if he wasn't kind, it didn't seem like it would make sense. And so we went, and had met for a drink, and then I think very quickly into that said, ‘Well, what are we doing tomorrow? We should meet again.’”\nThe tabloids caught wind of their relationship pretty quickly, essentially forcing an official confession from Kensington Palace a few months later. Harry's public statement about the fact that he and Meghan were dating was really a condemnation of the media's “abuse and harassment” and racism targeting her. \n“It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm,” the statement reads. “He knows commentators will say this is ‘the price she has to pay’ and that ‘this is all part of the game’. He strongly disagrees. This is not a game - it is her life and his.”\nUnfortunately, this was just the beginning of difficult conflicts the couple would face with the British public and their own family.\nThe couple made their first public appearance together with Meghan supporting Harry as he played in a charity polo match. The Duchess is often seen over the years supporting her husband from the sidelines as he plays his favorite sport.\nAfter being introduced to his immediate family, Meghan was Harry's plus one at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, Kate Middeton's sister. Pippa married James Matthews in Bucklebury, England. Evidently, Meghan was not at the wedding ceremony, but Harry drove 100 miles to pick her up at Kensington Palace, London, then back to the Berkshire village of Englefield for the rest of the festivities. \nAt the time, ELLE UK reported that it is “against royal protocol for members of the royal family to upstage proceedings,” and the public's interest in Meghan would have definitely stolen some attention from the bride on her big day.\nThe couple traveled to Botswana, Africa, for the former actress's 36th birthday and to introduce her to some of his friends in the area. \n“He was thrilled to bits that he could introduce her to them,” a source told US at the time. “The celebration began almost the minute they touched down. … Meghan was speechless and so touched.”\nRumors of an imminent engagement were running wild at the time.\nMeghan made an appearance on the cover of Vanity Fair, revealing the depth of her romance in the interview.\n“We’re a couple. We’re in love,” she told the magazine. “I’m sure there will be a time when we have to come forward and present ourselves, and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us. It’s part of what makes it so special, that it’s just ours. But we’re happy. Personally, I love a great love story.”\nLater that same month, she was seen with Harry at the Invictus Games, the charity he founded for war veterans of outstanding athletic achievement. Also in attendance was Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland.\nThis was also the month where Meghan was first introduced to the Queen at the monarch’s summer residence, Balmoral Castle. \nThough she'd been spending a lot of time in the U.K., Meghan still had to finish shooting her role on Suits. In late November 2017, it was reported that she was an official London resident.\n“Meghan has officially moved out of her Toronto apartment,” a source told US Weekly. “Movers were seen there yesterday and today. Meghan’s furniture from her Toronto home will be going into storage and her personal belongings are being sent to the UK.”\nThe actual engagement supposedly took place earlier in the month, but it was announced on November 27.\n“His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince Harry to Ms. Meghan Markle,” the official statement read. “His Royal Highness and Ms. Markle became engaged in London earlier this month. Prince Harry has informed Her Majesty The Queen and other close members of his family. Prince Harry has also sought and received the blessing of Ms. Markle's parents.”\nMeghan's ring was designed with diamonds from one of Princess Diana's brooches, connecting her to her late mother-in-law.  In an interview with the BBC, Harry said, “The ring is obviously yellow gold, because that's her favorite, and the main stone itself I sourced from Botswana, and the little diamonds on either side are from my mother's jewelry collection, to make sure she's with us on this crazy journey together.”\nMeghan discussed in the same interview how she had met Queen Elizabeth II, Harry's grandmother. “She's an incredible woman,” she said.\nIn Harry & Meghan, the couple shared how exactly Harry popped the question: he got down on one knee on a blanket outside Kensington Palace. “In the North garden, being overlooked by the staff flats, I got 15 of those electric candles,” he said. “Of course I got down on one knee. Of course I did.” \nMeghan knew her answer immediately. “He’s down on one knee and I was just like, ‘Yes!’” she said in the doc. “We were so joyful and excited. I was like, ‘Ah, we’re doing this!’”\nIn a gorgeous ceremony at the traditional St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle, the couple officially wed on May 19, 2018. Forbes reported that 29 million people tuned in for the live-broadcast, and there were 600 guests in attendance. Meghan wore a Givenchy dress designed by Clare Waight Keller with a boat neck and elegant train, which she adorned with Queen Mary's diamond bandeau tiara.\nThis couple announced their first pregnancy on Instagram, writing, “Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019.”\n“Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.”\nThe announcement came out as they embarked on a 16-day royal tour through Australia, Fiji, Tonga, and New Zealand. After arriving home, they settled in at Windsor Castle's Frogmore Cottage.\n“The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will move to Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Estate early next year as they prepare for the arrival of their first child,” their office said at the time in a statement to People. “Windsor is a very special place for Their Royal Highnesses and they are grateful that their official residence will be on the estate.”\nArchie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor was born on May 6, 2019, in London. In a statement on Instagram, the Palace announced, “Their Royal Highnesses’ son weighs 7lbs. 3oz. The duchess and baby are both healthy and well, and the couple thank members of the public for their shared excitement and support during this very special time in their lives.”\n“It has been the most amazing experience I could have ever possibly imagined,” Harry said to reporters just afterwards. “How any woman does what they do is beyond comprehension, but we're both absolutely thrilled and so grateful for all the love and support from everybody out there.”\nIn a controversial decision, Meghan and Harry announced that they are stepping back from their duties as working members of the Royal Family and planning to make the move to the U.S.\n“After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution. We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen,” they wrote in a statement on Instagram.\n“We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honour our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages,” they continued. “This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity.”\nBREAKING: Prince Harry: \"There was no other option.\"Prince Harry has revealed he and Meghan felt they had no other option but to leave the Royal Family behind during a speech for his Sentebale charity.Read more here: https://t.co/2tNh1kBEXM pic.twitter.com/8plUnoJlX5\nThe couple settled into the neighborhood of Montecito, California, where life seems to move at a more relaxing pace. \n“This kind of stuff is so basic, but it’s really fulfilling and about getting back to basics,\" Meghan told Bustle of their hobby of raising chickens and living a regular family life, comparatively. \nA few months later, The New York Times reported that the pair signed a multi-year deal with Netflix through their new production company, for “documentaries, docu-series, feature films, scripted shows, and children’s programming.”\n“Our focus will be on creating content that informs but also gives hope,” the couple said in a statement. “As new parents, making inspirational family programming is also important to us.” \nIn an essay for The New York Times, Meghan revealed she had a miscarriage over the summer.\n“After changing his [Archie's] diaper, I felt a sharp cramp. I dropped to the floor with him in my arms, humming a lullaby to keep us both calm, the cheerful tune a stark contrast to my sense that something was not right,” she wrote. “I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second.”\nMeghan and Harry signed a multi-year deal with the music and podcast streaming giant, through their company Archewell Audio, named after their son. \n“What we love about podcasting is that it reminds all of us to take a moment and to really listen, to connect to one another without distraction,” Harry and Meghan said in a statement. “With the challenges of 2020, there has never been a more important time to do so, because when we hear each other, and hear each other’s stories, we are reminded of how interconnected we all are.”\nMeghan's show Archetypes begins airing in 2022 and is an instant hit.\nThe couple shared another photo through a friend of their new expectation, this time a daughter.\nOn Valentine’s Day, they said in a statement to US Weekly, “We can confirm that Archie is going to be a big brother.”\nHarry and Meghan sat down with Oprah Winfrey for a special tell-all interview about their decision to step back as royals and what their lives were like in the palace. \nThe couple made some big revelations during the sit-down, including Meghan detailing the racism she experienced in the U.K. and that someone in the royal household made comments on their future child's skin color. Meghan also discussed her mental health struggles while dealing with the pressures of royal life. She recalled that at one point, she “just didn’t want to be alive anymore.” Harry also said he felt “really let down” by his father, King Charles, and that his relationship with his brother, Prince William, “is space, at the moment.”\nLilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born on June 4, and named in honor of her great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, who was lovingly called Lilibet by family. Her middle name was clearly intended to honor Harry’s mother, Princess Diana. They call their youngest Lili for short.\nAfter several years away, and some back-and-forth over safety issues for the family, Meghan and Harry returned to the U.K. to celebrate the Queen's 70th year as a monarch, her Platinum Jubilee.\nThe family gathered together once more at Windsor following the Queen's death in September 2022. After rumors of frosty relations between Harry and his brother Prince William, the two brothers were seen with their wives greeting mourners and surveying the tributes left in the Queen's honor.\nHarry and Meghan spoke about their first date, engagement, and wedding at length for the first time, along with what led them to step back from their senior royal family roles.  \nHarry acknowledged he may never receive an apology from his family or the institution for all that happened. “And I’ve had to make peace with the fact that we’re probably never going to get a genuine accountability or a genuine apology. My wife and I, we’re moving on. We’re focused on what’s coming next.”\n“There’s times when I’ve been angry, but I can’t be that angry because I genuinely feel that I, and we, are exactly where we’re supposed to be,” he added in the last episode's final minutes. “We’ve made it to the other side.”\nNotably, Harry details Kate's icy reception to Meghan from the very beginning. He wrote that Kate was likely “on edge,” understanding that she was now “going to be compared to, and forced to compete with, Meg.” \nIn late March 2023, Harry returned to the UK to appear in court for the legal case he and several other public figures were waging against Associated Newspapers Ltd (ANL), which are the publishers of British tabloids The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday. In a witness statement, via People, he discussed how his relationship with Meghan Markle led him to become more concerned about the tabloids' treatment of them. \nThe press's treatment of Meghan made him \"increasingly troubled by the [royal family's] approach of not taking action against the press in the wake of vicious persistent attacks on, harassment of and intrusive, sometimes racist articles concerning Meghan,” he said in the statement. He noted the “the situation got worse” when Meghan was pregnant with their first child Archie.\nHarry stated that this claim is “not just about me. I am bringing this claim because I love my country and I remain deeply concerned by the unchecked power, influence and criminality of Associated. The evidence I have seen shows that Associated's journalists are criminals with journalistic powers which should concern every single one of us. The British public deserve to know the full extent of this cover up and I feel it is my duty to expose it.”\nIn June, Meghan and Harry ended their deal with Spotify and their Archewell Audio division announced that they “have mutually agreed to part ways and are proud of the series [Meghant’s Archetypes] we made together.”\nA source talking to People said part of it was the podcast production at Spotify, and part of it was personality-based.\n“What works in podcasting is authenticity and intimacy and revealing things either about yourself or about a topic that says something that [listeners] haven’t really thought about,” the insider said. “None of that happened. And Meghan wasn’t prepared to do that, because she lives an incredibly guarded life.”\nAnother source close to Archetypes’ production said that Meghan and Harry “were given no formal lay of the land to kick things off, so they were already on unsteady footing even before the ink was dry.”\n“Things moved very slowly on both ends,” the source said. “It was rare to have a direct conversation with them, so everything had to flow through a million middle persons.\"\nAnother source told Us Weekly that Meghan and Harry are “regrouping.” \n“They want to figure out how they can best expand the entertainment side of things,” they said, adding that the couple felt “snubbed” by Emmys voters when their Netflix docuseries Harry & Meghan received no nominations. \nGossip outlet DeuxMoi, and tabloid Radar Online, began alleging that Meghan and Harry were “taking time apart.”\nOne source told Radar, “The Sussexes are under tremendous financial pressure to fund their lavish California lifestyle, including their $14 million mansion and huge security costs. That stress coupled with their emotional issues has likely made life a living hell. Taking time apart on different continents will hopefully help them find whatever they need to move on.”\nBut Page Six spoke to a source who said, “It’s not true, it’s literally made up.”   \nThe rumors were apparently very annoying to the couple, and a source told Us Weekly that Harry and Meghan were complaining about the media’s treatment of them since their Spotify deal ended. \n“It seems to be one assault after another these days, with people lining up to take cheap shots at them,” one source said. “Quite frankly, both she and Harry are sick and tired of it.”\nAnother source said they have “a ton of exciting things in the pipeline. [They’re] ready to come back stronger.”\nThe pair are “really happy together” in California, according to a source speaking with People. \n“They seemed really happy together,” the family insider said. “Harry seems to be embracing this life he has with Meghan and knows it’s a very different one than he had before, of course.”\nThey added, “Meghan does seem to run the household and make the decisions, but it’s not that he bends for her. It’s just a dynamic that works for them, and maybe one that he needs after everything he’s been through.”  \nThe couple attended Beyonce's concert at the SoFi Stadium in Inglewood over Labor Day Weekend. They shared a private box with Meghan's mother Doria Ragland and friend Abigail Spencer. The group was dressed in silver, per the singer's request for her birthday. Meghan wore a sparkling pencil skirt and white crop top and Harry had on a silver blazer.\nFans filmed the couple dancing together before Meghan hugged Harry close for a kiss. She then continues dancing with an arm around him affectionately. \nAfter attending the Düsseldorf Invictus Games in Germany, Meghan and Harry snuck in a little vacation to Portugal, local publication Nova Gente and People report. People noted that the couple likely visited Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank there. Eugenie and Brooksbank are splitting their time between the U.K. and Portugal due to Brooksbank’s job.Additionally, Eugenie recently welcomed her second child, Ernest, who was four months old at the time of Meghan and Harry’s visit. Meghan and Harry likely met him for the first time.\nAimée Lutkin is the weekend editor at ELLE.com. Her writing has appeared in Jezebel, Glamour, Marie Claire and more.

{"title": "All About Brad Pitt’s Girlfriend Ines de Ramon, Who He’s Been Dating for a Year", "date": "2023-10-03 21:38:00", "text": "Just weeks after Brad Pitt was rumored to be seeing Emily Ratajkowski (who went on to reportedly date Pete Davidson for a couple weeks), the 59-year-old actor seems to have a different new woman in his life. The Daily Mail ran photos of Pitt at a Bono concert on Nov. 13 with Ines de Ramon, a 32-year-old Swiss jewelry professional. The Daily Mail claimed it was informed by sources that de Ramon was part of Pitt’s team. People, meanwhile, reported that de Ramon works for the jewelry brand Anita Ko. Her LinkedIn lists her position as vice president of the company.\nIn photos, Pitt appeared putting his arms on de Ramon, and introduced her to his friends there, including Cindy Crawford. De Ramon is recently single herself, having separated from her husband, Vampire Diaries actor Paul Wesley, in September 2022. \nReports on her relationship status with Pitt were initially a little conflicting, with People reporting them as dating and E! reporting they’re just friends. People described de Ramon as Pitt’s “girlfriend” in a report published on December 16, and the two were then seen together getting out of a car in Hollywood on Pitt’s 59th birthday on December 18, 2022.\nNew Year's Eve made it clear though: Pitt and de Ramon are dating and rung in the New Year on vacation in Cabo. On January 3, 2023, Page Six ran paparazzi photos of the two topless on their trip. The couple went on to celebrate their one-year anniversary in September 2023.\nSo, who is de Ramon? Here, the essentials and all the details on her connection to Pitt.\nWhile neither de Ramon nor Pitt have commented on reports that they’re dating, The Daily Mail ran photos of them at a Bono concert together on November 13. The outlet reported they arrived together in Pitt’s Tesla at 8 P.M. They left separately, de Ramon in Pitt’s bodyguard’s SUV and Pitt in his Tesla. \nInterestingly, the source was indicated as close to de Ramon rather than Pitt. The source said, “[they] have been dating for a few months,” and that “Brad is really into” de Ramon. “They met through a mutual friend. She is very nice.”\nA second source, this one close to Pitt, confirmed they were dating, but casually. “[They] recently started dating. [But] it’s not an exclusive relationship. Ines is cute, fun and energetic. She has a great personality. Brad enjoys spending time with her,” the source said.\nA source told E! that same day, meanwhile, that Ines is “a friend of his.” Of the dating rumors, the source added, “This has been assumed in the past and has been wrong.” Hmm...\nPeople reported on December 16 that de Ramon and Pitt were acting particularly coupley at the after party for the Los Angeles premiere of his film Babylon the night before. The two were seen “mingling with guests, occasionally with their arms around each other,” the outlet wrote. It marks the two's first big public sighting together since dating reports broke in November.\nDe Ramon and Pitt ended 2022 together—and gave the public definitive proof they're a couple in vacation photos of them lounging pool-side, topless together. De Ramon's back was turned to the camera while Pitt sat next to her, both sitting, talking, and reading by the water. No one else appeared around them in shots taken. Page Six ran the pictures here.\nPeople also reported that the two spent New Year's Eve together in Cabo days before Page Six published photos. A source told People on January 2, “They are dating and having fun. They have a good thing going on. There is no stress. Brad is enjoying it.”\n“[He] is not seeing anyone else right now,” the source added, suggesting that things may be becoming a little more serious. “He is spending more time with Ines. He is very happy.”\nA few days after their vacation, a source told ET that the new couple are “excited about where things are headed.” \nThey continued, “Ines took a bunch of time off from work during the holidays to celebrate with Brad and spend New Year's Eve with him. They had a great time in Cabo just relaxing and having fun together.” \n“They're a great match and have a good thing going,” they added. “They have a lot in common and Brad likes how chill and low-key Ines is. They're excited about where things are headed.”\nPitt isn’t the only actor that de Ramon has been with. De Ramon and The Vampire Diaries’ Paul Wesley announced their separation after three years of marriage in September 2022. Wesley and de Ramon were first romantically linked in July 2018.\nA rep for the couple told People in September that “they have separated” and have been living apart for several months. “The decision to separate is mutual and occurred five months ago. They request privacy at this time,” the rep added.\nOn Friday, February 17, Wesley filed for divorce in Los Angeles listing the reason for their split as “irreconcilable differences,” according to People. The divorce petition says that the former couple's assets split will be decided at “trial or by stipulation.”\nFollowing news that Pitt sent de Ramon flowers from afar for Valentine's Day, a source, identified as a “close friend” of Pitt, spoke to Daily Mail in late February about the two's connection. They have supported each other through their divorces. “Ines does the same for Brad who is unfortunately still dealing with his messy divorce from Angie,” the source said. “They actually bonded over their divorces and are quite serious. She has met most of his kids.”\nThe source claimed that Pitt's romance with de Ramon has been very different from his previous. “She is zero drama and very low-key,” the source said. That source also said that he doesn't care about how Jolie or de Ramon's ex Paul Wesley see their romance. “He especially doesn't give a damn what Angie thinks,” the source said. “In fact he wants her to know that he is happy with someone else. Brad does not care what Paul thinks of him, nor what Paul thinks of him dating Ines. Even though Paul is out of the picture, Brad and Ines are going to continue keeping it on the DL.”\nPitt and de Ramon celebrated their one-year anniversary in September 2023, with a source speaking about their relationship in detail to Us Weekly. “[Their] relationship is stronger than ever,” the source said. “[They] spend almost all their free time together.” That source noted de Ramon is close to Pitt’s friends, too.\n“Brad still hasn’t introduced his kids to Ines,” the source said. “It’s not that he doesn’t love Ines, it’s just that he wants to ensure this relationship is going the distance before he takes that major step.”\n“He’s dated a few women over the years but hasn’t introduced any of his children to them,” the source added. Pitt is “happy” with his and de Ramon’s current status. “[He] isn’t in a rush to push things unless it unfolds organically.”\nDe Ramon is a graduate of the University of Geneva, earning her bachelor’s in business administration. Her LinkedIn indicates that she speaks five languages, with French, English, and Spanish indicated at a bilingual or native proficiency, and German and Italian listed at a professional working proficiency. Prior to working at Anita Ko in Los Angeles, de Ramon spent four years working in the retail department of jewelry company de GRISOGONO.\nFollowing news that she and Pitt may be dating, de Ramon appeared to set her Instagram to private. De Ramon has appeared before on Wesley’s Vampire Diaries co-star Nina Dobrev’s Instagram when she and Wesley were still together.\nOne photo of her remains on her ex-husband’s Instagram too:\nDe Ramon has managed to keep public information about herself very limited, despite her marriage to Wesley and current rumored ties to one of Hollywood’s biggest stars. Pitt is likely to guard details of their relationship too, should it continue or become more serious, as the actor has not spoken much about any particular woman he has dated following his 2016 divorce from Angelina Jolie.\nTuesday, February 14, was of course Valentine's Day, and de Ramon, was spotted in Los Angeles carrying an oversized bouquet of pink peonies, according to the Daily Mail. A source told People that the flowers were from Pitt, a romantic gesture for the holiday.\nPitt was in New York City for Valentine's Day, filming his latest movie Wolves.\nOn Friday, February 24, Pitt and de Ramon were seen together in Paris at Fouquet’s on the Champs-Élysées, seated next to each other amongst a larger group. The short clip was shared by the publication Paris Match on Twitter. In the clip, de Ramon is wearing a shimmering spaghetti strap silver dress and Pitt was in a black tuxedo. \nExclusif : Brad Pitt et sa petite amie Inès de Ramon au Fouquet’s des Champs Élysées, après la cérémonie des César. #Cesar2023 #bradpitt pic.twitter.com/QZB6N72kxE\nThe actor was in Paris for the 48th César Film Awards, where he was tasked with presenting Fight Club director David Fincher with an honorary award. A source told People the couple did not travel to France together, but arrived separately a day apart. \nA source told People on Thursday, July 27, that things are “going very strong” for the couple and “they are doing great.”\nThe actor has been in Europe filming a movie, but production was put on hold following the SAG-AFTRA strike. She has managed to see him throughout the season and filming.\n“The two have been spending a lot of time together this summer as they truly enjoy each other’s company and are very into each other,” the insider said. “It’s apparent to anyone who sees them together.”\nDe Ramon has also been visiting the Château Miraval which Pitt and his ex-wife Angelina Jolie have been contesting one another over in court.\n“He still keeps a residence at Château Miraval and has been spending a lot of time there and elsewhere in Europe,” the source explained.  “And Ines has been flying in to see him several times.”\nOn Wednesday, August 23, de Ramon was photographed wearing a “B” pendant necklace which some are connecting to her rumored beau. The jewelry designer was drinking a green smoothie and walking her dog in black athletic wear. The pair are coming up on a year of dating, but a source told ET a few days after the necklace sighting that they are “happy being low-key.”\n“Brad and Ines are still seeing each other and having fun,” the insider said. “They enjoy each other’s company and have similar interests. They’re both creative, like to travel, and are happy being low-key. Things are good between them, but Brad isn't rushing anything.”\nThey added, “Brad is very careful and intentional about who he dates. He likes to ease into things and let things grow naturally.”\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "<i>Only Murders in the Building</i>’s Season 3 Finale Solves One Mystery and Introduces Another", "date": "2023-10-03 21:03:00", "text": "Ben’s killer is revealed, and so is the next victim. \nSpoilers below. \nWho killed Ben Glenroy? That’s the question the third season of Hulu’s Only Murders in the Building has revolved around, and the finale “Opening Night” gives us not one but two answers. \nMabel cracks the case almost immediately at the beginning of the episode, spurred by both Oliver’s sweet-talking reunion with his beloved dips (he’d been warned to stay off the stuff after suffering a heart attack a few episodes ago) and Howard finally piecing together the shredded message. By Mabel’s calculations, Ben—who had been fasting before the show—was tempted by a Shmackery’s cookie left in his dressing room by none other than Donna, Death Rattle’s producer, after she found out that Maxine’s review of the show (and specifically, Ben) was unfavorable. Donna sprinkled a tiny bit of rat poison on top of the cookie and sent him off to his dressing room with the suggestion to “be nice to Ben,” knowing he would take the bait, all in the name of saving the show.\nThe footage that Mabel and Tobert recovered earlier in the season of Ben talking to someone in his dressing room, and the lipstick message saying “fucking pig” on the mirror weren’t targeted attacks, but rather the unraveling of Ben’s psyche prior to him taking the stage. But Donna still holds the poisoned cookie. To add fuel to the fire, newly-free Loretta also hands over the bloody handkerchief found on Ben’s body, which has Donna’s exact shade of lipstick pressed perfectly into it. It seems like a hook, line, and sinker, and the gang hatches a plan to confront Donna and bring her down by luring her in with a new review of the revamped musical Death Rattle Dazzle. \nOn opening night, Mabel brings a bouquet of flowers to Donna with a note summoning her to the backstage offices. Before she goes, she offers her son Cliff two disturbing kisses (“one on the lips and one on the heart”) and tucks her own handkerchief in his pocket. Oliver, Mabel, Charles, and Tobert (with the boom mic) await her backstage to accuse her of the crime, and she confesses almost immediately. Her motive was to save the show by any means necessary, especially because it’s Cliff’s first production. While she didn’t mean to kill Ben (she only wanted to buy time for the show), when he reappeared later that night, she says she couldn’t risk him going on stage the next night. \nTobert records her confession for the podcast but she asks for one thing in return: Call the cops after the show. She wants to be there for opening night and deems herself “not a flight risk” due to her stage four lung cancer. They agree, but as Mabel watches Donna and Cliff from the wings, she realizes that Donna didn’t act alone. \nMabel follows Cliff up to a lookout in the rafters of the theater where she confronts him about pushing Ben down the elevator shaft. “One on the heart,” Mabel realizes, means that Donna’s lipstick-stained handkerchief wound up in Cliff’s suit jacket pocket, placing Cliff at the scene of the crime. Cliff doesn’t deny it, telling Mabel that Ben found out about Donna’s rat poison from toxicology reports. Ben remembers that Donna offered him the cookie and then offends Cliff by insinuating that he doesn’t have a brain of his own, and Cliff fights back saying that he never wanted to cast Ben in the first place—that he thinks he’s a superhero hack who can’t act. The two get in a scuffle that ends with Cliff, somewhat accidentally, pushing Ben to his death at the bottom of the elevator shaft.\nThe confession almost breaks Cliff, who refuses to let his mom take the fall for him, and he threatens to jump out of the rafter to his own death in the middle of the musical. But the warmth of his mom’s hand pulls him gently to safety. He apologizes and she forgives him before the two are carted out by the police; sadly, they don’t get to see that the musical received a good review after all. \nThe season’s fixation on the love between a mother and her son isn’t only resigned to Donna and Cliff’s odd dynamic; Loretta finally tells Dickie that she’s his biological mother. He says he knew it all along and quickly goes back to work as her agent, fielding offers far and wide in Hollywood. Oliver, reunited with the love of his life, finally lets go of control and encourages her to go and pursue her dream with Dickie by her side. As for their relationship, he says he’s just fine being with Loretta in short bursts. L.A. is also calling Tobert’s name for an indie film gig and Mabel turns down his offer to join him and find herself out west, saying that she needs to make herself “unstuck” in New York. \nEvery mystery story has red herrings, and that was especially true of this season of Only Murders in the Building. Many of the characters introduced as potential players had increasingly minor roles as the season went on—especially Ashley Park’s Kimber, who at one point was positioned as a major suspect. Jonathan, played by Jason Veasey, also got minimal screen time after he takes a drug cocktail in the finale that rendered him unable to go on for opening night, forcing Oliver (and not Howard, who desperately wanted the role) to take his place. Even Jesse Williams’ Tobert, who will be carrying on a bicoastal romance with Mabel for the foreseeable future, didn’t have much to do late in the season aside from a few funny one-liners. \nOnly Murders in the Building ends its third season similar to seasons past: by setting up yet another investigation for the true crime junkies’ true crime podcast. As the trio celebrates solving Ben’s murder, Sazz ( Charles’ former body double, played by Jane Lynch) crashes the party. Charles announces that he’s going to go get an Argentinian malbec wine from his apartment to keep the party going, and Sazz says that she needs to tell him something sensitive but puts off the conversation for the moment. \nUpstairs in Charles’ apartment, a single bullet pierces the window and the person inside topples over with blood gushing from their body.

{"title": "V.E. Schwab Is Rewriting the Rules of Fantasy (And Maybe Life Itself)", "date": "2023-10-03 20:03:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe author’s forays into alternate realities aren’t about escapism. They’re about power. \n“I am somebody who wants the world to be stranger than it is,” says Victoria “V.E.” Schwab, her voice dipping toward melancholy as she caps off the sentence. It’s a curious thought she presents—considering the world is, in fact, consistently and maddeningly bizarre—and yet one approaching the truth uniting the author’s works of fantasy, including the bestselling sensation The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue and her latest, the first entry in a new series: The Fragile Threads of Power. \nThese stories, which have built Schwab a sizable audience of not only Instagram followers (365K and climbing), but active, engaged readers across platforms and continents, are grounded in what Schwab calls a “point of departure” from reality. They are each set in a version of the world we know, but with an asterisk. So: In Addie, there is New York City, and there is Paris, but there is also a god made of shadow who grants wishes that double as curses. In Threads, there is London, but it is carved into multiversal quadrants, versions in various stages of grandeur and ruin: Red London, White London, Grey London, and Black London. There is magic in Schwab’s work, but it exists along familiar contours, never claiming faraway lands from which to flourish. \nSchwab’s been, as she puts it, “in this game” since 2009, pumping out books from the age of 19, work that she marks by three essential characteristics: 1) “deeply fleshed-out” characters; 2) a “slow” initial hundred pages, “because I’m laying the board for a game I’m asking you to play”; and 3) writing with a “very specific lyrical style.” She adds, with something of a shrug and a smile, “If you don’t like these three things, then my books probably aren’t for you.” \nShe’s right, at least in part. Her characters are beloved, if not exactly naturalistic. Her beginnings can grow turgid, though rewarding for the devoted. And her prose is that of a young poet, fond of frequent line breaks and overwrought descriptions but with a slippery, hypnotic cadence. Still, none of these factors are what ultimately make Schwab’s work so enticing. The appeal is not in the “stranger” world that she and her readers desire, but a landscape in which the real world’s power might become comprehensible—and therefore, finally, manageable. \nSchwab knew something of bifurcated realities as a child: She grew up between San Jose, California, and Nashville, Tennessee, moving back and forth repeatedly throughout her first 18 years. An only child, she considered herself self-sufficient well before she hit adulthood, and acquired friends as a natural “social mimic” who was “very, very intense in everything I did,” she says. She attended an all-girls preparatory school in Nashville, and she claims she “never” wanted to be a novelist; she wanted to be a World Cup soccer player. \nBut Schwab also enjoyed the expansive isolation of her own mind, where her imagination could nurture a sense of being “alone without feeling lonely.” When she first enrolled in a university, she attended for astrophysics before “leapfrogging around different departments” and signing her first book deal, which might as well have included her signature on the bottom line of life itself: A traditional career path would never be her lot. She’d been rooting around for this path for years, arguably ever since she picked up reading. \n“The first time I felt transported by a book, my reaction was of two minds,” she says. “It wasn’t even just to be transported. There was a part of my brain at the time that was like, This is power.” She continues, “I was intoxicated by the idea of the manipulation of words and [what] that could do to somebody else’s mind far before I ever wrote a novel.” \nEven as a teenager, Schwab was furious to have these powers of hers taken seriously. I ask if, in the years since she’s become a traditional publishing success story, she’s perhaps aged out of that insecurity. She replies, “I don’t think you can age out of it when you start in young-adult, and when you’re a woman who writes in fantasy.” \nAs a genre, the young-adult label fit her work like a girdle, squeezing it into a specific shape but smoothing the interesting bits along the way. Her first book, 2011’s The Near Witch, was a fairytale with a teenage protagonist, and “at the time, that automatically made it YA,” Schwab says, adding, “YA can be a beautiful section of the market. But it does feel like it has a lot of rules.” She was told that her books were unlikely to sell well—largely because she didn’t write within the strict parameters of the romance subgenre—and that each consecutive YA work would have approximately “two to six months to succeed” before bookshelves would be cleared for new entries, and hers lost to the ether of unlikely discovery. She continues, “The most traumatized authors I know are authors who are either in or have come through YA.” \nWhen Schwab made the leap to adult fiction with 2013’s Vicious, she expected a similar timeline for supposed “success.” After two months, she emailed her editor, assuming the deadline had arrived: They’d now decide if she’d sold enough copies to cinch herself another book deal. Her editor recommended, instead, that they circle back after two years. “That was this realization that books got to live longer lives in adult, and find readers at a slower rate,” Schwab says. “I needed that advantage because Vicious was never a bestseller, but it sold the same number of copies every year for seven or eight years.”\nThe publication of Vicious also announced the arrival of her twin literary identities: Victoria Schwab, with which she’d continue to release books like the Monsters of Verity and Cassidy Blake series, and V.E. Schwab, under which she’d pen her popular fantasies such as the Shades of Magic trilogy, the Villains books, the newly launched Threads of Power series, and her stand-alone novels including 2020’s Addie LaRue and 2022’s Gallant. (Some books would be released under Victoria and later under V.E.) The pseudonym was both a marketing tool and a self-protective measure: Such a gender-neutral name allowed her—in theory, anyway—to reach new audiences, as well as to create “a version of me that lives rent-free in people’s heads,” she explains. To her friends and family, she’s Victoria. But online, and to her many followers, she’s V.E., maker of tangential realities, not “the human who wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks my dog on the beach.” In other words, V.E. could have power, while Victoria could live. \nDuring the height of the pandemic, Addie LaRue took off—a miracle Schwab attributes, not entirely in jest, to its “very sexy villain.” But she recognizes the book was also “inextricable from the time in which it was published.” After its initial release in October 2020, Addie hit the New York Times bestseller list, but it was only after popular book-centric creators on TikTok (a.k.a. BookTok) championed the novel that it became a true phenomenon. Addie—about a twenty-something girl cursed to be forgotten by everyone she meets throughout multiple centuries, but who falls in love nevertheless—was the kind of book readers wanted, and perhaps needed, during COVID: “defiantly hopeful,” as Schwab puts it, and a tale of endurance across borders and eras and unbeatable odds. \nUnprompted, Schwab suggests that this, actually, is the real unifying theme across her books: the so-called “mastery” of death. She explains that, as a child, she fretted over her father, a type-one diabetic whose blood sugar levels she helped to monitor, and whose tenuous health created an environment where constant observation was paramount to survival. She concludes, “I just became convinced, if I pay enough attention to everything happening around me, I can control everything. And if you think about what writing novels is, it’s exercising control.”\nShe admits, but does not apologize for, how this rationale might come across. It’s “manipulation,” she says, and “wanting to have some power over a reader’s mind,” even if “it sounds narcissistic to put it that way.” Of course, creating fictional realities is an act of narcissism, perhaps one of the few narcissistic acts that might also serve a benevolent purpose. But this doesn’t upset Schwab. On the contrary, it thrills her. She talks of feeling powerless as a child, and how she searched rock faces in California hoping to find key holes, anything that might confirm her doubts that reality wasn’t—or shouldn’t be—what it seemed. When she came out as gay in her late twenties, it was further confirmation to herself that reality had always been different than what she’d initially perceived. Doors were opening. Light was coming through. As she chronicled in a coming-out essay for Oprah Daily in 2020, she exited a metaphorical “house,” and the world around her became suddenly stranger, and all the more beautiful. \nBut Schwab—and the world itself—did not actually become stranger; it was the perception of Schwab herself that expanded. \n“Good fantasy is only escapism for people who already have everything that they need and want in reality,” Schwab says. In other words: What the author, and her audience, really yearn for is the power—the tools of “manipulation,” as it were—to rewrite the stubborn, heartbreaking rules that govern our real world. It’s not that reality isn’t sufficiently strange; it’s that it’s so very hard to control.\nSchwab is currently on book tour for The Fragile Threads of Power, a nearly six-week trip spanning multiple cities across the U.S., Ireland, and the U.K. It’s a grueling schedule, especially as she’s much more accustomed to a regular writing routine from her favorite coffee shop in Edinburgh, Scotland, where she lives when she’s not traveling. “I like living in old places, in places that haven’t felt the need to choose between the realistic and the supernatural,” she says, citing her neighbors’ affection for ghost stories. “I feel like growing up in the States, by virtue of how young a country it is…it feels so resistant to the supernatural. You either have to be a believer or a non-believer.” \nThis split down the middle is a familiar source of both the author’s ire and inspiration. There’s always a separation—Victoria and V.E., reality and imagination, the strange and mundane—that Schwab wants to smother, or otherwise pull taut between her fingers like twine. And it extends to her publishing career, where she’s often felt shoved into disparate categories, whether on account of her success (or lack thereof); her gender; her sexuality; or her genre of choice. She wants the freedom just to be, to play, to write and be accepted for it without caveat, much in the manner of her literary icons: Imagine, if you will, Neil Gaiman or Stephen King ever needing introduce themselves as “best-selling male fantasy authors.”\n“It feels like I’m stuck with this choice,” she says. “I either downplay pieces of my identity: I take a gender-neutral pseudonym as I did. I try to be mainstream. I try to be palatable, and I still get disqualified. So then I try to be proud, and I try to be loud, and I try to be aggressively femme and gay, and I still get disqualified, where I still get put in a subcategory. And I just want to be like, How big do you have to get as a fantasy author before you don’t have to be caveated as something smaller?”\nIn the midst of this specific struggle, Schwab also has to contend with the demands of a shifting industry: Readers have come to expect a relationship with her over social media, whether in the form of her Instagram or her newsletter, featuring the cheeky title “The Visible Life of V.E. Schwab.” And she recognizes that even these engaged followers don’t necessarily belong to the same category. Some are Addie fans; others come for Shades of Magic; still others clamor for the third and final entry in her Villains series. Because she hops between books and series and settings, her audience is not a “homogenous” one. “Sometimes I get very panicky,” she admits, “because I think I can’t appease them all because I only write one book at a time.”\nAnd she feels, yes, “an immense pressure to perform author-hood,” she says. “I always am like, the person I’m most jealous of in this entire world is Donna Tartt. Talk about a person who’s just, ‘Take the myth of me and run! You’ll never see me.’ I’ll say to my friends, like, ‘What a dream. What a dream to just be a mythological figure.’”\nOf course, she seems to amend this notion the next time we speak: “The insanity-inducing thing is that I insist on being online. If I could not engage—but, to me, engagement is part of what I love.” It’s also part of the Sisyphean task of building a readership in an era where attention is a fickle currency. “The conversation I have with [my publicist] every week is like, Am I going to be relevant?” \nSchwab yearns to have an end goal in sight, both in the context of her life and in her fiction. She outlines every book with a specific ending in mind; she never begins a project without having already decided on its finale. But getting to that ending—that’s where she gets to experiment. For these periods, she can play in the ‘what if’ she recalls from a memory ironed in her teenage brain, when she went walking along a wooden fence and stumbled upon a door just beyond it. I’ll let the author tell it:\n“There was a door standing upright in this empty yard, as if the rest of the house had been razed around it, but this door has not been razed. And I remember reaching the end of this fence and standing there and staring at this door. My mind was like, What if I open that door, and it’s not the yard on the other side? But that same ‘what if’ is what prevented me from opening the door. Because as long as I didn’t open the door, as long as I only lived in the ‘what if,’ there was a potential that I would open the door and see somewhere else. The moment I opened the door and didn’t see somewhere else, it would suck. It would be a return to the norm. ” Ending this anecdote, she summarizes, “And reading is living in the potential of what could be, and not in the confirmation of what is.”\nThis statement, like Schwab’s desire for a “stranger” world, is not an entirely accurate one. Reading—even, or perhaps especially, in the fantasy genre—confirms exactly “what is”: that the world is strange; that it is inhabited by dark and terrible forces; that behind every door there is the opportunity for change. But sometimes the best way of navigating such an utterly confounding reality is not by approaching it unarmed. As Addie, and Vicious, and Threads all prove, sometimes it takes magic to see the monsters clearly—and to finally beat them back. \nLauren Puckett-Pope is a staff culture writer at ELLE, where she primarily covers film, television and books.

Gavin Newsom tapped the EMILY’s List president to fill Dianne Feinstein’s Senate seat.\nLaphonza Butler, president of the political action committee EMILY’s List, will be Congress’s first-ever Black lesbian senator.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom tapped Butler to fill the Senate seat that was left empty after the death of Dianne Feinstein,  Politico reported. Her appointment marks a historic first for Congress, with Butler becoming the sole Black woman currently serving and the third-ever Black woman to ever serve in the Senate. She will also be the first openly LGBTQ+ Black woman to work in Congress.\n“I’m honored to accept Gov. @GavinNewsom’s nomination to be U.S. Senator for a state I have made my home and honored by his trust in me to serve the people of California and this great nation,” Butler said in a statement posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. “No one will ever measure up to the legacy of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, but I will do my best to honor her legacy and leadership by committing to work for women and girls, workers and unions, struggling parents, and all of California. I am ready to serve.”\nButler has served as president of EMILY’s List, an organization that works to elect pro-choice Democratic women, since 2021.\nShe previously worked as the director of public policy and campaigns in North America for Airbnb, a strategist and partner at political consulting firm SCRB Strategies, and a senior advisor for Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2020 presidential campaign. She also has a long and involved history with the labor movement, having served as the president of home-care workers union SEIU Local 2015 for more than a decade. \nOther high-profile California Democrats are currently running for Feinstein’s seat—she was the longest-serving female senator in U.S. history prior to her passing at 90 years old—which will be up for grabs in the 2024 midterms. These include Reps. Adam Schiff, Katie Porter, and Barbara Lee.\nCNN reports that Newsom had previously promised to appoint a Black woman if Feinstein, who announced earlier this year that she would not run for reelection, were to resign from her seat earlier than planned. Many had hoped the governor would select Lee, the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, as Feinstein’s replacement. However, Newsom opted to not choose any of the candidates participating in the 2024 Senate election, so as not to give any particular candidate an advantage over others ahead of time. Though Butler herself may choose to run for office next year, too.\n“As we mourn the enormous loss of Sen. Feinstein, the very freedoms she fought for—reproductive freedom, equal protection, and safety from gun violence—have never been under greater assault,” Newsom said in a statement on X. “Laphonza has spent her entire career fighting for women and girls and has been a fierce advocate for working people.”\nHe concluded, “I have no doubt she will carry the baton left by Senator Feinstein, continue to break glass ceilings, and fight for all Californians in Washington.”\nAs an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.

Or the hair that your favorite bodega person sees on a weekly basis? Or perhaps it was just last week when you ventured outside to grab a bagel during NYC’s hurricane? \nSomewhere, somehow, Miu Miu saw your hair, put it on the inspiration board and added it to the runway for their Spring Summer 2024 show.\nAfter a full Fashion Month of very glamorous hair including the big hair bouffants at Schiaparelli, the sleek French twists at Dior, and pretty beach waves at Chanel, Miu Miu gave us greasy, oily, hangover hair and honestly, it was nice to feel seen. “It was greasy, stringy hair, I loved it,” a friend texted me after the show. From runway photos, the hair looked oily (not shiny), matted (not artfully tousled), clumpy (not as cute as Taylor Swift’s wet hair during the Eras tour), like the hairstylists played a game of “hide the dry shampoo” backstage.\nThe amount of dishevelment varied. From the neck up, Gigi Hadid looked like she was walking home after cramming for an all nighter at the library, paired with sequin board shorts and thick glasses. Model Rianne Van Rompaey’s hair was so lank and ropey, drawn into a low pony, that it reminded me of my hair at the end of any hike where I’ve ever gotten lost. It’s a slight departure from the staticky cloud hair of last season, in which the models looked like their heads were rubbed with helium balloons (and it turns out they were, to get the effect.)

{"title": "Where Is Mike Jeffries, Abercrombie & Fitch’s Former CEO, Now?", "date": "2023-10-03 15:47:00", "text": "Netflix’s documentary White Hot: The Rise & Fall of Abercrombie & Fitch charts the messy trajectory of the once-cooler-than-cool mall store that peaked in the ‘90s and early 2000s, only to come crashing down after a string of racist, exclusionary controversies. The man at the center of the brand’s peaks and valleys? Mike Jeffries, A&F’s former CEO, who’s described by the documentary’s subjects as “private,” a “micromanager,” a creative “mad genius,” and simply “bizarre.”\nLeslie Wexner first brought California-born Jeffries onto A&F in 1992, hoping he could revamp the 100-year-old brand. At the time, Jeffries was known as the former president of Alcott & Andrews, a women’s retail chain that filed for bankruptcy in 1989. Wexner, on the other hand, was the king of retail; he was the CEO of A&F’s then-parent company L Brands, which owned stores like The Limited and Victoria’s Secret. The documentary describes how it was Jeffries’ strategy to center this new iteration of A&F around elitism, sex, and exclusivity. According to the doc, Jeffries had rigid perceptions of masculinity and femininity, which he infused into A&F’s image.\nJeffries also brought on famed photographer Bruce Weber, who’s credited with helping to establish the aesthetic of the company's golden age. (All those A&F shopping bags with black-and-white photos of half-naked men? Part of Weber’s vision.) In recent years, more than 20 current and former models have come forward to accuse Weber of sexual assault and exploitation. He has since settled two sexual assault lawsuits and has not admitted guilt. Wexner has also come under scrutiny for his close ties to the late Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who was found dead while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Wexner retired as CEO of L Brands in 2020 and left the board in March 2021.\nAt first, under Jeffries, A&F saw incredible success, and in 1996, he took the company public. But he was also the leader as A&F confronted scandal after scandal. In 2002, there were protests over racist T-shirts and suggestive thongs marketed to pre-teen girls.  A group of ex-employees sued A&F in a class-action lawsuit in 2003 for racial discrimination. (A&F settled for $40 million and admitted no wrongdoing.) And then there was the rare interview Jeffries gave to Salon in 2006. In the story, Jeffries is described as a “quirky perfectionist and control freak,” who always goes through the revolving doors at A&F headquarters twice and never passes other employees on the stairwells. During the interview, he infamously said: “Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don’t belong [in our clothes], and they can’t belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.”\nFrom there, the controversies only continued to mount. In 2012, Bloomberg reported on an “Aircraft Standards” manual for the A&F executive jet, written by Jeffries’s longtime life partner Matthew Smith. (The manual was made public in an age-discrimination lawsuit brought against the company by a former pilot, according to Bloomberg.) The manual included 40 pages of highly detailed instructions, including what kind of underwear aircraft staff should wear and the seating arrangements for Jeffries’s dogs.  Then in 2013, BuzzFeed News published reporting that Smith was “one of the most powerful people” at A&F, even though he wasn’t technically employed and his role was “never formally reported” to shareholders. Per the report, “Two former executives used the word ‘dangerous’ when describing Smith, citing the fact that he is organizationally unaccountable if something were to go wrong with regard to a decision he’s made.”\nAfter reports of struggling sales, Jeffries finally stepped down from A&F in December 2014, nearly a year after he was removed as chairman. In June 2015, Samantha Elauf won a Supreme Court case against A&F after the company refused to hire her because she wore a headscarf.\nOnce he departed A&F, Jeffries mostly stayed out of the news. Some of the biggest updates were that in 2015, the company sold the corporate jet, and in 2016, Jeffries listed his Manhattan townhouse for $19.5 million. He then relisted it a year later for $16 million, per ELLE Decor, and it ended up selling in 2018 for $12.9 million.\nBut in 2023, he was back in headlines again after a BBC investigation found that a group of men alleged Jeffries and Smith exploited them for sex during events they hosted around the world. The outlet stated: “Two former US prosecutors who independently reviewed documents and testimony uncovered by the BBC have called for an investigation to determine whether charges for sex trafficking could be brought.”\nOne of the men told the BBC that Jeffries was the “kingpin” and that he “took advantage of people in a very vulnerable point in their life, especially when they’re around these big cities, coming from small America.”\nWhile neither Jeffries nor Smith have commented on the accusations, A&F told the BBC it’s “appalled and disgusted” by the alleged behavior and that new leadership has changed the company into the “values-driven organization we are today” with “zero tolerance for abuse, harassment or discrimination of any kind.”\nFran Horowitz is A&F’s current CEO, and under her, the brand has transformed, this time focusing on diversity, size inclusivity, and a more understated, trendier clothing selection. But much like the A&F cologne that smacks you in the face on your way into the store, Jeffries’s influence on the brand will always linger. \nWatch White Hot: The Rise & Fall of Abercrombie & Fitch on Netflix now.\nMadison is the digital deputy editor at ELLE, where she also covers news, politics, and culture.

(In fact, Gomez re-followed Lipa and Zendaya. Today, she still follows them.)\nRegarding Lipa specifically, “It was an accident!” Gomez said with a laugh. “I was just cleaning up some of my Instagram. Then somebody called me and was like, ‘What happened with Dua?!’”\nNothing, and Gomez went above and beyond to make that publicly clear.\nGomez even wore a dress from Versace and Dua Lipa’s collaboration to a Rare Beauty event.\nGomez posted the Versace look on Instagram, captioning her image, “A little Versace/Dua moment 🦋”. Lipa commented, “angeeeeeeeel!!!! 😍😍😍😍” in further proof that all was well.\nGomez also spoke about her upcoming album in Fast Company’s wide-ranging interview, in addition to how heartbreak influenced her decision to quit Instagram in 2018. \nWith her new music specifically, happy songs are coming, she said. “I love sad-girl music; I’m really good at that,” she admitted. “However, I can’t really write that if I’m not sad. I’ve had to relearn what being me and being happy looked like. There is not one sad song on this whole album.”\nStill, “I’ve never promised anyone that I’ll never have a bad day again,” she stressed. “I’ve always been honest with my fans.

{"title": "<i>Priscilla</i>: Everything to Know About Sofia Coppola’s Priscilla Presley Film", "date": "2023-10-03 15:03:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nLast year, Baz Lurhmann’s Elvis biopic was everywhere from the Met Gala to awards season. This year, it’s Priscilla Presley’s time to shine.\nSofia Coppola is writing, directing, and producing the film Priscilla, adapted from Priscilla Beaulieu Presley’s 1985 memoir, Elvis and Me. Cailee Spaeny, best known for roles in Mare of Easttown, Bad Times at El Royale, and On the Basis of Sex, will star in the titular role. Meanwhile Euphoria’s Jacob Elordi will star opposite her as the King of Rock n Roll.\nHere’s what else we know so far. \nHere’s the official synopsis from A24: \n“Her story was so vivid in my mind and the visuals of that world, Memphis, the ’60s. It’s so American,” Coppola told The Hollywood Reporter. “And I always like themes about finding one’s identity and teenage girls growing into adulthood.” \nThe filmmaker also connected to Presley’s story as someone who also came of age in the orbit of a towering cultural figure: her father, Francis Ford Coppola. “I know from my family what it’s like to be inside a show business family,” she added to THR.\nGiven its unflinching portrayal of Priscilla’s life, the film shows a side of Elvis that may be hard to watch for fans. These include his courting Priscilla when she was 14 and he was 24, choosing her clothes for her to wear, and giving her a black eye during a pillow fight, per THR. “It was a different time,” Priscilla Presley told Hollywood Reporter. “I lived in his world. I wanted to please him. I wanted to fit in. I wanted to have fun with him. I wanted to see what it was that he liked.”\nAside from Spaeny and Elordi, Succession's Dagmara Domińczyk plays Priscilla’s mother. \nThough Coppola considered a number of actors for the role of Elvis, Spaeny was always her first choice for Priscilla, Deadline reports. When she finally met with Elordi for coffee in New York, “all the girls in the room just turned to him, they gravitated,” she told THR. “I just felt like, ‘Yeah, he has that kind of charisma that I imagine Elvis had.’”\nThe team behind the scenes includes: cinematographer Philippe Le Sourd, costume designer Stacey Battat, editor Sarah Flack, and production designer Tamara Deverell—all longtime Coppola collaborators, according to Variety. \nPriscilla arrives in theaters on November 3, 2023 via A24. It just premiered at Venice Film Festival in early September. Production began last fall in Toronto. \nCatch the teaser above and watch the official trailer below. \n“The people who are watching, they’re living it with you, and you hope and pray that they get it. They get your feelings, your hurts, your sensitivity,” the film's subject told THR. \nAt the premiere in Venice this month, Presley appeared to be moved and was seen wiping away tears at the end of the screening. She praised the film at a press conference after, saying “Sofia did an amazing job,” per Vulture. \nShe also took a moment to address some of the movie’s controversial moments, such as her age gap with Elvis and their sexual dynamic. \n“I was more of a listener,” she said, according to Vulture. “Elvis would pour his heart out to me in every way in Germany: his fears, his hopes, the loss of his mother, which he never, ever got over. I was the person who really, really sat there to listen and to comfort him. That was really our connection, even though I was 14 … I was older in life than in numbers.”\nShe added, “People think that was the attraction — it was sex. Not at all. I never had sex with him. He was very kind, very soft, very loving, but he also respected the fact I was only 14 years old. We were more in mind and thought, and that was our relationship … We built a relationship, and that relationship went on until, yes, I left, and it wasn’t because I didn’t love him. He was the love of my life. It was the lifestyle that was so difficult for me, and I think any woman can relate to that, but it didn’t mar our relationship. We still remained very close, and of course, we had our daughter, and I made sure that he saw her all the time. It was like we never left each other, so I want to make that clear.”\nThe estate is reportedly unhappy with Priscilla. TMZ reported in June that it was made without the estate's knowledge or consent. One official even told the outlet the film was “horrible.” \nIn response to the criticism, Prisicilla Presley told TMZ, “I am very excited to see the interpretation of my book by the masterful Sofia Coppola. She has such an extraordinary perspective and I have always been such an admirer of her work. I'm certain this movie will take everyone on an emotional journey.”\nElvis Presley Enterprises also turned down requests to include Presley's own music in the film. “They don’t like projects that they haven’t originated, and they’re protective of their brand,” Coppola told THR. “But that made us be more creative.” \nWhen to Catch New Episodes of 'The Morning Show'\n'Only Murders' Has Been Renewed for Season 4\nAll About the Only Murders Season 3 Finale\nWho Is Mike Jeffries, and Where Is He Now?\nWhat Happened Between Uche, Aaliyah and Lydia?\nBeyoncé Is Releasing a Renaissance Film\nThe 25 Best 'SATC' Guest Stars\nWatch a New Trailer for Fair Play\nPhoebe Dynevor on the 'Fair Play' Period Sex Scene\nWatch Every Episode of ‘Love Is Blind’ Season 5\nA Stirring Farewell to Sex Education\nWhat We Learned from The Super Models\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Haven’t Defined Their Relationship: It’s More ‘Hanging Out’ Than Dating", "date": "2023-10-03 14:49:00", "text": "While some fans online are already calling Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s relationship a romantic comedy, Kelce and Swift themselves haven’t quite defined what they are, People reports. It’s absolutely not a full-fledged serious romance though, as sources have made clear over the last few weeks.\nTwo sources doubled down on this to People in a report published yesterday. “[They’re] still just getting to know each other,” the first source said. “It’s nothing too serious.”\n“He is a charming guy,” the second source added, noting there hasn’t been any define-the-relationship talk. “It’s more of a hanging out situation than dating.”\nMuch like how Swift is focused on her music and Eras tour, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end is putting his energy into his work while spending time with the singer. The source continued, “He’s focusing on football like he always has. During the NFL season, his priority is the Chiefs, and it’s all about the team.” \nThe Daily Mail ran its own new report about Swift and Kelce yesterday, with a source claiming that Swift really does like Kelce, and her friends like him for her. \n“We are hearing that Taylor is very much into Travis and is looking forward to seeing where things go,” that source said. “Her close girlfriends are glad she is with someone who shares the same values as her and is not in the entertainment industry. He seems to balance her, and his mom and family adore Taylor.”\nSources have consistently called Kelce and Swift’s connection casual. Their future is full of possibilities that they intend to explore out of the limelight. \nAs a source told Entertainment Tonight on September 28, “When Taylor and Travis first connected, Taylor was looking to have fun while enjoying some downtime. So far, it’s been a nice change of pace for her. Now, as things progress between Taylor and Travis, they’re both looking to keep it more private. They’re both excited about where things are headed.”\nSwift attended Kelce’s game on Sunday. The two stars were not seen together though, as Swift kept to her friend group and left the stadium with them. \nPage Six reported that Swift and Kelce had a Sunday morning hangout prior to the NFL game. Kelce was photographed leaving her apartment around 11 a.m.\nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

{"title": "Selena Gomez on Why Her Final Justin Bieber Breakup Led Her to Dump Instagram Too", "date": "2023-10-03 14:42:00", "text": "Selena Gomez was the most followed woman on Instagram when she deleted the app and gave control of her account to an assistant in 2018. In a new interview with Fast Company, Gomez explained that her final breakup with Justin Bieber in spring 2018, after their 8-year on-off romance, led her to dump Instagram too. \nBieber, of course, started dating his now-wife Hailey Bieber just months after, in June 2018. They got engaged a month later, and then married in September 2018. \nGomez recalled her headspace at the time: “I had just gotten my heart broken. I didn’t need to see what everyone was doing,” she said. “Then there were those moments of not feeling positive about how I looked because of what I’d see on Instagram. Wow, I wish my body looked like that.” \nShe explained having her own body change also impacted how she viewed herself. Before, she’d “had a teenager’s body,” she said. And now, “none of the sample sizes were fitting, and that would make me feel embarrassed. Although how unrealistic is it to expect a normal woman’s body not to change?”\nAt the same time, Gomez was navigating her own mental health. In 2018, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Two years later, she shared her diagnosis publicly on Miley Cyrus’ Bright Minded Instagram Live show.\nInitially, Gomez worried about the consequences of sharing her mental health struggles and condition. “I grew up being a people pleaser,” she said. “I had a responsibility at a very young age—young people were looking up to me. I didn’t know who I was. Having that responsibility would make me walk on eggshells a lot. I thought maybe it would be damaging to tell people who I am. It started to become a threat that freaked me out. Well, if you’re not right, then you can’t work.”\nShe reflected on the time just before she was diagnosed: “I went through a really hard season [then]. It was my highs and my lows, and I didn’t know what to do, so I couldn’t control it. I would want to cancel things. It was just a tormented feeling. That’s why, when I found out my diagnosis, it was just, ‘Oh, okay, I feel a bit relieved, I understand a bit more.’ I got second opinions. I went to doctors. I’m fortunate enough to be able to have people who can help me survive every day.”  \nAs a celebrity now, Gomez puts herself in a different category than stars like Beyoncé and Adele. “I’m not unattainable,” she said of herself generally. “I look at someone like a Beyoncé, and I am amazed. My jaw drops. Every part of her is just impeccable, and it’s just so beautiful. I went to her show and was blown away. But I’m just not that, and that’s okay. I’m me, and I’m a little silly, but I also like being sexy and fun, and I also want to do good with the time I have here. We need goddesses like Beyoncé and Adele. But I’m just happy to be your best friend.” \nAlyssa Bailey is the senior news and strategy editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage of celebrities and royals (particularly Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton).

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n’Tis the season for all puffer everything. \nOne day, it’s your laptop, books, and notepads. The next, it’s your groceries, and the day after that, your toiletries and a pair of shoes for that upcoming flight. My point is: You need a good tote bag for just about every and any occasion. It’s the most useful type of bag, but because it’s for all occasions, it should also be on-trend and comfortable—just versatile enough to work in every scenario. With all the hype around puffer styles right now, why not incorporate the quilted look into more than just a winter puffer jacket or vest with a chic puffer tote bag?\nNot only are these bags super practical and workable, but they are equally chic and cool. The style aligns with current fall 2023 bag trends, but can still be used as your work bag, weekender, or even gym bag. Here, find 15 puffer tote bags that are both cool and functional. \nThe customization and metallic finish on this tote elevate it perfectly. \nThink Royln is known for its puffers, and I am obsessed. This messenger tote is perfectly sized, and the crossbody strap makes it so comfortable. \nSustainable brand Baggu is saving the planet one bag at a time. This tote offers a slightly unique take on the puffer trend and is perfect for everything. It’s simple but has a great shape.\nI happen to own this bag, and it fits everything without weighing too much, no matter how much I stuff inside. It has a super chic feel, and the quilted puffer material is so chic—plus, it’s also a favorite of our senior shopping commerce editor.\nCoachtopia is the brand’s ultra-successful foray into trendier styles. The patch detailing here is cute, and the cloud-shaped stitching is unreal. \nThis COS bag is extremely on-trend. It’s technically an oversized tote bag, but it doesn’t feel too big when worn. It also looks super cool with any outfit.\nH&M is great at making affordable yet elevated styles that feel far more expensive. I would classify this bag as just that—price-conscious yet sophisticated.\nThis bag can fit way more than you’d think by the looks of it. Because of all the pockets, it is great for storing all the little things—and even a few big things.\nAnother trend we’ve been seeing lately of is mini bags. Although not quite mini, the strap on this is shorter than most other totes. The bag itself is plenty spacious, but the shorter handle makes it idea for transitioning from day-to-night.\nI love the stretchy, silky material on this bag, which differentiates it from other puffer totes. Plus, it’s really durable, so it will last the test of time.\nRain or shine, this bag is a must-have. It pairs perfectly with a matching puffer jacket in the fall and winter, and even shorts or a dress in the summer.\nEveryone loves a two-in-one option, and the bottom of this bag is expandable for days when you need the extra space.\nThe iconic North Face puffer jacket is now a bag of its own. I am definitely purchasing this and plan to pair it with the matching jacket for a coordinated ensemble.\nLeave it to Alo Yoga to make the most necessary tote of all. For anyone who needs a perfectly sized bag to carry wet, worn, or dirty items, this is it. \nOf course you can find the perfect puffer on Amazon.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nELLE's favorite beauty releases of the new season, featuring all sorts of metals. \nRecently, I’ve been getting asked the same questions anytime I'm at a dinner party. The first, what do I think of Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner? The second is more in reference to my job: What beauty products have I seen recently that have really excited me? Well, let me direct them here: To a selection of new Fall beauty launches that are making me feel like it's back-to-school season all over again, and they all happen to have a glint of metals, whether it be in the packaging or the formula itself. Read on for the sparkle explosion coming from Rabanne Beauty, two beautiful new palettes inspired by art, and a royal scent with actual 24-karat-gold.\n“Chanel’s famous skin care line now comes in refillable packaging, with a gold-anodized aluminum core. The refill vessel is also pretty enough to stand on its own (and great for travel).”— Kathleen Hou, Beauty Director\n“This gua sha massage tool is shaped like the fan-shaped leaves of the ginkgo, one of nature’s most mystical trees. I like using the smooth end for lifting, and the curved end for de-puffing, especially when I use it with the Supremÿa Baume, newly reformulated to be even more luxurious and potent.”— K.H.\n“Anybody who loves a head massage needs this comb. Its eight teeth gently stimulate your scalp for better circulation (which may lead to stronger hair growth). It’s made of kansa, a sacred Ayurvedic material that’s naturally antimicrobial.”— Margaux Anbouba, Beauty Editor\nRabanne Beauty leans hard into the ’60s metallic heritage of the fashion brand, with glitter in all-new, extra-shiny forms: glitter spray that makes you look like you were doused with pixie dust; a concentrated loose powder that turns metallic and can be dabbed everywhere; and even a sparkly mascara topcoat. For something a little more subtle, there are eye shadow palettes in rich shades and extra-smooth formulas and an inky black mascara. — K.H.\n“This concealer has medium coverage and a silky formula that’s spiked with hyaluronic acid to hydrate. It lasts all day, so you can look fresh from your morning coffee to evening cleanser.”— M.A.\n“Yes, those are flecks of 24-karat gold inside this fragrance. Inspired by Louis XIV’s beloved orange trees in his parterre garden, fresh neroli blossoms mix with firewood smoke and pomegranate, paying homage to the lively parties that the Sun King threw inside his Orangery.”— M.A.\n“My favorite smoky eye becomes much more artful when using this palette. Each of the shades was inspired by Lancôme makeup creative director Lisa Eldridge’s private tour of the Louvre, where she saw light dancing across the marble statues and artwork of the Richelieu wing.”— M.A.\n“Dior’s new serum has a dramatic backstory: On one day, for just one hour, a special variety of wild rose bred specifically for skin care is harvested, frozen at below-zero temperatures, and then cryo-ground to become the hero ingredient.”— K.H.\n“A new-ish Australian beauty brand committed to ‘slow beauty,’ Fluff does small-batch quarterly drops of its products, which have included a bronzer powder and a solid lip oil. I particularly like the Anish Kapoor–style design of Fluff’s refillable compacts.”— K.H.\nComing Soon\n\"If you’ve always been a vanilla girl and grew up on the scent of Bath & Body Works Warm Vanilla Sugar, there’s a grown-up version for you. This scent features a trio of vanillas, including a vanilla infusion, a vanilla absolute, and a vanilla caviar. If you’re looking for a scent like straight vanilla extract, this isn’t it because it doesn’t smell overpoweringly sweet, thanks to some lavendar and woods notes. But it does smell warm and a little edible all at the same time.\"— K.H.\n\"Jean-Claude Ellena, the former master perfume for  Hermès is famous for saying that perfumes should be like a \"soft caress,\" and should not shout. His latest creation isn't any less distinctive though, and is for those who love warm, spicy scents. Fall often means that people begin rotating in their favorite smoky scents. But if you're not a fan of the woodsy scent family, this, with its notes of clove, ambrette, and carrot seed, is a great alternative \"sweater scent.\"  — K.H.\n“With my sensitive dry skin, this is just what I needed. The gel-cream formula melts into to the skin to revive and rehydrate for a smooth, dewy finish. The cream also offers an incredible sounding 100-hours of moisture as a claim, so I'm thinking that it should last me all day.” —Tasha Nicole Smith, Beauty Assistant\n“Gabriela Hearst has released her very first perfume set, created with Argentinian fragrance brand Fueguia. The scent Paysandú features native ingredients never before used in perfumery, such as the medicinal plant marcela and herb carqueja, to conjure up a floral and smoky picture of rural Uruguay, where Hearst and Fueguia founder Julian Bedel both grew up.”— K.H.\n“Gabriela Heart's New York is a ‘big city’ scent, with notes of smoke and bourbon. Together, with Paysandú, they create an aromatic synergy for the designer, who still runs her family’s ranch in Uruguay.”— K.H.\n“After interviewing multiple perfumers, I’ve learned that the key to smelling completely unique is to layer fragrances. It’s sort of like it is with clothes. Wearing an outfit straight off the runway is one thing, but combining a few of your well-loved pieces to create your own distinctive look really makes it personal.  Designer Tory Burch agrees, telling me that, 'Growing up, I always loved mixing and layering scents to create something new.' These oils with their soft singular notes like rose, vetiver, and sandalwood, are like a great basic, and the perfect fragrance wardrobe staple to build your own personal scent from.” — K.H.\nKate Moss Stars in New Charlotte Tilbury Campaign\nBigger Than Botox: The Newest Beauty Game Changer\nThe Unifying Power of Latina Beauty\nChristian Cowan Has Something New For Your Face\nThe Best Spring 2024 Makeup Trends \nEverything You Need to Know About Lash Lifts\nOur 20 Favorite Fragrances of All Time\n25 Best Ulta Products According to ELLE Editors\nThe 13 Best Root Touch-Up Products\n15 Best Drugstore Retinol Staples That Really Work\nThe Best Beauty Products Launching September 2023\n19 Makeup Essentials That Stand The Test of Time\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "13 At-Home Laser Hair Removal Devices That Actually Work", "date": "2023-10-03 21:50:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nFlawless skin with just one zap.\nWhile you might be feeling down about the end of summer, the fall and winter seasons are the perfect time to finally test out some of the best at-home laser hair removal tools. Even though the convenience of using your favorite razor in the shower is an excellent option for hair removal, it can be tedious, result in ingrown hairs, and become an exhausting process if what you’re after is skin as smooth as a baby seal. If you’re anything like me, using an at-home hair removal device is equally thrilling and terrifying. I find shaving tedious, but my first foray into permanent hair removal didn’t go well. After spending hundreds of dollars at an esthetician’s office, I found laser hair removal was not effective enough to justify the pain. Because I’m someone who can easily cosplay as Snow White (pale skin, dark hair, high tolerance for short men), I’m the ideal candidate for laser hair removal. But alas, I had to give it up for the sake of my sanity and my wallet.\nI thought I was resigned to using a razor forever. Then, I stumbled upon the Braun IPL Silk Expert Pro device. Not only was it significantly cheaper, less painful, and less humiliating than the salon service, but I actually started to see results quickly. For all of the many methods of body-hair removal out there—from shaving with the best razors to sugaring to waxing—laser hair removal (both professional and at home) is the only strategy that promises more permanent results. \nAt-home handheld hair removal devices come in two categories: IPL or a diode laser. Most at-home laser hair removal devices rely on IPL—intense pulsated light—therapy, in which tiny beams of light at different wavelengths zap the bulb within each hair follicle. “In essence, it is using heat to destroy the hair follicles,” says dermatologist Dr. Marisa K. Garshick, who mentions that dermatologists also use versions of IPL for photo rejuvenation procedures (a.k.a. fading dark spots). On the flip side, diode laser technology uses one single wavelength of light, which experts say can help minimize damage to the surrounding skin and be used safely on all skin types and shades. The light is selectively absorbed by the pigment, or melanin, within the hair follicle, making it a more targeted (and often more effective) approach to hair removal. \nAccording to dermatologist Dr. Karan Lal, it’s important to note that most at-home devices are “best suited for small to medium hairs in small areas—upper lip, chin, cheeks, bikini, etc.,” he says. “They are typically not meant for large surface areas like the back.” (There are a few exceptions, but we’ll get to that later).\nTo help you wade through the treacherous waters of the World Wide Web, we consulted our experts and customer reviews to find the 13 best at-home laser hair removal devices for women. \nFeaturing a sensor that adapts the light intensity to your skin tone, this FDA-approved device strikes the perfect balance between safety and efficacy. For sensitive skin, there are also three “comfort modes” to choose from: normal, gentle, or extra gentle. The device comes with two interchangeable heads for more precise results in different areas like the face, armpits, and bikini line. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to light brown hair\nAmazon rating: 4.4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I’m eight weeks in and it has worked even better than I’d hoped. Other than a few stray hairs, my legs are completely hairless, and I have no need to shave between treatments.”\nAccording to some reviewers, this device is best suited for those with very dark and/or coarse hair. It’s equipped with an LED screen to track how many light pulses have beamed onto each area—though you may need to wear safety goggles (which are included) while operating. Each lamp comes programmed with enough pulses to last for up to five years. When it runs out, you can order a replacement cartridge and keep the handle.\nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to light brown hair\nAmazon rating: 4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “If you’re a female with the unfortunate gift of facial hair, do not hesitate—buy this one! I have fair skin and thick black hairs, which make me a great candidate. I’m on my sixth treatment, and my chin hairs are growing back finer and slower. I’ve also used this on my armpits with great success.”\nIn a perfect world, most at-home laser hair removal devices would be equipped to be used forever and ever. Unfortunately, that’s not exactly the case, but this device comes pretty close. Fitted with 600,000 flashes, which equals about 40-plus years of full-body treatments, you can bet this tool will be in for the long haul.\nBest for: Fair to dark complexions\nHair color: Black and brown hair\nNood rating: 4.7/5 stars\nA Nood reviewer says: “The flasher is easy to use and I am already starting to see results in the first four weeks! Cannot wait to see what it does in the next four weeks!”\nSee results in as little as three to four weeks with this handheld-sized option. Equipped with five power settings, this device is safe to go all over various skin tones and sensitive areas (yep, even down there!) easily. Uniquely, the head of the device offers cooling properties to reduce laser heat on the skin. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to light blonde hair\nKENZZI rating: 5/5 stars\nA KENZZI reviewer says: “A worthwhile investment; it works! After five sessions, I am seeing notable results. Hair growth is very, very minimal. Absolutely fantastic.”\nThis sapphire device might look too pretty to use, but trust me, you’ll become obsessed with the results. Unlike some devices which can burn the skin, this tool has a significantly cooler head, making it more comfortable to use. If you don’t have a high pain tolerance, this tool is practically painless to use.\nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to dark blonde hair\nAmazon rating: 4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I never write reviews, but feel like I have to for this device. I began using it immediately on my upper lip, chin, and armpits. I have not had to pluck a single chin hair since I started using it over a month ago. The armpit hair growth has substantially decreased as well. I am approximately seven sessions in, and I cannot speak highly enough of this device.”\nThis FDA-approved laser also includes Braun’s smart skin sensor, which automatically adapts your treatment to your skin tone to ensure a safe and effective treatment. Equipped with 300,000 flashes for longevity, the device is small enough for trickier areas (and is safe for facial use!) while covering enough skin so the process doesn’t take forever.\nBest for: Fair to dark complexions\nHair color: Black to dark blonde hair\nAmazon rating: 4.3/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I’ve been using this about twice a week for a little over a month, and I would say the hair in my pits is 80 to 90 percent gone. And most impressively, it doesn’t hurt!”\nThis compact, lightweight, FDA-approved device is the most time-efficient option out there. The device itself is corded, so keep that in mind. However, as its title suggests, you simply press the button where you want to laser for a quick treatment. Plus, it’s safe to use on your face!\nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to light brown hair\nAmazon rating: 4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “Yes, this really works. I have very light skin with dark hair. I started using this every three days and my bikini line and upper lip hairs are now pretty much non-existent.”\nIf you’re looking for an FDA-approved device to treat larger areas like your legs, arms, or back, the head of this laser is large enough to cover more ground. The laser emitted is a brand-patented combination of IPL and radiofrequency designed to safely treat a broader range of skin tones and hair colors. The scientists behind the professional machines actually developed the technology, so you know you’re in good hands.\nBest for: All skin tones\nHair color: All hair colors\nNordstrom rating: 4/5 stars\nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “I️ had modest expectations, but this product definitely went above and beyond. I️ have black hair and mainly used it to reduce the peach fuzz on my abdominal area.”\nIf you’re in the market for something that won’t break the bank but will still get those silky hair-free legs you’ve been dreaming about, look no further. This model features two modes and eight adjustable light settings to ensure pain-free removal. Even better, you get a three-year warranty. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Light brown to black hair\nAmazon rating: 3.6/5 stars\nWhat people are saying: “I didn’t really expect this little device to do such a good job, but it does. I would normally need to shave every three days, and now I don’t have stubble for nearly a week. Plus, my skin feels really smooth.”\nFor your next international getaway or domestic weekend trip, you might want to start thinking about what you want to bring in your makeup bag. This FDA-approved device can easily fit in any toiletry case and still packs a punch with its 300,000 flashes. In fact, it’s designed to reveal smooth skin in just 15 minutes. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to dark blonde hair\nAmazon rating: 3.1/5 stars\nWhat people are saying: “Quite simple to use, doesn’t burn, and isn’t painful. It is small and can be carried in your luggage, so you do not have to stop the treatments.”\nIf your pain tolerance is somewhat low, you may want to reach for this device with cooling technology that reduces laser heat and inflammation. What’s more, it has three other attachments and is rechargeable. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to light brown hair\nAmazon rating: 4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “It worked like magic. You need to be consistent though, but it works.”\nIt’s no secret that laser hair removal can be uncomfortable at times. Here's an option that is borderline pain-free. The laser on this machine feels more like an ice cube to the skin, which helps minimize pain and soothe the skin. It’s got two modes for large and small areas and five energy levels to adapt to different hair densities and skin sensitivities. \nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to dark blonde hair\nAmazon rating: 3.6/5 stars\nWhat people are saying: “I was so surprised this actually worked, but it did! The hair I treated has either grown back more slowly and is sparse or hasn’t come back at all. I’ve used it every other week for the past three months. More than got my money’s worth.”\nUnlike many at-home IPL devices, this one is suitable for several skin types and hair colors, and, according to reviewers, it’s also a gentler option than many others on the market. The device itself isn’t rechargeable or corded; it comes pre-charged with 400,000 light pulses, which the company claims will last a “lifetime.”\nBest for: Fair to medium complexions\nHair color: Black to blonde hair\nAmazon rating: 3.5/5 stars\nWhat people are saying: “This product does work! It may not work as well as the professional treatments, but with patience, the cost benefit and easy access make treating yourself at home well worth it.”\nDr. Marisa K. Garshick is a dermatologist practicing with MCDS Dermatology in New York and New Jersey.\nDr. Karan Lal is a dermatologist and director of pediatric dermatology and cosmetic surgery at Affiliated Dermatology in Scottsdale, Arizona. \n“Both IPL and diode devices rely on the same target, which is the pigment of the hair follicle, to have an effect,” Dr. Garshick says. She adds, “At the most basic level, the diode refers to an actual laser, while the IPL is a light-based device.”With a bit of consistency and a lot of patience whichever light beam route you opt for will come with real results. Typically, it will take at least a few sessions to see any change, and each session should be spaced out at least one week apart. Remember always to follow the instructions of your specific device.\nDepending on the intensity level of the laser (many of the devices have multiple settings), it can feel uncomfortable. When each follicle gets zapped, it might sting a bit—many people compare it to a rubber band being snapped on the skin. But hey, no pain, no gain, right?\nBefore you start shopping (and zapping) away, we do have one important editor’s note: Since laser hair removal relies on melanin to produce results, it’s often not effective on lighter hair colors, like blonde and light gray, which, by nature, contain less pigment. If you have a lighter hair color, consult with a dermatologist before investing your money into an expensive at-home device. Also, read the fine print of every product description because most companies disclose this information upfront. Laser hair removal is also safe for people of color, but certain lasers can cause hyperpigmentation and irritation on darker skin tones, so again, it is best to consult your dermatologist.\nGenerally speaking, laser hair removal devices are safe. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take proper precautions. “At-home laser hair removal can be safe,” says Dr. Lal. However,  he adds, “It is not universally safe because many factors play a role in safety. All available devices are safe for those with light skin and dark hair.” Needless to say, burns and redness can still occur with less powerful at-home devices. Contact a doctor if you are concerned or notice any discomfort or irritation. \nDr. Lal has a few helpful tips to make removal easier and safer: “Be sure to have tiny stubble the laser can pick up for treatment. Make sure the device you are using is suitable for your skin color and hair color. Don’t use this laser if you have red or very light blonde hair. Don’t over-pulse the laser in the same location as this could lead to burns.”\nFor in-office treatments, “The gold standard is the Gentlemax Pro by Candela. It is a dual alexandrite and Nd-Yag laser that can treat all skin types, hairs of various sizes, and in various locations,” says Dr. Lal.\nAs a leading publisher of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty content, ELLE.com is committed to highlighting the best products in various categories by personally testing the latest and most innovative products, interviewing countless experts, and vetting customer-loved items.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nYou’re looking snatched and fiscally responsible.  \nI know it feels like Amazon Prime Day was just here, but it’s nearly time for the fall savings event, Amazon Prime Big Deal Days—mark your calendars for October 10 and October 11. There are bound to be more marked-down items than one person could possibly parse through, so we’re breaking down all the best goodies to shop during the sale, like the best jewelry deals, home deals, and even the best Amazon Halloween costumes. But for now, it’s all about the best shapewear deals. \nI am a big proponent of shapewear. The right piece can solve undergarment conundrums, boost confidence, and amplify looks. But it often does so at a hefty price tag. Is this capitalism preying on our insecurities? Probably, but you don’t have to stand for it any longer because Amazon carries tons of options at affordable price points. From butt-lifting shorts to full slip dresses, you can shop for whatever it is you need. Better yet, you can look to customer reviews and photos to help inform your decisions. But if you want to make the most of the Big Deal Days, you better get a head start. Here, preview some of the best shapewear on Amazon to add to your cart ahead of the savings event. \nA thong bodysuit like this is perfect for wearing under just about anything—including jeans and a T-shirt. \nThese are the No. 1 bestseller on Amazon for a good reason. Smooth yourself out from the waist to mid-thigh with these shorts. \nI love that this has shorts because it will also help prevent chafing if worn under a dress or skirt. \nWearing a tight dress on a girl’s night out calls for a shaping thong. \nDon’t forget that Spanx is available to shop on Amazon. Stock up on all your favorites during the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days. \nHere’s another mid-thigh option, but this one is strapless, which makes it even more versatile. \nAll shapewear should have a built-in bra, IMHO. But anti-static? A new bar has been set. \nFeel snug and secure under any formal gown (or casual maxi dress!) with this longline slip. \nWhile this is both stomach smoothing and booty lifting, my favorite part is the silky smooth fabric. \nYou shouldn’t have to choose between risqué necklines or shapewear. Opt for an open-chested shaper and get the best of both worlds.\nMeg is the Associate Fashion Commerce Editor at ELLE.com where she researches trends, tests products, and looks for answers to all your burning questions.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nYou can never have too many handbags.\nWhether you carry exclusively designer handbags or are a thrift store queen, your purse says a lot about you. Just like any other accessory, it has the potential to be not just a functional piece, but a statement-maker, a conversation starter. With the right bag (and the right contents), you can go anywhere. Gucci, Fendi, and Prada are of course everyone’s dream bags, but what I love about smaller popular purse brands is that they’re typically less ubiquitous. You get the thrill of someone asking, “Where’d you get that bag?” Whoever and wherever you are, that never gets old. \nSome might say you can have too many bags, but the other perk about small purse brands is that they’re typically more affordable than the big designers. So, you can buy however many you want. Step up your purse game—and get into the best fall 2024 bag trends, while you’re at it—and check out these brands, both popular and upcoming, to know right now.\nYou might’ve seen Published By’s sculptural metallic handbags around Instagram, but they’re more than a one-trick brand. Its styles can be worn as statement pieces or as everyday bags, and both ways are bound to garner plenty of compliments.\nPrice range: $350-$1,000\nNon-traditional shoe brand and queer-community favorite SYRO is now venturing into handbags, and you’ll definitely want to get your feet— wait, hands—on this one. Inspired by a trans woman who subdued the Club Q attacker by stomping on him with her heels, this bag is made to be not just a handbag, but protection. Not only is it a uniquely chic bag perfect for clubbing, commuting, and everything in between, but the story behind it makes it totally badass. Get on the pre-order list ASAP!\nPrice range: $375\nMedea is just the kind of subtle, underrated brand that any cool girl needs to have in her stash. The brand’s signature is bags that could pass for shopping bags, but they’re also known to drop must-have new releases like its just-released jeans bag.\nPrice range: €300-€1,100\nIf you saw Bottega Veneta’s latest runway show, you’ll know that the bandana-shaped bag will be the next big shape, but it’s nothing new. Lemaire’s bandana bag is perfect for holding everything you could want while maintaining it’s cool, slouchy shape.\nPrice range: $965-$2,200\nDentro’s bags are great if you want a distressed look without the distressed quality. Spare threads and exposed lining are staples of the brand and make for a uniquely chic look.\nPrice range: $390-$850\nCoach is perhaps one of the penultimate bag brands, but its new line of Coachtopia bags, made with sustainable materials, gives a youthful boost to the brand’s ethos. \nPrice range: $195-$550\nKARA is a great brand for cool statement bags. From oversized chain handles to all-over knots, these designs make for perfect bags to carry on a night out. \nPrice range: $325-$750\nPuppets & Puppets wasn’t always known for their bags, but recent collections have made them a must-have for ironic accessories. You might’ve seen the brand’s popular cookie bags in various colors, but we particularly love its banana handle bag.\nPrice range: $395-$645\nDemellier London makes bags that are sleek and sophisticated, proving you don’t need a designer logo to prove the quality. Made with high-quality sheepskin leather, the styles are smooth, smocked, croc-embossed, or quilted, making for a variety of chic styles that can be worn anywhere.\nPrice range: $450-$695\nW78st uses upcycled materials to make its ultra-cushiony purses, including denim, leather, and special charms. They also come in a range of sizes, from ultra-mini to oversized statement bags.\nPrice range: $420-$570\nYou may know Brahmin as a classic brand for croc-embossed and leather handbags, but the brand’s latest designs and colorways make the brand youthful and fun. They have any color you could possibly want, but if you want to stick to black and brown, they have plenty of chic styles for that, as well.\nPrice range: $95-$435\nKaai’s styles range from mini bags to large leather totes, which means you can get any style you need. With subtle design and minimal logos, these bags make quiet luxury accessible.\nPrice range: $215-$800\nBrandon Blackwood handbags have been popular since they first launched, and there’s a reason. The shapes, colorways, and materials are trendy but high-quality, and the brand name is quickly becoming a designer brand in its own right.\nPrice range: $175-$550\nBoyy’s special wonton-shaped bags are not only cute and dainty, but ultra-chic too. The brand carries a wide variety of styles, including its signature buckle styles, and you’ll get a wide range of colorways as well, all in high-quality materials like calf-leather or nylon.\nPrice range: $595-$1,700\nYou may know Alexis Bittar for bold, statement jewelry, but it’s time to get to know the brand’s purses as well. Made with the same craftsmanship and metalwork as the brand’s jewelry, why not level up your purse game, too?\nPrice range: $395-$745\nDouglas Poon’s glass bags have been a favorite of mine for a while. The unique, Victorian aesthetic of the bags is rather impractical, but that’s the beauty of them. These are definitely conversation-starter bags, just be super careful with them!\nPrice range: $250-$530\nBembien handbags have the quality of vintage leather bags, but the luxury of modern design. They’re perfect for everyday use, whether you’re trekking around the city or going on vacation.\nPrice range: $175-$390\nTalk about a two-in-one: Edie Parker’s signature Burn Bags also feature a connected lighter, so you’ll never be without one on a night out (or a morning journey home). \nPrice range: $295-$895\n15 Cute Puffer Totes to Shop ASAP\nThe Best Bags to Buy During Amazon’s Big Deals Day\nThe Best Amazon Fashion Deals to Shop Right Now\nShop These Deals on Amazon Shapewear \nThe 49 Best Gifts You Can Get on Amazon \n12 Best Ballet Flats With Arch Support\nA Hot Girl’s Guide to Amazon Halloween Costumes\n14 Jewelry Deals From Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days\n25 Suede Bags to Carry You Through The Fall Season\nThe Early Black Friday Fashion Sales to Shop Now\nShop Brands That Support Breast Cancer Awareness\nThe Launch: Fashion News to Know This September\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "12 Ballet Flats With Real Arch Support, According to an Expert Who’s ‘En Pointe’", "date": "2023-10-03 13:00:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nWear this season’s most popular styles in complete comfort.\nAll of my prima ballerinas out there know too well that those pink satin dancing shoes fall far from the realm of comfort. Consequentially, their watered-down, functional fashion counterpart, the ballet flat, doesn’t exactly provide much in the way of relief or reinforcement, either. So while the concept of ballet flats with arch support may seem contradictory, rest assured that you can still wear one of this season’s hottest fall shoe trends without totally compromising comfort.\nAnd who better to pirouette-turn to than Dr. Ann Anderson, podiatrist and podiatric surgeon with a background in ballet? “A ballet flat will not usually give as much arch support as a sneaker,” she admits. “But [they] can be supportive if the construction of the shoe incorporates an arch support...” Despite the name, a “flat” shoe can still offer adequate support if it’s intentionally designed. \nThankfully, certain brands have mastered the art of comfortable ballet flats. Anderson suggests looking for a heel cup or arch support that is part of the shoe design in order to help support your foot overall. Below, shop the 12 best ballet flats with arch support to wear this season.\nIn all likelihood, you’ve already seen Vivaia flats trending across social media, touting extreme comfort and earth-friendly composition. Complete with an Armisia Argy herbal insole, the Aria 5°  provides promising heel rebound, arch and forefront support, and a padded  heel patch for extra cushy comfort. This style is also machine-washable, making it a champion of convenience as well.\nSizes: 5-11\nColors: 31 options\nMaterial: Recycled cardboard, carbon-free rubber\nCustomer review: “Vivaia’s shoes are made from recycled plastic bottles, which is what originally got me interested in the brand. I think we can all agree, 6 plastic bottles never looked this good...the first thing I noticed was the insole; these are now more cushioned and structured around the arches and toes.”\nA style I’m most looking forward to wearing this season, the Mary Jane makes a case for comfort with this square-toed, patent pair of flats from Cole Haan. An easy accomplice for fall denim or cozy sweater dresses, this shoe is lightweight and comes equipped with additional arch support. \nSizes: 5-11\nColors: Black/Gold, Lizard Gold\nMaterial: Synthetic, polyurethane\nCustomer review: “I wanted simple flats that weren’t boring. I wore them for the first time to a wedding. 10 hours, standing at least half of that time, plus dancing, and they were completely comfortable (and I have flat feet).” \nIf you only add one shoe to your closet this year, make it a ruby red slipper. This one from Margaux has a 4.8-star rating from nearly 850 reviews, most of which praise the shoe’s plush, customizable fit and multi-width sizing. And if you need even more support, Anderson suggests adding a custom molded orthotic prescribed by a podiatrist—as over-the-counter options can sometimes be too bulky or thick.\nSizes: 3-14\nColors: 15 options\nMaterial: Nappa leather\nWidths: Narrow, Medium, Wide\nCustomer review: “A problem I have with most flats is that they’re a little too flat. I’ve had more success with Margaux flats than other brands because they have a little cushioning inside.”\nDesigned in nude shades and natural palettes, Rebecca Allen’s patent flat features breathable lining and a foam-cushioned footbed for squishy-soft support. Side note: If you have a wider foot, you may want to size up in these, given the pointed toe.\nSizes: 6-11\nColors: Black, Nude I, Nude II, Nude III, Nude IV\nMaterial: Leather\nCustomer review: “I own two pairs and absolutely love them and get so many compliments! I’ve never had a pair of flats/skims that don’t slip in my heel when walking UNTIL these!”\nA lovechild of the classic ballet flat and timeless loafer, this airy flat comes with a molded EVA insole and a memory foam midsole. It’s also available in multiple widths, so it’s great for those with particularly wide or narrow feet.\nSizes: 5-12\nColors: Black, Silver Metallic, Beige, Navy\nMaterial: Leather, fabric, synthetic\nWidths: Narrow, Medium, Wide\nCustomer review: “These shoes appealed to me straight away. They’re classic and comfortable. Dressed up or casual, I just love them.”\nNot only do these classic ballerinas add an unexpected pop of pastel to your fall wardrobe, but they also cradle your feet in molded, shock-absorbing EVA foam.\nSizes: 5-11\nColors: Jade, Natural Beige\nMaterial: Synthetic, microfiber\nCustomer review: “LOVE the jade green color!”\nIf you’re looking to add a little bedazzle and pizzazz to your everyday black-on-black ensemble, these flats from Birdies proudly display a subtle jacquard pattern and bejeweled strap, alongside seven layers of “cloud-like comfort” in the footbed.\nSizes: 5-12\nColors: 15 options\nMaterial: Jacquard, rubber\nCustomer review: “Super cute and comfortable flats! Felt a little snug at first, but fit well after wearing around the house for a little bit. Perfect addition to my workwear wardrobe!”\nAnderson lists Vionic as one of her favorite brands when it comes to comfort and support. Vionic prides itself on podiatrist-approved options, no matter the style. So rest assured that this cute, orthotic ballet flat hosts top-tier technology meant to hug your arches and support natural alignment. And if you’re still not sold, this style also received the American Pediatric Medical Association (APMA) Seal of Acceptance.\nSizes: 5-12\nColors: Navy, Gold, Pewter, Silver, Black\nMaterial: Leather or calf hair, microfiber, rubber\nWidths: Narrow, Medium, Wide\nCustomer review: “These are a dream come true! I have avoided wearing ballet flats for years because they usually lacked arch support. Vionic for the win...now I can wear them with full support for all day comfort!”\nThese charming, feminine flats have a removable PORON®-cushioned insole that focuses on offering maximum arch support. \nSizes: 5-11\nColors: Navy, Camel, Leopard, Black/White\nMaterial: Polyester, leather\nCustomer review: “These are incredibly comfortable. I wore them the first day for 10+ hours and no blisters!”\nThe classic black flat gets a sleek update in the form of this pointed-toe cutout style. Not only can you wear these with practically everything, but you’ll also be relieved to know they’re built with contour and comfort technology, so you can wear them (painlessly) all day long.\nSizes: 5-12\nColors: Black, Hazelnut, Silver\nMaterial: Synthetic\nWidths: Standard, Wide\nCustomer review: “Cute, dressy flat. Fits true to size, rubs slightly on my heel...but they are great for dressing up an outfit.”\nThese houndstooth slingback flats bring sophisticated details to a classic style—like a side cutout, oversized buckle, and a cushioned footbed with arch support. Perfect for pairing with your favorite sweater and neutral slacks.\nSizes: 5-11\nColors: Black Houndstooth, Tobacco, Brown, Black\nMaterial: Leather, synthetic, rubber\nCustomer review: “These shoes are beautiful! True to size fit and well made. I had read some reviews that said these shoes run small...this is not my experience. I may get another pair!”\nFitFlop burst onto the footwear scene in 2007 when they introduced biomechanically engineered sandals designed to complement “body structure, joint alignment and natural movement,” while still being non-ugly, of course. A hefty feat indeed, but they’ve overwhelmingly succeeded and expanded their footwear styles to include sneakers, boots, and flats—like this one with almost 300 5-star Amazon reviews.\nSizes: 5-11\nColors: 19 options\nMaterial: Leather, fabric, rubber\nCustomer review: “These were perfect...they fit so well they feel like slippers, especially with the subtly padded insole & cushioned outsole...they look like flats but have nice arch support.”\nTypically, actual ballet dancers have notoriously high arches in their feet. But arch support-specific shoes are usually best for lower arch, or flatter, feet. \n“Higher arch feet usually need more cushioning in the shoes for shock absorption than arch support, so I usually do not recommend an arch support shoe for these patients,” Anderson says. Whether your arches are high or low, you should always consult your doctor before ditching all your shoes for orthotics. If your feet are too flat, arch support can cause pesky callouses from excessive pressure along the arch. In this case, it’s best to seek out a custom orthotic that fits your shoes. \n“Ballet can be very hard on your feet,” Anderson notes, due to years of stretching and strengthening the midsole to stand on pointe. But ballet flats in general are “not considered a supportive shoe because they lack significant shoe structure, they have a narrow toe-box, and have no support for the foot,” she states. And a super thin flat with no support can make you feel like your feet are literally pounding the pavement all day long.\nTo counteract this, Anderson advises looking for flats that specifically tout arch support or a heel cup, and a wider toe-box to allow for more wiggle room in the shoes. However, if you do have severe podiatric woes, you may want to wear the style carefully. “I will caution that ballet flats are usually not as deep as other shoes, and this can lead to nail injury due to excessive pressure on the nails,” Anderson warns.\n15 Cute Puffer Totes to Shop ASAP\nThe Best Bags to Buy During Amazon’s Big Deals Day\nThe Best Amazon Fashion Deals to Shop Right Now\nShop These Deals on Amazon Shapewear \nThe 49 Best Gifts You Can Get on Amazon \nKeep These 18 Best Purse Brands on Your Radar Now\nA Hot Girl’s Guide to Amazon Halloween Costumes\n14 Jewelry Deals From Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days\n25 Suede Bags to Carry You Through The Fall Season\nThe Early Black Friday Fashion Sales to Shop Now\nShop Brands That Support Breast Cancer Awareness\nThe Launch: Fashion News to Know This September\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nFor when you need a bit of arm candy. \nWhile the rest of the world is mourning the departure of sunny weather and 9 p.m. sunsets, fashion aficionados are rejoicing over the arrival of fall—the ultimate season to cocoon ourselves in scarves, stomp around in our favorite boots, and show off all of the sweaters that have been piling up in our closets. ’Tis the season to layer and accessorize, and there are few pieces we love as much as a gorgeous handbag. \nWhere summer was all about canvas bags and straw totes fit for a picnic in the park or a day at the beach, fall assemblages call for a bit more repose and sophistication.

{"title": "The 25 Best ‘Sex and the City’ Guest Stars", "date": "2023-10-01 04:00:00", "text": "I couldn't help but wonder, who hasn't been on SATC?\nFor six seasons, Sex and the City was a revolving door for actors and actresses who were either fans of the show, friends of the show, or up-and-comers who just wanted to be part of the action. Some played versions of themselves (Matthew McConaughey, Lucy Liu), while others were barely recognizable (a young Kat Dennings, Andy Cohen). Here, a look back at some of the famous faces who crossed paths with Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte over the years.\nAll episodes are available to stream on Max\nJack (Bradley Cooper) was bad news from the beginning. As Carrie says in the episode, \"They Shoot Single People, Don't They?\" Jack was everything she needed at 2 a.m. on a Tuesday at a gay bar: single, straight, smoker. It could've been the greasy hair, the tempting smoking habit (she was trying really hard to quit), or the fact that Jack later discovered Carrie's \"Single & Fabulous?\" New York Magazine cover story — the two never did anything more than make out in a crowded bar and briefly, in his convertible. \nIn “The Perfect Present,” Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda head to a purse party thrown by the recently dumped Vanessa, played by the queen of the bend-and-snap. “Isn’t life funny? Because of that fucker, I’ve discovered, I’m Fendi!” she says in the episode, moments before walking into Samantha and Smith (in his pre-Gus Van Sant days) boning against several glass racks. \nGeri Halliwell played Phoebe, someone Samantha runs into on one of the hottest days of the summer. While fanning herself, Samantha learns (via Phoebe) that the pool at Soho House is the place to be, that is, if you can get past the waiting list. Enter: Annabelle Bronstein, whose membership card Samantha finds in the bathroom and uses a few times before her jig is up.\nBetween the end of The X-Files (the OG run) and the beginning of Californication, David Duchovny guest starred on several TV shows including Sex and the City. He played Jeremy, Carrie’s high school boyfriend (sorry, \"sweetheart\") who completely sweeps her off her feet before revealing he’s starting treatment at a mental institution in Connecticut. Here he is welcoming Carrie to the Juneau Spears Center, a place harder to get into (and out) of than the Soho House.\nJustin Theroux had the distinct honor of guest starring on SATC twice. On the season one episode, “The Monogamists,” Justin played Jared, a writer friend of Stanford’s who had a thing for giving the thumbs-up and was named one of  New York Magazine’s “30 Coolest People Under 30.” His character didn’t venture too far in the occupation department the second time around; on the season two episode “Shortcomings,” Justin played Vaughn, a fiction writer who orgasms too fast (hence, the episode’s title). \nIn the same episode where Samantha famously said, “I don’t believe in the Republican party or the Democratic party; I believe in parties,” Elizabeth Banks checked off one of her very first TV roles. In “Politically Erect,” Elizabeth played Catherine, the pearl-wearing fiancée of a politician Charlotte had set her eyes on at a fundraiser. According to Catherine, she met Bob, the fiancée, at a party where women brought guys they didn't want to date, leading a martini-filled Charlotte to mumble something about one women's trash becoming another's treasure.\nJohn Slattery played politician Bill Kelley, who was running for city treasurer and famously told Carrie, \"I love making love with you,\" before asking her to pee on him in the shower. When Carrie offered to \"dribble warm tea\" on him instead, Bill dumped her, citing that his campaign advisors didn't like her sex column. This of course, led Carrie to write a bit called, \"To Pee or Not To Pee?\" without using his real name. \"It was much more political not to,\" she said on the episode.\nReason #2409 why you should never date someone you meet at your therapist’s office: Seth, played by Jon Bon Jovi in “Games People Play.” In the episode, Seth takes Carrie out to dinner, plays a sexy game of Twister, and tells her he’s in therapy because he’s “really fucked up about women… after I sleep with them I lose interest” — after sleeping with Carrie.\nRemember when Samantha used Lucy Liu’s name for a Birkin bag that had a 5-year waiting list? On “Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda,” Samantha committed this very crime – a travesty in the PR world – and got caught by Lucy, who played herself on the episode.\nIn the L.A.-set episode, appropriately titled \"Escape From New York,\" SMG played Debbie, the \"most ambitious and feared creature,\" according to Carrie. Debbie was a junior development executive who really, really wanted to make a movie out of Carrie's columns. She also predicted that the movie would be \"chick flick big\" before declaring that the man who came up with that term \"should have his balls cut off.\"\nIn the same L.A. episode as SMG, Matthew McConaughey played a hyper version of himself who was interested in Carrie's movie and her columns. In a cringe-worthy business meeting, the SATC version of Matthew declared that he wanted to play Mr. Big and sleep with Carrie, all while biting on a toothpick. \"We are animals, men, women, walking the earth,\" he said in this scene. \"We are made of head, heart, and loins. We're talking about using them, am I right?\" Nah. Carrie was good, which is why she GTFO of there.\n\nBefore she was Bailey on Grey’s Anatomy, Chandra Wilson played a cop who confronted Samantha about her Richard “CHEATER” posters in the episode titled \"Anchors Away.\" When Samantha explained, “This man said he loved me, and I caught him eating another woman’s pussy,” the extremely understanding cop backed off in full support of this public shaming.\nCarrie’s columns never did turn into a movie, but they did turn into a book thanks to the brains of Lily Martin, book agent, played by Molly Shannon. Together with Courtney Masterson (Amy Sedaris; see next slide), Lily transformed Carrie's words  into something with a spine. At their first meeting, Lily got right to the point: “Is it hopeful? What's the message? What’s your point of view, after all the break ups and disappointments and train wrecks? You still believe he’s out there, right?” That gasp you heard? Millions of people asking why after all these years, Lily still knows what they’re thinking. \nWhen she was not finishing Lily’s sentences, Courtney (Amy Sedaris) was busy introducing future lovers to each other. Case in point: Carrie and Berger, who met while Carrie was in a book meeting with Courtney at her office. Hard to believe this relationship eventually ended with a Post-it note by way of The Hamptons, motorcycle rides, and a white noise machine that only took Carrie to the rainforest.\nBefore he was Tag on Friends, Eddie Cahill played Sean, Carrie’s bisexual “generation-something else” fling that she met at a party celebrating his “internet magazine… that I still couldn’t find on my computer.” Carrie Bradshaw and her internet talk! Despite the fact that they had a great time on her ice skating date (she smoked and drank on the ice like a rebellious young!) Carrie was not prepared for where he took her to next: a party attended by the next SATC guest star on this list...\n... Alanis! On \"Boy, Girl, Boy Girl..\" the Canadian singer played Dawn, who kisses Carrie in a game of spin the bottle. Following the experience, which \"wasn't bad, kind of like chicken,\" Carrie went home and confirmed that she was indeed  \"too old to play this game.\" Other than Carrie's giant flower brooch (which of course got an update in one of the movies), this kiss was a shining moment for the episode.\nTo give back, Charlotte volunteered to be a guide for the blind on season six. Part of her training required walking in public with a mask and a guide to experience what the blind experience. Enter: Carrie, who fails miserably as Charlotte's guide. I guess this is why you shouldn't perform these training exercises at a Barneys, especially with stellar shoe salesmen like this one, played by SJP's real-life BFF Andy Cohen, around.\nThere was no one better than Kat Dennings for the role of Jenny Brier, a bratty, lip-gloss wearing 13-year-old who asks Samantha to plan her Bat Mitzvah on season three. When Samantha hesitates, Jenny name drops Carson Daly and \"The Clintons\" (who \"of course can't make it\") before casually revealing her bank account: \"We'd be lucky if we can swing this for under a mil.\" To which Samantha responds, \"We'll never get *NSYNC.\"\nOn an episode titled \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" Samantha has a fling with Adam, a director who has well, funky spunk. When he says she's just trying to avoid blowjobs and that they're \"easy,\" Samantha, arguably the best sex-ed teacher (and life coach) on TV, launches into one of the most memorable SATC speeches: \"I love giving head. Easy? You men have no idea what we're dealing with down there. Teeth placement, jaw stress, suction, gag reflex, all the while bobbing up and down trying to breathe through our noses. Easy? Honey, they don't call it a job for nothing.\" Mic. Drop.\nOn season four, Margaret Cho played Lynne, a fashion show producer who recruits Carrie to walk in a show that features New Yorkers and models alike. “No one is more New York or has more style than you,” she says on the episode, “The Real Me.” When Carrie hesitates, Lynne delivers another convincing command: “You’re fucking doing my show. If I have to hunt you down, skin you alive, and have one of the models fucking wear you.” The only problem with this character was that there was not enough of her. Imagine her having a showdown with Samantha?\nPeggy is Cosmopolitan.com’s entertainment writer, specializing in Leonardo DiCaprio, This Is Us, and the royals.

Brandon Maxwell leaned into a skin-focused beauty look, utilizing Noble Panacea products for a hydrated, fresh glow. \nDo you want to peek into the future to see what’s in store for 2024? Katie Jane Hughes, celebrity makeup artist and founder of KJH.brand whose clients include Hailey Bieber and Karlie Kloss as well as Kim Baker, celebrity makeup artist and founder of Glamazon Beauty divulge to ELLE.com all top Spring 2024 makeup trends, fresh off the runway!\nGraphic liner, floating eyeliner—whatever you want to call it, it’s a vibe and you will see it all Spring/Summer 2024. This graphic liner look on Paloma Elsesser at Eckhaus Latta gives a butterfly wing effect and plays up her high cheekbones. \n“I love how a graphic eye can be an accessory to your look,” shares Katie Jane Hughes in response to the Jil Sander show at Milan Fashion Week.\nCelebrity makeup artist and Lancôme Global International Makeup Artist Sheika Dailey took us to the year 3000 with this futuristic cat eye. Playing with negative space and floating lines in the inner eye, ups the sex appeal of this sultry look. “It’s editorial yet still super wearable and sexy,” says Hughes. You can read more about the look, here.\n“I predict that the Spring/Summer ’24 makeup trends are going to be all about vibrant, bold, color eyeliners,” shares Glamazon Beauty founder and celebrity makeup artist Kim Baker. Curious as to which colors? Baker says, “Eyeliner in bold over the top shades such as Periwinkle, royal blue, vibrant red, and shocking pink” will be all over the lids of trendsetters and beauty girlies next spring.\nHughes also agrees that color eyeliner is a big Spring/Summer ’24 trend. “I love how they matched the eye look to the fashion at Helmut Lang,” says Hughes. “In 2024, the vibrant color lined eye will dominate the street and our makeup bag,” adds Baker.\nDon’t have colored eyeliner? You can fake it with eyeshadow. “We saw royal blue being used at shows such as Altier Ndigo. Makeup artist T. Cooper used the shade ‘Oshun’ featured in the Supreme Being Palette by Glamazon Beauty to create a killer eye look that works for runway to real-way,” says Baker.\nFor Spring/Summer ’24, imperfection is perfection. And while we normally see this trend with the hair, this season, it’s visible with makeup in a bold, bright way. The mismatched eyeshadow seen at Chopova Lowena was a favorite for Hughes. She shares, “I think this is a really cool and fresh take on how to do eyeshadow that is unusual and out of the box.”\nAt Phillip Lim 3.1, this neon, one shadow look plays up negative space in opposite accords.\n“The look I kept seeing across the board was glowing skin. Everyone had dewy, glowing skin and I can’t think of a better feature to play up for Spring and Summer,” says Baker. At Retrofete, it was all about sexy, glowy, and hydrated skin. Elyse Reneau, Executive Director of Global Beauty at Too Faced states, “Humidity has never looked so sculpted!” \nAt Altuzurra, celebrity makeup artist Diane Kendal showcased her famous “flawless face” technique that she developed early in her career. It focuses on making skin look as radiant and perfect as possible, using minimal makeup.\nMermaidcore gets an update for Spring/Summer ’24. At Sandy Liang, rhinestones were placed haphazardly around the eyes to mimic barnacles. Into this look? You can read our full take on it, here.\nMermaidcore is more than just rhinestones and shades of blue and green. Jason Wu’s interpretation highlights healthy skin. “Inspired by Jason’s vision of experiencing rebirth after a shipwreck, we crafted a cohesive makeup look that exuded a dewy, aquatic allure,” shares Kendal, who was the Lead Makeup Artist. Wu’s Kindness For Your Lips Lip Oil was applied on the high cheekbones for a luminous glow.\nIf a sensual siren decided to attend a rave, this look is how I envision their makeup. The amalgamation of blue, green, and yellow mimics underwater coral reefs and is a festival of color for the eyes. Somewhere, somehow, I think Ariel would approve. \nDanielle James is the Digital Beauty Director of ELLE.com.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nCan you stop your stomach issues with a single capsule? \nWhen we think about bacteria, negative connotations often come to mind. But, not all bacteria is bad, and probiotics are the prime example of what health experts call good bacteria. “Probiotics are friendly, healthy, good-for-you bacteria that work to improve your health,” says Dr. Roshini Raj, a gastroenterologist, author, and founder of Tula Skincare. Most notably, probiotics can help to promote a healthy gut, but these essential microorganisms can also lead to clear skin, a high-performing immune system, and balanced pH levels (down there) for women. \nAs for how to ingest probiotics, it’s essential to note that they are naturally found in foods like greek yogurt, kombucha, and kimchi. However, depending on your diet, you might not consume enough probiotics on a daily basis. In that case, you might want to consider taking probiotic supplements. “When choosing a probiotic supplement, the first step is to look at the ingredients,” Dr. Raj advises. “You want powerful ingredients that are not only good for you but that will also be effective.”\nThere are an array of probiotic supplements that are formulated to target specific concerns, so the first step is to understand what exactly you need help with. For example, if you are experiencing digestive issues, the Cleveland Clinic suggests selecting a capsule that contains lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, bacillus or saccharomyces boulardii. We know these names sound extremely complicated, so it might also make sense to consult your doctor or a professional that could point you in the right direction.\nAccording to Dr. Raj, if you incorporate effective probiotic supplements into your diet, you should start to feel, and look, much healthier. “After my patients began probiotic treatments, I saw a significant improvement not only in their internal health but also in their appearance,\" says Dr. Raj. “Oftentimes their skin was calmer and clearer and I could tell they were feeling better before they had the chance to tell me.” But don’t just take Dr. Raj’s word, try it yourself! \nAhead, scroll through a list of the best probiotics to improve your overall health.  \nGarden of Life’s probiotics are crafted specifically for women  to support vaginal, digestive, and immune health.

And I definitely notice a difference when I switch to other brands.”\nFormulated by gastroenterologist and skincare brand founder, Tula’s probiotic is focused on giving you your best skin ever. More specifically, these capsules are infused with ceramides, which help to promote hydrated skin.  \nType: Capsule \nDosage: 1 daily \nCertified: Non-GMO, gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free  \nTula Rating: 4.1/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: \"Just finishing my 30-day supply.

I haven’t noticed any changes as far as helping with bloating but will try it for another 30 days and see if I notice a difference.”\nHUM Nutrition is renowned for creating effective  supplements, and these potent Gut Instinct capsules are spiked with 10 strains of probiotics for better digestion and immunity. Clinical studies conducted by HUM proved that 90% of customers were satisfied after regularly consuming the Gut Instinct capsules.\nType: Capsule \nDosage: 1 daily \nCertified: Vegan  \nBlue Mercury Rating:: 4.7/5\nWhat reviewers are saying:  “I have taken other probiotics before and have not felt as comfortable in my gut as I do with Gut Instinct!

{"title": "The 10 Best Collagen Supplements for Hair Growth", "date": "2023-09-30 23:37:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nEager to have luscious locks? Look no further. \nThere’s nothing more upsetting than looking in the mirror and noticing sparse areas of hair on your scalp— dare we say bald spots. For those of you who have dealt with hair loss or hair thinning, you've probably gone down a rabbit hole of research, attempting to discover the best ways to restore your beloved strands. While desperately scouring the internet for answers, we're guessing that you came across a variety of hair growth shampoos and hair growth oils . And perhaps you found a thing or two about collagen.\nOn a basic level, collagen is one of the most abundant structural proteins found in the body. Composed of several types of amino acids, this powerful protein helps to promote skin elasticity, support muscular health, and encourage hair growth. “The most abundant amino acids in collagen are glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and arginine, which are crucial for maintaining the health, elasticity, and strength of skin and hair,” says Dr. Dusan Sajic, board certified dermatologist. Thus, it comes as no surprise that many of us rely on collagen supplements to foster thriving hair.  \nConsuming collagen supplements can be a great after-the-fact solution, but it should also be considered as a preventative measure, especially as we get older.  “As we age, not only do we produce less collagen, we also lose excessive collagen due to environmental stressors like UV exposure, smoke exposure, and poor health habits,” says Shannon Augustine, board certified aesthetic nurse practitioner. But fear not, because luckily, there are plenty of collagen supplements that exist— from capsules to powders, and even liquids. Ahead, we’ve curated a list of the best collagen products for hair growth and we've also consulted medical and cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Dusan Sajic as well as aesthetic nurse practicioner Shannon Augustine, who have shared everything you need to know about collagen. \nVital Proteins’ formula is packed with hydrolyzed collagen peptides that help promote hair growth in addition to encouraging nail, bone, and joint health. Simply take a scoop of this powder and mix it into your favorite drink for your daily dose of collagen. \nType: Powder \nKey Ingredients: Collagen peptides, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid\nCertified: Paleo-friendly, gluten-free, dairy-free \nAmazon Rating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I noticed my hair was growing faster. I didn't measure it, but I feel convinced that I've experienced faster hair growth.”\nAnthony’s Collagen Peptide Powder is extracted from grass fed cattle,  which makes this blend rich in protein. And despite the fact that this collagen is animal-derived, Anthony’s formula is crafted without hormones, steroids, and antibiotics. \nType: Powder  \nKey Ingredients: Collagen peptides, pure hydrolysate\nCertified: Gluten-free, non-GMO\nAmazon Rating: 4.6/5 \nWhat reviewers are saying: “I’ve used this collagen consistently for a few years. I put it in my morning coffee or smoothies. My skin looks brighter and my hair is noticeably healthier.”— Danielle James, Beauty Director, ELLE.com \nAccording to Spoiled Child’s website, users reported stronger hair simply after 6 weeks of consuming the E27 Extra Strength Liquid Collagen on a regular basis.  For the best results, it's recommended to take one to two tablespoons a day.\nType: Liquid  \nKey Ingredients: Collagen Peptides, vitamin C, hyaluronic acid\nCertified: Sugar-free, gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, non-GMO\nSpoiled Child Rating:  4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “The mango flavor adds a little sweetness and kick to my morning smoothies. I love that it has hyaluronic acid—the hero ingredient in the Hailey Beiber Erewhon smoothie. Now I can have a hydrating smoothieat home for a fraction of the price.” — Danielle James, Beauty Director, ELLE.com \nThese citrus flavored gummies are not formulated with any animal-derived ingredients, so they're perfect for those who are on a vegetarian or vegan diet.  In addition to collagen and biotin, these gummies are also infused with zinc, which is a crucial element regarding hair growth. \nType: Gummies  \nKey Ingredients: Collagen, biotin, zinc\nCertified: Vegan, cruelty-free, gluten-free\nSephora Rating: 5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I’ve tried my fair share of skin, hair and nail gummies and these are my favorite. I’ve been trying to grow out my hair after bleaching it for a year and I needed all the help I could get. The best part is they taste great!”\nIf you love the taste of pomegranate, you won’t be able to resist NeoCell’s liquid collagen blend. Formulated with vitamin C, this nourishing mixture helps to strengthen hair strands.   \nType: Liquid  \nKey Ingredients: Collagen, vitamin C\nCertified: Gluten-free\nAmazon Rating: 4.4/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I’m not losing hair like I have been for several years. So few hairs in the brush after one month of two tablespoons each night. It's thicker, as well.”\n Kourtney Kardashian is all about living a healthy lifestyle, so it comes as no surprise that she translates that same mindset into her brand, Lemme. Lemme’s biotin and collagen supplements come in the form of delicious gummies that are comprised of natural nutrients like biotin and zinc, which promote hair, skin, and nail health. \nType:  Gummies \nKey Ingredients: Grass-fed collagen peptides, biotin, vitamin C\nCertified: Non-GMO, dairy-free, gluten-free, soy-free, paraben-free\nAmazon Rating: 4.9/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I started using Lemme Glow on a whim, and it’s become a must-have in my beauty routine. It's made my skin smoother, and my hair and nails look healthier than ever.”\nIf you’re always on the go, it might be helpful to pop a bottle of collagen capsules into your purse. We highly recommend  Ancient Nutrition’s Collagen Peptide Pills as they’re great for rejuvenating various parts of your body including your hair, joints, and nails. \nType:  Capsules\nKey Ingredients: Bovine collagen, ashwagandha root and leaf extract, amla berry extract \nCertified: Non-GMO, keto friendly, dairy-free, gluten-free, soy-free\nRating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “Noticed results within a couple of weeks! My nails grew and weren’t brittle anymore, my hair was thicker and my skin is definitely looking and feeling better!”\nA few drops a day will keep the thin hair away. Raw Science’s liquid collagen and biotin drops help to generate healthy strands, especially for women who are struggling with hair loss. If you enjoy sipping on tea, try putting a few drops of this liquid mixture into a cup of lemon ginger tea for a tasty drink. \nType:  Liquid \nKey Ingredients: Biotin, bovine collagen peptides, vegetable glycerin, natural raspberry flavor \nCertified: Gluten-free\nLemme Rating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I’ve been using this supplement for two years now. It definitely helps to grow your hair and nails out quickly. Easy to use.”\nThere are various kinds of collagen, and one of the most popular types is marine collagen. Marine collagen, extracted from fish, is specifically coveted for its ability to absorb more quickly into the body in comparison to bovine or porcine collagen. If you’re interested in trying out marine collagen, consider Amandean's  Marine Collagen Peptides which supports smooth hair and skin.\nType:  Powder\nKey Ingredients: Water hydrolyzed marine collagen, lime extract, aloe vera extract\nCertified: Gluten-free, soy-free, shellfish-free, keto friendly \nAmazon Rating: 4.4/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “This collagen powder is great for hair and nail growth and joint pain.

My hair is so thick and grows very fast.”\nFor those seeking a collagen blend packed with extra protein, look no further than Garden of Life’s Grass Fed Collagen Peptides Powder. With 18 grams of protein, this blend contributes to skin elasticity and healthy hair. \nType:  Powder\nKey Ingredients: Grass fed collagen peptides\nCertified: Gluten-free, non-GMO\nAmazon Rating: 4.5/5\nWhat reviewers are saying: “I can’t believe how much this Garden of Life collagen powder has improved my overall health. Not only does it promote healthy skin, hair, and nails, but it also provides proven joint mobility support.”\nDr. Sajic tells ELLE.com that collagen is a protein formulated with amino acids that provide structure, elasticity, and strength to both skin and hair. “Altogether around fifty-six percent or more of the amino acids in collagen are foundational for skin and hair proteins, and thus has a great ratio that will contribute directly to hair health and vitality,” Dr. Sajic explains. \nHowever, it’s essential to understand that while collagen can certainly help to solve some of your hair problems, maintaining a healthy diet is equally important. “Optimal hair health also requires a more comprehensive approach, including other proteins, vitamins, minerals, and care practices,” Dr. Sajic says. \nAlthough collagen is widely recognized for its ability to promote healthy hair and skin, this abundant protein also plays a crucial role in other bodily functions including joint health and bone health. “Collagen assists in maintaining the integrity of cartilage, which is essential for healthy joints, and it helps to maintain bone density, which is crucial for preventing age-related bone issues like osteoporosis,” Dr. Sajic explains. \nIf you’re looking to target these areas of your body, or simply interested in a supplement that provides a cohesive approach, it’s worth incorporating collagen supplements into your daily wellness routine. \nAlso to note, some collagen supplements are infused with additional nutrients that help to nourish the body. “Collagen supplements may also include vitamins like vitamin C, zinc, vitamin B, and omega-3s which further support your body and health,” Augustine says. \nSo, we’ve heard about all the wonderful benefits of collagen but are there any side effects? Dr. Sajic shares that although collagen is generally safe for most individuals, there are a few things to note. “Some may experience side effects like stomach discomfort, a bad taste or possible allergic reactions,” Dr. Sajic says. “It’s essential to choose high-quality collagen supplements and consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new supplement regimen,” he adds.\nTo avoid allergic reactions, or any added ingredients that might not sit well with your body, Augustine also suggests taking the time to thoroughly read the ingredient labels.  \n“You should always talk to your health care provider before taking any oral supplements or medications,” says Augustine. She also explains that consulting a healthcare professional is especially important if you are taking daily medications or have serious drug or food allergies.\nDr. Sajic shares that those with fish, pork, or bovine allergies should avoid collagen, as many collagen supplements are derived from these animal sources. “It’s also important to talk to your doctor if you have liver or kidney disease, as the excess protein may put extra stress on these organs,” he adds. \nCollagen supplements exist in many forms— including liquid, powder, and capsules— but they all have relatively equal effects. \"There are not enough non-bias studies to suggest that one is better than the other,” Augustine shares. \nAt the end of the day, it simply boils down to your personal preferences, lifestyle, and dietary restrictions. “Liquid collagen can be consumed directly or mixed into beverages, while powder can be added to smoothies, coffee, or baked goods,” Dr. Sajic says. If you would prefer not to mix collagen with your food or drink, you can always take a capsule. However, Dr. Sajic notes that depending on the capsule, it might not be absorbed as efficiently as other forms of collagen. \n“For most people, collagen should be taken once daily,” Dr. Sajic says. “Dosage can range from 2.5 to 15 grams daily, depending on the individual’s age, health, and specific skin or hair concerns.” And as with anything, patience and consistency is key, so make sure that you keep track of your collagen intake. “It may take several weeks, if not three to four months, for you to start noticing the benefits of collagen supplements,” Dr. Sajic adds.\nDr. Dusan Sajic is a board-certified medical and cosmetic dermatologist, the director of the Derma Skin Institute, and the creator of  Sajic Skin.\nShannon Augustine, NP is a is a board certified nurse practitioner and self-proclaimed expert injector at  SkinSpirit.\nAs a leading publisher of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty content, ELLE.com is committed to highlighting the best products in various categories by personally testing the latest and most innovative products, interviewing countless experts, and vetting customer-loved items.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nThe hair of your dreams awaits.\nIf frizz didn't exist, many of us would be happy campers. Sometimes, battling frizz can feel like a full-time job, especially when factors like humidity work against you, and buying a plethora of products to ward off frizz sometimes doesn't seem worth the trouble. Sure, the market is brimming with several quick fixes that can momentarily smooth down flyaways, like hair oils or leave-in conditioners. But odds are, if you’ve been battling frizz your whole life, you’ve heard something about keratin.\nKeratin treatments are an in-salon service that reduces frizz and adds shine to your hair; they can be pricey, and when done incorrectly, potentially damaging. However, whether you opt for a salon treatment or not, you can still get the smoothing, healing, and repairing benefits of keratin right in your shower. “If you’ve got frizzy locks and are afraid to take the leap and get a full-on keratin treatment at the salon, then a keratin shampoo is a great way to start,” says Clayton Hawkins, Los Angeles-based celebrity hairstylist who counts Olivia Rodrigo and Dove Cameron as clients. Ahead, find the 13 best keratin shampoos that can alleviate frizz.\nGetting a keratin treatment will make you feel like you're on top of the world. However, maintaining your treatment to prolong that feeling comes with work, specifically a proper at-home hair routine. Gussi's \"protection plan\" line was specifically designed to follow up the brand's own at-home keratin treatment. This shampoo adds sheen and fights frizz. \nSize: 8.1 fl oz \nSulfate-free: Yes\nAmazon rating: 3.4/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I can have the best of both worlds rocking nice curls or getting a smooth straight blow out without feeling like I’m severely damaging my hair. I was doubtful, but after 2 uses and being able to have frizz free days, I believe that this is very helpful and so much better than using products for permanent results. It was easy to use and really impressed with the results it delivers.”\nThe “morpo-keratine” technology in this product restores the flexibility of the hair to help create voluminous body with structure.\nSize: 8.5 fl. oz.\nSulfate-free: Yes\nAmazon rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I started using this shampoo several months ago. My hair look healthier, shinier, and more alive. A bit pricey though but I'm happy with the outcome. It does work.”\nOne of Amazon’s top-reviewed shampoos, Purebiology’s RevivaHair Growth Stimulating & Anti Hair Loss formula, is packed with active ingredients to treat thinning or damaged hair. The natural extracts in the cleanser include biotin and keratin, which work in tandem to stimulate hair growth.\nSize: 8 fl. oz.Sulfate-free: Yes\nAmazon rating: 4.2/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I purchased this at the recommendation of my hairstylist, who swears by it! The shampoo doesn't foam up as much as others, but I did notice a difference in my hair thickness and strength. Will continue to use, as hair turnover takes time to really see the full impact.”\nThis keratin-infused product prevents breakage and works to repair all the signs of heat damage. If you’re constantly using a flat iron or blow dryer, grab this to restore lost moisture and nutrients while in the shower.\nSize: 8 fl. oz.Sulfate-free: Yes\nAmazon rating: 4.6/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “My hair regained luster; feels healthy and thicker!”\nHair damaged by heat or chemicals can reap the benefits of this shampoo which works overtime to repair and strengthen the hair.

I notice my hair feels more manageable after using this shampoo. I feel less breakage with this shampoo. I would definitely recommend this!”\nWeak, damaged hair is often limp and lifeless.

After continued use, your hair should appear and feel fuller, thicker, and stronger.\nSize: 8 fl. oz.Sulfate-free: Yes\nAmazon rating: 4.4/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “Love this stuff! It's great for my thin hair.”\nThis Keratin Complex shampoo provides a gentle cleanse to color-treated hair.

Double up and use the Keratin Complex conditioner from the same line to further hydrate and restore your hair’s protein.\nSize: 13.5 fl. oz.Sulfate-free: No\nUlta rating: 4.2/5 stars\nAn Ulta reviewer says: “I love the way it cleanses my hair! Has it feeling refreshed, and softer.”\nPreviously, if you’ve had a Brazilian keratin treatment, there wasn’t a need to use a keratin-based shampoo or conditioner, but this product works with the treatment to maintain the health of your hair and leave it feeling full and healthy longer.\nSize: 13.5 fl. oz.\nSulfate-free: Yes\nAmazon rating: 4.5/5 stars\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “I wash my hair once a week and these products keep the frizz at bay the entire time.

If you already have a keratin treatment, “Keratin shampoos help protect your investment by prolonging the smoothness of the cuticle,” says Perteet.\nEven if you have un-treated hair, keratin shampoos can still help keep frizz at bay. “If you have frizzy/coarse hair texture, keratin shampoo is a great option to help smooth your hair,” says Rasmussen. “Over time it creates a coating on the hair that will help fill in the pores in your hair to make it smooth and shiny.”\nAs a leading publisher of fashion, lifestyle, and beauty content, ELLE.com is committed to highlighting the best products in various categories by personally testing the latest and most innovative products, interviewing countless experts, and vetting customer-loved items.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nMega volume and shine are just a spritz (or rinse) away.\nWe owe a big apology to our hair for all the stress we put it through, from constant hot styling to packing on heavy formulas, to frequent manipulation. That said, breakage, thinning, and dryness are inevitable. \nEvery story begins the same way: You notice your hair has been breaking off more than usual and immediately log on to Amazon to secure a bottle of the best hair growth vitamins or hair growth shampoos. Thankfully, there are several additional hair care treatments that encourage growth, give limp strands more volume, and fortify hair bonds to stop further breaking.\nBecause hair loss is such a sore spot and insecurity for many, the internet is brimming with products that make lofty promises to give you the luscious, full mane of your dreams. That's why we decided to help cut through the noise to find the ones that are actually worth your coins. We pored over dozens of customer feedback to find 17 of the top-reviewed hair thickening products that will blow you away.\nScalp care is the best care for restoring your hair. Vegamour's serum contains rich antioxidants to minimize breakage and shedding that leads to excessive hair loss.\nSize: 1 fl oz \nAmazon star rating: 4.1/5\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I started with the brow serum and it worked so well that I had to try the serum for my thinning hair. I didn’t tell anyone that I was using it, but when my grandma told me that she wishes she had thick hair like mine I figured that was the best testimonial it could get, because I have never had thick hair! And I’m only 3/4 of the way through my first bottle! I’m truly grateful for this stuff!”\nTopical remedies can aid in hair restoration, but why not work directly at the source? Nutrafol's supplements are packed with a bevy of good-for-you vitamins to boost health and overall hair growth.\nSize: 120 capsules\nAmazon star rating: 4.3/5 \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I’ve used other top-of-the-line hair support products for 15 years but nothing compares to this. I’d lost almost 1/2 of my hair after covid and this made my hair grow back freaky fast and healthy! It’s super soft, shiny and thick again. I’m going to take this exclusively from now on & not bother with the others.”\nA TikTok fave, this serum from The Ordinary uses ingredients like Procapil (commonly used in hair growth products) and Baicapil to reboot hair density and increase blood flow in the scalp.\nSize: 2 oz\nSephora star rating: 3.9/5\nA Sephora reviewer said: “I got this for my mom because she started losing her hair after local radiation and her hair has never looked better! She is so happy with it and her hairline is so much fuller now.”\nInstead of massaging a sticky serum into your hair, Oribe's Serene Scalp Thickening Hair Treatment is a spray formula that addresses hair thinning and loss from the root. The treatment conditions, nourishes, and restores with just a few sprays.\nSize: 4.2 fl oz \nSephora star rating: 3.9/5\nA Sephora reviewer said: “I expected this to either make my hair greasy or frizzy. When it worked great the first time I expected it to just last one day max. Then I thought ‘I’m ok, it’ll just last from wash to wash; not be cumulative.’ But my hair was fuller even when you just washed & dried without using the spray. And my thin, fine, color treated hair loves it! If you’re thinking of trying it Definitely do! I Highly Recommend this spray!!”\nThis treatment is all about helping your hair, well, flourish. The lightweight formula restores balance and strengthens the hair from the scalp to promote regrowth.\nSize: 4 fl oz\nSephora star rating: 4.9/5\nA Sephora reviewer said: “I love this product for my thin hair! It gives some volume and it makes my hair look healthy! I use it every night, dry or wet and it doesn’t leave any grease unlike other thickening products. I also love the smell, it is light and fresh. I doesn’t irritate my scalp or make it drier. I just hope I can see changes for some hair growth, maybe if I continue to use it consistently.”\nYou've likely heard all of TikTok praise Mielle Organic's viral Rosemary Mint oil. Stimulating the scalp with a minty-fresh sensation, this oil softens and strengthens weak, brittle hair. \nSize: 2 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.6/5\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I recently lost my edges due to low iron and braiding. After bringing my blood level up, I wanted to try something to grow my hair back. Within 2 months I noticed a change in my edges. My hairline is fuller. This is a MUST buy. My edges were very thin and braiding them made it worse. But using this changed my hairline life. It leaves a soothing feeling.”\nSometimes, instant results are what you need. Nioxin's Styling Thickening Gel allows your hair to appear thicker no matter what style you choose. \nSize: 5.1 fl oz\nUlta star rating: 4.3/5\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “I've been using this product for almost 10 years, since the last time I transitioned back to natural waves. It mixes so well with curl products and other stylers, and it's good whether you leave your hair to air dry or heat style. It's so versatile and easy to use. Recommend!”\nLiving Proof makes it easy to fluff and volumize your hair instantly. This texture spray doesn't leave behind a crunchy mess and keeps the hair full of body and bounce.\nSize: 7.5 fl oz\nSephora star rating: 4.5/5\nA Sephora reviewer said: “My all-time favorite. I’m on my 4th bottle and the bottle itself lasts forever. I have bleached processed hair (balayage) and curl it practically everyday. I’ve noticed such a difference when I stopped using it bc I ran out. People notice the volume. It doesn’t weigh my hair down or make it feel like it has residue.”\nThis powerhouse product detangles, softens, and hydrates the hair, among other things. The MVP of the formula is Emblica Technology, which plumps lifeless, dull strands and brings them back to life. \nSize: 6.7 fl oz\nUlts star rating: 4.2/5\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “I have long hair down past my butt and it still gave my hair a good amount of lift and body. It is pretty darn pricey but already it works. It smells good and is easy to use. I'm going to try it again and curl my hair and see how it works with that.”\nHere's a shampoo that breaks down the gunk, oil, and dirt that threaten your hair daily to reveal refreshed, bouncy hair. Even better, it's safe for those with color, whether a bad DIY job or professionally treated. \nSize: 8.5 fl oz \nUlta star rating: 4/5\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “I have thin, flat hair, tends toward greasy. This is a great shampoo for fullness and volume. Yes, you still need to style with volumizing products if you want major lift, but this is a great everyday (or every 3 days in my case) shampoo. It is not moisturizing — it is thickening. If you want moisture, use a moisturizing shampoo.”\nTreat your scalp to a boost of caffeine, ginger root, and arginine, all working together to build resistance and strengthen to prevent further breakage or shedding. \nSize: 3.04 fl oz\nSephora rating: 3.9/5\nA Sephora reviewer said: “This product has been amazing for me. I’ve noticed a lot less shedding and my hair feels stronger. My scalp feels great. I apply it at night before bed, and I haven’t noticed too much of a crunchy feeling or residue. I daresay that my roots look thicker with new growth! I’ve been using the system with shampoo, conditioner, and the blow dry primer. I’ve always struggled with fine hair, but lately my shedding and texture has been a concern. I highly recommend this serum!”\nIf your hair needs more shine, growth, and strength, and less breakage and thinning, the antidote could be found in this Amazon best-seller. Massage this scalp serum into your hair to boost moisture (not too much or it can get really oily) and manageability. \nSize: 4 fl oz \nAmazon star rating: 4.2/5\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “So far this product is helping with my hair thinning around my face for hair loss. I have new hair growth coming up. Looking a lot better. Good product so far.”\nWhen your hair is already feeling lifeless, the last thing you need is heavy products weighing down your hair even more. Good thing this Kristin Ess spray has a lightweight formula that imparts shine and volumizes the hair, perfect for bombshell blowouts. \nSize: 8.45 fl oz \nUlta star rating: 4.1/5\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “Highly Recommend. I've used this for about 2 months now and I'm in Love. Works Great!! I will spray this in layers under my hair right before blow drying then using my diffuser high heat, low blow, pumps up my roots to give so much volume that lasts all day.”\nRestore your hair's density with this top-rated shampoo powered by biotin, rosemary, and aloe to stimulate the scalp and soften the hair.\nSize: 14 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.3/5\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I have an extremely sensitive scalp! Almost everything breaks me out. This has been a godsend. It has a pleasant scent, easy to use pump, and creates a decent amount of leather. The price is great too. I highly recommend this product for anyone that sugfers skin irritation.”\nThe key to a voluminous blowout Farrah Fawcett would be proud of is this volumizer by Color Wow. It doubles as a heat protectant, so you can apply it ahead of heat styling for big, bouncy curls. \nSize: 6.5 fl oz \nAmazon star rating: 4/5\nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I was pretty skeptical but this actually does work. Pleasantly surprised. Would recommend. A bit pricey but worth the splurge.”\nGive your scalp an intense treatment that fuses peppermint, tea tree oil, and vitamin b5 to stimulate the scalp and encourage growth.  \nSize: 4.23 fl oz\nUlta star rating: 4.7/5\nAn Ulta reviewer said: “Thanks to age and medications my hair started to fall out more than normal. Thin, flat and weak looking was my new daily norm and I was devastated!! On a whim I decided to try the Intensive Spray and my hair is happy again!! After 2 weeks my hair looks full and I have a lot less breakage! It's a great option to have!”\nDefine curls, tame frizz, and add volume with just a few pumps of R+Co's Thickening Foam. This formula is made with a cocktail of vitamin E, fruit extracts, and aloe leaf for extra nourishment.\nSize: 5 oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.2/5\nWhat people are saying: “Gives so much volume to my thin curly hair.

{"title": "Our Favorite Fragrances Will Have You Smelling Like A Dream", "date": "2023-09-30 22:32:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nMeet your new signature scent. \nWhen you meet someone, your fragrance is the first thing to introduce you before words leave your mouth. What do you want your scent to say? Are you a burst of energy fueled by bright citrus and fruits? Or maybe you like to be mysterious with sultry tonka beans and woods tickling the noses of every passerby.\nA signature scent is also deeply personal; it can evoke particular memories, elicit a sense of comfort or nostalgia, and even help tell the world about your unique personality. Plus, fragrances can smell quite different on different skin types, which makes finding the best perfumes for women a personalized experience. \n“Fragrance is about the way it makes you feel,” explains Joan Tanis, national training and events director at Maison Francis Kurkjian. “Wearing a scent that works with your specific body chemistry can also enhance your mood and even change behaviors. Fragrance encourages the release of endorphins, which makes us feel good.”\nIf you’re not sure exactly where to start on your scent journey, don’t fret. We’ve scoured customer reviews and tested dozens of buzzy formulas to bring you some of the most exciting perfumes. From summer-centric lavender perfumes to mature vanilla and rich gender-fluid scents, we made it easy to uncover timeless classics or intriguingly unconventional blends—no matter your preference. And the best part? You can order a few samples to compare and contrast your favorites while still deciding, or go all-in on a full-size bottle that doubles as décor once you’ve nailed down your signature fragrance.Also worth noting: Many of these brands offer some amazing perfume gift sets, so you can treat your loved ones to the magical experience of (hopefully) finding their new go-to scents, too. \nSmells like: A sunny Italian vacation \nKey notes: Mandarin, neroli, orange blossom, jasmine, myrrh, musks \nSummer doesn’t seem too far away when you have this scent on hand. Orange Smoke smells exactly like its name—a toasty, citrus scent that's as sweet as it is smoky. \n“If I could bottle up what my vacation on the Amalfi Coast smelled like, it would be eerily similar to Orange Smoke by Dries Van Noten. The mandarin, orange blossom, and neroli notes are warmed up under the sun and deepened with musks to create a bright and warm aroma.”—Nerisha Penrose, ELLE.com beauty commerce editor\nSmells like: Salty citrus\nKey notes: Salted Lemon, pink pepper, musks\nA little bit spicy, citrusy, and woodsy all in one, this super-affordable fragrance has the depth of a much pricier top-shelf perfume. The scent leans neither too masculine nor feminine, meaning it’s one your BF might just be tempted to use, too. \n“I’ve always been a sucker for men’s cologne, but have never actually added any to my routine because I don’t want to smell like a full-on dude.  However, this Le Monde Gourmand scent strikes the perfect balance. Described by the brand as evoking the ‘comforting embrace of an oversized hoodie stolen from your crush,’ it has an effortlessly musky scent without being too rich or overpowering. It’s so good, in fact, I love to spritz it on every few hours for a fresh whiff.”— S.P.  \nSmells like: Creamy woods\nKey notes: Almond, coffee, bergamot lemon; jasmine, orange blossom, tonka bean, cacao, vanilla, sandalwood, patchouli and cedar\nStarting bright and surprising with whiffs of jasmine, this perfume soon turns dark and seductive with traces of coffee and cocoa. A must-have for any wild night in or out. \nAn Amazon reviewer says: “The bottle is what immediately caught my attention, but after I sampled it, I needed to have it. It goes very well with my natural scent; it’s warm and sweet, yet sexy. It’s perfect for everyday wear as well as special occasions.”\nSmells like: Soft, tangy florals\nKey notes: Grapefruit, rose accord\nA fruity, floral fragrance as traditionally feminine as its color, this is a non-fussy pick for day wear.\n“Of all the perfumes I’ve tried over the years, Chanel's Chance has remained a constant in my lineup. It’s lighter and more modern than the brand’s iconic N°5 scent, yet is still just as effortlessly classic and long-lasting. In fact, I’ve found it to be such a universal crowd-pleaser that even an Uber driver once asked me what I was wearing.”—S.P.\nSmells like: Marshmallows and ice cream\nKey notes: Lavender blossom, juicy pear, bergamot, coconut, vanilla orchid, woods, cashmere \nEven if your name isn’t Ari, you can still smell like the superstar with this flirty, feminine perfume. With sweet floral and fruity scents of lavender blossom, pear, coconut, and vanilla, this is a bright, young fragrance, in the best way.\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “That’s it. Steamy cotton candy. I smell like a sexy cavity. Ten out of 10.”\nSmells like: Florals deep in the woods\nKey notes: violet leaves, jasmine, vetiver.\nCreated by the brand that brought us the chicest, most enviable lingerie in the market, the perfumes by La Perla are just as desirable. This scent is citrusy enough to invoke a bold, wide-awake feeling, but countered with dark notes of neroli, too.\nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “Very beautiful, fruity violet perfume. This smells like a rich French woman. Oozes elegance, and the bottle is just oh-my-god stunning.”\nSmells like: A floral boutique\nKey notes: Jasmine, rose essence, chypre accord\nWith ambassador Zendaya as its leading lady, Lancome’s Idole already has a lot going for it. But with its burst of fresh florals—rose and jasmine, in particular—this makes for a fully feminine, but never overpowering, scent.\nAn Amazon reviewer says: “Beautiful scent of flowers that lasts on your clothes and wherever you spray it on yourself for well over a day! Plus, you only need a little bit, because it most certainly goes a long way.”\nSmells like: Spicy amber\nKey notes: Jasmine, saffron, cedarwood, ambergris accord \nBaccarat Rouge 540 is another woodsy scent with a sweeter edge. That first whiff is sweet, then it evolves into spicy, earthy notes of jasmine, cedar, and saffron.\n“This perfume is a guaranteed conversation starter. The distinct smell either evokes the response of 'Ahh, I love 540,' amongst knowing individuals or 'What is that smell?!' to those that are about to be introduced to the reigning king of the perfume occult. It seems more genderless at first spritz, but then dries down to a sweet, woody, sexy aroma.” — Danielle James, Beauty Director, ELLE.com \nSmells like: Honeyed florals\nKey notes: Ylang ylang, Damascus rose, jasmine\nThere’s a reason you see this iconic bottle in practically every magazine you’ve ever opened. It’s a classic, and the fruity, floral ingredients never weigh down the luscious elegance of the ylang-ylang, jasmine, pear, melon, peach, and lily. \nA Sephora reviewer says: “Lovely floral scent, not too warm or heavy but still has good lasting power. Would recommended this to all ages and seems appropriate for both day and night. Gorgeous bottle.”\nSmells like: Early summer morning by a beach\nKey notes: Bergamot, pink pepper, primofiore lemon, neroli oil\nEven if you don’t live near the coast, this effervescent summer perfume will instantly transport to warm, sandy shores with notes of bergamot, coconut milk, and aquatic-inspired transluzone. Also, what’s not to love about its striking apothecary-style bottle? \nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “Love this scent, takes me to holiday in my head in one spritz. All the best bits—sun cream, salty skin, fruity cocktails, and tropical flowers. Delicious. The scent really lasts well, too. Great for every day!”\nSmells like: Spicy florals\nKey notes: Black Coffee, white flowers, vanilla\nFor those who crave a little danger in their dress-up, this sexy concoction smelling of coffee, vanilla, and pear is a feast for the senses. A little smooth, a little edgy, this is a fantastic fragrance for evening wear.\nA Sephora reviewer says: “One of my favorite scents. Very mature but not like an old lady scent. It’s sophisticated and warm. I wear this year-round but suggest wearing it in the winter.”\nSmells like: First bloom of spring flowers\nKey notes: Bergamot, lychee, peach, jasmine, peony, orange blossom, moss, musk\nThis luxurious and fruity perfume is like summer in a bottle. Featuring unique traces of lychee, peony, orange blossom, and peach, with a little musk mixed in for good measure, this is like a well-made cocktail—worth the extra cost. \nA Saks Fifth Avenue reviewer says: “As a perfume hoarder, I can say that I have nothing like it in my collection, and it smells amazing! It’s a citrusy floral that settles in very beautifully.”\nSmells like: Fancy flowers\nKey notes: Calypso orchid, mandarin, Bulgarian rose, almond milk, ylang ylang, iris, white musks, sandalwood\nBuckle up tight because this fragrance takes you on a ride. The yin-yang scent composition unfurls a delicate composition of sensual citrus and florals, then comes the dip: warm almond milk, sandalwood, and white musk.\n“As someone with over 100 fragrances, my signature scent changes daily. However, I almost always begin most of my scent layers with Yin Transformation, which bursts with creamy florals that feel like a balmy spring morning.” — NP\nSmells like: Freshly squeeze berries over florals\nKey notes: Schisandra berry, mulberry, lily of the valley, plum blossom, honeysuckle, white amber, sandalwood, musk\nDrawing inspiration from the Korean word songari, which means an array of flowers or fruit on a single stem, this enticing fragrance is at once familiar and unexpected. Top notes of mulberry and Korea-native Schisandra berry open up to plum blossom and honeysuckle, followed by subtly grounding base notes of amber and sandalwood.\n“Elorea’s genderless perfumes are quickly becoming some of my new favorites. The burgeoning K-beauty brand looks to nature and its founders’ shared heritage to create some undeniably divine scents, like the soft yet not overly sweet Inflorescence. If you’re unsure which Elorea perfumes will best suit you, I also love that the label offers a discovery set, which comes with a voucher of equal value that can be applied to any purchase of a full-sized scent.”—Sam Peters, ELLE.com contributor\nSmells like: Fresh-out-of-water peonies\nKey notes: Black pepper, raspberry accord, peony accord, geranium, freesia accord, Turkish rose, patchouli, musk\nIf all you want for your birthday is a bushel of peonies, this perfume should be a runner-up. It’s a beautiful floral fragrance with notes of raspberry, geranium, Turkish rose, and peony. Basically a wearable bouquet.\nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “This is a lovely perfume with so many enticing scents–uplifting citrus, woodiness, and unusual florals. I found this to be really lovely, with good staying power.”\nSmells like: Spices and woods\nKey notes: Davana, tonka beans, coffee, labdanum, agarwood, sandalwood\nAnother fragrance that owes its influences to a city—in this case, bustling Mumbai—this perfume contains notes of davana, tonka bean, coffee, and sandalwood, to name a few. It’s a rich and slightly spicy perfume that’s perfect for the chilly winter months ahead.\nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “I generally find Byredo’s combinations to be impressive, unusual, and long-lasting. Mumbai Noise is no exception—it has terrific staying power. I love the woody and spicy notes, but it’s not too dark or heavy. The davana definitely lifts the blend! This is up there with my favorite, Bal d’Afrique!”\nSmells like: Sugary florals\nKey notes: Cattleya orchid, freesia, centifolia rose\nIt’s all in the name, folks: This perfume is like spritzing on the feeling of a sunset soirée in a romantic palace garden. With orchid, patchouli, tea leaf, jasmine and rose, wearing Flowerbomb is the next best thing to carrying a bouquet wherever you go.\nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “Flowerbomb, in my opinion, has to be the most beautiful and comforting fragrance ever created. Sweet-soft-romantic-powdery. It’s heaven in a bottle.”\nSmells like: Luxurious after-shave\nKey notes: Peppermint, geranium, patchouli\nFor a slightly more masculine, aftershave-inspired perfume, this minty fragrance is fresh and delightful. Along with mint, it has notes of geranium and patchouli for a complicated but delectable fragrance. \nA Nordstrom reviewer says: “Praise for this scent with not a single flower petal in sight. It makes me think of a classy wizard who relishes a good gin. It’s mystic and unusual, and I’m here for it.”\nSmells like: Dark, powdery fruits \nKey notes: blackcurrant, musk blonde wood\nA classic in the Armani collection, Sì is the ideal bottle for anyone pining for an earthy scent that doesn’t smell like, well, earth. With rose and freesia mellowing out this seductive fragrance, it’s a great transition perfume from day to evening.\n“When I heard rumors that this was Rihanna's original 'signature scent,' I had to try it. And now I see exactly why everyone says she smells so good. This perfume is the perfect scent to take you from summer into autumn.” — Danielle James \nSmells like: Peppery florals\nKey notes: Pink pepper, iris, ambrette\nThe whole point of this perfume is that it smells like the best version of you. That is, a you that showers with expensive body wash, and that inspires people to come up to you gushing, “What are you wearing?” It contains bright notes of pink pepper, warm amber, and a hint of fresh iris.\nA Glossier reviewer says: “I agree, it is a slightly more mature scent, but it’s such an elegant soft smell that I even put it on before bed and after showering. Definitely my new go-to. :) A few of my friends have bought it after smelling it on me at work. It’s such a unique but familiar scent at the same time. I love, love, love this perfume.”\nLauren Puckett-Pope is a staff culture writer at ELLE, where she primarily covers film, television and books.

{"title": "The Best Looks From Paris Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2024", "date": "2023-09-30 16:36:00", "text": "The fashion month calendar culminates in the City of Lights.\nKiko Kostadinov’s spring collection made me want to be more bold. It made me want to wear orange and black stripes, colorful furry wrap coats, and tunics over pants. Black, light grey, and cargo hues were offset by chartreuse green, cobalt blue, and candy pink. Hem and neck lines were equally asymmetric, and jackets were purposefully buttoned askew. Patterns, colors, and styles were unconventionally paired in ways that might have seem haphazard to an untrained eye. The lesson: stop getting dressed and start playing dress-up.—Meg Donohue, associate fashion commerce editor \nMiuccia Prada's finger has been on the pulse of youth culture and its future for the last few seasons, and this preppy-beachy collection is no different. She continued with the multiple layers exploration, this time with prep school blazers, oxford button downs, bikini bottoms and surf shorts in varying shades of navy, orange, and yellow. She countered the more encumbering looks with fresh bandana-style leather tube tops and matching skirts, plus a healthy dose of jacquard. With another all-star cast including Troye Sivan and Cailee Spaeny, Mrs. Prada closed out fashion week showing she may be generations away from the youth in her cast, but she's all too aware of how we dress, and how we want to dress, and how we should dress. —Kevin LeBlanc, fashion associate\nJohn Galliano is a master of character study and development, and his co-ed Margiela collection brought the most excitement to the runway all week. Every look, deconstructed, repinned, and held just so, told a story with each gesture, whether with the intentional removal of a shoulder pad or the exaggeration of a skirt's hem. Galliano's inspiration was of inheritance, and how that translates through clothing passed through generations. One can't help but to think of a daughter throwing on her father's massive blazer, or a child ensconced in their grandmother's corseted dresses. With Galliano, the possibilities for imagination and stories is endless. —Kevin LeBlanc, fashion associate\nValentino is always one of the most anticipated shows of the Paris Fashion Week calendar, and Creative Director Pierpaolo Piccioli refused to let this platform go to waste. Amid political turmoil and a pushback against women’s rights in the fashion house’s home country of Italy, Piccioli sought to celebrate the female form—not in a way that provokes or sexualizes, but in a way that honors its strength and vulnerability. Instead of utilizing embroidery as an embellishment, he manipulated it into a fabric of its own, creating intricate, cage-like garments that revealed unconventional pockets of skin underneath. Motifs like flowers and lace, which typically allude to a woman’s delicacy, are subverted to signify strength, and bursts of pink and bold Valentino red further evince the inextricable link between femininity and power. —Elena Plumb, freelance fashion assistant\nFirst and foremost, the Mugler runway was star-studded. Models included Angela Bassett, Paris Hilton, Helena Christensen, Irina Shayk, Amber Valletta, and Fan Bingbing. The collection was, as expected, full of sex appeal, exposed flesh, and geometric cut-outs. The shapes and hyper-structured silhouettes signature to the brand were, of course, present, as were de-constructed thigh-high boots, colored fringe, and tinsel. There were more than few freed nipples and one entirely translucent, hard-sided breastplate (glass?) that might have stolen the show if it weren’t for Angela Bassett. Did I mention her?—Meg Donohue, associate fashion commerce editor \nRokh’s spring/summer 2024 collection proved that the utilitarian trend can still be chic. Sleek tailoring paired well with doily-like white lace, and otherwise classic workwear pieces — trench coats, button downs, and slacks — were reimagined to be slightly twisted. Cropped jackets, elongated belt straps, and weird proportions made the collection semi-normal looking to the naked eye, but up close, you can see the “off” features and oddities that make it interesting. A mostly black and grey color palette and a mostly sleek, sturdy primary fabric were accented with a subtle pop of color & touch-worthy textures: a latex mustard yellow top here, a muted pink and yellow shag dress there. The collection as a whole felt dark, but not heavy or suffocating, perhaps a response to the ultra-loud, gimmicky trends of seasons past that frankly, Rokh has never participated in anyway.—Madison Rexroat, fashion & accessories assistant\nThe Best Looks From Milan Fashion Week SS24\nAll the Best Looks From London Fashion Week SS24\nWilly Chavarria Brings Sex Appeal to NYC\nBruceGlen Brought Body Positivity to NYFW\nThe Best Looks From New York Fashion Week SS24\nBrandon Maxwell Presents Dynamic Minimalism\nGabriela Hearst Designs for Chic Women\nTory Burch Hosted Her Own Night at the Museum \nCollina Strada Was an End-Of-Summer Night’s Dream\nI Went to the Kate Spade Show With Ease (Sort Of)\nRalph Lauren Brought His Home to NYFW\nAll The Best Fall/Winter 2023 Couture Looks \nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n©2023 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

{"title": "The 25 Best Ulta Products ELLE Editors Are Obsessed With", "date": "2023-09-30 01:19:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nFrom a lash-boosting mascara to ultra-hydrating moisturizer.\nWalking into an Ulta store or browsing its online catalogs makes me feel like a kid in a candy store. With thousands of makeup, skincare, haircare, and fragrance products, the popular beauty retailer nearly always has what I’m looking for—plus a few extra impulse purchases I can’t resist adding to my cart. \nAnd while some may think of Ulta as Sephora’s less sophisticated younger sister, don’t be fooled. Alongside its wide selection of budget-friendly and drugstore favorites (hello to this TikTok-viral Maybelline mascara!), they also carry hundreds of luxury beauty products from coveted labels like Pat McGrath Labs, Chanel, Lancome, and Dior. Moral of the story: Whether you’re looking to save a few dollars as student loan payments return or are in the mood to do some major retail therapy, Ulta is the one-stop shop to satisfy any beauty lover’s cravings.\nAnother perk I’d like to mention is that Ulta has a fantastic loyalty program. Similar to Sephora’s program, you can earn points for every dollar you spend and get exclusive gifts and discounts depending on your membership tier. However, Ulta offers some additional benefits like two times the points during your birthday month; your points go a bit farther here (500 points can be redeemed for $17.50, while at Sephora, 500 points get you $10 off.) Although you do have to spend at least $25 to get free shipping at Ulta, depending on your membership level, it’s not that hard to qualify for, given the sheer abundance of goodies you’ll likely want to stock up on.\nI could easily wax poetic about Ulta, but let’s go shopping, shall we? Ahead, I’ve shared a few of my beauty staples and tapped discerning ELLE editors for their must-have finds available at Ulta. Add these gems to your lineup, we promise you won’t regret it.\n“As a serial lipstick dater, I have a hard time committing to just one formula. Urban Decay’s Vice Lip Bond has me recently testing out the whole monogamy thing because quite frankly, this product is incredible. The shade range is the stuff of my vibrant dreams (looking at you, Solo Player!), and one swipe can hold up for a jam-packed day.” —Bianca Rodriguez, Fashion & Luxury Commerce Manager \n“I can’t count the amount of sunscreens I’ve tested over the years, but of all of them, this one is unbeatable. Not only does it effectively protect my skin from UVA/UVB rays, but the formula is also unmatched. It never leaves a white cast, creamily blends into the skin, and best of all, is non-comedogenic, so it never causes a breakout.”—Tatjana Freund, Fashion & Luxury Commerce Editor\n“I have lots of hair, but the strands are soft and fine. Too much product and it can really weigh down my 4B/4C curls. This curl cream not only smells divine, but is also lightweight and defines my curls. I have low porosity hair. However, with this curl cream, I don’t have to work too hard to get my hair to absorb the product. Highly recommend for my low-porosity sisters!”—Danielle James, ELLE.com Digital Beauty Director\n“You can never have too much blush. However, this pigmented duo palette from Juvia’s Place delivers insane color payoff with just one swipe. The duo comes with a light and deep shade of blush so you can layer each on top of one other or give them their own time to shine.”—Nerisha Penrose, ELLE.com Beauty Commerce Editor\n“I will give you one little truth of the beauty industry: When it comes to mascara, drugstore ones are just as good as luxury ones. I know this, yet when I saw my friend Claire with the kind of long, fluttery eyelashes you only see on babies or straight men who don’t need them, I thought the answer had to be a luxury brand. It was this—and when I tried it for myself, I understood why. My lashes are fine and point straight down, but this made them longer, fuller, and thicker in just a few coats.”—Kathleen Hou, ELLE Beauty Director\nMy combo skin is an annoying amalgam of contradictions—shine here, flaky patches there!—but Fresh’s deep hydration cream has become my go-to moisturizer for a fix-all remedy. My skin instantly soaks up this rich formula, yet isn’t left feeling greasy or sticky in the slightest. I love that it not only provides long-lasting hydration with a blend of hyaluronic acids, but also soothes redness from my uncouth prodding via rose extract. And to top it all off, it smells like an actual floral bouquet.\n“Meeting Donni Davy, Euphoria’s lead makeup artist, and her line of cosmetics last year quite possibly changed me. Half Magic’s hues pack a punch, and this eye paint and eyeliner combo product is no different. I’ll opt for this weekly in place of my good ol’ black eyeliner when I want a pop of color. The results always make me smile.”—BR\n“T3’s Airebrush Duo was my go-to for quickly transforming my curls into a sleek blowout. However, this newer version is the only tool that’s good enough to make me set it down for the first time in three years. The larger, oval-shaped barrel still adds volume to the hair, but it allows me to cut down my styling time.”—TF\n“Founder Alicia Yoon grew up with eczema and has spent years explaining what a ‘skin barrier’ was before I even knew it was a thing. For my friends with hypersensitive skin and who definitely can’t use a retinol but still want something effective, I always suggest a Peach & Lily product—specifically this serum. I’ve been through at least three of these serums because it is a steady product that helps to consistently brighten skin and moisturize.”—KH\n“The amount of Thigh Rescue’s I own is frankly borderline embarrassing. Yet, if a product is going to grant world peace—a.k.a. no irritating chafing for my thighs in hot humid months—why wouldn’t I keep this in every handbag I own?”—BR\n“Of all of Chanel’s products, this multi-use stick is criminally underrated and by far my favorite. I use the shade 'Transparent' to add a natural-looking dewy highlight at the top of my cheeks. For an even bolder look, you can layer on a powder highlighter for a budge-proof gleam. If you prefer even more glow, the pinkier shades work great as blush.”—TF\n“My primer aversion was reversed after just one use of the E.L.F Cosmetics Power Grip Primer. This bestseller and TikTok-favorite keeps my makeup stuck for hours. My trick is to use this primer when I’m wearing matte products to impart a natural, healthy shine, as matte formulas can make me look powdery and flat.”—NP\nEllis Brooklyn’s Salt Eau de Parfum reminds me that summer isn’t just a season, it’s a mentality. This warm, slightly floral, slightly salty scent is like nostalgia in a bottle for me when NYC winters turn frightening.\n“Do I need another palette? No. Did I buy this with my own money? Absolutely. The palette contains a universal highlighter and four shimmery eyeshadows that together look like the top of an ancient statue. The green shadow is my go-to shade, and the highlighter and eyeshadows are buildable. I bought it as a collector’s item, but I’ll need to purchase another one because I’ve been using the palette so frequently!”—DJ\n“I have scraped jars of Hanahana beauty with my fingernails, wiping every crevice clean like a dog trying to get every bit of peanut butter out of a jar. I generally find moisturizing my body a chore, but when this sits on my vanity, I suddenly find myself very motivated. It combines the scent of a calm-inducing lavender and the rich, but not greasy touch of this shea butter. When I’ve coated my whole body in this, I feel like a shiny, slippery, well-moisturized dolphin.”—KH\n“For my unruly brows, nothing works as effectively as the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow gel. As far as basics go, this one will never leave my side. It completely tames my brow hairs, even in horrible New York humidity. I can’t tell you how many tubes I’ve gone through.\"—TF\n“Not to be dramatic, but I truly believe every New Yorker (or just general over-populated city-goer) needs this serum in their welcome bag. The key is in the kombucha, which provides serious protection against harsh climates all day. The difference in my skin compared to some friends who haven’t made the switch is quite noticeable (but let’s keep that secret between us).” —BR\n“All I’ve wanted to do recently is put glitter on my eyelids with the enthusiasm of a kindergartener discovering shiny objects for the first time. This ‘glitter puck’ makes my eyes gleam like they’ve been lightly dusted with fairy dust. Donni Davy is a glitter connoisseur and always coming up with a new shade or shape of glitter that I haven’t seen before.” —KH\n“There’s been a lot of hype on the Internet about the Dream Coat Supernatural Spray, and I’m here to confirm it. I never thought a single hair product could make such a difference in my blowout routine. Not only does it dramatically cut down on styling time, but it also keeps humidity at bay so that I can style less throughout the week. Even on my curly, dry hair, a blowout with this spray gives me a sleek, shiny look that lasts.”—TF\n“One of the best tube mascaras on the market! I often have trouble with product settling underneath my eyes (I have long bottom lashes). The wand allows me to paint them perfectly with minimal mess.”—DJ\nSam Peters is a Senior Commerce Editor at Hearst covering fashion, beauty and lifestyle.

{"title": "10 Biotin Shampoos For Fuller, Voluminous Hair", "date": "2023-09-29 21:38:00", "text": "Every item on this page was chosen by an ELLE editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\nDo biotin shampoos really work? A dermatologist weighs in.  \nNot all of us have the luck of being born with Cindy Crawford’s luscious locks. Most of us must work harder to achieve the voluminous hair we dream of. Of course, an easy fix may be to “just get extensions,” but it’s not as simple as it seems. Extensions often weigh down your scalp and, even worse, cause permanent hair damage. Here's where biotin shampoos come in. \n“Biotin is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin (vitamin B7) that has important roles in cellular metabolism and signaling,” New York-based board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Tiffany Libby, tells ELLE.com. Simply put, biotin has long been touted for its hair-strengthening properties. “It is used in biotin shampoos as it is believed to strengthen hair follicles and increase scalp circulation and hair density. While there is limited clinical data that points to the use of oral or topical biotin for promoting hair and nail growth in healthy patients, some patients find it helpful in helping to thicken and strengthen hair,” she explains. \nThe shower is where your hair gets all the attention it’s craving. If you are someone who has been bleaching and coloring your hair since the beginning of time, your hair probably needs some extra TLC. For biotin shampoo to give you the results you desire, you must keep an eye out for some key ingredients that support your hair in every way, such as vitamins and natural oils—both promoting hair growth. Luckily, we polled experts and perused dozens of customer reviews to find the eight best biotin shampoos to start your hair care journey.  \nPutting your trust in shampoo when experiencing hair loss is quite the gamble. Honeydew’s Biotin Shampoo is one that won’t let you down. This Amazon bestseller features natural oils, including coconut oil, as well as vitamins, biotin, and keratin that thoroughly cleanse the scalp to create a clean slate for new growth to sprout. \nSize: 8 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.4/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “This product saved my long hair. I started using it after I experienced some hair loss. After using it the first time, my hair stopped falling out. I will continue to use this shampoo and conditioner. I highly recommend for people losing their hair.”\nIn this shampoo, biotin is supported by vitamin B3 and pea spout extract to enrich the hair and scalp with nutrients and encourage blood circulation for growth.\nSize: 8 fl oz\nWalmart rating: 4.6/5 stars\n“I’ve been using this shampoo (and the conditioner) for about six weeks. I have curly hair and haven’t gotten a trim, so I don’t know if my hair has grown. However, I have noticed less hair falling out when I wash and brush my tresses. I don’t love how my strands feel after I use just the shampoo—it feels slightly rubbery; however, after using the corresponding conditioner, my hair returns to its soft state.”—Danielle James, Beauty Director ELLE.com \nMielle Organic’s Rosemary Mint Oil isn’t the only product in the line that deserves the hype. Before you even get to the oil step, the Rosemary Mint Shampoo is a godsend for those looking to repair breakage-prone and brittle hair over time. It is a slow-burner, so don’t expect immediate results, but rest assured your hair is in good hands. \nSize: 12 fl oz\nAmazon star rating: 4.6/5 stars \nAn Amazon reviewer said: “I have been using this product for years and have always thought it has helped my hair tremendously.

After shampoo and conditioning, Dr. Libby advises using other topical biotin products elsewhere in your routine. Enter: hair serums.\n“If there is interest in using topical biotin, I would recommend a leave-on daily treatment, like SpoiledChild A22 Biotin Boost Hair + Scalp Serum, formulated with rosemary oil, caffeine, and niacinamide, and has demonstrated hair growth benefits. It is an elegant, lightweight formulation in an easy-to-use spray that is fast-absorbing and residue-free, and does not weigh hair down while it is working on the scalp,” she explains. \n“You can use a biotin shampoo as often as you need to shampoo your hair,” Dr. Libby says.\nWhile biotin has been known for encouraging growth, Dr. Libby advises looking for products that contain “other ingredients that help cleanse the scalp and remove residue, and ingredients that support hair growth like caffeine and rosemary oil, and prevent hair loss like saw palmetto extract,” she says.\nDr. Tiffany Libby, NYC-based double board-certified dermatologist who specializes in cosmetic and laser dermatology\nNerisha Penrose is the Beauty Commerce Editor at ELLE.com.
