{"title": "Loki Season 2 Has A Key Piece Of Evidence That Backs Up The Biggest Secret Wars Fan Theory", "date": "2023-10-06 12:41:25", "text": "The premiere of Loki season 2 provides a key piece of evidence that helps back up a major theory focused on the God of Mischief's role in Secret Wars.\nWarning! This post contains SPOILERS for Loki season 2, episode 1\nLoki season 2 provides some key evidence for a major theory regarding the titular God of Mischief's role in Avengers: Secret Wars. Having failed to stop Sylvie (Sophia Di Martino) from killing He Who Remains (Jonathan Majors) in the finale of Loki season 1, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has returned to warn the Time Variance Authority of the imminent danger ahead. However, his major MCU future may have been teased as well.\nAs seen in Loki season 2's first episode, Loki is suffering from \"time-slipping\" where his body is involuntary and violently sent back and forth between the past, present, and future. However, it's been argued that this temporal affliction should be impossible inside the TVA given its existence outside of time. Loki's potential role in Avengers: Secret Wars is perhaps teased as well, supporting theories about the God of Mischief and his future with the TVA in light of a rapidly expanding multiverse.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Episode 1's Post-Credits Scene Is Way Deeper Than You Realize\nAccording to a popular Avengers: Secret Wars theory about Loki, the God of Mischief will soon be positioned to fix the multiverse. As a strong act of redemption, Loki could become a hero during the events of Secret Wars with the decision to take over the TVA. However, this would go beyond maintaining the original Sacred Timeline to ensure that He Who Remains' variants wouldn't exist (such as Kang). According to this theory, Loki would create a new Sacred Timeline out of the various realities that will likely be in conflict during Secret Wars, thereby providing the MCU with a brand-new universe in the aftermath.\nBecause He Who Remains' variants engaged in a multiversal war before the creation of the Sacred Timeline, it does seem as though history might repeat itself, first with Kang variants in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and then on an even bigger scale with Avengers: Secret Wars. As such, Loki could find himself in the unique position to bring about order from the chaos he's certain is coming. After all, He Who Remains was quite confident that his variants would return with the freed multiverse and all of its branch realities, and the multiversal threat of Kang has already been proven in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\nKeeping this Secret Wars theory in mind, Agent Mobius tells a time-slipping Loki in Loki season 2's premiere that there still needs to be a \"Loki Who Remains\" before they can figure out what to do about He Who Remains' variants. Despite being a joke on Mobius' part, this does support the idea that Loki could end up replacing He Who Remains in the MCU's future. He could end up being the one to oversee the creation of a new timeline with the God of Mischief ironically providing order and stability across realities.\nLoki replacing He Who Remains is certainly a compelling idea when looking at his overall arc. Although he didn't experience the events of Thor: The Dark World, Ragnarok, and Avengers: Infinity War like the original Loki, this variant of the God of Mischief is still becoming a more redemptive figure, having learned what it truly means to have glorious purpose. As such, the idea of Loki finding a new purpose by taking on the complex responsibility of forging a new timeline in Secret Wars is quite appealing.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Cast Guide: Every New & Returning Marvel Character\nBeyond Agent Mobius' joke, Loki's belief in an imminent multiversal war is a tease as well. Although Loki wanted more time to come up with a plan, Sylvie was convinced that He Who Remains was evil and had to be killed. However, Loki season 2 confirms Loki wasn't and still isn't convinced He Who Remains was all that bad. Loki's now questioning if He Who Remains was in the right, having made the hard choice to destroy entire realities for the sake of saving all the others from the most dangerous variants of himself.\nReferencing the multiversal war that came before with He Who Remains' variants, Loki believes the only certainty he and Mobius have is that another war is coming very soon. As such, this is likely the multiversal war that will soon be seen in Avengers: Secret Wars with Loki season 2 serving as critical setup for the crossover set to release in 2027. As such, only time will tell if Loki does end up taking over the TVA as He Who Remains' eventual replacement in the MCU.\nNew episodes of Loki release every Thursday at 6pm PT / 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "The Incredibles 2 Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-06 12:41:25", "text": "The long-awaited sequel, The Incredibles 2, wrapped up Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl's stories while still leaving the door open for a threequel.\nThe Incredibles 2's action-packed ending perfectly wrapped up The Incredibles story but still left the door open for a potential threequel. It took 14 years for Disney Pixar to finally release a sequel to the 2004 film, and audiences were eager to have their unanswered The Incredibles questions addressed. Though the Parr family got a happy ending in the original movie, it was unclear whether Supers would ever be legalized again or how Bob and Helen would handle their superhuman children (including their multitalented baby, Jack-Jack). It may have taken over a decade, but by the end of The Incredibles 2, this was all laid to rest.\nThe Incredibles 2 picked up right where The Incredibles had left off, with the Parr family facing off against the new supervillain, the Underminer. Though they had learned to cooperate and appreciate each other to an extent in the 2004 movie, it's clear from this first scene of the sequel that they didn't quite have this perfected. Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl failed to take down the Underminer and were once again blamed for destroying city property. However, in the wake of this incident, siblings Winston and Evelyn Deavor requested Helen's help in moving toward legalizing Supers again, and a mysterious villain, the Screenslaver, began causing chaos to stop them.\nRELATED: The Incredibles 2 Cast & Character Guide\nNear the end of The Incredibles 2, Helen devised a plan to track down the location of the Screenslaver and take him down for good. The villain could control people through hypnotization, using nothing but a screen. When Helen, as Elastigirl, found the villain's hideout, he was revealed to be nothing but a pizza boy, something that puzzled her greatly. Still, by publically eliminating this thread, Elastigirl had succeeded in convincing the world that Supers should be legal again. Winston Deaver arranged for ambassadors from around the world to meet on a boat to sign a document allowing the Parr family to fight crime again.\nJust before this grand event, Helen discovered that the inside of the Screenslaver's mask contained electronic screens, and she quickly realized that this meant the pizza boy was only being controlled by the real villain. Unluckily for Elastigirl, she realized this in front of Evelyn Deaver, who was, in fact, the real Screenslaver and villain of The Incredibles 2. She put the goggles on Helen's face, taking control of her. This is when she revealed that she planned to take control of all the Supers on Winston's boat and force them to crash it into the city, definitively proving that Supers shouldn't be trusted.\nEvelyn explained that her father, who had been shot and killed during a break-in at his mansion, would have survived had he called the police instead of waiting on Supers to save him. She felt that Supers were a hindrance to the world, more destructive than helpful, and despite Winston's reverence for them, she desired to see them all fall. Thankfully, before she could pull off her plan, Dash, Violet, and Jack-Jack managed to get to the boat and free their parents from mind control, and the Superfamily fought together once again, successfully turning the ship away from the city to safety.\nThe Parr family weren't the only ones who saved the city from the Deavers' out-of-control boat. A league of other Supers had also been taken under Evelyn's control, and once Helen and Bob were freed from their screened goggles, they fought to release the others. From there, everyone worked together to save the day—a spectacle that was made public on screens across the city. This meant that, despite mind-controlled Frozone publically announcing that the Supers were waging war on normal society, the public was willing to let it all go and again support the legalization of Supers.\nMoreover, the ambassadors remained on the Deavers' boat throughout the entirety of the dramatic rescue, so they were still willing to show their support for the Supers with their signatures. In one of the final scenes of The Incredibles 2, Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and countless other Supers were seen in a courtroom while a Judge declared the repeal of the Superhero Relocation Act. Finally, Bob and Helen, as well as their talented children, were allowed to publically continue to make the world a better place.\nBob Parr may have been the main character of The Incredibles, but in The Incredibles 2, it was time for Elastigirl to take center stage. This made a lot of sense with her previous character arc since, after the Superhero Relocation Act, she became determined to live by the rules and focus on her family instead of saving the world. Still, this hadn't been initially her goal. At the beginning of The Incredibles, Elastigirl stated in an interview that she had no interest in settling down and starting a family. She was at the top of her game and wanted to continue representing women as she kicked some criminal butt.\nThough she had been reluctant in The Incredibles, she stepped up and proved herself to be a pretty remarkable hero when she took it upon herself to fly a jet out to Syndrome's island and rescue her husband. However, the beginning of The Incredibles 2 revealed that Helen was still conflicted about her two identities. She ultimately realized that to do what was right for her children, she needed to leave her home and be Elastigirl again. Her role in saving the day in The Incredibles 2 completed her Incredibles arc by balancing her identity as a wife and mom with that of Elastigirl.\nOf course, just because Helen carried the focus of The Incredibles 2 doesn't mean Bob didn't have a part to play. As Elastigirl returned to being a full-time Super, Bob did precisely what he had said he wanted during the Mr. Incredible interview at the beginning of The Incredibles—he dove into being a father. Before the Superhero Relocation Act made Supers illegal, Bob had already been considering hanging up his Super Suit to start a family. It was only because he was forced to retire before he was ready that he resented his domestic life. In The Incredibles, Bob learned to appreciate his family, and in The Incredibles 2, he really perfected being a dad.\nEdna Mode and Jack-Jack Parr were quite the unlikely match, but since the infant seemed to have all Super abilities in one, the designer took a particular interest. The Incredibles 2 revealed that when Syndrome kidnapped Jack-Jack and was subsequently killed after the baby revealed his powers, Bob and Helen had been too far below them to really see what had happened. Therefore, at the start of The Incredibles 2, the Parrs still believed that their youngest son had no powers.\nThis all changed when Helen started her job with the Deavors. Getting used to caring for all three kids at once became considerably more complicated when Jack-Jack suddenly began walking through walls, multiplying, and turning into a horned demon baby. Exhausted and unsure of what to do, Mr. Incredible took his son to see Edna, who was fascinated to see a baby with such power. She designed him a suit that came with various safety measures, and with a remote control, Bob could track Jack's location, extinguish any flames the baby created, and, overall, just ensure he was safe.\nRELATED: Incredibles 2: All of Jack-Jack's 18 Powers Explained\nThe Incredibles 2 gave the Parrs a satisfying ending while still leaving things open for a potential threequel. The family is seen driving into the crime-fighting sunset, ready to work together to make the city a better place. Still, the fact that they had just dropped off Violet's date at the movie theater demonstrated how the struggle between balancing a personal life and being a Super would always be present. This means countless opportunities for a continued story.\nAdditionally, it's implied that Evelyn Deavor might not have been entirely dealt with. Though she was arrested, Violet mentioned that, as a wealthy genius, she would likely get a slap on the wrist. The Screenslaver's agenda against Supers was unchanged, and there's always a chance she could return as an even more pronounced villain in The Incredibles 3. Still, since it took 14 years after the first Incredibles movie for The Incredibles 2 to be released, it could be a while before we know if Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and their Superfamily have any more stories to tell.\n"}

If you love all things gothic, here's your next Netflix binge-fest.\nThere are a lot of great Dark Academia shows and movies on Netflix for fans of the genre or those who are curious about it. Tweed jackets, elbow patches, and twisted journeys of self-discovery — these are the elements at the center of Dark Academia, an aesthetic that has established a presence in movies and television based on specific themes. It isn't just young people in prep school beige, peering out from behind rows of books; it's learning taken to its most impassioned, and often violent, extreme. Dark Academia as a genre can often boast beautiful gothic imagery, compelling and dramatic storylines, and an emphasis on studious characters.\nThe various streaming services have a vast collection of Dark Academia movies and shows that will have viewers reaching for their sweaters, scarves, and book bags. Dark Academia has only been growing in popularity, and the streaming giants have raised the bar when it comes to creating–and adding–television series and movies that perfectly incorporate the genre's moody settings and themes. Whether viewers like mysteries set in the 1800s, supernatural capers involving spell books, or secret societies full of sinister machinations, there's plenty to choose from to satisfy any Dark Academic.\nRELATED: The 50 Best Movies Of All Time\nOne of the overlooked Dark Academia movies on Netflix is 2020's Rebecca, an updated adaptation of the novel by Daphne de Maurier which was famously adapted in 1940 by Alfred Hitchcock. This new version from director Ben Wheatley stars Lily James and Armie Hammer as a newlywed couple who arrive at the husband's estate where the new wife finds herself battling with the memory of his first wife. The movie doesn't hold up to the Hitchcock version, however, Lily James gives a strong performance that compliments the gripping combination of Dark Academia and film noir vibes.\nMary Shelley was an esteemed author, a young woman who began writing Frankenstein at the age of 18. The movie Mary Shelley is a period drama with Elle Fanning playing the author in a Dark Academia movie that focuses on her romance with Percy Bysshe Shelley, which inspired her to write her groundbreaking horror novel. The movie allowed Fanning to shine in the role, one that led her to take on several other historical roles over her career. While the critical reviews were average, the movie delivered a dark look at the young woman with very dark literary ideas in her mind.\nThe Skulls is a 2000 movie that touched on the dark side of college academia. Director Rob Cohen and his The Fast & The Furious star Paul Walker teamed up here one year before they made their street racing movie to tell the story of a kid from the wrong side of the tracks (Joshua Jackson) who picked up a college scholarship as a champion rower. He then joins a secret society at the college known as The Skulls, which is based on the Skull and Bones secret society that allegedly existed at Yale and has members at all levels of the government. The movie was panned by critics but picked up a cult following and spawned two sequels.\nA Christmas musical that ignites the holiday spirit in a unique and stylish way, Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey follows Jeronicus, an imaginative toymaker as he works towards assembling some of the most awe-inspiring creations of his career, only to be betrayed by his ambitious apprentice. Years later, when the once joyful Jeronicus has all but given up hope on completing his magnificent opus, his granddaughter appears in his workshop and inspires his ability to create. He rediscovers the spirit of the season and finds new meaning with his family just in time for Christmas.\nOne of the most disturbing Dark Academia movies on Netflix is The Pale Blue Eye, based on the novel by Louis Bayard. Set in 1830, the movie sees a detective named Landon (Christian Bale) investigate the murder of a cadet at the West Point Academy. There, he meets an outcast named Edgar Allen Poe (Harry Melling) who helps with the investigation. Poe's work has an influence on many Dark Academia works, so it is interesting to see him as a character in one, especially with Melling's committed performance, and the gothic feel of the thriller keeps the tension high until the intriguing reveal of The Pale Blue Eye's true killer.\nBased on the novel by Donna Tartt, Ansel Elgort stars in The Goldfinch, a movie about a young man whose mother was killed in a bombing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City when he was 13. After her death, he set out to survive on his own after taking a famous painting from the museum after the bombing called The Goldfinch. Not all Dark Academia movies take place in university settings, and the idea of the illustrious world of art plays a big role in this movie, which plays in the same sandbox as the best of the genre.\nFor fans of blending magic with their scholastic endeavors, The Magicians will take them on an enchanted, angst-ridden adventure accompanying Quentin Coldwater, a student of Brakebills College for Magical Pedagogy, as he acquaints himself with the realm of magic. Along with his group of grad school chums, Quentin endeavors to not only learn about wielding magic himself as a magician but also use it to prevent impending dangers to the institution and humanity en masse. The series is based on the novels of Lev Grossman.\nThe Dark Academia Netflix movie franchise continues in Enola Holmes 2. The sequel finds Enola attempting to get her own detective business off the ground when she begins looking into the disappearance of a young factory worker. Brown continues to be charming and heroic in this role, ensuring that she will have a great new franchise once Stranger Things ends. The new movie also has the added benefit of including more of Henry Cavill's Sherlock Holmes, with great chemistry shared between him and Brown. The movie continues to draw influence from Arthur Conan Doyle's work while being its own thing as well.\nWhile he is best known for his fantastical worlds of elves and hobbits, J.R.R. Tolkien worked as an English professor and published several academic works as well. In the 2019 biopic Tolkien, Nicholas Hoult stars as the esteemed author in this movie that tells the story of his early life as a professor and author, and the moments that led to his creation of his magical world. Much of the movie takes place during his time as a teenager where he fell in love with his future wife, and then his time at Oxford, where he developed his love for language.\nReleased in 1992, School Ties is another movie that shows the dark side of elite schools and the separation between the haves and have-nots. The movie takes place in 1955 and follows a working-class teenager who received a football scholarship to an exclusive Massachusetts prep school. However, he finds it hard to fit in and hides his Jewish heritage from his new friends, knowing their negative stereotypical views. The cast had some of the top young stars of the era, with Brendan Fraser, Matt Damon, Chris O'Donnell, Ben Affleck, and Cole Hauser in the cast as students.\nBased on the popular series of books, A Series Of Unfortunate Events focuses on the tragic story of three orphaned children — Klaus, Violet, and Sunny Baudelaire — as they attempt to discern the truth about their parents' sudden demise. Their only remaining guardian, the mercurial Count Olaf, inspires anything but familial comfort. As Olaf plots to get his hands on the siblings' fortune, they are obliged to outsmart him, though his disguises and elaborate plans make it increasingly difficult. The show is based on the novels by the clever Lemony Snicket (Daniel Handler).\nFrom television horror hit-maker Mike Flanagan, The Haunting of Bly Manor is hailed as one of the scariest Dark Academia shows on Netflix. The series is the follow-up to Flanagan's The Haunting of Hill House and features much of the same cast from that show. Taking inspiration from the works of writer Henry James, the show follows a young governess who is hired by a man to care for his orphaned niece and nephew at the Bly estate. Once there, the young woman finds strange occurrences that hint at dark secrets. Like Flanagan's other shows, The Haunting of Bly Manor will keep viewers on the edge of their seats.\nBased on the real-life Shelby family, who built an empire of gambling and bootlegging from the ashes of the war and a ruined England, Peaky Blinders displays the raw talent and resourcefulness that can result from education found in the gritty streets of Birmingham. The popular series follows the main protagonist Tommy Shelby on his rise through his family's hierarchy and the criminal hierarchy of Birmingham. Eventually, his influence and power reach further than he ever dreamed; to the English aristocracy, where his street smarts are pitted against the nobles' book learning to astonishing results.\nWhen even the famous consulting detective Sherlock Holmes can't solve the case, a group of misfits who live on the streets of gritty Victorian London are called upon to lend their talents to its shadowy machinations by his esteemed associate Dr. John Watson. This is Holmes' as fans have never seen before, and the eccentric characters are as unique as the series of supernatural capers they help solve. Viewers will enjoy helping \"The Irregulars\" solve their puzzles as much as the intriguing setting, which vacillates between the criminal underworld and the royal palace.\nBased on the novels by Deborah Harkness, A Discovery of Witches is a Prime Video Dark Academia show about a witch and a vampire who protect powerful texts at the Oxford Bodleian Library. In the world of the series, vampires and witches are long-time enemies, but here they realize they have to work together to keep a specific book out of the hands of people who wish to unleash a great evil on the world. The cast includes Matthew Goode as vampire Matthew Clairmont and Teresa Palmer as witch historian Diana Bishop. There were three seasons of the series and a total of 25 episodes.\nRELATED: The 50 Best TV Shows Of All Time, Ranked\nThere have been several adaptations of the Charlotte Bronte book Jane Eyre, but one of the best arrived in 2011 from director Cary Joji Fukunaga (True Detective). This Dark Academia movie stars Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre, an orphan with a dire childhood who found a home with St. John Rivers. Once she turned 18, she went to Thornfield Hall where she became a governess. However, she soon falls in love with Mr. Rochester, the master of Thornfield Hall (Michael Fassbender). The movie won several awards and even picked up one Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design.\nOscar-winning director Guillermo del Toro has played with the Dark Academia genre before in Crimson Peak and other projects, but he has a lot of fun embracing it in this twisted Netflix series. Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities is an anthology horror series that features eight separate stories that are told with that gothic feel placed within modern settings. Other filmmakers such as Vincenzo Natali, Ana Lily Amirpour, and Jennifer Kent helm some of the other stories. The anthology ensemble also includes actors such as Andrew Lincoln and Dan Stevens. While perhaps not as impactful as some of Guillermo del Toro's best movies, it is a strong anthology series for fans of the filmmaker.\nReleased in 2009, An Education was a coming-of-age drama based on the memoir by British journalist Lynn Barber. In the movie, Carey Mulligan stars as Jenny, a schoolgirl who meets a charming con man who seduces her (played by Peter Sarsgaard). A period picture, the story takes place in 1961 in London and Jenny has dreams of attending Oxford when she meets David. She then allows him to manipulate her and her parents, and soon learns that things are not always as good as they seem as she almost ruins her entire chance for an education and future. The movie picked up three Oscar nominations, including one for Mulligan.\nThe free-spirited and dynamic younger sister of Sherlock Holmes, the famous consulting detective, finally embarks on her own exciting adventure in Enola Holmes, starring Millie Bobby Brown as the titular Holmes sibling. Well-versed in martial arts, physics, astrology, history, and methods of deduction, she puts all of her incredible skills to work discerning the whereabouts of her missing mother, with no help from her famous older brother. Though her educational background is formidable, it isn't based on formal training and thus is dismissed despite its immense efficacy.\nBefore he was Doctor Strange in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Benedict Cumberbatch took on the role of Sherlock Holmes, the world's greatest fictional detective. In this series, created by the BBC, Holmes and his partner John Watson (another MCU veteran in Martin Freeman) had four seasons and some of Holmes' most popular cases as the intellectual detective solved the toughest of crimes. The episodes were all feature-length, with three in each season, and one special that arrived in 2016. Of the Dark Academia shows on streaming services, Sherlock remains one of the smartest.\n\n"}

A hidden reveal, which the episode leaves viewers to interpret themselves, without explicitly discussing it is the latest significant Endgame change in the period since the Avengers finally took down Josh Brolin's Thanos, continuing the Infinity Saga's over-riding importance to the MCU. The implications of that reveal are not only major for Endgame, but also for the future of the MCU beyond Avengers: Secret Wars.\nWhen Loki season 1 released in 2021, the show opened a significant plot hole that retrospectively changed Captain America's otherwise perfect Endgame ending. The ending saw Chris Evans' Captain America skip out of the main MCU timeline to return to the 1940s and get his happily after with Peggy Carter after returning the Infinity Stones to their correct places. While avoiding the temporal disaster the Ancient One predicted would otherwise happen, Cap's decision created a new multiverse branch, that Loki's introduction of the TVA should have made problematic. In short, Captain America's happy ending branch should have been pruned as a violation of the Sacred Timeline, and only an implied loophole (that He Who Remained allowed it for some reason as an exception) has been the only justification. Now, Loki season 2 has made that suggestion MCU canon in a genius way.\nRelated: Every Loki Season 2 Episode 1 MCU Easter Egg & Reference\nThe first episode of Loki season 2 introduces the Temporal Loom, a huge invention of the TVA created to allow He Who Remains to control the flow of time, as he revealed he was doing in season 1. Loki's lore previously revealed that He Who Remains managed to harness the power of Alioth to end the Multiversal War by defeating his own rogue variants and destroying their timelines, before consolidating the Sacred Timeline. What wasn't quite as clear was how He Who Remains kept control of the flow of time without using the Infinity Stones (which the Ancient One claimed controlled the flow of time in Avengers: Endgame). But Loki season 2 reveals that as well as using the TVA to prune rogue branches, He Who Remains used the Temporal Loom to form the Sacred Timeline in the first place.\nCrucially, the other thing the Temporal Loom reveals is that the way everyone has thought about the Sacred Timeline is actually a lie. Simplified images of the timeline in Loki season 1 presented a single line, with individual branches breaking off from it, but season 2 reveals that the Sacred Timeline is actually a bundle of separate timelines bound together to form a rope, rather than a single thread. That seismic change means that as well as the main MCU timeline (either 616 or 199999 depending on who you believe), multiple other \"universes\" are actually part of the Sacred Timeline.\nFundamentally, Loki season 2 reveals that the Temporal Loom was always designed to tie branches together into one acceptable Sacred Timeline, so branches weren't all outlawed, it was simply that too many of them would destroy the order of the Sacred Timeline. As OB says:\n\"The Temporal Loom is the heart of the TVA. It's where raw time is refined into physical timeline. And it's not constructed to weave together so many new branches, so it's overloading.\"\nIn other words, He Who Remains allowed the existence of different universes and branches, as long as they could be tied together in a linear rope, existing parallel to one another, and not causing chaos. As the image of the unstable Sacred Timeline from the TVA's own monitors shows in Loki season 2's premiere, the Temporal Loom has a built-in threshold for branches, and it's only after that point that things start to really go wrong:\nThat is huge for Captain America and Avengers: Endgame, because it suggests that the branch that Cap created by returning to the 1940s on Earth-616 was just one of the multiple threads within the unified Sacred Timeline. It didn't create a deviation from He Who Remains' plan, because it was tied into the Sacred Timeline by the Temporal Loom, which offers the belated explanation behind why the TVA didn't appear to prune Chris Evans' veteran Avenger.\nThat also means that Captain America was able to live his life happily without looking over his shoulder for TVA hunters as Sophia Di Martino's Sylvie was forced to. While he may have had to hide his existence from those in the timeline he knew he was \"killed\" when he went into the ice, Cap could marry Peggy Carter and get the true happy ending he had been robbed off by Captain America: The First Avenger's ending.\nEven more intriguingly for the MCU away from Avengers: Endgame specifically, the new explanation of the Sacred Timeline also explains why the Amazing Spider-Man, Raimi's Spider-Man, Sony's Spider-Verses, Fox's Marvel Universe (which is confirmed to come into the MCU with Deadpool 3) and basically every other Marvel movie timeline \"annexed\" to the MCU were able to coexist with the MCU without the TVA turning up to prune them, despite their confirmed links to the MCU.\nFor the MCU's future movies, that also means that any future Multiversal War that ends with the Sacred Timeline being restored could still include the same alternate universes as threads within the larger timeline system. That would mean Deadpool could still exist outside of the main timeline, if Marvel Studios choose to isolate him, and opens up further possibilities with the Multiverse, without there needing to be a catch-all solution that makes other timelines impossible. Quite how that will play out will obviously be revealed in the upcoming Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars, but the idea that that would have to be a full reset to unify all timelines perhaps isn't quite true.\nNew episodes of Loki season 2 release every Thursday on Disney+\nWant more Loki content?

{"title": "The War Doctor's Name Is Meaningless In Doctor Who Now", "date": "2023-10-06 12:31:24", "text": "The War Doctor is never classed among the regenerations due to their actions during the Time War, but the War Doctor deserves to be recognized.\nDoctor Who has rendered the War Doctor’s name meaningless despite their redemption at the end of the Time War. The War Doctor was introduced in the 50th Anniversary special of Doctor Who, when the questions around the events of the Time War were finally answered in “The Day of the Doctor”. The War Doctor is technically the 9th Doctor, but his hidden story meant Christopher Eccleston’s regeneration in New-Who is classed as the 9th Doctor. Throughout “The Day of the Doctor”, David Tennant and Matt Smith’s 10th and 11th regenerations recalled their time as the War Doctor with great shame, hiding their past as much as possible.\nDue to the supposed genocide the War Doctor caused during the Time War, the War Doctor disavowed the name of the Doctor, deeming themselves unworthy to represent it. Rescinding the name of the Doctor meant Eccleston’s incarnation became the 9th Doctor and the War Doctor had no name, but was referred to as the War Doctor, Doctor of War, the Warrior, and the Renegade. The Doctor may be ashamed of this version of themselves, but this is not the only reason the War Doctor has no title, and it may not be entirely fair the War Doctor is rejected in this way.\nRelated: Doctor Who Season 14: Release Date Prediction, New Cast & Everything We Know\nThe Doctor may be ashamed of the Ward Doctor’s intentions during the Time War, but this may not be deserved. “The Day of the Doctor” revealed the actual events of the Time War and proved the War Doctor did not actually commit double genocide. Being able to find a peaceful solution to the Time War with 10 and 11 did mean the War Doctor was comfortable taking their name again, but due to the timelines being out of sync this never comes to fruition. The War Doctor reclaiming the Doctor’s name also had no effect on the regenerations, and the War Doctor is still not classed as the 9th Doctor.\nNot only did the War Doctor not do what they are accused of, but other regenerations have followed through with morally worse actions. The Doctor aims to be the hero, but even regenerations after the War Doctor commit actions much worse than that version. The 13th Doctor committed a horrific triple genocide in Flux by extinguishing the Daleks, Cybermen, and Sontarans in one. Not only that, but the 13th Doctor showed no remorse for their actions, whereas the War Doctor massively struggled with the weight of their would-be actions. Flux alone questions how Thirteen is more deserving of the Doctor name than the War Doctor.\nHowever, the War Doctor still not embracing the Doctor’s name is more complicated. The skewered timelines meant the 9th Doctor believed they caused the ending of the Time War and committed genocide against their own race, something that weighed heavily on them. The War Doctor is no worse than other Doctors, and arguably better than some, as someone still needed to be responsible for the ending of the Time War. The War Doctor did not do what they were accused of, but they are an easy scapegoat when the Time Lords and the Doctor themselves needed someone to blame.\nThe War Doctor taking the fall and dropping the title of the Doctor represents that sacrifice. His separate identity also encouraged the Doctor’s own growth to make them become almost a different person, even a new Doctor. The War Doctor’s actions plays on future incarnations' minds, because when it came down to it, the Doctor knows they were willing to commit an act as detestable as genocide in Doctor Who, making him symbolic of an era the Doctor would rather forget.\n"}
{"title": "Star Trek's New Super-Weapon Finally Fulfills the Promise of the Genesis Device", "date": "2023-10-06 12:31:24", "text": "The Genesis Device is one of the most controversial aspects of Star Trek II, but now a new super weapon finally fulfills Genesis' promise. \nWarning: Contains spoilers for Star Trek #12!Star Trek’s new super-weapon finally fulfills the promise of the Genesis Device. One of the most controversial aspects of the franchise, the Genesis Device is a destructive weapon in the galaxy, despite its benign origins and intentions. In Star Trek #12, a new and similar weapon is unleashed during the “Day of Blood,” with shocking results.\nStar Trek #12 is written by Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly and drawn by Angel Unzueta. The Klingon Emperor Kahless has obtained the Bajoran Orb of Destruction and plans to use it to complete his god-killer array. While analyzing the Orb of Creation, Spock and Scotty realize it has the same energy signature as the Genesis Device. Harnessing the power of the Orb takes a team effort, with both crews coming together to build a device that can tap into its energies. They fire the Orb’s energies at Kahless’ headquarters. Plants and grass begin to spring up, ultimately reaching the throne room and reviving a dead Alexander, while Kahless retreats.\nThe Genesis Device began with the best of intentions, but left a dark legacy. First appearing in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, the Genesis Device allowed its user to terraform a planet in a matter of hours, as opposed to decades. One of its designers, Doctor David Marcus, immediately saw its potential as a weapon, and his fears were realized when both Khan and the Klingon commander Kruge sought to use it against the Federation. The Genesis Device worked, but thanks to David introducing proto-matter into it, it was not stable. Eventually, the Federation shut down its research into the technology.\nThe Orb of Creation shares a lot in common with the Genesis Device. Both bring life to where there was previously none, but the Orb is far more stable. This no doubt owes to it being crafted by non-linear beings far beyond our comprehension. The Bajoran Prophets have a firmer grip on the nature of space-time and this allows them to build something that will truly work. Humans, by nature of their linear existence, do not understand these concepts and lack the power as well, forcing them to take shortcuts, like using proto-matter. The Orb also revived Alexander much like Genesis brought back Spock.\nRelated: These Two Characters Are Star Trek's Newest, Greatest Odd Couple\nHowever, as seen in season three of Star Trek: Picard, the Federation never stopped working on the Genesis Device. When Worf raided a Section 31 facility, he saw the research had continued, resulting in the Genesis II. It was a “blink and miss it” reference, and was never talked about again. The ability to rapidly terraform a planet is an awesome one, but unfortunately the potential for evil inherent in it renders it non-practical. However, the Bajoran Orb of Creation, Star Trek’s new super weapon, fulfills the promise of the Genesis Device in a much better way.\nStar Trek #12 is on sale now from IDW Publishing!\nShaun Corley is a freelance writer currently residing in the mountains of Appalachia.

{"title": "&quot;Should Probably Win Best Picture&quot;: Barbie Gets Rave Review From Fan-Favorite Horror Director", "date": "2023-10-06 12:22:09", "text": "Even horror movie directors are fans of Barbie, as a fan-favorite genre filmmaker explains why Greta Gerwig’s film should probably win Best Picture.\nDoctor Strange and The Black Phone director Scott Derrickson has added his voice to the long list of vocal supporters of Greta Garwig’s Barbie. Based on Mattel’s iconic line of fashion dolls, the movie smashed box office predictions to become the highest-grossing live-action comedy of all-time. Off the back of the movie’s monumental success, Warner Bros. is striving to have it nominated in several key awards categories for next year's Oscars, including Best Original Screenplay, Best Picture, and acting nominations for Barbie stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.\nWhile speaking with The Playlist’s The Discourse podcast, Derrickson discussed his favorite movies of the year and nominated Gerwig’s Barbie and the Argentinian possession horror film When Evil Lurks as his top two. He also went on to describe Gerwig’s film as an “extraordinary movie on every level” and deserving of a 2024 Best Picture win. Check out his comments below:\n“By the way, those movies [based on existing IP] can be amazing. I think ‘Barbie’ is the best film I’ve seen this year—well, maybe that’s not true; I saw this horror film, ‘When Evil Lurks’ at Fantastic Fest, but ‘Barbie’ and ‘When Evil Lurks’ those are my two favorite films of the year, which couldn’t be further away from each other.\n“’Barbie’ is a good example of populist I.P. that was treated with true brilliance. That’s an extraordinary movie on every level. I think it should probably win Best Picture; the writing is so clever and so smart and subversive, the acting is amazing, and it’s so entertaining, it’s artful in its visuals, the style of it, it’s just an awesome film.”\nWhile Barbie’s overwhelming box office success and widespread popular appeal make it a natural choice to be listed among the nominees of 2024’s Academy Award for Best Picture, for years many commentators have noted the category’s tendency to favor smaller, independent fare over big-budget blockbusters. While this year’s own list of nominations seemed to buck the trend somewhat, by including box office hits like Avatar: The Way Of Water and Top Gun: Maverick, the award would ultimately end up going to the much more modest Everything Everywhere All at Once.\nIn fact, it has now been over 20 years since a Best Picture winner has accumulated anything akin to Barbie’s impressive $1.43 billion worldwide gross, namely since 2003’s The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, whose own takings topped $1.14 billion. Though it is fundamentally true that box office popularity does not always equate with excellence in film making, Barbie reviews have praised Gerwig's approach for its exceedingly clever writing, impressive production values and exceptional performances.\nMoreover, Gerwig is no stranger to seeing her films contend for Best Picture and retains many of the independent filmmaking sensibilities that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences seem to value so highly. Yet at this stage, it is not even clear whether Barbie will be nominated, let alone win. With a growing list of filmmakers like Derrickson on her side, however, Gerwig's chances are steadily growing.\nSource: The Playlist\n"}
{"title": "The Highest-Grossing Pixar Movies Of All Time", "date": "2023-10-06 12:20:26", "text": "The highest-grossing Pixar movies include Toy Story and Inside Out, but which movie from the studio comes out on top?\nThe highest grossing Pixar movies of all time might not quite reach the level of Disney Animation movies, but with the critical acclaim added on, they might be even more impressive. Pixar Animation Studios got started in 1979 as part of LucasFilm before breaking away and becoming its own animation studio under Steve Jobs and Apple. After making a short film called Luxo Jr. in 1986, the studio worked hard to create the first-ever CGI animated movie in 1995 called Toy Story. That was just the start, as Pixar quickly became one of the top critically acclaimed animated movie studios in cinema history.\nUsing data from Box Office Mojo, the highest grossing Pixar movies worldwide have an impressive list of films, titles that can compete with anything from Disney, DreamWorks, Sony, or any other animation studio pumping out feature films. These include stories about sentient toys, a world where cars exist, but people are nowhere to be found a world where monsters deliver screams and laughs to remain alive, and even a world where the emotions in a child's mind like the upcoming Inside Out 2, are living beings that help determine people's actions and reactions.\nRELATED: The 50 Best Movies Of All Time\nA Bugs Life was the second-ever Pixar movie following Toy Story, and while it made more than the first Pixar movie, few people talk about it anymore. One problem with its release was that DreamWorks also had a movie about bugs hitting that year in Antz. While A Bug's Life made almost $200 million more than Antz, it was still not a huge take at the box office and ranks near the bottom of the highest grossing Pixar movies of all time. The movie still carried on the Pixar method of delivering a smart story with brilliant animation, this one based on the Aesop fable The Ant and the Grasshopper.\nBy the time Pixar released Cars 3, it had delivered a couple of disappointing releases with the misunderstood Brave and poorly received The Good Dinosaur. Add to the fact that people had soured on Cars after the first two movies, and it kept people away from theaters for this third movie. That is disappointing because Cars 3 was the best of the three and delivered the type of story Pixar specializes in. Much like Woody in the Toy Story franchise, Lightning McQueen needed to figure out where his place in the world was when he saw the end closing in. This third movie held back the zany humor and had a lot of heart, which might lead to Cars 4.\nThe first Cars movie wasn't received overly favorably by critics, but it still made good money for Pixar. The movie was a love letter to the iconic Route 66 and how interstates helped kill the small towns along the roads that Route 66 connected. While it didn't get good reviews, there were fans who connected with the story, and they helped the movie rise up the charts of the highest grossing Pixar movies of all time, and while it made less than its first sequel, it still finished with a respectable $461 million at the worldwide box office.\nThe first Toy Story movie remains an iconic classic, but that was Pixar's first movie, and it wasn't going to be a huge box office success thanks to that. However, Pixar had a chance to recoup on their newfound popularity with the sequel, Toy Story 2. One thing that has set Pixar apart from many other studios is that the sequels are often even better than the originals, especially in the Toy Story franchise where the second movie eclipsed the first and the third was better than the second. The movies in that specific series also made more money with each installment, with the second making more than the first, but not as much as the third and fourth.\nIn what might be the biggest surprise in Pixar movie history, Elemental moved up the list of the highest grossing Pixar movies of all time despite everyone calling it a bomb. The reason people dismissed Elemental was because it had a bad opening weekend. However, no one foresaw the movie having the legs it did. While some thought it was going to fail like Lightyear, the difference is that Elemental was an original idea and those need positive word of mouth, even if it is a Pixar movie. It picked up that word of mouth and almost ended up at $500 million and proved to be a hit.\nWall-E, which earned $521 million worldwide, is a movie that proved Pixar are masters at what they do. The movie features almost no dialogue, which seems ludicrous for a kid's movie. However, it worked beautifully. WALL-E is a robot left on Earth to clean up the mess after humans had to abandon the planet due to pollution, causing toxic poison in the air. He soon sees and falls for another robot called EVE, and the two of them try to send the message that Earth is ready to give humans a second chance.\nA Pixar film that deserves more attention, Brave is the studio's take on a Disney Princess movie, and it shows how Pixar was able to turn the tropes of a Disney Princess movie on their heads, grossing $538 million worldwide in the process. The princess in this movie, Merida, does not need a man to help save her, and she confronted both the curse that she unknowingly placed on her family and the expectations that come with her societal role, with determination and courage. The combination of it being a familiar genre and Pixar's history at this point helped it be a hit.\nThough Cars 2 is one of Pixar's less successful works critically, it grossed $191 million domestically and $559 million worldwide. The story of Cars 2 flips the script of the original movie and turns the fish out of water story into a spy caper, as Lightning McQueen sets out to stop crime overseas. Cars 2's critical reception did not signal the end of the Pixar franchise. Far from it, in fact, as it was followed by a sequel, and help spawned the spin-off movie series Planes.\nMonsters, Inc. tells the original story of Mike and Sulley, as they work to power the city of Monstropolis by collecting the screams of human children. Unfortunately, when one kid, Boo, escapes into the monster world, Mike and Sulley have to put her back without their co-workers or boss noticing. Monsters, Inc. scared its way to a $290 million domestic gross in 2001. Worldwide, it took in $578 million. It was followed not only by a feature-length prequel but also a Disney+ release which acts as a sequel, titled Monsters at Work.\nRELATED: Pixar Proves Animated Movies Don’t Need A-List Actors To Be Successful\nRatatouille is a film that took Pixar overseas, as the story's setting is Paris, in the world of fine dining cuisine. Its story follows Remy, a rat who wishes more than anything to be a chef, and Linguini, the human who becomes his friend. Together, they save a restaurant and impress an otherwise harsh food critic. Showing that a great artist can come from anywhere, Ratatouille's heartwarming story not only made $623 million at the worldwide box office but is one of several Pixar films to win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature.\nThe Incredibles follows a family of super-powered individuals who find themselves in a world that no longer accepts superheroes. However, when the family's dad, Mr. Incredible, gets a secret offer that will let him get back into hero work, he jumps at the offer, leaving the rest of his family behind to figure out what's going on and what to do about it. The first Incredibles movie was not only a critical and box office success, grossing $631 million worldwide, but it also introduced audiences to one of Pixar's funniest characters, the iconic Edna Mode, making it an even more memorable affair.\nAn emotional and lovely story, Up follows a retired man, Carl, who wishes to visit Paradise Falls in South America—a destination he and his wife had planned to visit before her passing. After being asked to move into a retirement home, he takes his dreams into his own hands and flies his house there using helium balloons. The adventure was a hit with fans, as it swept in $293 million at the domestic box office and $735 million worldwide. Full of lovable characters, talking dog Dug later received his own spin-off series of shorts on Disney+, titled Dug Days.\nMonsters University is the prequel to Monsters, Inc. which follows Mike and Sulley back in their college days. Though they first find themselves at odds, they soon come together as they compete to become the best of their university's scarers. Monsters University helps establish how Mike and Sulley come to be at their jobs in Monsters, Inc., and capitalized on the pair's chemistry to earn a humongous $743 million worldwide.\nCoco takes its inspiration from the Mexican celebration of the Day of the Dead and follows a boy, Miguel, who dreams of being a musician but is forbidden to become one by his family. A string of events lands Miguel in the Land of the Dead, where he meets his ancestors and uncovers secrets of his family history. Particularly celebrated for its gorgeous visuals and soundtrack, Coco made $210 million domestically but finished off its run with an impressive $807 million gross worldwide, one of the highest grossing Pixar movies of all time.\nInside Out tells the story of a hockey-loving girl, Riley, who grapples with the reality of moving. The movie is largely told from the perspective of the emotions in Riley's mind; Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. Together, they aim to help Riley settle into her new home, discovering the complexity of emotions along the way. The animated movie deals with serious issues in a way that's easy for viewers of all ages to understand, and its success led to the announcement of a sequel, Inside Out 2, scheduled for release in 2024. Inside Out made $356 million domestically and $858 million worldwide.\nClownfish are naturally shy, so Pixar decided to find out what happened when one of these creatures, Marlin, was forced to venture through the ocean to track down his son, Nemo, in Finding Nemo. The resulting film is heartwarming and breathtaking, leading to theme park rides and a sequel. Finding Nemo raked in a $380 million domestic gross, adding on an additional $559 at the foreign box office that led it to take $940 million worldwide, easily moving it into the running for one of the highest grossing Pixar movies of all time.\nFinding Dory explores the origins of Pixar's favorite blue tang fish, Dory. When the largely forgetful Dory begins to get flashbacks of the past, she ends up on a journey to track down her parents. The popular sequel to Finding Nemo earned $486 million at the domestic box office, contributing to a gigantic $1.02 billion worldwide. It received exceedingly positive reviews for further exploring this favorite character while staying true to the tone of its predecessor. It was the love for the first movie that helped this become one of the highest grossing Pixar movies of all time.\n Toy Story 3 explores Woody and the gang's attempt to return home after they are mistakenly donated to a daycare before Andy leaves for college. Things get tense when the Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear—a stuffed animal who was abandoned by his owner—drags the toys through an agenda of his own. The third installment in the Toy Story series was released eleven years after the second and played its way to $415 million at the domestic box office. This combined with the overseas takings led to a gross of over $1.06 billion worldwide, one of the highest grossing Pixar movies of all time.\nThe most recent entry in the iconic Toy Story franchise, Toy Story 4, outdid all entries in the series that came before it to earn $1.07 billion dollars worldwide. The toys' latest adventure explores what happens when Woody's new kid, Bonnie, makes her own toy using a spork and googly eyes. Things get even more intense when this created toy, Forky, runs away, and Woody runs into Bo Peep outside an old antique shop. Like the series' earlier installments, Toy Story 4 is both hilarious and emotional and help set up Toy Story 5.\nThe highest-grossing Pixar movie of all time is Incredibles 2, raking in $608 million domestically and $1.2 billion worldwide. The sequel takes place directly after the conclusion of the first film, and explores Mrs. Incredible's new secret missions, which are designed to bring supers back into the spotlight. Meanwhile, Mr. Incredible must deal with the kids at home, learning to understand Violet's boy problems, Dash's homework, and Jack-Jack's new powers. It wasn't quite as well received as the original but was still another strong entry for Pixar.\n\nBrooke is a Screen Rant staff writer obsessed with music and movies.

After Marvel Studios and Sony negotiated a deal in 2015, Tom Holland was cast as the MCU's official version of Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man, taking over the role from Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, who'd portrayed the wall-crawler in Sony's prior franchises. Holland made his first appearance as Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil War, but has since been involved in Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, has completed his first solo MCU trilogy, and Spider-Man 4 is in development.\nAs one of the MCU's youngest heroes, Peter Parker was introduced in Civil War as a 15-year-old student who had only recently been gifted his superhuman abilities after being bitten by a spider. Marvel Studios chose not to retell Spider-Man's origin story in the MCU, as it had previously been adapted twice at Sony, so Parker was instead thrown straight into the action. Over the last seven years, audiences have watched Peter Parker grow from a teenager into a young adult, with Spider-Man: No Way Home setting him up to embark on a new adventure in the MCU's future. Here's a breakdown of Spider-Man's entire timeline in the MCU.\nRelated: 10 Spider-Man Movie Moments That Divided Fans Most\nNot much is known about Peter Parker's childhood in the MCU, other than the fact that he was born on August 10, 2001, and at some point in his youth, his parents became absent. This left him in the care of his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, which follows Parker's backstory laid out in Marvel Comics and in Sony's previous Marvel films. Some theories have suggested that Spider-Man's parents may still be alive in the MCU, which could be revisited in the future, though there has currently been no mention of them in the MCU.\n2010's Iron Man 2 released years before Spider-Man joined the MCU, but after Peter Parker's debut, theories began to arise suggesting the child seen taking on a HAMMER Drone wearing an Iron Man mask could have been a young Peter Parker. While this was purely speculation, Tom Holland himself confirmed this theory while speaking to The Huffington Post, showing that Parker had been a fan of Iron Man long before the armored Avenger recruited him. This connection would later see Tony Stark become a mentor to Peter Parker, and demonstrates the brilliance of the MCU's interconnectivity.\nIn a change from the widely-accepted backstory for Spider-Man, Uncle Ben died prior to Peter Parker being bitten by a spider in the MCU. While Marvel Studios has never shown Uncle Ben on screen, he was mentioned during 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming, with his death being noted as being one of the main reasons Parker chose to keep his identity as Spider-Man a secret from everyone, including Aunt May. Uncle Ben's death left a lasting legacy on Parker's actions as Spider-Man, and made his connection with Aunt May even stronger, as the pair only had each other from then on.\nAt the age of 14, Peter Parker was bitten by a spider and gained spider-like abilities overnight. These meant he was able to stick to walls and ceilings, adjusted his eyesight, and gave him enhanced strength, reflexes, agility, and senses. As a young genius, Peter Parker used his scientific mind to create synthetic webbing that he could shoot from utensils on his wrists, allowing him to operate as the vigilante Spider-Man. His actions as a \"friendly neighborhood Spider-Man\" caught the attention of many fans in Queens, and saw him quickly become an internet sensation, with videos showing him catching speeding cars and saving bystanders.\nAfter learning of Spider-Man operating in Queens, Tony Stark tracked him down and recruited him to join his team in Captain America: Civil War, marking Peter Parker's MCU debut. Parker traveled to Berlin with Stark and Happy Hogan, was gifted a new, streamlined suit, and fought alongside Team Iron Man against Team Cap, who had drifted apart over disputes caused by the Sokovia Accords and the framing of Bucky Barnes. During this battle, Spider-Man fought Captain America, Bucky Barnes, the Falcon, and Ant-Man, proving his worth as a new hero in the MCU, but was dropped back home after the events of the film.\nBack in Queens, Spider-Man longed to officially joined the Avengers, but in the meantime, dealt with smaller threats, such as retrieving a stolen bicycle, stopping a carjacker, and thwarting a bank robbery. In investigating strange technology in the neighborhood, Spider-Man learned of Adrian Toomes' Vulture, witnessing his robbery of tech acquired by Damage Control. Parker scaled the Washington Monument to save his friends, and intercepted the Vulture's crew on the Staten Island Ferry, but almost caused catastrophe. Spider-Man later battled the Vulture at Coney Island, incapacitating the villain and earning Stark's trust, though he would refuse Stark's offer to become a member of the MCU's Avengers.\nDuring a field trip to the MOMA, Parker's Spider-Sense alerted him to alien activity in New York during Avengers: Infinity War. He arrived to help Iron Man and Doctor Strange handle Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian, but found himself inadvertently traveling into space after stowing away on Maw's ship. Luckily, Parker was on hand to help save Doctor Strange, and his bravery in these moments prompted Tony Stark to finally christen Spider-Man as a member of the Avengers. Parker helped Stark land Maw's ship on Titan, and prepared to battle the Mad Titan Thanos once the Guardians of the Galaxy arrived.\nAfter meeting the Guardians of the Galaxy, the team, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man devised a plan to retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos once he arrived on Titan in search of the Time Stone. Spider-Man put up a strong fight against the Mad Titan with the help of Strange's portals, but was ultimately no match for Thanos, who proclaimed him to be an \"insect.\" Parker saved the Guardians of the Galaxy after Thanos hurled Titan's moon at the planet, but soon found himself trapped on Titan with the other heroes after Thanos acquired the Time Stone and departed for Earth.\nUnaware of Thanos' actions in Wakanda in the final moments of Avengers: Infinity War, the surviving heroes on Titan waited and watched as most of them turned to dust following Thanos' snap. All the Guardians of the Galaxy, except for Nebula, disappeared, followed by Doctor Strange, which left Spider-Man as the last hero to suffer the same fate. In an emotional moment, Parker apologized to Stark before turning to dust, leaving the armored Avenger distraught and unsure of what to do next, though he would return to Earth and battle in Peter Parker's name during Avengers: Endgame.\nFive years after being snapped away by Thanos in Infinity War, the Hulk's snap in Avengers: Endgame brought back all the dusted heroes, including Spider-Man. Peter Parker joined the Avengers for the Battle of Earth, returning to his homeworld through one of Doctor Strange's portals. Parker was key to protecting the Avengers' Infinity Gauntlet in Endgame's final battle, though would eventually hand the artifact over to Captain Marvel. After Iron Man gathered the Infinity Stones and eradicated Thanos and his army, Peter Parker had a moment to say a final farewell to his friend and mentor, and turned up to Stark's funeral with Aunt May before returning home.\nEight months after the Battle of Earth, Peter Parker was still suffering the loss of Tony Stark, but embarked on a school trip to Europe nonetheless. However, the appearance of Nick Fury and a multiversal hero, Mysterio, dragged him back into action. Mysterio soon revealed himself to be a fraud, intent on destroying London in an effort to fool the world into thinking he's the strongest hero ever, with the help of Stark's drones casting illusions. Peter Parker would use his Spider-Sense to detect Mysterio's illusions, eventually taking him on one-to-one and defeating the villain, earning the respect of Nick Fury (who had actually been the Skrull Talos in disguise).\nDuring Spider-Man: Far From Home's excursion to Europe, Peter Parker and MJ finally began their romantic relationship, shortly after the latter worked out that Parker was Spider-Man. After returning to New York, Parker and MJ embarked on their first date, swinging through the streets of the city much to MJ's dismay, yet this would end with Spider-Man's identity being revealed to the world by J. Jonah Jameson. In Spider-Man: No Way Home, Parker mentioned that his favorite time had been the one week he'd spent with MJ before the world found out who he is, but the pair would stay together even through this difficult time.\nAfter Parker, MJ, and Ned Leeds were refused enrollment into MIT because of their connections to Spider-Man, Parker sought the help of Doctor Strange to make the world forget his true identity. However, Parker tampered with Strange's spell in an effort to have Ned, MJ, Aunt May, and Happy remember him, which caused a destabilization of the multiverse, dragging individuals who knew Peter Parker from other realities into the MCU proper. Spider-Man: No Way Home saw Parker attempt to cure the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Lizard, and Electro from Sony's previous Spider-Man films, yet he'd come to odds with Strange, who wanted to send them home to their deaths.\nSpider-Man: No Way Home saw Peter Parker trap Doctor Strange in the Mirror Dimension and continue his scheme to cure the multiversal villains of their various inflictions. However, the Green Goblin living inside Norman Osborn didn't want to be cured, and convinced Lizard, Electro, and Sandman that they didn't need to be either, leading to an epic battle at Happy Hogan's condominium that tragically ended in the death of Aunt May. Whereas Uncle Ben usually delivered the \"with great power\" speech, May got this chance in No Way Home, urging Parker to do the right thing, but leaving him angry and heartbroken nevertheless.\nAfter Aunt May's death, Tom Holland's Peter Parker was met by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's versions of Spider-Man, also dragged into the MCU proper by Doctor Strange's spell. Together, the trio created cures for each of the multiversal villains, and during a battle at the Statue of Liberty, managed to inject each villain with their cure, including, reluctantly, Norman Osborn. Interacting with his variants allowed Holland's Spider-Man a few moments of brotherhood and connection with people who knew exactly what he was going through, giving him the opportunity to learn from their shared experiences.\nDespite curing all the multiversal villains, their existence in the MCU threatened the stability of the multiverse, but Peter Parker realized the only way to protect everyone was for Doctor Strange to complete his original spell. Doing this, everyone forgot Peter Parker, yet retained memories of Spider-Man. This returned the other Spider-Men and their villains to their home realities, but left the MCU's Spider-Man completely alone, as not even MJ, Ned, or Happy remembered him. With his place at MIT jeopardized, Parker began a GED program from his new apartment in New York, and sewed himself a new suit to operate as a more mature Spider-Man in the MCU's future.\n"}
{"title": "Carol's Walking Dead Spinoff Exit Actually Saved Daryl's TV Show", "date": "2023-10-06 12:20:25", "text": "Carol's exit from the original Daryl Dixon spinoff plan has actually helped save the show despite Melissa McBride and Norman Reedus' great chemistry.\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon episode 4\nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon was initially supposed to feature Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) alongside Daryl (Norman Reedus), but her exit actually helped save the show. Daryl and Carol were two of the most popular characters on the main show and were mainstays for the entire 11 seasons. Both developed massively as characters and were crucial for The Walking Dead's final arc. The premise of a spinoff between the two does sound promising, although perhaps not essential. Despite being fan favorites and having great chemistry, Daryl Dixon has benefited from Carol not being included in the spinoff and leaving Daryl solo.\nWhile the spinoff is better off without Carol, it has nothing do to with the quality of her character or Melissa McBride's performance. In fact, a solo Carol spinoff would likely have worked just as well, but the two together is simply not necessary. Many aspects of their relationship have already been explored. They have helped each other overcome emotional difficulties in their life and have grown closer as a result. They have also had their moments of confrontation but come the finale, their friendship was stronger than ever. Having already explored most of their relationship dynamic, a show featuring both Daryl and Carol would be less likely to succeed.\nFrom everything Daryl Dixon has offered so far, it is difficult to see how it would have worked with Carol involved. With the plot focusing on the importance of Daryl's arrival in relation to the main supporting characters, Carol also being part of this would make both her and Daryl feel less special. The relationship dynamic Daryl has with Isabelle (Clémence Poésy) and Laurent (Louis Puech Scigliuzzi) has helped give Daryl Dixon the highest Rotten Tomatoes score of all The Walking Dead projects. Adding Carol to the mix may have created different dynamics and conflict, but ultimately, they would have hurt the show.\nDaryl's relationship with the rest of the group is complicated enough without adding Carol to have potentially contrasting opinions. A spinoff with both characters may have had an entirely different plot, but that only further emphasizes the idea that the spinoff is better without her given how well Daryl's spinoff has performed. The unique feeling of Daryl alone in France couldn't be replicated with an ally alongside him; his journey into the unknown gives off a completely fresh feeling that could only be achieved on his own. Carol is a great character who should continue being involved in The Walking Dead universe, but she would be better off having her own spinoff, rather than sharing the spotlight.\nAlthough Dead City had a solid first season, it further highlighted that Walking Dead spinoffs are suited to one character. Daryl Dixon has been better than Dead City throughout its run, mainly because it has focused solely on Daryl. The cast and characters have been much more memorable in Daryl's spinoff since they serve a more important purpose to the show. Whereas Negan (Jeffery Dean Morgan) and Maggie's (Lauren Cohan) show revolves around only their journey, the supporting characters in Daryl Dixon are crucial in driving the plot and matter far more to the story.\nBy focusing only on the protagonist, Daryl Dixon gives new cast members the chance to really shine as Isabelle alone is far more interesting than any new character introduced in Dead City. By prioritizing Maggie and Negan, it makes everyone else unimportant as their story is the only one to get invested in. With Daryl Dixon, there are plenty of new communities that quickly become prominent as they are all involved in helping Daryl complete his journey. By no means is Dead City a poor show, but by having such a fixed narrative, its potential becomes far smaller than a show with an individual protagonist.\nEven though the show's narrative has worked better without her, Carol could still appear in Daryl Dixon. One of the episode previews showed Daryl contacting someone, the most likely candidate being Carol. This gives her an easy way to enter the picture, be it by joining Daryl in France or being there to meet him when he finally makes it back to America. Melissa McBride has already been spotted filming for The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 2. Ensuring the focus still stays on Daryl's story in France is important, but if done right, Carol could be a strong supporting character rather than a dual protagonist.\n"}
{"title": "Loki Season 2: Story, Release Date & Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-06 12:11:25", "text": "As confirmed by the end of Loki's finale, Tom Hiddleston's God of Mischief will return for a second season on Disney+. Here's what we know so far.\nLoki season 2 releases as part of Phase 5 ofthe MCU, with the Disney+ show revealing more about what the MCU's future might look like. After meeting his demise at the hands of Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War, the Avengers' Time Heist in Endgame unleashed a variant of Tom Hiddleston's God of Mischief on the MCU, and Loki season 1 saw him exploring the world of the Time Variance Authority (TVA), and coming face-to-face with Jonathan Majors' He Who Remains. If the Loki season 1 ending cliffhanger is anything to go by, season 2 will bring another helping of time travel drama to the MCU.\nSo far, Loki is the only one of Marvel Studios' live-action Disney+ series' to be gifted a second outing, though the animated What If...? and Spider-Man: Freshman Year have also been confirmed for second seasons too. Loki's time travel and timeline-jumping allows for endless possibilities for season 2, particularly after the titular God of Mischief appeared to find himself in a new timeline at the end of Loki season 1 - one where the TVA is ruled over by Kang the Conqueror instead of He Who Remains. With season 1 unleashing the multiverse, Loki season 2 will likely soon change the franchise drastically once again.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Cast Guide: Every New & Returning Marvel Character\nLoki season 2 released October 5, 2023, showing Tom Hiddleston back in action as Loki. Prior to this, the biggest step towards Loki season 2 came with the release of the first trailer, and the post-credits scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, as the MCU's first Phase 5 film featured the return of Loki and Owen Wilson's Mobius M. Mobius, who met Majors' Victor Timely in the early 20th Century. This confirmed that Loki season 2 would feature more time travel antics, showing the TVA duo investigating Kang the Conqueror and his variants throughout history.\nWhereas audiences wait patiently for some projects to be announced and confirmed by Marvel Studios, Loki season 2 was confirmed to be in development in the final moments of season 1. The finale, \"For All Time. Always,\" ended with the stinger revealing that \"Loki will return in season 2.\" This sticks to Marvel Studios' desire to expand on secondary characters' stories while interconnecting them to the theatrical releases - though it seems Loki isn't there yet, as his story still has some way to go on the small screen.\nLoki suffered delays along with many of Marvel Studios' Disney+ series - but luckily, Loki season 2 hasn't been delayed as drastically as some of its fellow TV shows. Originally planned for a summer-2023 release date, Loki season 2 instead released on October 5, 2023 - having been moved forward a day from its prior October 6 date - and is also set to release an episode every week. Similarly to Loki season 1, season 2 consists of six episodes, releasing every Thursday until the finale airs on November 9. Loki season 2 will be the second of the MCU's Disney+ shows releasing in 2023, following June's Secret Invasion, but preceding Echo, which will be released towards the end of November.\nMuch of the Loki season 1 cast is set to return for the second season alongside Tom Hiddleston in the starring role of Loki, the Asgardian God of Mischief. Returning for Loki season 2 are Owen Wilson as Mobius M. Mobius, Sophia Di Martino as Sylvie, Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Ravonna Renslayer, Wunmi Mosaku as Hunter B-15, Eugene Cordero as Casey, a.k.a. Hunter K-5E, and Tara Strong as Miss Minutes. Fresh off a monumental win at 2023's Academy Awards ceremony, Ke Huy Quan joins the cast of Loki season 2 as Ouroboros, the TVA's chief engineer.\nKe Huy Quan is joined by several other new additions, as Kate Dickie and Liz Carr also join the cast in Loki season 2, episode 1, in the roles of General Dox and Judge Gamble respectively - two high-ranking TVA officials, who appear set to provide further obstacles for the protagonists of the show. Rafael Casal also appears as Hunter X-5, who is a lower-ranking TVA operative who will also provide Loki and company trouble based on his concerns about their dealings. Charlie Cameron and Jack Cunningham-Nuttall round out the roster of newly introduced season 2 figures, with Cameron appearing as a mail cart driver, and Cunningham-Nuttall playing the bewildered McDonald's cashier who Sylvie speaks to at the end of the episode.\nKang actor Jonathan Majors is also set to reprise his role as the many variants of the Multiverse Saga's major villain. In Loki season 1, Majors portrayed He Who Remains, the guardian of the Sacred Timeline, before he played Kang the Conqueror himself in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Peyton Reed's third Ant-Man film also saw Majors portray many more variants of Kang the Conqueror, forming the Council of Kangs, and debut as Victor Timely in a tease for Loki season 2, so it's unclear just how many variants of Kang will be appearing in the upcoming Disney+ series.\nBy killing He Who Remains, Sylvie unleashed the multiverse, allowing an innumerable amount of branching timelines to form, meaning Loki season 2 could span many different time periods and alternate realities. Loki season 2, episode 1 supports this idea, with Tom Hiddleston's anti-hero seemingly being flung through time as a result of the multiversal changes to the MCU.\nThe Loki season 2 synopsis states that \"'Loki' Season 2 picks up in the aftermath of the shocking season finale when Loki finds himself in a battle for the soul of the Time Variance Authority. Along with Mobius, Hunter B-15 and a team of new and returning characters, Loki navigates an ever-expanding and increasingly dangerous multiverse in search of Sylvie, Judge Renslayer, Miss Minutes and the truth of what it means to possess free will and glorious purpose.\" As such, it seems that the sequel season will further explore what Sylvie killing He Who Remains did precisely to the larger landscape of the MCU, combining the Loki season 1 cast's personal stories with the overarching narrative surrounding Kang and his variants - especially with one such variants confirmed to appear in the form of Victor Timely.\nThere have been rumors that the TVA could be involved in Deadpool 3 in the MCU's Phase 6. As such, it's possible that Loki season 2 could begin to lay the foundations for Ryan Reynolds to make a smooth entrance into the MCU.\nAudiences were gifted their first look at Loki season 2 as part of 2023's Disney+ trailer, promoting Disney's own streaming service. However, this trailer only gave viewers a brief glimpse at what might unfold in the upcoming series, not revealing much past Tom Hiddleston and Owen Wilson's returns as Loki and Mobius. At 2022's D23 Expo, audiences were gifted a look at the first full trailer for Loki season 2, which was released later on for the general public.\nHe Who Remains was revealed as the man behind the TVA in Loki season 1, and as a variant of Kang the Conqueror. In Marvel Comics, Kang is a time-traveling villain and a thorn in the side of Earth's Mightiest Heroes, often putting the fate of the world at risk. The MCU's Kang the Conqueror and his variants have been shown off in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, and since the title of the MCU's next major crossover event is Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, it's expected that Kang is the Multiverse Saga's new Thanos - which all started in Loki season 1, so season 2 will surely develop this further, potentially setting up even more variants for the future.\nLoki season 2 releases every Thursday on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Creed 4 Should Pay Tribute To Rocky V's Biggest Plot Hole", "date": "2023-10-06 12:11:24", "text": "Creed III's story setup for Amara's future in Creed IV might require a sly tribute to Rocky V's most notorious plot hole to make it work.\nIn order to pay off Creed III’s story setup for Amara’s future, Creed IV might have to make a winking tribute to the most infamous plot hole from Rocky V. In its first three installments, the Creed series has focused on Adonis “Donnie” Creed’s attempts to live up to the legacy of his late father, the world champion Apollo Creed. But Creed III has set up Donnie’s own successor: his daughter Amara. If Creed IV wants to follow up on this story setup, it’ll need to make some alterations to the franchise’s already complicated timeline.\nOne of the most poignant scenes in Creed III saw Amara visiting her dad at his boxing gym. She wanted a go on the punching bag to emulate her dad, so Donnie gave her some pointers on how to improve her stance and get the most power out of each punch. This touching scene seemed to pretty clearly telegraph a future for the franchise in which Amara will follow in Donnie’s footsteps and pursue a career as a boxer. But if Creed IV is going to continue that storyline, it’ll need to mangle the timeline much like Rocky V did.\nRELATED: Creed 4 Will Be Michael B. Jordan's Most Difficult Movie Yet\nOne of the most notorious plot holes in the Rocky franchise arrives at the beginning of Rocky V. Immediately after his fight in Russia at the end of Rocky IV, Rocky comes home and Rocky, Jr. is somehow much older than he was in Rocky IV. One of Creed IV’s best storytelling options is to continue the idea that Amara is going to become a boxer like her dad. But she’ll need to be at least in her mid-teens, if not late teens. If the sequel goes that route, they should also hint that the events are taking place immediately after those of Creed III.\nWith a baffling seven-year time jump, Dame’s complicated prison sentence, and a misplaced rematch with Ricky Conlan, Creed III has already messed up the series’ timeline. As it stands, even if Creed III takes place seven years after Creed II, Amara goes from being born to being nine years old between those movies. The only way to fix the timeline is to not fix it, but rather remind audiences that the Rocky franchise’s timeline has never made any sense with a timely throwback to Rocky V’s Rocky, Jr. storyline.\nThe Creed comic book is already set 10 years after Creed III as it follows an older Amara as an amateur boxer. That sets the story in 2035. Creed will become a sci-fi series if it keeps going further into the future. Creed IV should just maintain the current timeline. It’s much easier for a production to keep a present-day setting than to imagine what the world might look like 12 years from now. Normally, the movie would just not mention what year it is, but if one minor bit of dialogue can imply that it’s still around our present, that will be enough of a nod to Rocky V.\n"}
{"title": "Star Trek’s First Holodeck Episode Is Great, But Created Its Biggest Cliche", "date": "2023-10-06 12:11:24", "text": "This Star Trek: The Next Generation season 1 episode is incredibly fun, but it introduces an issue that would plague many future holodeck episodes.\nThe first Star Trek episode to prominently feature the holodeck comes in Star Trek: The Next Generation season 1, and while the episode itself is great, it introduces an element that becomes a cliché in future holodeck episodes. In TNG season 1, episode 12, \"The Big Goodbye,\" Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) takes a break from his duties as captain of the USS Enterprise-D to try out the ship's newly upgraded holodeck. Picard takes on the persona of fictional hard-boiled detective Dixon Hill and invites a few of his crew members along for the ride.\nCaptain Picard, Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden), and ship's historian Whalen (David Selburg) don their period-accurate mobster gear and step into San Francisco of the 1940s. They marvel at how real the holographic environment around them looks, from the cars on the street to the people who populate the program. Everyone gets caught up in the story of Dixon Hill and everything seems to be going well until Whalen is shot with a very real bullet. Dr. Crusher states that his injury could prove fatal if he is not taken to sickbay soon, but the holodeck refuses to respond to any commands, leaving the crew members trapped inside.\nRelated: Star Trek: The Next Generation Cast & Character Guide\n\"The Big Goodbye\" is an incredibly fun episode with great performances from the main cast, but some of the mechanics of the holodeck do not make sense. The holodeck malfunctions after an alien probe scans the Enterprise, which somehow turns off the safety features, traps Picard and the others inside, and cuts off communications to and from the holodeck. For one thing, it's unclear why the holodeck would have safety features that can be turned off or why it would be able to craft real bullets. Logically, the holodeck should shut off when any malfunctions occur, reverting back to a regular room.\nAs Ensign Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) works with Lt. Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) to repair the holodeck, he says that shutting the holodeck down could cause the crew members inside to \"vanish.\" This makes even less sense and raises a whole host of questions about the nature of the holodeck. In future Star Trek holodeck episodes, the safety protocols would continue to malfunction, although the danger of the people inside dematerializing is never mentioned again. Still, if one ignores the illogical inconsistencies of the holodeck technology, \"The Big Goodbye\" is an immensely entertaining episode that allows the characters (and the actors) to have a little fun.\nDespite its frequent malfunctions, the holodeck is an incredible piece of technology the likes of which people of the 21st century can only dream about. It's clear why it would be such a popular feature on starships and starbases, as it allows people to visit their favorite fictional worlds or eras of history. While Star Trek: The Original Series had genre episodes such as the very fun \"A Piece of the Action,\" they had to create an often thin explanation for why an alien planet resembled Earth of the past. The holodeck removes any limitations, opening up the doors for the creative teams behind Star Trek to do all kinds of fun genre episodes.\n\"The Big Goodbye\" recreates the hard-boiled detective genre, but later holodeck episodes would dive into Westerns, spy thrillers, and old-school sci-fi serials, among others. Episodes on the holodeck give the actors a chance to wear something other than their Starfleet uniforms and play alternate versions of their characters. The best holodeck episodes offer insight into the characters and help them work through their problems. While the first-ever holodeck episode in Star Trek: The Next Generation may have introduced some cliches, it also led to a long line of fun and entertaining Star Trek episodes.\n"}
{"title": "Loki Time-Slipping Explained: All 3 Timelines Loki Jumps To", "date": "2023-10-06 12:00:26", "text": "Loki season 2 finds the God of Mischief slipping through time – a phenomena that seems similar to glitching in the Spider-Verse.\nLoki season 2 finds the Asgardian God of Mischief dealing with the problem of time-slipping - a process in the MCU that seems remarkably similar to glitching from the Spider-Verse franchise. The comparison is a fair one, given how the Spider-Verse and Loki season 2 cast both deal with the concept of a disorganized multiverse and variants traveling to times and spaces not their own. It is unclear, however, if there is a technical difference between time-slipping and glitching, or if the only difference between the two conditions is terminology.\nThe concept of time-slipping was first introduced in the Loki season 2 trailer, as Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Agent Mobius (Owen Wilson) met with O.B. (Ke Huy Quan). A member of the TIme Variance Authority's \"Repairs and Advancement\" division, O.B. was able to identify the strange condition that seemed to be paining Loki and causing him to randomly teleport across time and space as \"time-slipping.\" A more worrying problem, however, was the fact that it was supposed to be impossible for anyone to time-slip within the Time Variance Authority's offices, and yet Loki was somehow managing it.\nLoki season 2's main timeline is in present-day - specifically, just after the events of the Loki season 1 finale. This naturally makes it the most important timeline thus far in the show, as it covers the current events of series, including detailing Mobius and O.B's efforts to help Loki tackle his unusual condition. However, the other two timelines shown in Loki season 2, episode 1 are also definitely noteworthy.\nLoki is sent far into the past in the show, providing a look at a whole new period of the MCU multiverse's history. This is the result of Sylvie sending him back in time in the Loki season 1 finale, allowing her to kill He Who Remains without interference. However, being sent back in time appears to have created more issues for Loki than just the initial transportation into the past, as it may well be responsible for his time-slipping in season 2.\nLoki season 2 episode 1 also shows a glimpse into the future, which doesn't look promising for either Loki, the TVA, or the MCU, to say the least. This glance at the future shows it on the brink of destruction, which is worrying enough by itself without the extra information that Sylvie appearing in it looking the same means it can't be that much further in the future. Hopefully the efforts of Loki and his allies can prevent this from staying what the future looks like, though nothing is certain at this point in time.\nIt is still uncertain precisely why Loki is time-slipping in Loki season 2. What is clear is that he is being pulled randomly \"between the past and present\" and between multiple points in time as well as space. It is possible that the time-slipping is some manner of side effect of Loki's encounter with He Who Remains in the Loki season 1 finale and the chaos that was unleashed when the Sacred Timeline was broken, or a result of Sylvie sending him back in time. It is also possible that the time-slipping is a time-based attack being inflicted on Loki by one of the many Kang variants now running unchecked across reality.\nWhatever the reason for Loki's time-slipping, it cannot be denied that the physical symptoms are remarkably similar to glitching from the Spider-Verse films. Glitching occurs when beings enter a universe that is not their own and begin to experience intense physical pain as their bodies shift wildly, rebelling against the differing reality around them. The Spider Society were able to avoid glitching with the use of advanced technology, which is apparently unknown to the Time Variance Authority if glitching and time-slipping are the same thing.\nHowever, while the symptoms are similar, there is no guarantee that time-slipping and glitching are the same thing. A number of multiverse travelers entered the Marvel Cinematic Universe during the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home and none of them showed symptoms similar to either glitching or time-slipping. There could be some other factor in play, such as Doctor Strange's magic negating the effects of time-slipping or glitching. It is also possible, as one theory suggests, that the Raimi Spider-Man and Amazing Spider-Man universes are similar enough to the MCU to not cause immediate glitching. In any case, this is one mystery that Loki season 2 will have to unravel.\n Whatever the cause of Loki's time-slipping, it may prove to be as much a boon as it is a hindrance. While Loki is clearly pained by the process, his random travels through time set the story of Loki season 2 into motion, with the God of Mischief describing how he saw much during his travels across time and that \"if what I saw is true, there is nothing that stands between this world and utter destruction.\" This could make Loki into an oracle of sorts, being able to guide the present into a different path that ensures a better future.\nThis presumes, of course, that the information Loki is seeing during his time-slips is accurate and that he and his allies will be able to plot the correct course based on what Loki sees. That might prove challenging enough, even without the suggestion that Loki's time-slipping is the result of Kang attacking him directly or a side effect of Loki confronting the Kang variant known as He Who Remains and re-creating the multiverse. In any case, it is ironic that Loki, a being often associated with chaos and confusion, should suddenly be a source of illumination who can help restore order.\nLoki season 2 releases every Thursday on Disney+.\n"}

Olson played Dee Reynolds throughout every season of the TV show, with her being one of the funniest members of the show's gang of five. However, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia was almost very different, with Kaitlin Olson not joining the show until after the series was greenlit.\nIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphia follows Charlie, Mac, Dee, Dennis, and Frank, the five owners of a run-down bar in Philadelphia named Paddy's Pub. The gang gets into all kinds of wacky situations, with their horrendous personalities getting them into trouble in nearly every episode. Despite the show's popularity, the origins of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia show that the series was almost entirely different, with it originally focusing on a group of actors in Hollywood. However, the story isn't the only detail that was switched in the show, as the pilot featured an entirely different Dee.\nRELATED: It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia Season 17 Renewal, Release Date Prediction & Everything We Know\nThe Kaitlin Olson Jordan Reid Always Sunny history goes back to the original pilot for the series. It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's pilot didn't actually feature Olson in the role of Dee. Although Charlie Day, Glenn Howerton, and Rob McElhenney are in the original episode, Dee was actually played by an actress named Jordan Reid. Jordan Reid was the girlfriend of Mac actor Rob McElhenney in the early years of the show's development, leading to her and the group of friends all starring in the original It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia pilot.\nWith It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia wrapping up season 16, it's hard to imagine anyone but Kaitlin Olson in the role of Dee. However, Jordan Reid may have appeared in the final show if it wasn't for some behind-the-scenes drama. By the time the series was greenlit, Jordan Reid and Rob McElhenney had broken up, causing Reid to leave the series. While Jordan Reid has made some small appearances in shows like Law & Order, she isn't nearly as present on screen as the cast of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\nDespite Reid being the show's original Dee, Kaitlin Olson is so much better for It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. In the pilot, Jordan Reid's performance is a lot more subdued than Olson's take on the character, with her manic and deranged line readings making the character who she is today. Even though Dee Reynolds is often sidelined, Kaitlin Olson manages to bring so much personality to the character, making her integral to the show's success.\nOn top of that, keeping Jordan Reid around after the breakup would have probably hurt the show. The behind-the-scenes emotions may have hindered the show's comedy, possibly making it not work nearly as well as it does now. While Jordan Reid probably could have pulled off a great Dee, the decision to bring in Kaitlin Olson was the right choice for It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\nRELATED: The 50 Best TV Shows Of All Time, Ranked\nWhile the casting turned out well for the show, the Kaitlin Olson Jordan Reid Always Sunny casting has some unpleasant history as well. Reid addressed her role in the pilot and her removal from the show in the past and suggested she was forced out due to her relationship with Rob McElhenney coming to an end. Following the end of their relationship, Reid claims (via Ramshackle Glam) that McElhenney \"he told me in no uncertain terms that if I did not stay in the relationship, I would be off the show.\"\nReid did eventually break up with McElhenney after the pilot was shot with FX. Shortly after, Reid's manager \"let me know that while Rob, Glenn, and Charlie had been picked up for the series, I hadn’t been.\" Though the It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia cast hasn't commented on the casting but Reid later says she doesn't hold a grudge against them and reveals she and McElhenney are friends again (via The New York Times). Reid also admits Olson is funnier and perfect for the role, showing that she looks back on her role in the history of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia with a gracious attitude given the circumstances.\nColin McCormick is a Senior Writer with Screen Rant and has been a proud member of the team since 2019.

{"title": "Star Wars Spoiled Its Thrawn Finale Twist Two Weeks Ago", "date": "2023-10-06 12:00:24", "text": "A frightening new soldier for Grand Admiral Thrawn debuts in the Ahsoka season 1 finale, having been foreshadowed by two previous episodes.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nThe season 1 finale of Ahsoka featured the surprising appearance of zombie stormtroopers, which was foreshadowed in previous episodes. As a concept, zombie stormtroopers have been around since the Star Wars Legends continuity, debuting in the 2009 horror novel Death Troopers, by Joe Schreiber. Fascinatingly – and perhaps unsurprisingly – both iterations of the undead stormtroopers are zombified by the dark side of the Force in some form.\nIn Ahsoka episode 8 “Part Eight: The Jedi, The Witch, and The Warlord,” a team of Thrawn’s stormtroopers is sent to confront Ahsoka Tano, Ezra Bridger, and Sabine Wren, aware that they will be no match for the Jedi trio. After being cut down, the stormtroopers are promptly resurrected as near-invincible zombies by the dark magick powers of the Great Mothers, a trio of Dathomirian Nightsister Witches. This grisly use of the stormtroopers was foreshadowed on two occasions in previous Ahsoka episodes.\nThrawn’s contingent of stormtroopers appears along with Grand Admiral himself in “Part Six: Far, Far Away.” The stormtroopers, like Thrawn, were sent to Peridea by Ezra Bridger and a group of purrgil in the series finale of Star Wars Rebels, so the soldiers had spent years on the extragalactic world, surviving with no resources other than what was aboard Thrawn’s flagship, the Chimaera. Fittingly, their protective suits of armor are in various stages of disrepair, displaying cracks and missing elements, which are replaced (or held together) by gold and red ribbons. Most fascinatingly, the episode’s subtitles refer to them not as stormtroopers, but as Night Troopers.\nAt first, it appeared that this was simply a nickname for the stranded stormtroopers who continue to serve Grand Admiral Thrawn, but the Ahsoka finale makes their name far more fitting. The Night Troopers, like Thrawn, are allies of the Nightsisters, whose new lore establishes that they originate on Peridea. The fact that a group of the Night Troopers are turned into the stormtrooper equivalent to Nightsister zombies (like those seen in Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Jedi: Fallen Order) makes their name an even better instance of foreshadowing.\nRelated: 15 Star Wars Easter Eggs In Episode 8\nThe Night Troopers themselves were foreshadowed two episodes before their debut in Ahsoka “Part Four: Fallen Jedi.” The mysterious former Imperial Inquisitor Marrok spews a green mist upon being struck down by Ahsoka Tano, making him likely a magick-enhanced Nightbrother or perhaps simply a zombified Inquisitor. While Marrok's resurrection was likely the work of Morgan Elsbeth, the Great Mothers demonstrated their ability to reanimate deceased beings at a much higher scale with the Night Troopers. With Thrawn and the Great Mothers arriving on Dathomir at the end of the Ahsoka finale, the New Republic will likely soon face more of his zombified minions.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}

Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story is a prequel series to Shonda Rhimes' hit Netflix series Bridgerton and while it primarily follows the rise of a young Queen Charlotte (India Amarteifio), the show explores several Bridgerton characters in their younger years, such as King George III (Corey Mylchreest), Lady Agatha Danbury (Arsema Thomas), Brimsley (Sam Clemmett), and of course Violet Ledger (Connie Jenkins-Grieg).\nWhile a potential Queen Charlotte season 2 has not been confirmed since it was only intended to be a miniseries, the success of the show could lead to the development of other Bridgerton spin-offs that focus on different characters. The events of Queen Charlotte could even possibly affect a potential storyline in Bridgerton season 3 involving Violet and Lady Danbury. Hailed for their diversity and steamy scenes, both Bridgerton and Queen Charlotte have been huge successes, and the demand for Bridgerton spinoffs has skyrocketed. And one character whom Rhimes is seriously considering for a potential spinoff is the young Violet.\nRELATED: Queen Charlotte Already Gave Bridgerton Season 3 Its Best Story\nConnie Jenkins-Grieg plays a younger version of Violet Bridgerton. While the young Violet's role in Queen Charlotte is much smaller compared to the show's main cast, the series still does an excellent job showcasing what a young teenage Violet was like before she married Edmund (Rupert Evans) and became the Dowager Viscountess Bridgerton. Queen Charlotte also focuses on Violet's relationship with her parents, unveiling that while she had an uneasy relationship with her mother, she had a much stronger and happier relationship with her father, who often made hats for the young Violet.\nAdditionally, when comparing Jenkins-Grieg's performance with that of Ruth Gemmell's portrayal of the character in Bridgerton, the two very much complement each other as both provide their own spin on Violet without having each version clash against each other. Considering that she is much older in Bridgerton, Gemmell does an excellent job portraying Violet as a fiercely protective and loving mother while Jenkins-Grieg excels at showcasing a much younger, enthusiastic, and energetic teenage version of the character.\nWhile Queen Charlotte creator Shonda Rhimes has not confirmed whether any other Bridgerton spinoffs are in development, she did hint that she is very passionate about the idea of working on a story centered on Violet and that she would be very interested in that being the possible next spinoff. When speaking about Queen Charlotte Rhimes said, \"There's no plan to explore anybody in particular. I was just doing this because I was so passionate about the subject. Although, in writing it I got very interested in Violet's story. So, we'll see.\" (via Hello) However, whether this Violet Bridgerton spinoff will happen is still unclear, but hopefully, its development will be confirmed soon.\nTimothy Lee is a writer who has been working at Screen Rant since 2023.

From character motivations to shocking identity reveals, BG3's story has plenty to keep even those coming back for yet another playthrough on their toes.\n[Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3.]\nSet over 120 years after Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn, Baldur's Gate 3 sees the rise of a new dangerous cult linked to mind flayers and seeking world domination. With many different endings that depend on choices made throughout the plot, BG3 cannot be fully experienced in a single playthrough. With that in mind, although there is still plenty to surprise during a repeat playthrough, there are some key story moments that will only be as impactful once.\nRelated: \"An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas\": Baldur's Gate 3 Review\nOnce in the Shadow-Cursed Lands in Act 2 Mizora, Wyll’s patron, will pay the camp a little visit. She has a mission for Wyll, and the rest of the party to rescue one of Zariel’s ‘assets’ who has been grabbed by the cultist of the Absolute. This is a great opportunity to negotiate with Mizora to try to free Wyll from his contract with her.\nRelated: All Baldur's Gate 3 Characters That Can Join Camp, Ranked\nThe twist comes when reaching the Mind Flayer Colony under Moonrise Towers and discovering that Mizora herself is the one who needs rescuing and is trapped in one of the mind flayer pods. There is then a choice to save her or leave her to die, but as killing her will also mean Wyll dies as well, letting her out of the pod is the best option.\nOnce in Act Three of Baldur’s Gate 3, the party will hear about a new crime boss in the city known as the Stone Lord. This new criminal is terrorizing the other criminal guilds who ask for the party’s aid in dealing with this issue. In particular, Nine-Fingers, the leader of the Guild, will want to talk to Jaheira, where she will reveal that the Stone Lord is none other than Jaheira’s old companion, Minsc. Hearing this information is one thing, but when it is confirmed by confronting the Stone Lord at the Counting House, nothing feels quite like seeing Minsc in the role of a villain.\nRelated: Baldur's Gate 3: Why Minsc's Return Is Such A Big Deal\nMinthara is a drow paladin found in the Shattered Sanctum in Act One, who will ask the party to reveal the location of the Druid Grove. Siding with her will mean the end for all the druids and tielfings there and is one of the more morally objectionable decisions in Baldur’s Gate 3. However, what isn’t immediately obvious is that Minthara is simply a thrall under the control of the Absolute.\nRelated: Baldur's Gate 3: Pros & Cons Of Romancing Minthara In BG3\nAfter siding with her in Act One, she can be met again in Moonrise Towers, where the other members of the cult have turned on her and sentenced her to death. Once she is rescued, it is revealed that just like many of the other True Souls the party has met, Minthara's mind was not entirely her own.\nAt the beginning of Act Three, the sleeping party is ambushed by githyanki and the Dream Guardian, who has been protecting everyone from the Absolute, calls out for help. Entering the Astral Prism leads to one of the biggest twists in the game as it is revealed that the Guardian is who they appear.\nPleading for the party’s help is a mind flayer calling themself the Emperor, explaining that they didn’t think the player character would help if they knew the Dream Guardian’s true identity. Refusing to help will mean a game over, but it is shocking to meet the party’s savior face-to-face for the first time and see who they really are.\nJust as the party is coming to grips with working with a mind flayer, BG3 throws another twist with the Emperor at the team. Delving into the Wyrmway beneath Baldur’s Gate, the party can discover even more about their illithid ally. After battling an undead dragon, it is revealed that the Emperor was once Balduran, famed adventurer and founder of Baldur’s Gate. When asked about it, the Emperor will show their life through flashbacks, including how they became a mind flayer.\nRelated: Should You Help The Emperor In Baldur's Gate 3?\nIn the beginning, it is insinuated by the Dream Guardian that they are the one keeping the party safe from the Absolute with their own powers. However, at the same time, it is revealed that they are a mind flayer called the Emperor. It is also revealed that the true source of the party’s protection is the imprisoned githyanki, Prince Orpheus. Orpheus is the son of Mother Gith, who freed her people from the mind flayers with her power to block their influence, a power she passed onto her son. Later in BG3, the party will face the decision of whether or not to free Orpheus, but his initial reveal is one that stands out.\nRelated: Baldur's Gate 3: Should You Free Orpheus In BG3 Or Side With The Emperor?\nVery early in Baldur’s Gate 3, the party will learn about a magical artifact called the Nightsong that is supposed to be hidden under the temple of Selune. A wizard named Lorroakan has even hired a band of adventurers to find it, but they found themselves outmatched by the goblins. However, it is not until the end of Act Two that the Nightsong is revealed to be a person, not an item, the aasimar daughter of Selune, Dame Aylin. Learning that the Nightsong is a person puts a whole new slant on Lorroakan’s search, especially once it is revealed that he knows what the Nightsong really is.\nShadowheart is one of the more complex companions in Baldur’s Gate 3, with a mysterious past that she can only partially remember. However, if she is encouraged to turn away from Shar, her personal questline will eventually lead to a massive and heartbreaking reveal. Shadowheart learns that her parents were followers of Selune, Shar’s sister and rival and that she was taken as part of that rivalry.\nRelated: Jennifer English On How Baldur's Gate 3's Shadowheart Was \"Her Dream Job\"\nBut it gets even more tragic as Shadowheart’s parents are revealed to be alive, held prisoner by Shar, and used to torment Shadowheart. At the end of the quest, Shadowheart is forced to make the choice: return to Shar and free her parents, or stay free herself and let them die.\nRaphael is a character met very early on in BG3, and once he has properly introduced himself, the party will learn he is a cambion, wishing to make a deal with them. However, the terms of the deal are unclear, and it is not until Act Three that Raphael’s full plan is explained. Raphael is, in fact, the son of Mephistopheles, one of the rulers in the Nine Hells, and he wants to make a deal to put him ahead of his father.\nRaphael will offer the Orphic Hammer to free Prince Orpheus and work with him in place of the Emperor. In exchange, Raphael wants the Crown of Karsus, which is currently being used to control the elderbrain. The Crown will allow him to take control of the Hells and eventually beyond, and should the party take the deal, Raphael will further explain his grant plan in a post-credits cutscene.\nAt the beginning of BG3, the enemy seems to be a strange new cult, worshiping a new god and controlling its followers with mind flayer tadpoles. However, it is not until Act Two that the true threat is revealed, as the cult is a front for the Dead Three, Bhaal, Bane, and Myrkul, who once again are attempting world domination.\nThis is a fantastic and clever way to link Baldur’s Gate 3 to its predecessors and without using the same paths that had been trodden before. However, there is a further twist at the very end when the elder brain explains that it was the true genius behind the entire plan and used the Dead Three Chosen to bring them the Crown of Karsus and build an army for them to set in motion the Grand Design.\n"}

{"title": "Even Dragon Ball Fans Missed The Real Reason Vegeta Became A Villain in Super", "date": "2023-10-06 12:00:24", "text": "Vegeta became a villain again in Dragon Ball Super, but this actually has a great explanation and it's connected to Destruction and Ultra Ego.\nAlthough fans were undoubtedly excited when Vegeta briefly reverted to his villainous ways during Dragon Ball Super's Granolah the Survivor Arc, this seemed quite sudden and unexpected. However, the series already explained why it happened, and subsequently proved that the Saiyan Prince would likely never suffer another relapse like that again.\nVegeta turns on Goku in chapter #76 of Dragon Ball Super, going off to fight Granloah on his own, but what Vegeta mutters to himself when the Cerealean is about to kill him demonstrates that Beerus led him to believe that he needed to change as a person to effectively wield the Power of Destruction (Hakai). In chapter #69 of Dragon Ball Super, Beerus tells Vegeta that his own power as a God of Destruction is unbounded because he only thinks about destruction, and that if Vegeta wanted to wield Destruction, he would have to destroy any stray thoughts he had.\nAt the time, Beerus was chiding Vegeta for spending too much time feeling responsible for the sins of the Saiyan race. However, Vegeta clearly interpreted Beerus' words as a need to return to his old, ruthless ways. During the fight against Granloah, Vegeta forces his opponent to destroy the ruins of his list civilization, and then even attacks Goku, telling him he would rather die than team up with him again. This seemed a completely random turn to fans, but it all makes sense because Vegeta was actually trying to master his new power, which came to fruition with his Ultra Ego transformation.\nHowever, as proved by his later apology to Beerus, Vegeta was only fighting dirty against Granolah and said those horrible things to Goku because he was trying to wield Destruction in the most effective way, as Beerus told him to. This would explain why Vegeta is able to drop acting like he once did almost too quickly, as though nothing even happened. Surely enough, soon after that Vegeta teams up with Goku again, and the two Saiyans witness together the memories of Bardock, creating an even stronger bond over the legacy of their species.\nSo even though many fans may have felt that Dragon Ball Super promised to make Vegeta a villain again and then failed to deliver, Beerus' comments to Vegeta about how he could master Destruction and then Vegeta's admission about how he failed to revert to how he once was all explain everything perfectly. Vegeta's return to villainy failed because he was trying to be someone he no longer was, and Dragon Ball Super was just giving fans one last glimpse of this version of the Saiyan Prince before shutting the door on that chapter of his life for good.\n"}
{"title": "Who Is Ravonna Renslayer? Loki's Marvel Villain & Kang Link Explained", "date": "2023-10-06 11:50:25", "text": "Judge Renslayer is a primary character in Loki season 1 and 2. Here's who Ravonna Renslayer is in the comics, and what her connection is to Kang.\nIn Loki, Judge Ravonna Renslayer, an agent with the Time Variance Authority (TVA), an organization responsible for maintaining the proper flow of time in the MCU, is played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Ravonna Renslayer has a wealth of comic book history to back her up as a character. Crucially, her comic history links her strongly to Kang the Conquerer, the time-traveling, multiverse-hopping villain who is set to be a large part of the MCU's upcoming future.\nThroughout Loki Mbatha-Raw's role as Ravonna Renslayer is both memorable and divisive. While she plays a friend to Mobius, the Loki season 1 ending - and the first episode of season 2 - paint her in a more complicated light. Flashbacks demonstrate her callousness in following TVA rule as she worked as an agent to collect even child variants like Sylvie. In the comics, Ravonna is known best as the long-time love interest of Kang the Conqueror, the villain intent on ruling all timelines. Here’s everything to know about Loki’s antagonistic TVA judge, her comics origin, and link to Kang.\nRelated: Everything We Know About Loki Season 3\nMbatha-Raw’s Loki casting was announced in February 2020. At the time, reports did not state which character she’d be playing in the Disney+ series. However, it was revealed her role would be that of the leading lady. Judge Renslayer's role in season 1 provided more context for this, showing Ravonna's time in the TVA, and her turn from being intensely committed to the faction - hunting down Sylvie and turning on Mobius for the TVA - to becoming one of its biggest critics in season 2 in order to try and bring about meaningful change for the institution, and protect the recently reformed multiverse.\nThis serves to flesh out a figure who both serves an antagonistic role, but who also has some real moral complexity, making her future in the Loki season 2 cast all the more exciting. Given Renslayer's comic origins, it seems she may well play just as integral a role in the second season as she did in the first.\nRavonna Renslayer was first introduced in 1965’s Avengers #23 and has gone by several different aliases, including Terminatrix and Temptress. She was born in the late 40th century and is the daughter of King Carelius, a ruler of one of Kang’s kingdoms. While Ravonna doesn’t have any superhuman abilities, she is highly intelligent and is skilled in hand-to-hand combat and proficient in the use of advanced future technology. Using a teleporter and other futuristic tech to detect energy fields, Ravonna is capable of traveling through time.\nShe has gone up against the Fantastic Four and the Avengers, who attempted to stop her from retrieving the Ultimate Nullifier, a weapon capable of destroying anyone the wielder wishes. In this instance, Renslayer wanted to destroy Kang the Conqueror, who opted to kill the Avengers rather than save her while visiting with the Grandmaster. At other times, she’s been the Avengers’ ally (though it’s short-lived), working with them to defeat Kang from taking over the 40th century. Renslayer is relentless, passionate, and incredibly capable. No matter what Renslayer got up to, however, she proved how clever and formidable a foe and ally (depending on the day) she could be sans powers.\nRavonna Renslayer first crossed paths with the time-traveling Kang when he attempted to conquer her kingdom and fold it into his growing empire in the 40th century. For a long time, Kang’s love for Renslayer was one-sided, and she despised him because of his imperialistic ways. When the Avengers showed up to defeat Kang, she initially joined them to do so in a bid to stop him. Due to his love for Renslayer, Kang allowed the kingdom to rebel against his plans because he hoped Ravonna would change her mind and marry him. Kang was certainly smitten considering Ravonna is the only ruler he didn’t kill while seizing control.\nWhen Kang’s general attempts to assassinate him, Ravonna sacrifices herself to save him, putting her in a coma until Kang could find a way to revive her. Ravonna becomes Kang’s greatest love and greatest nemesis - someone who loved him, then sought revenge and killed him. While the time-displaced princess eventually returns Kang’s feelings, she often feels betrayed by his actions. He’d much rather conquer the timeline or try and kill the Avengers than save her, and Ravonna grew tired of coming in second place to his diabolical schemes. Either way, her love-hate relationship with Kang plays a big role in her story. At one point, Ravonna even becomes the ruler of Chronopolis, a realm Kang created outside of time.\nRelated: 10 Burning Questions Loki Season 2 Can Finally Answer\nJudge Renslayer’s link to Kang is crucial. Her presence in Loki foreshadowed the show's plans to bring the time-traveling villain into the MCU as early on as the series. It’s important to note Jonathan Majors was officially cast as Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man 3, which means plans for his role in the MCU were already in motion. Considering Ant-Man came up with the idea to use the Quantum Realm to time travel, it makes sense that Kang would be a villain in the film. However, bringing Major's Kang into the MCU at the end of Loki season 1 allows for more build-up before he appears in later movies, and helps to develop the complex character more thoroughly.\nIt's unclear how much of Ravonna's origin story has been retained by the MCU, and how much of it might come into play later, if at all. Ravonna's variant is shown to the TVA as a school teacher who very much is not a princess in the 40th century. Additionally, while she knows a lot of the TVA's secrets, it is unclear how she knows them, how much she knows about Kang's existence, and whether Miss Minutes plays some role in the relationship between the two. However, Loki season 2 is sure to explore more about the Renslayer, and could well angle into adapting more of her comic storyline for the MCU.\nThe MCU has played fast and loose with comic backstories before, so it's no surprise that it's seemingly the same for Ravonna Renslayer. Loki season 2 has a lot of opportunities to further expand the character, potentially allowing for some aspects from the comic to be enmeshed alongside an entirely new and exciting story, whenever and wherever that takes her.\n"}

At the end of episode 4, the main students arrived at Dr. Cardosa's house to subdue Sam, who went there to kill the doctor for his involvement in the Woods. While Marie is trying to get Sam to calm down, she suddenly wakes up in bed next to Jordan.\nNow, Prime Video has released a new trailer for Gen V episode 5, revealing Marie's sudden time jump didn't just impact her. In the trailer, Jordan reveals they are missing multiple days of time, which is implied to have impacted everyone who was at Cardosa's house. The trailer also promises a look inside Sam's psyche as he battles people he thinks are puppets.\nPrior to Marie waking up in bed with Jordan, she had been trying to calm Sam down after Emma grew in size and pinned him to the ground. However, now that her and her friends have lost time following their attempt to save Cardosa, it's unclear what the final results of their efforts were. It's also unknown why they lost time, or how it's connected to Gen V's ongoing Woods mystery.\nSince everyone involved in the incident has been impacted, it's likely a Supe is behind their memory loss. Sam may have more powers than he's letting on, wiping the students' memories so he can escape without them every finding out where he went. Another possibility is that Cardosa called a Supe who knows about the Woods to step in, erasing Marie and her friends' memories to ensure whatever happened in those missing days is never discovered.\nNow that Gen V has introduced a new memory loss mystery, it appears the group discovering the truth behind the Woods will be much harder than they thought. Perhaps the mystery surrounding the Woods will be used to set up a dangerous new storyline in The Boys season 4, which is expected to follow-up one some plot points from the spinoff. Now that the Woods' conspiracy has deepened, it will prove even harder to discover everything going on below Godolkin.\nSource: Prime Video\n"}
{"title": "When Loki Takes Place In MCU Timeline", "date": "2023-10-06 11:40:25", "text": "Loki will pick up with the God of Mischief both before and after his death in Avengers: Endgame, and here's how it fits into the MCU timeline.\nHere's where Loki fits into the Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline. First released as the third of Marvel's Disney+ shows, Loki brings back Tom Hiddleston as the titular God of Mischief, following on from his disappearance with the Space Stone in Avengers: Endgame. That movie fully introduced time travel to the MCU (after it was first explored in Doctor Strange), and Loki takes things further, revealing the Time Variance Authority (TVA), which keeps watch over the timeline and multiverse, with the Loki season 1 ending carrying some major implications for both.\nAll of that means the MCU timeline (or timelines) is central to Loki, which feels particularly necessary after Avengers: Endgame. That movie created several branches, and while most were closed by the time the end credits rolled, there were some discrepancies and disagreements over exactly how it all worked. That's something Loki puts right, but just where - or rather, when - exactly do its own events take place, and how does it fit into the MCU overall?\nRelated: Everything We Know About Loki Season 3\nThe answer to where Loki fits in the MCU timeline is a slightly convoluted one. Because he teleported away with the Tesseract, creating a new branched timeline, Loki takes place after The Avengers in 2012, with the God of Mischief still a villain and several years away from redemption. However, the show is also releasing after Endgame, and it's clear the film's events have also taken place, because the time heist had to have happened in order for Loki to have teleported away (something the series shows and addresses). That puts it in a strange position of existing in several places of the timeline, or perhaps none at all would be more accurate, but it does make sense given the involvement of the TVA.\nThe TVA operates outside of time and space, meaning it doesn't have to adhere to the same rules of the MCU timeline. While Loki teleports away into another timeline during Endgame, he is found by the TVA and taken to their headquarters, meaning that he too now exists outside of the timeline itself. That puts the character in a fascinating position, allowing for several different possibilities for where he might go next. Loki itself features different time periods - especially given Loki season 2's time-slipping - and so the character can be shown all across the MCU's timeline, rather than in one fixed point, even though his journey is more linearly picking up from that point in 2012.\nRelated: Loki’s Complete MCU Timeline Explained\nMarvel Phase 4 is utilizing several different timeline tricks. Black Widow is a prequel set between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War; WandaVision took place just after Avengers: Endgame, but mimicked multiple decades; Eternals spans thousands of years. It's an approach that helps massively expand the scope of the MCU and naturally fits as it looks to open up the multiverse too. Loki works well for both of those because of its ability to explore different timelines, including the many branches created in Endgame, while also creating a new character arc following on from The Avengers.\n"}

It was a rocky return for Ben Song (Raymond Lee), as the reboot's main character had to complete an exceptionally dangerous leap without the help of his team. Although he's ultimately successful, Ben later learns that he's actually been missing and presumed dead for three years. But before he can even begin to process the news, it's off to the next leap.\nIn an interview with TV Insider, Grismer shares that Quantum Leap season 2 will include more flashbacks to Ben's past. Grismer, who is also a directing producer on the series, mentions that the flashbacks will appear \"as they're needed\" which is something that's established in the premiere episode. Read Grismer's quote below:\n“There are various flashbacks throughout the season, for sure. They appear when they’re needed.”\nIn the debut episode of season 2, titled \"This Took Too Long,\" Ben has a moment where he flashes back to Addison (Caitlin Bassett). Toward the end of the installment, Ben thinks back to a conversation he had with Addison where he expresses fear of losing her because of their work on grand projects like Quantum Leap. She responds calmly, and with a gradually beaming smile, and says: \"Then you'll come find me.\" The conversation is clearly significant, given the news that Ben will receive moments later.\nAfter successfully completing the objective behind his leap, Ian (Mason Alexander Park) finds Ben. It's a heavy moment, but the emotion of their reunion doesn't land, With obvious reluctance, Ian tells Ben about how he's been missing and presumed dead. It sets up the rest of Quantum Leap season 2, but it also fulfills the flashback. Ben has lost Addison, he's lost time with her, and he has to find her again.\nRelated: Quantum Leap 2022 Cast & Character Guide\nIt's an early example of how the reboot, which airs Wednesdays on NBC and streams on Peacock, will weave in flashbacks. It's an important way of fleshing out the main character, which in itself is a key goal if the new Quantum Leap hopes to eventually have a chance of matching the original's popularity and largely enduring cultural relevance.\nSource: TV Insider\nAbdullah Al-Ghamdi joined Screen Rant in 2019.

Here’s how to get it.\nUnlocking the Agaou Throwing Axe in Cyberpunk 2077’s Phantom Liberty DLC is a great idea, as the new weapon added can do some impressive damage to opponents. The throwable machete is part of Phantom Liberty, a paid expansion for CD Projekt Red’s popular RPG. The Agaou is considered an iconic piece of gear and one of the coolest new weapons in Cyberpunk 2077. What makes it so special is that it can be thrown at enemies for massive damage but, in addition to that, it also discharges an AoE shock effect onto them.\nThis additional electric damage not only eats away at their life bar but also has a considerable explosion radius that affects nearby characters. What makes the Agaou Throwing Axe a special weapon is that it has a perk that grants a 125% headshot damage multiplier. With a throwing weapon build, the potential of the Agaou can be enhanced significantly, especially if you are using a Sandevistan that allows you to slow time and throw the axe with critical precision. This is easily one of the strongest melee weapons in the Phantom Liberty DLC and one that should immediately be sought out if you are looking to improve your damage output.\nMore Cyberpunk: 10 Most Powerful New Weapons (Phantom Liberty DLC)\nUnlocking the Agaou Throwing Axe in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty is fairly simple, especially when considering how powerful the weapon actually is. To get it, you will need to head to the southeastern portion of Dogtown, a new area added with the DLC. There, you will find a location with increased criminal activity, which will be the base where you can get the Agaou.\nTo reach the destination, you can fast-travel to the Luxor Wellness Spa waypoint and start heading south until you see the icon with the three skulls. This is where your enemies will be, and where you will finally obtain the Agaou in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. The next step is cleaning the house, so you can eliminate all the criminals in the area and make your way through the building. The strategy you employ here is irrelevant, so you can either go in guns blazing or try a stealthier approach.\nThe important thing is that you eliminate the big boss at the end, named Ayo Zarin. They fight primarily with melee weapons and have a large chunk of health, so adapt your combat strategy accordingly. Upon defeating them, you will be able to loot the Agaou Throwing Axe off Ayo Zarin’s body, along with several other items. These include a cache access card, which grants you access to a nearby loot room in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty.\n"}

She will give him a couple of clues as to where to find this area, and Basim will agree to try to help her with her obsession.\nThis is also the time when Basim can start finding Mysterious Shards, as before that while they are listed as a collectible in each region on the map of Baghdad, it will not be possible to find them. Like with Dervis’ Artifacts, players will have to find them by wandering around various parts of the map. They will spawn randomly, and when players approach they will learn that Order members are transporting them around Baghdad.\nOnce Basim has found an Order member with a Mysterious Shard, they can follow them throughout the streets of historical Baghdad to find a good place to ambush them. Players have to assassinate the Order member to get the Shard, but this might be dangerous as most of them also travel with guards. Look for hiding places along the road to lure guards away and whittle down their numbers. Once the Order member is alone, do the same thing to take them down and get their Shard piece.\nThe best way is typically to find a haystack, as Basim will not likely be noticed, and it will count as a stealth kill even if civilians and guards are nearby. Hide in a haystack and pull the Order member in to assassinate them.\nBasim can find the place by searching for the right area, as the clues suggest that it is near an oasis north of the ‘Aqarquf Dunes. There is a Synchronization Point right next to an oasis drawing on the Northeast corner of the map, and that is where Basim should head. Dive into the water and into a cave and follow it through until the end to find the chamber with pillars inside.\nEach pillar will require a different number of Mysterious Shards, and once Basim has enough to fill one he can put his Shards in that pillar and exchange them for a piece of Gear. The first one available is the Samsaama, a special dagger that can steal health every fifth hit, and the gear found in the chamber is already fully upgraded. Find all the Mysterious Shards to fully unlock the chamber, the gear hidden within, and complete Nehal’s Calling Quest in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage.\n"}
{"title": "Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s Best Armor Is A Huge Disappointment", "date": "2023-10-06 11:01:25", "text": "One of the most elusive quest rewards in Assassin’s Creed Mirage is fittingly effective, but it doesn’t really fit into the game satisfyingly.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage doesn't quite employ the extensive gear systems of its RPG predecessors, but there is still a decent number of options when it comes to what outfit to wear. The wardrobe Basim can collect throughout the game is largely comprised of robes resembling those traditionally worn by the Hidden Ones – often primarily white or off-white and hooded – but some, and particularly some costumes, have a bit more variety, including a few that are definitely more armored than Basim's default attire. The most exclusive outfit in the game, however, is disappointing compared to the verisimilitude offered by most others.\n[Warning: The following article contains minor spoilers for Assassin's Creed Mirage.]\nTaking players to 9th century Baghdad, AC Mirage is a refreshing return to the series' central, long-running conflict between the Hidden Ones and the Order of the Ancients – two shadowy organizations that would manifest the Assassin Brotherhood and Templar Order respectively in later centuries. Mirage's gameplay reflects this return to the series' earlier era as well, in part including a number of outfits which don't have defensive stats, but do provide unique perks. There is also a certain set of collectibles, which offers a mysterious set of armor as its ultimate reward, a quest line which has seen multiple variations in the series since Assassin's Creed 2.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nFairly early in Assassin's Creed Mirage, Nehal tells Basim of a supposed treasure hidden somewhere near an oasis in the desert north of Baghdad, beginning a quest called \"The Ancient Place.\" The aptly named Northern Oasis is indeed holding such a treasure – three, in fact, locked behind mysterious mechanisms in a cave only accessible by diving to the bottom of the oasis' water. The mechanisms are unlocked by inserting a certain number of Mysterious Shards, found on the person of and taken from (either through pickpocketing or killing and looting) people connected to the Order throughout Baghdad.\nFive Shards will unlock the most coveted prize: Milad's Outfit. The trait unique to Milad's Outfit, Forgotten Terror, makes it so a bright flash of lightning disorients nearby enemies whenever a successful air assassination is performed (i.e. jumping on an enemy from above to assassinate them). Especially in the later sections of the game, when Milad's Outfit is likely to be acquired and a breadth of other tools in Basim's possession make Mirage's dangerous combat less so, this flash of lightning can help tremendously. Not only does it give the player an immediate advantage over surrounding enemies in a fight, it also makes it so performing an assassination and fleeing the scene is much easier.\nRelated: \"What [Players] Loved First\" - Simon Arseneault On Assassin's Creed Mirage\nWhile helpful in a variety of gameplay situations, Milad's Outfit looks a bit ridiculous, like an over-designed suit from a Marvel movie, and feels entirely disconnected from the rest of the game. AC Mirage – despite featuring Basim as its protagonist – actually has very little to do with the Isu. Simply collecting these Mysterious Shards and slotting them into an ancient mechanism is far less interesting than a reward that has a meaningful connection to the story. For instance, the Armor of Altaïr, which can be acquired by Ezio in Assassin's Creed 2, deepens the connection between the two master assassins, fits into the story of Ezio recovering Altaïr's codex, and is in sync with the general aesthetic of the Assassin Brotherhood.\nMilad's Outfit's only connection to Mirage's story is that Order members are seeking it, and apparently covet the Mysterious Shards. Milad is never mentioned in any other capacity, and the outfit is woefully anachronistic. It even goes so far as to alter Basim's voice, making it deeper and slightly digitized – an understandable feat for a bit of Isu technology, but it feels shoe-horned into Mirage like something of an obligation. Having powerful and unique rewards for potentially lengthy side adventures is always welcome, but the reward for collecting the Mysterious Shards in Assassin's Creed Mirage, Milad's Outfit, is quite a letdown. Luckily, its powerful perk can still be utilized with its appearance changed by equipping a Costume.\n"}

Gear Chests are located in each region, but they are not automatically marked on the map until Basim spots them. Therefore, learning how to spot and mark them early will be essential.\nGear Chests are the best way to find good armor and weapons within the gameplay of Assassin’s Creed: Mirage. Basim must find these chests in order to get upgrade sheets for the gear he already has for the Blacksmith to make improvements as well. Some of these chests can be opened when Basim finds them, others need a special item to unlock them.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nEach region of the map will list the number of Gear Chests in that region. That lets Basim know how many to look for, but it does not automatically mark where they are even after activating a Synchronization Point. To mark them on the map, Basim must spot them with either Enkidu or his own Eagle Vision.\nEnkidu can be scared away if you use him too close to a Restricted Area with a lot of guards, or near where there are archers on the rooftops.\nTo use Enkidu’s Eye, activate him and look for gold lines on the skyline. Focus on them and fly closer if necessary and Enkidu will mark it for you. This could also reveal other valuable items not automatically marked, such as Mysterious Shards, but look out for other gold lines as well. Basim can do the same thing using his Eagle Vision, but he will have to get much closer physically to do so.\nOnce the Gear Chest is marked, Basim will have to navigate to them, and these chests are almost always in Restricted Areas and behind locked or barred doors. This means Basim will have to take down a guard with a key or knock the bar off the door from a window to enter the room with the chest, as is the case in the Metal Factory. Try to employ stealth gameplay mechanics to do so, as being seen will cause Basim's Notoriety to increase.\nOnce you reach a Gear Chest, opening it might present another challenge to Basim. Some Gear Chests can be opened automatically, but others will require a Merchant Token, which is one of three types of Khidmah Tokens in the game. These Merchant Tokens can be found by completing Contracts, and some Gear Chests will require them to be opened. If Basim does not have any Merchant Tokens, he will have to return later to open the Gear Chest. Once he collects the Gear, Basim will be able to continue his journey through Baghdad in Assassin’s Creed: Mirage.\n"}

Your mission here is to rescue the rebel leader Ali ibn Muhammad, preferably without getting caught by the many guards who swarm this large outpost. There are many ways to break into the Prison, from fighting your way inside to adopting a clever disguise.\nThe Gate Prison can be found by checking the World map and looking southwest from the Metal Factory, close to the Iron Gate that leads outside the main city. Depending on your notoriety level in Assassin's Creed Mirage, approaching this area could be fairly easy or incredibly hard to even show your face. Feel free to scout the location beforehand to know where guards patrol and how many are within the jail.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nWhile you could get into the Damascus Gate Prison by fighting your way inside, you can also ask for help from the Merchant or Rebel groups found nearby. Those who have no patience for a stealthy approach could take out guards in battle as they fight waves of enemies to reach Ali. However, this approach is obviously pretty dangerous in Assassin's Creed Mirage and would require you to have many healing items to recover from injuries.\nThe main character, Basim, can heal using Elixirs that restore your health to its maximum capacity, but you may only hold up to two at a time by this point in the game's story.\nClose to the Iron Gate by the jail, you can meet with a merchant who can help you sneak into the Prison by disguising you as their assistant. This favor isn't free, though, as you will have to pay the merchant one Merchant's Favor Token. This unique currency ordinarily gets you discounts with vendors across the city and is gained by either pickpocketing people on the streets or completing different Contracts in Assassin's Creed Mirage.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed Mirage: How to Find (& Complete) Contracts\nAnother way to get into the Prison is through the rebel you can talk to located to the east of the jail, who can rally a group of warriors to mount an assault against the Prison while you sneak in. This distraction may help more than the merchant since it takes out more than a few guards who could have exposed you inside the fortress. A Power Token that normally resets your notoriety will be needed to grant this favor from the rebel group.\nNo matter how you decide to infiltrate the Damascus Gate Prison in Assassin's Creed Mirage, you will still have to sneak past or eliminate several guards to find and rescue Ali ibn Muhammad.\n"}
{"title": "Starfield: The Best Physical Skill Builds", "date": "2023-10-06 10:00:25", "text": "While Combat skills seem to be the most appealing ones, you can excel in Starfield with a well-rounded Physical build. Here are some of the best.\nUsing Starfield’s best Physical skill builds can be an easy way of powering through opponents and getting through the game without major inconveniences – all while not excluding the challenge factor that outer space involves. Such builds are centered on grounded exploration and combat rather than using your spaceship and usually focus on survivability, combat power, and even stealth prowess. As Starfield is quite an open-ended RPG when it comes to skill trees, you can mix and match abilities to round out the perfect build. In fact, you are incentivized to do so, as most of the best Physical builds in the game stem from such combinations.\nPhysical skill builds do not necessarily mean that you will only invest in abilities from that tree, but that will be the main focus when building your character. You will likely be using many Combat skills in Starfield to perfect your Physical build, as combat abilities allow you to exterminate opponents while surviving hard battles. There are endless possibilities on how to build your character, especially because Starfield’s lack of a level cap essentially allows you to max out all of your skills, but focusing on specific builds while progressing through the game’s many stories can be a great way of making your experience more pleasant.\nRelated: 10 Starfield Quests You Definitely Want To Avoid\nA very fun Physical build to play around with is what you can call a space samurai build. Its focus is high survivability rates mixed with close and personal face-to-face combat with melee weapons – preferably a sword, which can make the build live up to its name. Mixed up with Ronin, one of the easiest Starfield character backgrounds to start off with, players can initiate their progress on the build from the get-go. While the damage output will largely stem from the Dueling skill on the Combat tree, you will want to invest most of your points on the skills from the Physical tree.\nThe Space Samurai Build in Starfield\nPhysical Skills\n \nOther Skills\n \nFor starters, your first priority should be the Wellness stat. Though there are objectives to unlock each level of the skill, you should try to max out all four levels as quickly as possible. This will boost your total HP by 40% and allow you to get in your enemies’ faces with an improved safety measure.\nThe second priority should be Pain Tolerance in the second row. You can either take it to level 3, which will reduce the physical damage you take by 15%, or max it out to get a 5% chance to completely ignore physical damage when your health is low.\nThe next obvious step is to maximize Martial Arts in the Physical tree as much as possible. This ability will increase your chances of landing a critical hit with a melee weapon by 15%, get a 15% boost to the chance of disarming your opponent, take 10% less damage, and reflect 50% back when blocking. This, of course, requires you to use some of Starfield’s best melee weapons, such as the Wakizashi. The last necessary skill is called Rejuvenation, and it will allow you to restore HP in and outside of battle if fully maxed out.\nIf you want, you can throw in a few extra skills to allow you to have different approaches to combat. Using Stealth and Concealment, both on the Physical tree, will give you the opportunity to walk around unnoticed, get close to opponents, and strike them down for 10x the regular damage you would normally do. This goes against the traditional samurai code and leans more into something of a shinobi, but everything is allowed in space. This is a fantastic complement to the build, leaving open combat as a second option to your stealthy slaughter.\nAnother similar build that focuses on melee damage is the boxer. Unlike the samurai, however, you will not be using melee weapons, but instead your bare hands. This build uses most of the high survivability skills offered from the previous skills, but takes advantage of the abilities that allow you to fight with your fists.\nThere is a decent amount of skills in Starfield that give you bonuses for not using weapons, so this is what the build is centered around.\nThe Boxer Build in Starfield\nPhysical Skills\n \nOther Skills\n \nOne of the main differences is that the Boxing skill from the Physical tree will be featured front and center with this build. The ability, when leveled up to 4, will allow you to do 100% more damage with unarmed attacks and give you a chance to knock down opponents. You will also consume less O2 when running in combat and using powered attacks. Another important skill in Starfield for the boxer build is Neurostrikes. At level 4, you will have a 20% chance of stunning an NPC with an unarmed attack, dealing additional EM damage, and knocking down nearby opponents when you stun an enemy.\nA skill that goes well with the samurai build but is essential for the boxer build is Gymnastics. This will allow you to use the combat slide and take less fall damage, while also increasing your jump height and overall running speed after using the combat slide or mantling.\nThe boxer build benefits from speed to get close to opponents and fight against them, so having this Physical skill unlocked can improve that strategy. The boxer in Starfield is equivalent to an overpowered monk in any fantasy RPG.\nSurvivability is key with the boxer build as well, so Wellness, Pain Tolerance, and Rejuvenation are also essential.\nThe last Physical build to use in Starfield is different from the two previous ones, which were focused on melee damage. The unstoppable tank build will also have a lot of survivability involved, but the focus here will be using powerful weapons to melt through opponents without ever having to stop or fear enemy encounters.\nThe idea is to be a complete juggernaut. Aside from Wellness, Pain Tolerance, and Rejuvenation, you will want to invest in all 4 levels of Weight Lifting. This Physical skill allows you to carry more weight and, thus, comfortably carry several heavy weapons and shotguns – you also get a 50% resistance boost to stagger.\nThe Unstoppable Tank Build in Starfield\nPhysical Skills\n \nOther Skills\n \nAnother Physical skill to use with this tank build is Energy Weapon Dissipation. This will reduce the energy damage you take and give you a chance to reflect it back to the opponent when your health is lower than 50% in Starfield. Because you are expected to take damage and, possibly be injured, Cellular Regeneration can also be a helpful Physical skill to invest in.\nAside from the Physical tree, there will also be important modifications to the skills from the Combat tree to make this Physical build work. Instead of Dueling, you will want to use Ballistics, Shotgun Certification, Demolitions, Heavy Certification, Rapid Reloading, and Targeting.\nThis will allow you to make the most out of shotguns and heavy weapons, as well as deal more damage when firing without aiming down your sights. With this, you become a walking grenadier and arsenal that can get close to opponents without fear of dying, exterminate them, and proceed to the next one.\nThere are several different Physical builds to use in Starfield, and these are some of the best and most varied ones to use so far.\n"}

That being said, it will be long before you can reach that stature. Furthermore, there is an argument to be made about your background, traits, weapons, and armor, all of which play a role in making your character as OP as possible.\nNonetheless, you can do so if you want to be the most powerful spacer across Starfields 120 Star Systems. That being said, you will have to commit to a lengthy and scripted playthrough to make it happen. Because making your character the most powerful in Starfield requires more than selecting the most powerful perks and weapons.\nRelated: How To Build The Most Ridiculously OP Ship In Starfield\nWhen it comes to making your character as OP as possible in Starfield, it largely depends on the starting background, traits, and skills you choose, with the latter being the most crucial. This is because they essentially outline your character's playstyle and, thus, how effective they are in combat and conversation.\nPlayers looking to make their character as OP as possible should also consider getting the best Starfield Starborn Powers.\nYour character's Background and Traits don't make or break how OP they are. However, they do significantly speed up the process at the start of the game. As a result, it's best to start on a fresh playthrough to follow to create an OP character.\nThe background you choose in Starfield is significant because it grants you three starting skills. While there are several best backgrounds in Starfield to choose from, you will want to go with the Soldier background to make your character as OP as possible. This is because, with Soldier, you get starting skills in Ballistics, Boost Pack Training, and Fitness. These are all skills you will push to get early on, so you could save those skill points and grab them now with the Soldier background.\nTraits are optional in Starfield, and you can select up to three. The kicker is that while you can lose traits in Starfield, you can't add them later on - another reason why starting on a fresh playthrough is best. The best traits to pick in Starfield to make your character as OP as possible are Alien DNA, Wanted, and Introvert.\nAlien DNA is arguably the most important because it provides more health and oxygen. While healing and food items are less effective with this trait, you will level up your character's Wellness skill, eventually rendering these effects obsolete in your game. You will also want to grab the Wanted trait. You will gain extra XP from bounties, and this trait will make your character OP by allowing you to deal extra damage when your health is low.\nThe final trait to acquire is Introvert. All it does is reduce your oxygen consumption when traveling alone. However, it's the perfect trait to combine with the Isolation skill, which is one of the skills you will be looking to max out.\nThe path to making your character as OP as possible in Starfield mainly depends on your chosen skills. Of course, the end goal of making your character as OP as possible should be to max out every skill in every skill tree in Starfield. That being said, some skills are more important to focus on than others. According to Khraze Gaming on YouTube, to make your character as OP as possible, you will want to focus on fully maxing out every one of these skills first.\nSkill Tree\nSkills to Max\nPhysical\n \nSocial\n \nCombat\n \nScience\n \nTech\n \nBy maxing out these skills, you will have the most OP character in Starfield. That being said, it will take a while to max out all the skills listed; that's why you will want to use this trick to level up fast in Starfield. The more XP you farm, the more skills you can buy; thus, the faster and more OP your character will become.\nAn Outpost XP Farm early on is also another great way to grind XP and Credits that will contribute to making an OP character.\nBecause you're focusing on leveling many skills in your Combat skill tree, any gun you use will automatically rip enemies to shreds. That being said, it's still worth looking at the most powerful weapons in Starfield. Though these weapons are already good, they will be even more powerful in your hands. What's more, because you're focusing on maxing out the \"Weapon Engineering\" skill in your Science skill tree, you can add mods to these weapons to make them even as OP as possible.\nYour armor is the finishing touch to take your OP character to the next level. While the Starborn Suit is the best armor in the game, you will have to wait a long time to get your hands on it. As a result, it is recommended to get the Mark 1 Spacesuit early in Starfield or the Mantis ship, suit, and backpack. Both are among the best armor in Starfield and which you choose depends on your preferred style.\nRegardless, if you follow the steps outlined above for your character's background, traits, and skills, it won't matter what guns and armor you use because you'll already have the most OP character in Starfield.\nSource: KhrazeGaming/YouTube\nRiley is currently attending Mount Royal University for a degree in Journalism.

This leader of the Order of Abbasiyah has been conducting human experiments to try and control dark magics. The perverted knowledge wielded by Fazil must be stopped, but his actions' insidious and hidden nature makes him hard to find.\nThe mission to eliminate Fazil begins in The Great Symposium, a massive academic building with twisting turns and multiple floors. Before you even start, use Eagle Sight to look for places that might hold potential clues regarding the Great Scholar's location. The restricted area here is smaller than Assassin's Creed Mirage's large map size, letting you focus on specific points of interest to investigate.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nBasim can blend into the background of spots throughout the Symposium in Assassin's Creed Mirage and eavesdrop on different people to learn more about Fazil's whereabouts. From the room where you start in the area, head right and turn left before reaching a set of stairs leading to the upper levels. Find a distraught librarian here talking to someone about how they lost an important book of Fazil's.\nHead outside to find two speakers near a bench talking about rumors of underground passageways below the House of Wisdom. An individual named Kahraman can be spoken to about these tunnels, but they will deny any possibility of secret routes unless you have proper payment. You will need to give them a Scholar Khidmah Token in Assassin's Creed Mirage to bribe Kahraman into telling you more.\nKhidmah Tokens can be earned by pickpocketing people along the city streets or by completing various Contracts. Each has a different effect and can be used to purchase favors from different characters you meet.\nThe two speakers may also mention that a gardener might have a key that unlocks the path into the underground area. You should be able to find this gardener close to the roof on one of the highest floors you can climb up to. Activate your Eagle Sight to pinpoint the worker's location ahead of time, and be careful not to get spotted as you try to keep your notoriety low in Assassin's Creed Mirage.\nYou can find the path leading to the underground passages next to a Gatekeeper, who guards an ornate blue door in the same place next to the stairs leading to the librarian. When you talk to this NPC, they will ask Basim, \"Those Who Came Before are...?\" This is clearly some code demanding a specific response in Assassin's Creed Mirage that you might be able to learn by exploring the House of Wisdom.\nNow, the door behind the Gatekeeper can also be opened by the key you get from the gardener, so there are multiple options. However, if you want to avoid sneaking past the Gatekeeper to use the key, you will find the passcode inside the book the librarian lost. If you follow the librarian from where you eavesdropped on them, you can use Eagle Sight to spot the book in Assassin's Creed Mirage on a balcony to the northwest of the Symposium.\nYou must avoid some guards to reach Fazil's book in a restricted section of the Symposium past the librarian, which you can see is glowing orange when you use Eagle Sight.\nThe rest of the passcode revealed in the book is \"Those Who Shall Return,\" a phrase that will convince the Gatekeeper in Assassin's Creed Mirage to open the door. The room you enter is scattered with different scrolls documenting Fazil's recent works, including a Great Work in the basement. Go ahead and move a bookshelf in this space to reveal a set of stairs going down into a Restricted Area within a series of tunnels.\nThis section of the assassination may be the trickiest to complete without getting into a fight due to the many guards who patrol the passages underneath the House of Wisdom. Mark enemies with Eagle Sight to ensure you don't get surprised as you explore this labyrinth in Assassin's Creed Mirage. Use your Whistle ability to lure guards into corners for quick and silent kills that fail to alert anyone lurking around this area.\nEventually, you will find a room with three guards commenting on how they plan to use \"volunteers\" for the Great Scholar's experiments near some iron cages and shackles. Wait until one of them leaves before using throwing knives to make the red pots in the room explode, which will either kill them or cause a distraction for easy assassinations. Travel a bit further to the left of the room to a larger prison space in Assassin's Creed Mirage.\nNear the holding cells, here is a note from Fazil saying that all those he conducts his ritual on must be wearing the right clothing before being brought to him. Go through the first cell door you see and travel under a break in the right wall to discover one of the Great Scholar's previous victims in Assassin's Creed Mirage. Disguise yourself with the clothes from the corpse to act as the next willing participant in Fazil's demented studies.​​​​​​​\nThe WhitePatient's Robe you put on lets you blend in perfectly, getting a free escort from one of Fazil's soldiers when you go past the prison door. Descending another staircase places you in a terrifying ritual chamber, Fazil's library of taboo knowledge and dark practices in Assassin's Creed Mirage. In the center is a mechanism that resembles a flower where Fazil is arguing with others about interruptions to his \"Great Work.\"\nSimply press the Blend In option at the center of the machine to start a cutscene that lets you assassinate Fazil the Great Scholar without getting caught in Assassin's Creed Mirage.\n"}

Luckily, there is an easy way to cure yourself of these afflictions.\nCurses are not very common in Baldur's Gate 3, but if you are unfortunate enough to come across one, you will need a way to remove it. The Level 3 Spell Bestow Curse can inflict multiple curses, affecting checks, saving throws, health, and/or attacks. Cursed items can provide useful bonuses at terrible cost. You may even get a particularly nasty curse called Tharchiate Withering.\nTharchiate Withering comes from the Tharchiate Codex, a cursed book on necromancy found in the Elminster Vault. Tharchiate Withering decreases your Constitution by five points. This can dangerously limit your health. Luckily, there's a simple move most players have easy access to, whether personally or through a companion. Even if, somehow, you lack the resources to cure your curse, you can find them.\nRelated: Should You Equip Cursed Items In Baldur's Gate 3?\n In order to get rid of curses like Tharchiate Withering in Baldur's Gate 3, you will need to know a spell called Remove Curse. Remove Curse is a Level 3 Abjuration Spell that removes curses of all types, from enemy spells to cursed items. This spell is available to Clerics, Warlocks, Wizards, and Paladins of the Oath of Devotion. It's an Action Spell, so you can quickly recover from any curse that may afflict you. You will need to be at Level 5 or higher to cast the spell yourself.\nIf you open the Tharchiate Withering but find yourself without the classes possessing the needed spell, don't worry. Since Shadowheart is a useful High Cleric, she knows Remove Curse. Simply direct her to use the spell, and the Curse will disappear. You could teach the spell to Gale or Wyll since they also have the needed classes to learn Remove Curse, but it is easier to bring Shadowheart along.\nIf you still lack a companion or class to cast Remove Curse, you will need to find a Scroll of Remove Curse. This is a rare scroll worth 100 gold pieces. You can purchase the scroll from merchants or stumble upon it while collecting loot. There is no definite area where all players can find a Scroll of Remove Curse. If you can only remove a curse by hoping you find a specific scroll somewhere in Baldur's Gate 3, you are better off avoiding the Tharchiate Codex or any items that bestow curses.\n"}

If players would like to try the game for themselves, it can be found on the Wordle website, which creates a new puzzle every day, keeps track of players' win streaks and guess distribution, and has a popular sharing ability.\nComedian Patton Oswalt scored a Wordle win-in-two, even though he only got a single misplaced letter from his starting word. He shared his win from July 15th on Twitter and called it \"Lucky!\"\nWith a new Wordle added every day, players may need a little help with the more difficult words, and having a strong starting word is important. Players may not have time to work out the puzzle solution every day, or perhaps they just want to keep their streak going but are having too much difficulty with the daily word. Whatever the reason, players can find every daily Wordle answer used so far in 2023 below.\nLooking for last year's answers? They're all here below for archiving needs.\nSimple games, like Wordle, are the perfect small distraction for the day.

{"title": "Loki Season 2: Why Wasn't OB's Memory Wiped By He Who Remains?", "date": "2023-10-06 05:05:44", "text": "Loki season 2 has confirmed that Agents of the Time Variance Authority got their memories wiped by He Who Remains, so what's going on with Ouroboros?\nWarning! This post contains SPOILERS for Loki season 2, episode 1\nLoki season 2's premiere features an exciting mystery surrounding its newest character and instant MCU breakout Ouroborus (Ke Huy Quan). Also known as O.B., it appears as though the head of the Repairs and Advancement department has a fully intact memory unlike his fellow agents working at the Time Variance Authority. This begs the question as to why He Who Remains allowed Ouroboros to keep said memory.\nIn Loki season 1's ending, He Who Remains (Jonathan Majors) was revealed as the true founder of the TVA, having created the organization to help maintain the Sacred Timeline where his variants (like Kang) would never exist. To that end, several fictions were put in place to keep the agents of the TVA complacent such as the Time-Keepers. Likewise, it's been revealed that agents like Mobius (Owen Wilson) and many others continually had their minds wiped, preventing them from remembering their past lives as variants while also ensuring they wouldn't question the TVA's true purpose. However, Loki season 2's premiere implies O.B. never had his mind wiped.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Cast Guide: Every New & Returning Marvel Character\nAs the chief (and only) engineer at the TVA's Repairs and Advancement department, Ouroboros is a key part of the Time Variance Authority. As such, Loki season 2's premiere confirms he's in charge of all the technology and inner workings of the TVA. He even wrote the entire TVA guidebook. However, Agent Mobius struggles to remember their history and even O.B.'s name due to the mind wiping by He Who Remains. Conversely, Ouroboros is able to recall their history with no issue, including his conversations with Loki after the God of Mischief time-slipped back into the distant past of the TVA. This establishes that O.B. possibly never had his mind wiped by He Who Remains.\nIt stands to reason that Ouroboros has always been far too integral to the TVA's operations to be mind-wiped. After all, it certainly seems as though the entire organization would fall apart without him. While the full extent of his knowledge remains to be seen, it's possible that O.B. may have been aware of He Who Remains' role in founding the TVA. Although he seems innocent enough, it's quite possible that O.B. knew the truth about the Time Variance Authority's true purpose and the truth about his fellow agents all along. There's also the possibility that Ouroboros was so isolated by his work that he wasn't deemed a threat the same way the other agents would have been.\nRelated: Every Loki Season 2 Episode 1 MCU Easter Egg & Reference\nThe TVA looks to be at risk of being destroyed thanks to the newly expanding multiverse. Needing to retrofit the TVA's Time Loom so it doesn't overload from the massive influx of raw temporal energy, perhaps O.B. will point Loki and Mobius in the direction of Victor Timely, the confirmed Kang variant who's set to appear. Existing as an inventor of time travel giving lectures in 1901, perhaps Timely can help O.B. stabilize the Time Loom as a replacement for He Who Remains (who remains no more). At any rate, O.B.'s intact memory will likely play a big factor going forward in Loki season 2.\nNew episodes of Loki release every Thursday at 6pm PT / 9pm ET on Disney+.\nWant more Loki content?

{"title": "Loki Season 2 Episode 1 Recap: 12 Biggest Reveals", "date": "2023-10-06 04:00:57", "text": "Loki Season 2 Episode 1 kicks off the God of Mischief's second small-screen adventure with a bang, and plenty of reveals tease what's to come.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Loki season 2, episode 1.\nLoki season 2 is finally here, and the MCU's latest streaming show premiere delivers plenty of answers - and even more questions. Kicking off immediately after Loki season 1's cliffhanger ending, the titular god of mischief finds himself uncontrollably bouncing back and forth in time. Loki season 2 episode 1 centers this condition as the primary conflict, though it's clear that all is not well in the TVA.\nLoki season 2 episode 1 follows most of the returning Loki cast and also introduces newcomers like Ke Huy Quan's Ouroboros as they try to navigate the sudden and explosive growth of the MCU timeline. It all starts with some familiar tropes: the Loki/Mobius bromance is strong, there are lots of complex questions, as well asLoki season 2 episode 1's post-credit scene following the now inevitable MCU trend. While the overarching story of Loki season 2 is reasonably straightforward so far, there are still plenty of reveals that form the foundation for the season to come.\nRelated: Every Loki Season 2 Episode 1 MCU Easter Egg & Reference\nIt doesn't come as much of a shock, but Loki season 2 opens up immediately where Loki season 1's cliffhanger left off. Having been kicked through a time door by Sylvie, Loki has arrived in an unfamiliar TVA, complete with He Who Remains imagery and a Mobius who doesn't recognize him. Fortunately, and more surprisingly, the mystery of where - or rather, when - Loki ended up is answered quite quickly.\nWhen Loki ends up in a different TVA at the end of Loki season 1, it appears as if he may have found himself in an alternate timeline branch from where he started. However, Loki season 2 quickly clears up that that isn't the case. Instead, Loki has been sent to the past. That clearly explains why Mobius doesn't recognize him (they haven't met yet), but the visual changes to the TVA remain a mystery.\nFor reasons unknown to him and viewers, Loki is suffering from a condition called Time Slipping. Because of this, he finds himself being pulled back and forth between the past, present, and future. The events of the Loki season 2 premiere have supposedly stopped this effect, but time will tell if it actually worked.\nThe big plot twist of Loki season 1 is that the Time-Keepers are not, in fact, real, and He Who Remains is secretly pulling the TVA's strings from the end of time. However, Loki season 2 reveals that wasn't always the case. In the past that Loki keeps unwillingly revisiting, imagery of the Time-Keepers is replaced with paintings, statues, and references to He Who Remains. At some point, presumably shortly before a TVA-wide mind wipe, the Kang variant changed his mind and removed himself from the picture.\nWhen Loki first finds himself in the past TVA, he plays an audio recording from a device on a wall. The voice is clearly Jonathan Majors' He Who Remains. Interestingly, the recording captures him thanking the TVA's Ravonna Renslayer for her help in his victory during the Multiverse War in which countless Kangs all battled and almost destroyed time itself. Whether she remembers this period in her life and what it means for the future is yet to be seen.\nOne of the unique elements of the TVA is that it supposedly exists outside of time. However, Loki's Time Slipping seems to imply that's not the case. Ouroboros seems familiar with the condition, but he seems to think that it's impossible, given that traveling through time in a place without time doesn't make sense. However, since it's clearly happening - and since the episode teases more about the TVA agents' mind-wiping - the TVA must exist in a more traditional environment than previously thought. Where or when that is, however, remains a mystery.\nOne of the best reveals in Loki season 2 episode 1 is the introduction of Ke Huy Quan's TVA engineer, Ouroboros. On the surface, the man who literally wrote the book on the TVA and its mechanical workings can certainly reveal plenty of interesting tidbits moving forward in the season. However, there appears to be more going on with him. Given he remembers Mobius visiting him 400 years earlier, but Mobius has no recollection, he may be the only TVA agent who's never had his memory wiped. Or, at least, it's been a lot longer.\nGiven that Avengers: Endgame introduced time travel as a major element, it makes sense that it also defined how time travel works in the MCU. Simply put, any changes made in the past don't affect the time traveler's own future. Instead, changes create a new branched timeline. In theory, this avoids grandfather paradoxes in which a time traveler can undo their own existence. However, Loki's actions in the past contradict this, having immediate effects on the future. For example, Ouroboros instantly remembers meeting Loki as Loki is simultaneously speaking to him in the past. The ability to affect the future from the past is wildly powerful and may be a key to the fight against Kang moving forward.\nRelated: The MCU Just Broke A Time Travel Rule The Avengers Called Unbreakable Only 4 Years Ago\nIn Loki season 2, episode 1, the TVA is suffering power issues. Ouroboros immediately recognizes that this must be because of a problem with the massive Temporal Loom. How exactly the device works isn't explained in detail, but, in the abstract, it takes every branch of time and collects them into a single, physical strand with a defined and stable shape. However, as the TVA has (perhaps temporarily) stopped pruning, the Temporal Loom is overloaded with timelines. Short of resuming pruning and killing millions, no answer is presented as to how to fix it.\nLoki's Time Slipping is understandably frustrating, and O.B. explains to him and Mobius that the Loom can be used to stop it. Mobius has to walk into the seemingly endless chamber containing the device and then harpoon Loki out of the timeline after the latter can prune himself at precisely the right time. It's convoluted, but the plan seemingly works. Time will tell if Loki's Time Slipping is really fixed or not.\nAs Loki is waiting for Mobius to prepare the Loom, he Time Slips into the future for the first time. There, the TVA is evacuating - possibly because of the Loom breaking down in the past - and Loki can't find a Time Stick. While wandering the halls, he sees Sylvie appear in an elevator, though he's soon after pulled back into his present time. Who pruned him - and why a phone was mysteriously ringing in his presence right before Sylvie appeared, are mysteries left for another episode.\nLoki season 2 episode 1 contains a short mid-credits scene that seems to reveal where Sylvie went after killing He Who Remains in the Loki season 1 finale. She ends up in Broxton, Oklahoma, in the year 1982 and doesn't seem to have chosen that time or place on purpose. Once there, she walks into a fast-food restaurant and is seemingly swept away by her newfound freedom. She closes the Loki season 2 premiere with the optimistic line, \"I want to try everything.\" \n"}
{"title": "10 Best Sports Anime of All Time", "date": "2023-10-06 03:53:19", "text": "Sports anime are some of the most compelling in the medium, but only a few are great enough to be called the best (and have major impacts on sports).\nJust as sports films have captured audiences' hearts, sports anime have risen from the ranks of TV shows or comic-inspired series to become cultural phenomenons. And looking at the most beloved and popular sports anime ever released, it isn't hard to see why.\nThe best sports anime series deliver compelling character histories, challenges, and victories. They also deliver on important themes like friendship, loss, family, and dedication. If all of that wasn't enough, the top ranks of sports anime have also captured enough acclaim and devotion to not only be recognized as the best of their subgenre... but be seen among the top anime of all time.\nAlthough reactions to The Prince of Tennis may not be as universally positive as others, it remains a perfect sports anime for newcomers. Beginning as a manga which was serialized from 1999 to 2008, the series follows young tennis player Ryoma Echizen as he excels beyond his competition, quickly becoming a certified tennis ace. At the same time, following his school's efforts to win a team championship.\nThe plot is very straightforward, and while the cast of characters may not be as fleshed out as other sports anime, The Prince of Tennis still manages to be one of the best-selling manga series and most popular sports anime series of all time. Long-time fans of the genre might find it less nuanced, but for viewers new to sports anime, it's a great introduction.\nPerfect for fans of the Fast and Furious series (particularly before it shifted from street racing to secret agent superheroics), Initial D centers on the same Japanese street racing the film series emulated for Tokyo Drift. Beginning as a manga in 1995 from Shuichi Shigeno, the series exploded into numerous anime stories, divided into \"Stages.\"\nThough many viewers were introduced to the series through its popularity as meme fodder online, the tale of Takumi Fujiwara on his mission to become a respected racer is hard to beat in its genre. With incredible driving sequences and an upbeat soundtrack, Initial D is a thrilling and underrated anime, sticking to its lane every step of the way.\nRelated: Naruto's Creator Confirms the Surprising Inspiration For The Most Iconic Jutsu\nYuri on Ice debuted in 2016 to a warm welcome, following its hero Yuri Katsuki, a figure skater trying to decide what his future in competition will hold. During his journey he rediscovers his passion for skating, as well as love. While not as old as some other iconiuc sports anime, the series enraptured not just the usual anime crowd, but also professional skaters, too (gaining popularity when its choreography and soundtracks made the leap into real-world figure skating). The heart, struggles, and emotion of the show, as well as its uncommon sport of focus, guarantee it will remain a must-watch for years to come.\nYowamushi Pedal first aired in 2013, but had already garnered fans due to its success as a manga series still being serialized after its 2008 debut. Spanning 84 volumes and airing five seasons, the series follows Sakamichi Onoda, who joins a bicycle racing club. The award-winning series from TMS Entertainment has stood out not only for focusing on cycling, but also the appeal of the otaku protagonist. With plenty of humor and heart, Yowamushi Pedal is a series that anime watchers should take a chance on (if they aren't hooked already).\nCreated first as a manga by Tadatoshi Fujimaki in 2008, Kuroko's Basketball is a stand-out series for breaking typical sports manga conventions. It follows the titular character, Tetsuya Kuroko, as he joins up with a basketball team hoping to become the top contender at the high school level. While initially seeming typical, the series blends magical action with sports tropes and plot beats. The players each seem to have their own superpowers, allowing the games to feel extra suspenseful and intriguing. The broad cast of characters are also motivated in compelling ways, while the main hero is an unexpected and very quiet star. Kuroko's Basketball is a must-see anime that blends traditional sports anime with fantasy-esque elements.\nAce of Diamond is another series that began as a manga (2006 - 2015) before being adapted into an anime by Madhouse and Production I.G., first airing in 2013 (and spawning multiple sequel series and manga since). The hero of the story is Eijun Sawada, who wants to be a star pitcher, or an 'ace' on the baseball diamond. The series provides personal competition as teammates compete to become an ace, as well as the usual ups and downs of a season of league baseball. With a cast of characters outfitted with big dreams and engrossing baseball action, Ace of Diamond needs to be on the watchlists of any baseball fan, and anime fan besides.\nHaikyu!! is one of the best known sports manga and anime of the modern era - and it's no wonder why. Another Production I.G series, this manga turned anime follows Shoyo Hinata, whose determination and team-building throughout the series make the tale a stand-out (despite how young it is relative to other hit sports anime). Haikyu!! has won several awards, and though it has concluded, it is worth jumping into sooner than later. Hinata's perseverance and struggles, as well as the camaraderie that builds into success, makes this a must-watch sports anime.\nWhile less widely known or cited than some other modern sports anime, Major deserves a spot on this list. First launching as a manga by Takuya Mitsuda and serialized from 1994 to 2010, followed by an anime airing in 2004, this baseball anime follows Goro Honda, who strives to be a professional pitcher like his father. What makes it unique is the length of the story, taking Goro from his early years playing the sport all the way to the major leagues.\nWhile demonstrating a progression far beyond one championship or season, Major has all the hallmarks sports fans love, but also enjoys a fan base including all-star MLB pitcher and hitter, Shohei Ohtani. The major league player has mentioned his love for the series in interviews, proving it isn't just a compelling story, but an inspiring one for aspiring athletes of all ages.\nCreated by George Morikawa as a manga in 1989, Hajime no Ippo has often been compared to Rocky. This underdog hero is Ippo Makunouchi, who enters the world of boxing when a professional boxer interrupts one of many instances of bullying in the young man's life. After Ippo learns how to box, the heart of the story comes from rivalries, character interactions, and the growth that Ippo undergoes as a result.\nLike the titular hero of Rocky or The Karate Kid, the hero in this anime is an underdog in a combat sport, who learns about himself and others the stronger he gets. Fans of either film should give Hajime no Ippo a chance, as the series has proven it can resonate long-term with audiences.\nIn 1990, mangaka Takehiko Inoue debuted what would become one of the most beloved sports manga, and eventually anime, in the world. Beginning with Toei Animation in 1993, the most recent film of the series The First Slam Dunk was still a box office hit. Slam Dunk is credited with increasing basketball's popularity in Japan, making it one of the most influential sports stories in manga and anime... if not the most influential of all-time.\nThe series follows Hanamichi Sakuragi, an intimidating, trouble-making gang leader who hopes to impress a girl by learning how to play basketball. His journey to becoming an accomplished player and leader of his championship team is already etched in anime history, so if any anime fan has yet to see it, it's a wrong to right sooner than later.\n"}

And now, their origin is revealed. \nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Alien Annual 2023 #1 After months of mystery surrounding Alien’s new Xenomorph subspecies, the answer to the question of how they came into existence has finally arrived, as Alien officially reveals the origin of the new white Xenomorph ‘hybrid’.\nIn Alien Annual 2023 #1 by Declan Shalvey and Danny Earls, readers are shown a spaceship containing a Xenomorph Queen and her brood crash-landing on LV-695 years before the events of Alien Vol. 3. When they hit the ground, they’re met with bug-like indigenous creatures who immediately investigate the Ovomorphs that litter the ground surrounding the crash-site. As per their nature, the Facehuggers leap out of their eggs onto the faces of these white ‘bugs’, and while the first few attempts at infection fail (given their faces are not the optimal size for Facehugger attachment), the aliens eventually find a way to release the genetic material needed to create Xenomorph life into the bodies of these ‘bugs’. The result is the white Xenomorph first shown in Alien Vol. 3, one of which overpowers the Queen and takes her place in producing Ovomorphs, with these new ones containing white Facehuggers.\nWhile it is interesting to see Facehuggers infect their hosts in a new and horrific way, it’s a bit underwhelming that this exciting new Xenomorph strain came about exactly how everyone would have assumed. Xenomorphs’ DNA Reflex is a key aspect of their entire species, and it’s been established that a dominant gene picked up by certain hosts can carry over to the next Xenomorph Queen and her brood. For instance, the Xenomorph as fans know them only look the way they do because of the genetic characteristics they picked up from human hosts. That’s also why creatures such as the Predalien look different, as that’s a Xenomorph born from a Predator host. These white bugs of LV-695 are the latest in a long line of Xenomorph hosts passing on their genetic traits to these alien parasites. Unlike the Red Xenomorphs from Aliens: Genocide (which this story seems to be inspired by, given the Xenomorph civil war), that were naturally-occuring Xenomorph mutants who came to be without the influence of a specific host, these white Xenomorphs relied entirely on these ‘bug’ hosts for how they came into existence - which isn’t too dissimilar to another line of Alien comics.\nIn 1992, Dark Horse Comics in partnership with Kenner Products published Aliens: Space Marines, a line of mini comics that were included with Aliens toys. The toys themselves were interesting variations of the classic Xenomorph, with ‘Mantis Alien’, ‘Scorpion Alien’, and ‘Rhino Alien’ being only a few examples. This was a creative way to sell kid-friendly Alien toys while also adding some variety, and the comics that were included explained that each of these Xenomorphs came to be after infecting aliens with those specific traits on new worlds. It was a great way to come up with new designs for Xenomorphs while also honoring the established lore, and it’s exactly what Alien Vol. 3 did with the white Xenomorph.\nWhile there’s nothing wrong with how the white Xenomorph was brought into canon, it does feel like a missed opportunity to delve deeper into uncharted, scientific hybridizations rather than the classic DNA Reflex. In fact, this very series introduced perhaps the most disturbing human/Xenomorph hybrid in the Alien franchise, and there was definitely room to expand on that idea. These people were operating in unregulated territory, they consisted of a mad-scientist mother, a naive but brave daughter, and a synthetic totally loyal to the mother. No one knew what they had, and the experiments that could have been conducted in secret had the potential to explore the deepest aspects of horror and human depravity in the name of science. However, despite what could have happened, fans can at least be satisfied in knowing the official origin of Alien’s new white Xenomorph.\nAlien Annual 2023 #1 by 20th Century Studios is available now.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

What is their history?\nThe preview for Bachelor in Paradise season 9 episode 3 showed Tyler Norris arriving on the beach and reuniting with Rachel Recchia, so it's time to revisit their past relationship. Rachel and Tyler met during Rachel and Gabby Windey's Bachelorette season. Tyler was smitten with Rachel while watching her on Clayton Echard's Bachelor season, and had even written her a DM that he'd like to pursue her, which she didn't see before the show began filming.\nAlthough their relationship didn't work out on The Bachelorette season 19, Tyler and Rachel seemed happy to see each other on Bachelor in Paradise season 9. In the preview, Tyler asked to speak to Rachel, who said that she was waiting to talk to him and was so excited he was there. Brayden Bowers commented that it would be kind of cool and cute if something did happen between them. Sean McLaughlin, whom Rachel had been connecting with, felt anxious and nervous because Rachel was his only connection. As Rachel and Tyler possibly rekindle their romance, here's their relationship history.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nRachel and Tyler had a strong connection throughout The Bachelorette season 19. Their relationship was sweet and romantic, and it was clear that Tyler only had eyes for her. He even wrote a poem for her. Rachel gave Tyler a hometown date, and they traveled to Wildwood, New Jersey, where Tyler owned a business called Spirit Ball. They spent the day walking on the boardwalk, eating snacks, playing games, and riding a Ferris wheel. They met up with some of his friends and relatives on the boardwalk. However, Rachel admitted in her confessional that their relationship was behind the others, and she felt like a horrible person.\nAlthough Rachel was having doubts, Tyler couldn't wait for Rachel to meet his parents. He told her that he wasn't falling in love with her, but so in love with her. He gushed that Rachel was the most amazing person he'd ever met. She interrupted him and cried as she told him that she wasn't ready to meet his family. She apologized, and he thanked her for not creating an awkward situation for his family. He was also grateful that she allowed him to love again and said that knew she'd find love. Tyler was later shown arriving to meet his family alone, explaining to them that Rachel had broken up with him.\nDespite their breakup, Rachel and Tyler had a sweet reunion at The Bachelorette season 19 \"The Men Tell All\" episode. He told her that she did everything perfectly. He said that, even though it didn't end the way he wanted it to, he respected what she did, and she did it with the most class. Tyler then appeared on Bachelor in Paradise season 8, in which he fell in love with Brittany Galvin. However, he had his heart broken again when she ended things with him after the show.\nTime will tell if Rachel and Tyler reunite on Bachelor in Paradise season 9. However, they were both shown kissing other people in the previews for the show. It might be hard for them to get out of the Friend Zone at this point, but perhaps a romantic connection could be rekindled between them. Either way, Rachel and Tyler clearly care very much about each other, which is a beautiful thing to see.\nBachelor in Paradise airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. EDT on ABC.\nSource: Bachelor Nation on ABC/YouTube\n"}

This post contains SPOILERS for Loki season 2, episode 1\nLoki season 2 continues the adventures of the titular God of Mischief (Tom Hiddleston) within the hallways of the MCU's Time Variance Authority, and the premiere further reveals why time doesn't matter inside the TVA itself. Having found He Who Remains at the end of Loki season 1, Loki was sent back to the TVA by Sylvie, though it was quite different from the TVA he originally left. Now, Loki season 2 offers new insights into why time works so differently inside the TVA.\nIn Loki season 2's premiere, Loki finds himself in the past, explaining why no one knew who he was in Loki season 1's finale as they hadn't met him yet. To that end, it's revealed that Loki is \"time-slipping\" where his body is involuntary and violently sent back and forth between the past, present, and future. However, this is something that should be impossible inside the TVA according to Agent Mobius (Owen Wilson) and Ouroboros aka O.B. (Ke Huy Quan), the TVA's head of Repairs and Advancement. Here's why time doesn't matter inside the TVA.\nRelated: Loki Season 2's First Post-Credits Scene Is Way Deeper Than You Realized\nAt its core, the primary reason time doesn't matter in the TVA is because the entire organization exists outside the normal confines of time and space. This is likely why its agents are able to live and work for hundreds of years, seeing as how Mobius and O.B. claim they hadn't seen each other in over four centuries. As has been said many times by Agent Mobius, \"Time works differently in the TVA\". Thanks to their technology such as TemPads, the TVA can enter and exit points of time across various realities as needed to maintain and protect the Sacred Timeline.\nAs Loki season 2 continues, it will be interesting to learn more about the origins of the TVA and how it was built by He Who Remains outside of time and space. However, that may be hard to do with the reveal that most TVA agents were routinely given mind wipes, preventing them from remembering the truth about former lives as variants or the TVA's true purpose in maintaining the Sacred Timeline. However, it also looks as though time itself is creeping into the Time Variance Authority now that He Who Remains is dead and the multiverse has begun to freely expand with new branch realities.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Cast Guide: Every New & Returning Marvel Character\nNot only has the TVA been experiencing power surges ever since the multiverse began expanding, but the TVA's Time Loom is at risk of overloading. Beyond its core function to create a physical timeline out of raw temporal energy, the Loom was apparently never made to handle the influx of new branch timelines. This forces O.B. to seal off the machine so he can hopefully begin retrofitting the Loom (lest the entire TVA be destroyed).\nLikewise, Loki's time-slipping is undoubtedly connected to the new multiverse expansion as well. Furthermore, it's been teased that the temporal affliction may have come through Sylvie's use of He Who Remains' TemPad in Loki season 1. Nevertheless, it does seem as though the core plot of Loki season 2 will be focused on saving the TVA from time itself.\nLoki season 2 continues next Thursday, Oct. 12 at 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}

Find out who won and who they might nominate for eviction.\nWARNING! THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR BIG BROTHER 25!\nBig Brother 25 took a new turn as the week 10 Head of Household (HOH) is Bowie Jane. This is Bowie's first competition win of the season, after playing an under-the-radar game for the last nine weeks. Thursday's live eviction was shocking, as the houseguests flipped the vote once again, and unanimously evicted Mecole Hayes instead of Felicia Cannon. Felicia's eviction seemed inevitable until the houseguests had a last minute change of heart. Host Julie Chen Moonves ended the episode with the announcement that all of the remaining houseguests had made it at least to the Jury of 7.\nThe Big Brother 25 week 10 HOH is Bowie. As the outgoing HOH, Cameron Hardin was ineligible to play. The remaining houseguests, Bowie, America Lopez, Blue Kim, Cirie Fields, Cory Wurtenberger, Felicia, Jag Bains, and Matt Klotz, competed in a game that began before the episode aired. The Humili-verse brought Humili-gram posts to the memory wall, which were distorted photographs of the evicted houseguests with various pieces of information on them. The houseguests had to answer seven questions about the pictures. The game came down to a tiebreaker between Bowie and Felicia, with Bowie winning the game.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nBowie has been a bit of a wildcard this season. During week 5, she was very upset when her alliance flipped the vote and evicted Red Utley instead of Jag without telling her or Cameron. She has been aligned with Cameron throughout the game, so it's doubtful that she'll nominate him. It's possible that she could take revenge on her former alliance members for lying to her and target Cirie and Felicia. Another option would be to try to break up the Cory and America showmance, or even the duo of Jag and Matt. However, since Cameron is working with Matt and Jag, he might talk Bowie out of nominating them.\nThis is Bowie's first competition win of the season, and it's long overdue. It'll be interesting to see what she decides to do as HOH, as viewers haven't really seen her assert herself before in the game. Big Brother 25 feels like a whole new and refreshed game now that Bowie has won. It'll be an unpredictable week in the house as Bowie takes the lead.\nAlthough some might say that Bowie hasn't really been playing the game until now, sometimes watching and waiting is a great strategy. Because she managed to stay out of the drama that's ensued over the past few weeks, she was able to take in information and study her fellow houseguests. It'll be exciting to see which houseguests she'll target. Bowie's HOH is definitely living up to Big Brother's motto of \"expect the unexpected.\"\nBig Brother 25 airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT, Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EDT, and Thursdays at 9 p.m. EDT on CBS.\n"}

{"title": "Prey Deleted Scene With New Predator Weapon Explained By Director", "date": "2023-10-06 02:59:20", "text": "Prey director Dan Trachtenberg cut an early scene where the Predator and Naru met earlier in the treetops due to budget and execution concerns.\nPrey director Dan Trachtenberg explains why a scene introducing Naru to the new Predator sooner was cut. The Predator franchise's return to feature movies saw Amber Midthunder's determined young hunter set out to prove herself when another hunter from across the stars began its own bloody game across the Great Plains in 1719. While Prey passed over a theatrical release and instead went straight to Hulu, it earned widespread acclaim from critics and has been seen as a return to form for the franchise.\nWith Prey now receiving a home release, Trachtenberg sat down with /Film and opened up about the movie's production, shedding some light on moments that didn't make it into the final cut. The director revealed that initially, Naru would encounter the Predator in the trees early on. For various reasons, which he explained, this was cut. Check out Trachtenberg's complete explanation below:\nI don't. This was a little bit of a filmmaking director trick of the trade. On the one hand, it was a sequence as we were devising it — Naru was in the tree in the beginning, so in my mind, it was to set up the sequence at the end, that the physical capabilities were there and the visual language was sort of already in the movie. I love the idea of seeing her running through the tree, and the Predator up there, because he's up in the tree so often in these films. Putting her up there, too, it could have been really fun. But I was also incredibly nervous that it ended up looking like Tarzan. The execution had to be perfect for it to be great. Then, it was also becoming very costly to do, and [it was] time-consuming, which, sometimes, is the same thing.\nIt was in the parking lot next to our stage, starting to map out where the trees were going to go, and having a talk with my producers about the cost and the implications and what's our schedule and other things that we needed also. So rather than fight to make it work, when other things were getting squeezed, I sort of waited until the things that were also critical were getting impacted. I said, \"You know what? What if we lost the thing? What if I took out that whole sequence? Then we could do this other ... Surely, you can't tell me that we can't.\"\nBut in the back of my mind, it was like, Okay, Dan. You're nervous about it already. Listen to your gut. It might not be great. The thing that I was the saddest to lose was, I thought, a clever use of the cut clamp, one of the Predator's weapons that Naru has in the sequence. So now, I'm glad that people can kind of see what it was. Previz is a tool that we use all the time in movies and TV sometimes, and movie fans and potential future filmmakers never get to see that stuff, so it's cool that they have it now.\nWhile Trachtenberg's initial idea for Naru and the Predator's first meeting was scrapped, the idea of it leaves the question of how Prey's narrative would be impacted by the sequence. It could be argued that seeing Naru's keen hunting skills could've impacted her journey, as her growth from a young hunter to the slayer of an advanced alien rival helped endear her to the audience, solidifying her as a captivating protagonist. While it likely wouldn't dampen her growth too much, it would make her actions in during the ending of Prey less of a surprise, as her skills would've already been shown.\nRelated: What Would Happen If Naru Met Other Predator Heroes?\nFurthermore, Naru's first true encounter with the Predator in Prey's final cut would surely be diminished if the pair met earlier. Naru's first glimpse at the Predator is both a surprise for her and the audience, as the alien makes his presence known when he slays a grizzly bear that she has been battling alone. Not only is the Predator's bloody intervention a shock, but it being able to annihilate large threats like bears with ease instantly makes Naru see how dangerous her foe truly is, raising the stakes further than before.\nWhile Prey's alternate first encounter established Naru's skill set and parallels with her Predator rival, the final execution proves that a longer wait may have been worth it. Alongside making her growth more captivating to watch and allowing further surprises, the greater build-up allowed for more anticipation around the Predator's on-screen debut. However, Trachtenberg still ensured a pre-visualized concept of this scene exists to give viewers a glimpse at an alternate take on the movie.\nSource: /Film\n"}

This article contains spoilers for Loki season 2, episode 1.\nLoki season 2, episode 1 continues the titular God of Mischief's MCU journey, bringing plenty of references and connections to the wider franchise with it. More so than many other Marvel Disney+ shows, Loki is tied intrinsically to the status of the MCU. The events of Loki season 1 were instrumental in the foundation of the MCU multiverse that led to stories like Spider-Man: No Way Home and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness becoming possible.\nJust as Loki season 1 kickstarted the events of the Multiverse Saga, Loki season 2 will be integral to its progression. This means that Loki season 2 will be filled with wider references to other MCU properties as well as other fun Easter eggs pertaining to different elements of the character. It all starts as it means to go on, with Loki season 2 episode 1's post-credits scene offering a huge tie to Loki and Thor's Marvel lore. As such, here is every Easter egg, reference, and fun nod found by the time the ending of Loki season 2, episode 1, \"Ouroborus\" rolls around.\nRelated: The MCU Just Broke A Time Travel Rule The Avengers Called Unbreakable Only 4 Years Ago\nMidway through Loki season 2, episode 1, Loki is introduced to Ke Huy Quan's character named Ouroboros, seemingly explaining the Loki season 2, episode 1 title. However, it has a deeper meaning than simply referencing the lovable new TVA agent. In the real world, an Ouroboros is a circular symbol often depicting a snake or a dragon devouring its own tail to signify the endless cycle of destruction and rebirth. Given the events of Loki season 2, episode 1, this seems fitting while also propping up Quan's O.B. to have a major role in the upcoming season.\nFurthermore, Ouroborus links to Norse mythology on which Loki and other Marvel Asgardians are based. In Norse myth, Ouroborus is depicted as Jörmungandr, or the World Serpent who is large enough to coil around the entire world. In these tales, it was said that as soon as Jörmungandr releases his tail, Ragnarok will begin. Interestingly, Jörmungandr is also Loki's child in Norse mythology. All of this just furthers how the title of Loki season 2's \"Ouroborus\" connects to Loki on a deeper level aside from being the name of Quan's character.\nA common Easter egg that has come to be expected by every new Marvel Studios project is the updated logo for the company. With Loki season 2, episode 1, the Marvel Studios logo is gold and green. This reflects the two primary colors of Loki's design throughout the MCU as both an Easter egg to the character's past and the prominent color scheme of the first season.\nIn the opening chase sequence of Loki season 2, episode 1, Kang's statue is shown towering above the TVA. While this could be seen as simply a reference to the overall villain of the Multiverse Saga, it holds a deeper meaning. The camera pans backward from the statue and back into the TVA building in which Loki is being chased almost as if the statue is watching the events unfold. This is an Easter egg to both He Who Remains and Kang's presence in Loki season 2, with both versions of the character having presided over timelines as they watched events take place.\nJust as Marvel Studios properties have delved into the multiverse, so too have Sony's Spider-Verse movies. In the latter franchise, characters are shown to \"glitch\" when they are in a universe different from their own. The visual representation of glitching is incredibly similar to Loki's time-slipping. While a slightly different phenomenon in context, the visual design of Loki's time-slipping was likely an intentional Easter egg to another prominent Marvel multiversal story.\nAs is known from Loki season 1 and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Jonathan Majors will be responsible for bringing Kang the Conqueror's many variants to life. In Loki season 2, episode 1, a neat Easter egg features Majors' first appearance in the season. When slipping into the past, Loki finds a recording of He Who Remains and Ravonna Renslayer from the time of the Multiversal War which provides context to the TVA's history while also providing a fun Easter egg to Majors' overarching MCU role.\nAs Loki, O.B., Mobius, and B-15 make it to the Temporal Loom, the camera zooms in on the door to the TVA's center. Interestingly, the door has an X in the middle on both sides which the camera looms on for a while. This is an Easter egg to the entrance to Cerebro from the X-Men movies with the design for both looking eerily similar, something that is likely no accident given the promising future of mutants in the MCU.\nOne aspect of Loki and other Asgardians that is common knowledge is that they are based on Norse mythology. In Norse myth, it is said that a World Tree known as Yggdrasil holds together the Nine Realms on its branches and that the other realms can be reached through the World Tree. In Loki season 2, the Temporal Loom is introduced as the conduit through which raw time flows to be constructed into a physical timeline.\nAs such, the Temporal Loom provides a similar function to the World Tree. Through physically crafting timelines, the Temporal Loom acts as the TVA's own Yggdrasil by forming and then holding together the different realms or universes. While the Temporal Loom is another interesting addition to the MCU's time-travel story, it also serves as a neat Easter egg to Loki's Norse mythology origins from Marvel Comics.\nOne of the more memed aspects of Loki's character in the MCU is his endless amount of hair flips. In Loki season 2, episode 1, this continues in abundance. After every time slip, Loki dramatically flips his hair over his shoulder. Given the countless time-slips shown in Loki season 2, episode 1, Loki's extra, over-the-top dramatic tendencies continue.\nThe new end-credit sequence of Loki season 2 provides an Easter egg to the state of the overall story. In Loki season 1, it was revealed that He Who Remains essentially constructed the Sacred Timeline to lead Loki and Sylvie to the Citadel at the End of Time. In Loki season 2, episode 1's end credit sequence, someone is shown reconstructing the events of the episode with miniatures and models. This references the central themes of Loki's story which center on the idea of free will against predetermination that will undoubtedly continue in season 2.\nThe post-credit scene of Loki season 2, episode 1 sees Sylvie exiting the Citadel at the End of Time in Broxton, Oklahoma. At first, this may seem like an innocuous location, yet it has deeper comic-book connections. In Marvel Comics, Broxton is where Thor rebuilds Asgard after the events of Ragnarok. While the MCU depicted this differently with New Asgard being situated in Norway, Loki season 2, episode 1's end-credit sequence including Broxton is a neat Easter egg to Marvel Comics.\nNew episodes of Loki release every Thursday at 6pm PT / 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Loki Season 2 Episode 1 Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-06 02:16:08", "text": "Loki season 2 hits the ground running in episode 1 which culminates in a twist-filled ending to set the tone for the God of Mischief’s second outing.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Loki season 2, episode 1.\nLoki season 2 begins almost exactly where the first season left off, with episode 1's ending providing plenty of twists and turns for the beginning of the God of Mischief's second solo MCU outing. In Loki season 2, episode 1, the titular Asgardian is attempting to deal with his new reality: a TVA under the control of Kang the Conqueror. What's more, Loki's former ally - Owen Wilson's Mobius - does not remember him as the lovable rouge begins slipping through time be it the past, present, or future.\nAs such, much of Loki season 2, episode 1 centers on Loki's predicament. Loki discovers that the Mobius who does not remember him is a result of him time-slipping into the past which provides plenty of Loki season 2, episode 1 Easter eggs. The episode is chaotic, to say the least, as the present timeline features Loki, Mobius, and Ke Huy Quan's O.B. finding a way to stop Loki's time-slipping before it is too late as the rest of the TVA deals with the aftermath of He Who Remains' death. With such a confusing, time-travel-oriented plot, here is everything explained about Loki season 2, episode 1's ending.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Episode 1's Post-Credits Scene Is Way Deeper Than You Realize\nThe episode opens exactly where Loki season 1 left off with Loki having time-slipped into the past of the TVA. After escaping the pursuing TVA soldiers, Loki crashes through a building and encounters the past version of Casey who does not remember him. Loki then slips for the first time back into the present as he tries to reunite with Mobius to explain his issue. After slipping between the past and present a few more times in his pursuit of Mobius, Loki finds himself in the War Room of the TVA in the past.\nHere he finds recordings of He Who Remains and Ravonna Renslayer from the Multiversal War and sees the original designs of the former's face adorning the War Room walls. Loki subsequently slips back into the present to finally encounter the versions of Mobius and B-15 that remember him, finally reuniting the cast of characters for Loki season 2. Loki begins explaining the complex situation to everyone present before Mobius opts to take Loki to Ouroborus - or O.B. for short - in an attempt to fix the time-slipping.\nLoki's time-slipping becomes more frequent from this point, often used for humor with his destination not shown until O.B.'s first scene. During this scene, Loki talks to the O.B. of the past while Mobius converses with the O.B. of the present. Eventually, Loki returns to the present until the third act of Loki season 2, episode 1 adds another twist to the tale.\nThe final time slip of the episode sees Loki travel into the TVA's future. Here, everything is in chaos. Loki frantically searches for a Timestick to conduct his part of O.B.'s plan to stop the time-skipping but not before he encounters Sylvie in the future. Sylvie makes it seem as though she has been searching for Loki before an unknown assailant prunes the latter, returning him to the present with Mobius and O.B. before the episode ends.\nConcerning how Loki managed to stop time-slipping, the answer is somewhat convoluted. O.B.'s plan to stop Loki's time-slipping was to have Loki prune himself as a means of stripping all traces of himself from every timeline. To make the plan succeed though, Loki had to prune himself at the same moment as Mobius activated a device called a Temporal Aura Extractor. According to O.B.'s theorizing, these two events happening at the same time would allow Loki to be pulled back into the present to stop him slipping through time.\nBy the time of Loki season 2, episode 1's ending, this plan is thrown into action. Loki slips into the future of the TVA as he frantically searches for a Timestick to prune himself when the time comes. Mobius puts the Temporal Aura Extractor in place, connected to the Temporal Loom - the aspect of the TVA that converts raw time into physical timelines. Eventually, Loki is pruned in the future by an unknown person meaning the Temporal Aura Extractor can pull him into the present, stopping the time-slipping seemingly for good.\nOne of the burning mysteries of Loki season 2, episode 1 was who pruned Loki in the future. As Loki is captivated by Sylvie's sudden appearance, someone prunes him from behind before anything else can be explained leaving both the audience and Loki without answers. Similarly, Loki returns to the present meaning it was not revealed who pruned him. The likely answer is that it was Loki who pruned himself. Loki is now aware that, at some point, a version of himself will appear at that exact point in time needing to be pruned to stop the time-slipping meaning he takes it upon himself to provide this.\nAlongside the question of who pruned Loki in the future, this scene provides many other questions. One of those is what Sylvie is doing in the TVA. As of the ending of Loki season 2, episode 1, the answer to this is unclear. It is likely that these events will be shown from the perspective of Loki and Sylvie as the season goes on given they take place in the future, potentially even in the final episode as the season delves even deeper than its predecessor into complicated time-travel storytelling.\nAnother unanswered question as of Loki season 2, episode 1's ending is who is calling the TVA phone in the future. As Loki sees Sylvie just before being pruned, a phone can be heard ringing in the TVA. The phone receives a lot of attention from both Loki and the camera meaning whoever is on the other end will likely be vital to the series' overarching story yet the identity of this mysterious caller is left frustratingly unclear as of the ending of Loki season 2, episode 1.\nAn interesting element of Loki season 2, episode 1 is that it changes the established time-travel rules of the MCU. In Avengers: Endgame, Hulk stated that it was impossible for someone who had traveled back to the past to change the future. Hulk explained that anything that happens in the past simply causes a brand-new timeline. However, Loki season 2, episode 1 proved different. Loki was directly impacting the events of the present when he time-slipped into the past as evident in his conversation with O.B. This could be because of the different time rules of the TVA yet regardless, it proves the MCU's time-travel rules are changing with Loki season 2.\nOne of the new elements of the MCU multiverse in Loki season 2, episode 1 is the Temporal Loom. O.B. describes the Temporal Loom as the section of the TVA in which raw time is refined to create physical timelines. O.B. also states that the endless branching of the timeline caused by He Who Remains' death is causing the Temporal Loom to overload which is causing Loki's time-slipping and the power surges at the TVA.\nConcerning what this means for the MCU multiverse, the ramifications could be huge. O.B. mentions that he will attempt to retrofit the Temporal Loom to handle the endless expansion of branching timelines. This could mean that the events of Loki season 2 essentially create the multiverse as O.B. figures this out which allows countless timelines to exist together. Regarding how else the Temporal Loom will affect the MCU multiverse, Loki season 2's next five episodes will hopefully reveal more.\nFinally, regarding what General Dox has planned for Sylvie in Loki season 2, episode 1, she simply wants answers. The TVA is in chaos after the death of He Who Remains which causes higher-ups like General Dox to somewhat panic. As a result, Dox states that she needs to know exactly what happened at the End of Time. To do so, Dox begins sending every single available TVA agent after Sylvie to extract an explanation from her, something that will undoubtedly cause trouble going into Loki season 2's future episodes.\nNew episodes of Loki release every Thursday at 6pm PT / 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Is Jonathan Majors' Kang In Loki Season 2?", "date": "2023-10-06 01:56:26", "text": "Audiences might wonder if Jonathan Majors' Kang is in Loki season 2 after He Who Remains and Kang the Conqueror were introduced in the MCU.\nWARNING: This article contains SPOILERS for Loki season 2, episode 1\nAfter he was introduced in season 1 and set up to become the next main villain of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, audiences may be wondering if Jonathan Majors' Kang is in Loki season 2. Majors joined the MCU in the Loki season 1 finale as the Kang variant He Who Remains, a version of Nathaniel Richards who had defeated all others and kept them at bay by creating the sacred timeline. Although Sylvie ended up killing He Who Remains and setting the multiverse loose, Marvel had made it clear that it wouldn't be the last viewers saw of Kang.\nSince then, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania introduced another variant, Kang the Conqueror, who was the main villain to Scott Lang and his family. Though that particular iteration of Kang was defeated by Ant-Man, the Quantumania post-credits scenes established there were innumerable other Kangs from across the multiverse. The second of the scenes also revealed a new version of Majors' Kang would be in Loki season 2, but now that the first episode has aired and he was nowhere to be seen, there might be some confusion over whether the villain will appear.\nAs seen in the Loki season 2 trailer, Majors will reprise his role as Kang variant Victor Timely in the show after appearing in the Quantumania credits scene. Little is known about the MCU's version of Victor Timely, since all that's been revealed is that he's an inventor/scientist of some kind working with time theory. In the Marvel Comics, Victor Timely is a persona adopted by Nathaniel Richards after he time travels from the future to the past.\nA month following the release of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Majors was arrested March 25 in New York City on charges of strangulation, assault and harassment. Although a trial date has not been set as of publication, the allegations against the actor have sparked speculation about his future in the MCU. Marvel Studios hasn't commented on the situation, but Loki executive producer Kevin Wright told Variety that Majors' arrest didn't affect season 2 because filming had wrapped in 2022.\nWright went on to explain there weren't any discussions about changing Majors' role in Loki season 2, saying, \"No. And that mainly came from — I know as much as you do at the moment. It felt hasty to do anything without knowing how all of this plays out.\" Given Wright's comments, it seems Marvel is waiting to see the final verdict of Majors' trial before deciding on his MCU future. Since the season was done before Majors' arrest, the show wasn't affected and Majors is still expected to appear in Loki season 2.\nIt's not known exactly which episode or episodes Majors will appear in during Loki season 2, but now that the premiere has aired, it's confirmed he wasn't in it. It's unlikely Majors' Victor Timely will be saved for the season 2 finale since he appeared in the trailer. After all, He Who Remains was hidden from all the Loki season 1 marketing, and he didn't appear until the finale. Since Victor Timely is shown in the trailers, he'll presumably appear earlier in the season, but exactly which episode of Loki season 2 remains to be seen.\nLoki season 2 continues next Thursday, Oct. 12 at 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "The MCU Just Broke A Time Travel Rule The Avengers Called Unbreakable Only 4 Years Ago", "date": "2023-10-06 01:50:26", "text": "The MCU just broke one of its biggest time travel rules, only four years after it was established as unbreakable by Marvel movie canon.\nWARNING: This Article Contains SPOILERS For Loki Season 2, Episode 1\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe introduced time travel in Avengers: Endgame, but four years later, Loki season 2 has broken one of the major rules established by Marvel Studios' 2019 movie. After Thanos snapped away half the universe in Avengers: Infinity War, Earth's Mightiest Heroes set out to figure out how to travel through time in order to undo the devastation wreaked by the Mad Titan. With the help of Tony Stark's genius and Scott Lang's knowledge of the Quantum Realm, they managed it, and used time travel to gather the Infinity Stones and defeat Thanos.\nEndgame also established a certain number of time travel rules, the biggest of which was that if someone traveled back in time and changed the past, it wouldn't affect the present. As Smart Hulk explains, \"If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future, and your former present becomes the past, which can't now be changed by your new future.\" The scene further established that time travel in movies like Back to the Future and The Terminator are incorrect because their premises are based on the theory that changing the past does, in fact, change the future. However, the Loki season 2 premiere completely breaks this rule in a big way.\nRelated: Loki’s Powers Explained In Full: How Each Ability Is Different\nIn Loki season 2, episode 1, Loki is having trouble time-slipping, which essentially means he's being pulled between the past, present and future at random. This actually comes in handy when he and Mobius visit the TVA's chief engineer Ouroboros, aka OB, for help putting an end to the time-slipping. Loki meets OB in the present, then time-slips to the past, where he has a conversation with the engineer about how to fix his time-slipping problem, leading the past OB to create a Temporal Aura Extractor that will help solve the problem in the present. Since OB is shown remembering the conversation with Loki as it's happening in the past, the audience can deduce that Loki's actions in the past are changing the future.\nThis goes against everything Smart Hulk, and by extension Avengers: Endgame, established in terms of how time travel works in the MCU. If changing the past affected the future, then everything from the Avengers' time heist would've had ripple effects and when they returned to their present, it would've been completely different. Thanos may never have been able to achieve the snap in the first place, and it would've been an anticlimactic ending to the Infinity Saga. However, establishing one set of rules in Endgame and then proceeding to retcon them over and over and over again in Marvel movies and shows since has only led to more confusion. Still, there's an easy way for Marvel to explain Loki breaking Endgame's time travel rules.\nThere's one repeating line in Loki that helps to explain why the God of Mischief was able to change the future by changing the past: Time works differently in the TVA. It's a constant refrain in Loki season 1, and that theme has continued into season 2. If time as a whole works differently, it stands to reason that time travel works differently as well. This would be an easy explanation for Loki being able to break Endgame's rules, because Loki time-slipping breaks even the rules known by the TVA. However, the episode also establishes that the way time works in the TVA is changing, which may be explained by the creation of the multiverse.\nEndgame took place before Sylvie killed He Who Remains, so the MCU was existing within the Sacred Timeline, and any changes to it would've been pruned by the TVA. Hulk's time travel rules may have been true for the Sacred Timeline, due to factors outside his and the audience's knowledge, but now that the multiverse exists, time travel doesn't work in the same way. This explanation would set up the MCU to not have to adhere to the rules established in Endgame, while not actively retconning the movie.\nOf course, it still means that Marvel needs to re-establish what the MCU's time travel rules are and ensure all movies and shows stick to them. Considering the massive multiversal war teased by Loki, and the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania post-credits scene, it's important audiences are clear on how time travel and travel between multiverses works—not just in a single movie or show, but across the entire franchise. Endgame's time travel rules were already confusing and have been made worse because they've been retconned so many times that it's become a running joke, and even Loki season 2 joined in on poking fun.\nWhen Loki, OB and Mobius are having their conversation across time, Mobius realizes that Loki is changing the present by changing the past, and OB says \"there's no flaw in that logic.\" Although the dialogue doesn't call out the Avengers or Endgame by name, it feels like a major diss to the 2019 MCU movie due to how many times Endgame's logic has been called into question. The pithy comment is played as a joke, and considering Endgame established rules directly contrary to the scene, it makes the Avengers movie the butt of the joke.\nThat said, the Loki season 2 premiere likely isn't trying to be maliciously mean to Endgame, especially since the movie is beloved by many and was by far the MCU's most successful film to date. But Endgame's time travel rules have been widely discussed and dissected ever since it released, and even within the movie itself, they don't make much sense. Having Loki rewrite the time travel rules of the MCU, while poking a bit of fun at Endgame, is a good way to show audiences that Marvel knows what they're doing and are trying to fix their mistakes.\nIt also shows that Endgame's time travel issues are incredibly far-reaching and, even four years later, Loki is still working to fix them so the MCU can move forward into its Multiverse Saga. With Loki potentially changing Marvel's time travel rules (again), hopefully future MCU movies and shows will make more sense, especially Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars. While that remains to be seen, we do know Loki was able to break a major time travel rule established in Avengers: Endgame—while poking fun of the Marvel movie in the process.\nLoki season 2 continues next Thursday, Oct. 12 at 9pm ET on Disney+.\nWant more Loki content?

{"title": "Loki Season 2 Episode 1's Post-Credits Scene Is Way Deeper Than You Realize", "date": "2023-10-06 01:45:25", "text": "Loki season 2's first post-credits scene is big on nostalgia, but the real meaning is probably deeper than you realize at first.\nWARNING: This Article Contains MAJOR SPOILERS For Loki Season 2, Episode 1In the grand tradition of most Marvel Cinematic Universe releases, Loki season 2 episode 1 has a post-credits scene. Following directly on from the daring mission to pull Tom Hiddleston's Loki out of the timeline and stop his time-slipping, the first Loki season 2 stinger is also an important one.\nLoki season 2 has already started off strongly, with a complicated storyline injected with a lot of scientific jargon (not least from Ke Huy Quan’s Ouroboros). It’s also very obvious that the show is less interested in tying to wider MCU timeline events, and focusing instead on the continued battle for the Sacred Timeline set up by Loki season 1’s ending. But that doesn’t mean all MCU traits are out the window, with the post-credits scene offering that element of familiarity.\nWatch Loki On Disney+\nAfter the credits role on Loki season 2 episode 1’s ending and Loki has avoided being spaghettified or lost in time, the post-credits scene flips back to Sophia Di Martino’s Sylvie in the immediate aftermath of He Who Remain's death. Sylvie transports herself to 1982, enters a McDonalds (perfectly rebuilt from the early 1980s designs, including the freakish cartoon tree), speaks to the young manager and orders one of everything on the menu. Quite how she pays for all of those burgers, fries and nuggets is anyone's guess, but since the marketing has spoiled that Sylvie ends up working at the same McDonalds, maybe she's forced initially to do so to pay off the fast food debt. Or she uses magic.\nRelated: How Powerful Each Loki Variant Really Is (& Who Is The Strongest)\nAs confirmed by the Loki season 2 episode 1 post-credits scene, Sylvie didn't stay in the Citadel at the End of Time after killing Jonathan Majors' He Who Remains in season 1's finale. Having completed her mission, she did exactly as Thanos did, seeking her own personal peace, by leaving and jumping somewhere else in the timeline. Sylvie's outfit all but confirms that the McDonalds scene happens immediately after He Who Remains' death.\nThe question most will have watching the Loki season 2 episode 1 post-credits scene is why McDonalds and why 1982. For the first answer, you have to consider Sylvie's tragic origin story. As she reveals in Loki's Lamentis episode, the TVA attempted to prune her when she was roughly ten years old in human terms (but a lot older as a Frost Giant). She flees and spends the rest of her life on the run, which, judging by the life-span of Frost Giants (at least around 5000 years), would mean she'd probably been on the run for thousands of years. 1982 doesn't appear to have any major significance in Loki itself, but it's interesting to note that Zaniac debuted in Thor #319 in 1982 ahead of his later importance in Loki season 2.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Episode 1 Recap: 12 Biggest Reveals\nMore importantly, it's what the year means to McDonalds that brings Sylvie to 1982, as revealed by producer Kevin Wright in an interview with Fast Company. The more colorful design of 1980s McDonalds, which was supposed to appeal to families, clearly worked on Sylvie: “When we stayed in the view of character, this woman who went on the run as a child, had been running through time, a fugitive of time, living in apocalypses, never being able to relax or slow down, the novelty of walking into a 1980s McDonald’s looked appealing.”\nShe never got her chance of her truly formative years, which would have included simple pleasures like the Asgardian equivalent of McDonalds. Sylvie seems drawn to McDonalds because of the same wonder that made the fast food giants so popular with children. It's a simple, almost naive pleasure, completely in contrast with Sylvie's life of fight and flight. Sylvie has also never been able to enjoy anything, constantly looking over her shoulder and having to move everywhere to keep ahead of the TVA. Being able to go somewhere as innocuous as McDonalds and not be worried about how conspicuous she is in her Asgardian outfit, which she noticeably doesn't disguise, is a huge indication that she believes she's beaten the TVA. Wright's comments further reflect that:\n\"You play a Little League game and go to McDonald’s. You go to a kid’s birthday party at McDonald’s. Someone like Sylvie would never have experienced that, and would be really taken by that... I was worried that McDonald’s would think we wanted to do something ironic or make fun of them. But we were selling an earnest story, a love letter to nostalgia through a character’s eyes who will see all of the novelty and joy of it.”\nRelated: How Old Is Sylvie Compared To Loki?\nSylvie's choice of the small town of Broxton, Oklahoma for her new home may not seem to have any significance in Loki's TV show lore, but it is an important site in Marvel Comics, which suggests it may be some sort of nexus location in wider Marvel lore. In the comics, Thor purchases land just outside of Broxton (paying with a truck load of gold), to rebuild Asgard in the wake of Ragnarok. That story run, with Asgard's new location outside Broxton, was where Lady Loki first debuted in the comics after the God Of Mischief stole Sif's body.\nObviously, in the MCU, Thor and Valkyrie rebuilt Asgard in Norway, but the new Asgard was in America on the page, setting up the events of Siege, which took place around Broxton. In that event, Norman Osborn seeks to invade Asgard, under the pretense of a threat to the United States, but really as a means to strengthen his own power. Loki actually plays a key role in that Siege, convincing Osborn to orchestrate a tragedy at Soldier Field football stadium, where thousands of civilians are killed during a battle between Volstagg and villains working for Osborn, as he and Loki watch on.\nOther notable events in Broxton include it being the site of the death of Cul Borson (AKA Serpent), as well as a war between the Asgardians and Galactus, and finally, its destruction by the God Of Hammers, which killed its residents, as a means to draw Thor's anger. Sylvie heading there in Loki's season 2 episode 1 post-credits scene doesn't tie to those events - though it could similarly endanger the town and its people - but it fits a rich Marvel history.\nLoki season 2 episode 1 suggests that Loki time slips because Sylvie kicks him back into the past from the Citadel at the End of Time before she kills He Who Remains. Because he was previously pruned - i.e. removed from the timeline - his presence back on the timeline causes a glitch, sending him randomly slipping through time without warning. By the same logic, Sylvie too should time-slip when she heads back to 1982: OB explicitly reveals that Loki is \"un-synced\" from time, which can only have happened when he was pruned. The fact that Sylvie also pruned herself makes this a plot hole that Loki will have to resolve in the future.\nLoki season 2 continues next Thursday, Oct. 12 at 9pm ET on Disney+.\nWant more Loki content?

{"title": "Suits Beats Netflix Original Mega Hit To Claim Longest Streaming Run Record", "date": "2023-10-06 01:32:17", "text": "Suits' relentless streaming dominance continues after breaking another streaming record it once tied for alongside a hit Netflix Original.\nContinuing its record-breaking streaming trend, the 2011 legal drama Suits has officially smashed another record in Nielsen’s viewership rankings, overtaking yet another massive Netflix original. First climbing back into widespread public consciousness when the hit drama began dominating streaming charts four years after it ended, Suits would eventually overtake Netflix’s hit show Wednesday for weekly viewership minutes. More recently, it also tied with Netflix’s Ozark for spending the longest time atop Nielsen’s Top 10 Overall Charts.\nPer The Hollywood Reporter, Suits can now officially add this new record to its ever-growing list of accolades, as finally overtook Ozark’s 11-week record thanks to the legal drama’s 12 consecutive weeks in the top slot. Making the feat even more impressive, Suits achieved its record in a single continuous streak, while Ozark had previously held its title spread across multiple season releases.\nWhile Suits’ original 2011 release was a success for USA Network, earning favorable reviews and strong viewership numbers, the show’s popularity gradually waned following the departure of key cast members such as Meghan Markle and Patrick J. Adams. Nonetheless, the show’s recent resurgence on streaming reveals the enduring appeal of its quick wit and largely formula-driven narratives. However, the timing of Suits' continued record-breaking streak on streaming television coincides perfectly with many important conversations currently taking place about streaming services and the equity of continuing residuals paid to actors and creatives.\nEarlier this year, Suits writer Ethan Drogin admitted that while he was elated to see the show’s resurgence on Netflix and Peacock, he had earned less than $300 in streaming residuals despite its overwhelming success. While the Writers Guild of America has recently come to an agreement with streaming services, which includes a dramatic new performance-based pay bonus structure for writers, members of SAG-AFTRA are still currently waiting to see the outcome of their own ongoing strike action.\nWhile Suits’ recent resurgence in popularity may have no direct connection to the wave of industrial action sweeping through Hollywood, its timing perfectly demonstrated many of the growing inequities that industry guilds were attempting to challenge. Perhaps once the recent public interest in Suits begins to die down, the show’s enduring legacy will come to mean much more than its growing collection of streaming records. Instead, its unlikely resurgence may have also potentially done much to help shine a light on important industry concerns and bring them out into the open.\nSource: THR\n"}

Frank Herbert's seminal 1965 sci-fi novel has been adapted to the screen several times starting with David Lynch's Dune from 1984, which was a critical and commercial failure and was disowned by the director due to studio interference. In 2000, a three-part miniseries officially titled Frank Herbert's Dune aired on the Sci-Fi Channel. Villeneuve's Dune, with the first film released in 2021, has become the definitive adaptation due to its critical and commercial success.\nAhead of the Dune: Part Two release date in March 2024, the Dune miniseries director spoke to ComicBook.com and shared his praise for Villeneuve's movies. Harrison, who wrote and directed the Dune miniseries, says he is \"very excited\" about what Villeneuve is doing with the story and hopes it will introduce newcomers to his previous adaptation. Read what he shared below:\nI'm very excited about it. Richard Rubenstein and I were still involved in the development of several attempts to try and get it off the ground after my miniseries. And maybe fortunately, some of those never came to pass because I think what Denis Villeneuve has done is just fantastic. And I love him as a director. I wasn't involved at all in the latest movies except to have my name put up there. But I think it's just fantastic and I'm really looking forward to the new ones.\nAnd I hope it does introduce a whole new audience to the Dune world. If they are able to get back and see my miniseries, I'm very proud of them. We were able to ... I think the success of them, they won a couple of Emmys and they were hugely successful here and abroad. I think they gave people faith that Dune actually could be adapted again.\nThe Dune miniseries was generally well-received by critics and audiences. At the time, it was considered a vast improvement over Lynch's Dune, which tried to cram the entire story, including all its intricate mythology and sprawling scope, into a single 2-hour 17-minute movie. However, it's worth mentioning that Lynch's preferred cut was three hours. Nevertheless, the Dune miniseries functioned better as an adaptation with a total runtime of 265 minutes. Today, the Dune miniseries still stands among the highest-rated programs ever broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel. As Harrison mentions, it also won two Emmys for Outstanding Cinematography and Visual Effects.\nBy breaking the book up into two parts, Villeneuve's movies adopted a similar approach as the miniseries, which is probably why Harrison appreciates them so much. Similarly, Villeneuve's Dune won several Oscars for its technical accomplishments, including cinematography, visual effects, production design, and sound. Villeneuve and Harrison's Dune adaptations actually have much in common, so it's possible the movies could bring new viewers to the miniseries, as the director hopes. However, one should temper their expectations considering the miniseries is now over 20 years old and was made on a fraction of the budget for $20 million.\nSource: ComicBook.com\n"}

{"title": "Who Is OB aka Ouroborus In Loki? Marvel Comics History & MCU Changes", "date": "2023-10-06 01:00:27", "text": "Academy Award winner Ke Huy Quan will be joining the cast of Loki season 2 as a new MCU character, with an interesting origin in Norse Mythology.\nWarning: This post contains SPOILERS for Loki season 2\nPhase 5's Loki season 2 sees the addition of an exciting new character known as Ouroboros to the MCU. The second season of Tom Hiddleston's solo Disney+ series was announced on July 14, 2021, during Loki's season 1 finale, and is set to follow on from the events of the first season, which saw the eponymous God of Mischief exploring the Time Variance Authority (TVA), dealing with multiversal variants of himself, and coming face-to-face with Jonathan Majors' He Who Remains, a variant of Kang the Conqueror. The post-credits scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania teased the storyline for the next season of the MCU show, especially by teasing one of the new characters in the Loki season 2 cast.\nLoki's season 1 finale ended with Sylvie, played brilliantly be Sophia Di Martino, killing He Who Remains, which created thousands of branching timelines, and trapping Loki in a very different version of the TVA, ruled over by Kang the Conqueror himself rather than the fictitious Time Keepers. While Loki season 2 is set to introduce Victor Timely, another Kang variant, to the franchise, the MCU will also be blessed with the debut of Ke Huy Quan, fresh off a win for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards for his role in Everything Everywhere All At Once.\nRelated: Loki Season 1 Ending & Future Set-Up Explained\nKe Huy Quan assumes the role of Ouroboros in Loki season 2, confirming the rumors before the show's release that this would be his character. Quan is a brilliant addition to the MCU, having been featured as Short Round in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom when he was only twelve, and appearing as inventor Richard \"Data\" Wang a year later in The Goonies. After taking a lengthy break from acting, Quan returned as Waymond Wang in Everything Everywhere All At Once opposite Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, and Jamie Lee Curtis.\nKe Huy Quan's Ouroboros is revealed to be the chief engineer of the TVA - and, in fact, their only engineer. As such, he's responsible for the upkeep and repair of all of the faction's tools, including their time travel devices, which gives him some complicated tech to take care of. Luckily, OB is both shown to be an outright genius, and committed to his work, as the first episode of Loki season 2 sees him spend 400 years toiling away without a single visitor - until Loki himself appears.\nThere are a few different representations of Ouroboros in the pages of Marvel Comics. The Oculus Oroboros is introduced as a conduit of elemental magic, that depicts a variation on the classic ouroboros shape of a snake eating its tail by featuring a second snake. Doctor Doom once attempted to harness the power of the Oculus Oroboros, though was stopped by Doctor Strange. There is also an Admiral Ouroboros, who appeared in 2015's Silver Surfer Vol. 7 #11, depicted as an antagonistic character who comes face-to-face with the Silver Surfer after the latter becomes trapped in a time loop, reminiscent of Groundhog Day or Palm Springs.\nIt's unclear whether these idea will translate into Loki season 2, though the TVA's time-twisting technology has already been shown to trap individuals in time loops, as Loki was berated by Lady Sif over and over again as punishment. Interestingly, the time loop that the Silver Surfer finds himself in is referred to as a Möbius strip - Owen Wilson's Loki character is named Mobius M. Mobius, and Tony Stark utilized an inverted Möbius strip to crack time travel in Avengers: Endgame. It's possible that this time loop theme could play a major role in Loki season 2, but the name Ouroboros could also suggest a deeper connection to Loki himself.\nThe shape of an ouroboros is depicted as a snake forming a circle, with the end of its tail in its mouth. This image has roots in Ancient Egyptian and Ancient Greek iconography, but also has a deep connection to Norse Mythology, on which most of Thor and Loki's MCU storylines are based. In Norse Mythology, the ouroboros is formed by Jörmungandr, otherwise known as the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent, an unfathomably large snake-like creature that resides in the world sea, and is large enough to encircle the entire Earth and bite its own tail. Legend notes that when Jörmungandr releases its tail, the catastrophic Ragnarök event will occur.\nWhat deepens the mystery, however, is the fact that the Midgard Serpent is actually one of Loki's own children in Norse Mythology, along with Hel, the Goddess of Death, and the wolf Fenrir, both of whom were adapted for Thor: Ragnarok, though Cate Blanchett's Hela was Loki's sister in the MCU. In Norse Mythology, Thor often has run-ins with Jörmungandr, engaging in epic battles with the serpent, even fighting to the death during Ragnarök. It's unclear how much of this will be adapted by Ke Huy Quan in Loki season 2, but it could even point to a deeper link between Quan's character and the God of Mischief himself.\nNew episodes of Loki season 2 release every Thursday on Disney+\n"}
{"title": "The Exorcist: Believer Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-06 00:51:10", "text": "The Exorcist: Believer builds to a final exorcism to deliver an ending with twists and sequel setup. Here's everything that happens and what it means.\nWarning: Contains SPOILERS for The Exorcist: Believer!\nThe Exorcist: Believer's ending revolves around a final exorcism to save Katherine and Angela's lives, and the event includes major revelations, death, and set up for a new trilogy of movies. Picking up almost 50 years after the original The Exorcist's story, the sequel shifts the franchise's focus to new families whose lives are changed when their daughters become possessed by demons. This brings Victor (Leslie Odom Jr.) to find Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) in the hope that she'll help the two families save the young girls. Ultimately, the fate of the girls is put in the hands of their parents and various spiritual leaders.\nIt is no surprise that The Exorcist: Believer builds to a final exorcism that puts the fates of Katherine (Olivia O'Neill) and Angela (Lidya Jewett) in the balance. This comes after Angela is confined to a mental institution while Katherine's parents attempt to help her at home. Chris is absent from the final exorcism after being stabbed in the eyes by Katherine, but she encourages Victor to recruit different people from all types of backgrounds and religious beliefs to help perform the final exorcism. The entire story wraps up rather neatly as there is no The Exorcist: Believer post-credits scene, but the final revelations still leave room for sequels.\nThe final exorcism in The Exorcist: Believer takes place at Victor's house. Katherine and Angela are both brought to the location after it is fitted for an exorcism. Victor is joined by Katherine's parents, the pastor at Katherine's church, Victor's nurse neighbor who previously wanted to be a nun, a local root doctor, and another one of Victor's neighbors who believes in God. The plan immediately goes awry when the Catholic priest tells them he cannot lead the exorcism as promised, but he passes leadership to the nurse, Ann (Ann Dowd).\nThe initial attempts to get the demon out of the girls are unsuccessful, as they mock Ann for her past, but the root doctor helps turn the night around. This leads to the demon revealing an impossible choice has to be made among the people in attendance; they must choose which girl lives and which one dies. The demon states that only one of them will survive, which connects to a deadly decision from Victor's past. While Victor and Katherine's mom Miranda (Jennifer Nettles) agree that they cannot and will not make that choice, Katherine's dad Tony (Norbert Leo Butz) panics and tells the demon he chooses Katherine to live.\nRelated: When Will The Exorcist: Believer Release On Streaming?\nIt initially appears as if Tony's decision is accepted by the demon, as Angela begins to float in the air before collapsing on the ground with no heartbeat and Katherine begins talking and looking like normal. However, this is where the demon's deceitful nature comes into play, as Angela begins to breathe again but Katherine dies. While attempts are made to save Katherine's life, she is taken away from the world of living. The death choice made by Tony in The Exorcist: Believer mirrors the one Victor made in his past, where who is chosen to live actually dies.\nOne of the big revelations in how The Exorcist: Believer ends goes back to the movie's opening sequence which results in the death of Victor's wife. An earthquake in Haiti leaves his pregnant wife with severe injuries, and Victor is told that he must make a difficult decision to choose between keeping his wife or unborn baby girl alive. His wife's wish was for him to protect the child at all costs, and the fact that Angela is alive after the 13-year time jump indicates that he followed through.\nIt is only during the exorcism that the demon reveals to everyone that Victor actually chose to save his wife instead of Angela, but the baby survived the operation instead. The revelation that Victor chose his wife over Angela recontextualizes much of their relationship. This is not something that Angela knew on her own, but it does explain why Victor is so protective and watchful over her now. The Exorcist: Believer's scary focus means there is no time for Victor and Angela to talk about the revelation after she gets better, but it would not be surprising if this puts a strain on their relationship going forward if she remembers.\nAngela surviving the exorcism leaves her with a clear fate as she returns to school, but where Katherine ends up in The Exorcist: Believer is more tragic. The movie indicates that she is pulled to Hell after her death. Katherine is shown in the woods again before she begins to be pulled underwater by many hands. This appears to be a visual representation of Katherine being taken to Hell by demons after she is tricked into being the sacrifice. It is unclear if The Exorcist: Believer is the last the franchise will show of Katherine or if her experience in Hell will factor into the sequel somehow.\nThe biggest surprise of the movie's ending is Linda Blair's return as Regan in The Exorcist: Believer. The movie makes multiple references to what happened to Regan after The Exorcist, but she is not an active part of the story. Her fate is instead left as a lingering mystery for most of the runtime. Thankfully, The Exorcist: Believer confirms Regan is alive and well by bringing Linda Blair back for a quick cameo. Regan is shown reuniting with Chris in the hospital during one of the final scenes. The appearance is an indication that viewers could see much more of Regan in The Exorcist: Deceiver.\nOne story point in The Exorcist: Believer that could create some confusion is the identity of the main demon that possesses Katherine and Angela. It is never named, but there are references made that the demon knows Chris and that she's encountered this spiritual being before. Despite the implication that The Exorcist: Believer's demon is Pazuzu, it has been confirmed that this is not the case. Director David Gordon Green revealed as much during interviews pre-release (via IGN), noting that the sequel has a new demon. However, he refuses to confirm the identity of the new demon, and The Exorcist: Believer does not confirm it either.\nThe fact that Angela's life is saved in The Exorcist: Believer might also have more to it than meets the eye. During the final moments, flashes of the blessing of protection Angela's mom gets while she is still pregnant are shown. This could mean that the blessing is actually what saved Angela's life, making the parallels to Victor's death choice before a coincidence. This would mean that the blessing is strong enough to prevent the demon from killing Angela but still allows her to be possessed. Ultimately, it is up to each viewer to decide which reading they want to believe.\nConsidering Universal announced The Exorcist: Believer as the start of a new trilogy, it is no surprise that the ending leaves the door open for its sequel. The follow-up is confirmed to be called The Exorcist: Deceiver, which indicates that there is more to what audiences witness here. The pastor specifically calls the demon a deceiver after the initial proposal of the death choice, so that could be a sign that Katherine and Angela's fates are not quite as sealed as believed. In any case, there is no doubt that the demon will return in some form, possibly pulling on the grief Katherine's parents struggle with.\nThe Exorcist: Deceiver's story is also sure to build on Chris and Regan's reunion too. The decision to bring Linda Blair back for a quick scene is certainly meant to get audiences excited to have her and Ellen Burstyn play bigger roles in the sequel. Both actresses had plenty of input on The Exorcist: Believer, and while their roles in the sequel are not yet officially confirmed, the intention is rather clear. The question then becomes if The Exorcist: Deceiver will fully shift the franchise's focus back to the MacNeil family or if Victor, Angela, and others will remain prominently featured.\nThe meaning of The Exorcist: Believer's ending is one of hope and belief. Despite it being a horror movie about the demonic possession of two young girls that features brutal deaths, The Exorcist: Believer leaves audiences with a message that believing in the good, and even God, is what everyone needs. It is seemingly only after Victor believes that the exorcism can work and reconnects with his daughter through his wife's scarf that his attitude and her fate begin to change. If there is any doubt about The Exorcist: Believer's true meaning of hope and belief, the final voice-over monologue provided by Ann Dowd makes it clear.\nSource: IGN\n"}

Known by millions for his sensational skills on the soccer field, David Beckham, along with his equally famous wife Victoria, has been in the spotlight for decades both on and off the pitch. Beckham rose to prominence as a loyal member of Manchester United, one of the greatest professional soccer clubs in the history of the Premier League. He started dating Victoria Adams in 1997 following her success as a singer in the popular Spice Girls group.\nBeckham aims to shine a light on David and Victoria's lesser-known qualities while revealing several new details on their careers and relationship history in the process. While everybody now recognizes the name Beckham, the documentary provides previously inaccessible coverage of the intricacies of what it's actually like to be David Beckham. The Netflix doc also chronicles David's humble beginnings and the internal battles that the superstar faced through the most intense and demanding parts of his celebrated career. David retired from soccer in 2013, fourteen years after marrying Victoria. Here are the ten biggest reveals from the four-partNetflix miniseries Beckham.\nRELATED: Untold Johnny Football – 10 Biggest Reveals About Manziel's Rise & Fall In Netflix's Documentary\nBeckham's first episode opens up with scenes of David Beckham tending to his bee farm fulling clothed in beekeeper's attire. He collects honey very naturally and hands some over to director Fisher Stevens, who is just as impressed as the viewing audience likely is. Outside of soccer, which Beckham has not played professionally in over ten years, beekeeping is just one of David's many hobbies that he enjoys regularly. Another favorite pastime of David's is to collect and assemble Legos. He unsurprisingly also loves to shop and invest in luxury items such as designer watches.\nBefore one of the most infamous games in David Beckham's career, Victoria revealed in Beckham that she told David that she was pregnant with their firstborn and eldest son Brooklyn. Victoria called David to tell him the news while he was in France awaiting a hotly contested matchup with the powerful Argentinian National team while she was in Brooklyn, New York, which inspired the name choice. Victoria reveals that while she and David were both incredibly happy about the news, she did not think much about how it would affect David going into one of the biggest games of his life.\nBefore David ever met Victoria in real life, he pointed her Spice Girls persona out on TV one day and announced that he was going to marry her. Beckham recalls being with former teammate Gary Neville and stating that he would marry \"the posh one\" in the future. Gary, of course, thought he was joking and started to laugh at David's earnestness. David soon proved to be incredibly serious about Victoria, who he knew nothing about at the time. By some magic, David turned out to be spot-on with his fortune-telling and he and Victoria have been together ever since.\nRELATED: 10 Biggest Reveals About Jason & Travis In Amazon's Kelce Documentary\nDavid and Victoria's marriage fell into very hot water when allegations surfaced about David's alleged infidelity with a former assistant of his by the name of Rebecca Loos. Loos came forward to the press that she and David had an affair that lasted four months when he first traveled to play in Spain for Real Madrid. David has always denied the allegations and Victoria has supported him, although both admit that it was the hardest part of their marriage by far. David recalls in the Beckham documentary that he is grateful that he and Victoria were able to come out of the difficult situation with their marriage intact.\nAfter the notorious incident in which David Beckham was ejected from the 1988 World Cup game against Argentina, he revealed that he was depressed after all of the public and media hate he received as a result. David recalls feeling hated by the entire country of England and not knowing how to handle all of the relentless public ridicule. Every time David would go anywhere in public, people would spit and cuss him out with fierce and intense hatred which left David feeling incredibly broken. David claims in Beckham that he was never quite the same after experiencing such public backlash on a national scale.\nDavid reveals in Beckham that he had a terrible spending habit when he first came into wealth. David is currently worth roughly $450 million so his early spending days did not do much to set him back financially. Beckham reveals that David's first paychecks that he revived on a Friday were typically gone by the following Saturday. He loved to spend his money on luxurious items, clothes, and even a brand-new BMW M3 from an Adidas endorsement deal. Considering Beckham's humble beginnings, it's hard to blame Beckham for indulging in the finer things.\nRELATED: Untold Hall Of Shame: The BALCO Drug Scandal & What Happened To Major Athletes After Investigation\nDavid's former soccer coach Sir Alex Ferguson expressed disapproval that David was starting to date Victoria Adams when he was still just a young player on Manchester United. Ferguson believed that dating a celebrity might steer David off the right path of becoming the world-class soccer player he could be. He instructed David not to take any photos together with Victoria in order to maintain their privacy. David obeyed and initially dated Victoria in secret, meeting in places like parks and avoiding the lurking eye of the paparazzi.\nDavid reveals that he charged his former Manchester United coach Alex Ferguson after the manager kicked a cleat at David, hitting him just above the eye. What was later revealed to be a freak accident and completely unintentional, an angry Ferguson kicked the soccer cleat at David which resulted in him apparently getting stitches. The following season, David was traded to Real Madrid, which was when his life began to spiral out of his control. He reveals in Beckham he never got to properly say goodbye to Ferguson.\nOne of the most unsettling revelations in Beckham is the horrific truth that David and Victoria received random threats that their newborn son Brooklyn would be kidnapped. These threats arose due to the lingering public hatred towards David after he was sent off in the 1998 World Cup. David recalls being afraid to leave the hospital in Beckham, sleeping up against the hospital room door where Victoria was staying. The couple recalls how they were somewhat robbed of the joy of their first newborn because of the intense paranoia circling around Daviid and the angry public.\nA lighthearted moment in Beckham arrives when Victoria recalls the instance in which David nearly missed the birth of his third son Cruz because he was tied up at a photo shoot with Jennifer Lopez. While the couple can laugh about it now in the Netflix documentary Beckham, David had cut it a little too close for Victoria to feel comfortable that he would be at the hospital with her when Cruz was born. In David's defense, he asked his wife what Posh would do, which ended up being one of the funniest moments in the four-part miniseries.\n"}

{"title": "John Wick's Perfect Replacement Hero Debuted 2 Years Ago In This Action Movie Hidden Gem", "date": "2023-10-06 00:00:26", "text": "The future of the John Wick franchise feels increasingly unclear, but the perfect action movie replacement already hit theaters two years ago. \nJohn Wick is one of the most iconic action franchises out there, but even if John Wick: Part 5 happens, the future of the Lionsgate movies is uncertain — and there's one existing action hero who could replace Keanu Reeves' if it comes to it. Reeves made his debut as the assassin John Wick in 2014, winning the hearts of critics and general audiences alike. The success of the first John Wick movie spawned multiple sequels, as well as the less-loved TV series The Continental. John Wick: Part 4 could have served as a definitive ending for the film series, but it seems like Lionsgate isn't ready to let go yet.\nDespite John Wick 4's ending, John Wick 5 is starting to seem increasingly more likely. Additionally, the John Wick universe is expanding with spinoffs like The Continental. It's very possible the series will continue, even if it changes drastically. However, given recent developments, it's just as likely to conclude sometime in the near future. Either way, the perfect replacement for the John Wick franchise already exists; the hidden gem actually released in movie theaters two years ago.\nJohn Wick may have a hold on the action genre, but one 2021 movie has the potential to become its replacement: Nobody. Starring Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul alum Bob Odenkirk, Nobody debuted to stellar reviews, receiving an 84% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes and a whopping 94% from audiences. Nobody also fared well at the box office considering the circumstances — it released as the industry was still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic — and it's easy to see why audiences enjoyed Odenkirk's first outing as an action hero.\nNobody follows Odenkirk's Hutch Mansell, a former assassin whose deadly skills are reawakened when his home in the suburbs is broken into. The incident leads to a number of revelations, with Hutch's family eventually finding themselves in the midst of all the danger. Odenkirk gives a compelling performance as the movie's lead, and he could easily hold his own if Nobody were to become a full-fledged action franchise. Although the first movie didn't add anything particularly groundbreaking to the genre, it served as a promising and action-packed beginning to a story that could take over when the John Wick craze fades.\nAlthough John Wick doesn't need a replacement just yet, the franchise's future is feeling less certain. There are a few reasons for that, but the most obvious goes back to John Wick 4's ending. The most recent installment of the series concluded with Reeves' titular hero supposedly perishing during a face-off with Donnie Yen's Caine. It's possible the Baba Yaga faked his own death. However, if Reeves' character truly is gone, it'll be difficult for John Wick: Part 5 to keep the franchise going. The lead character — and the actor who plays him — is the main draw, so it's hard to see the series faring nearly as well without him.\nAnd while John Wick's franchise future could lean into spinoffs, prequels, and sequels, that approach may not be as promising as it once seemed. After all, The Continental attempted to explore the world of John Wick from a different perspective, but the 2023 series didn't capture the heart of the films. The Continental reviews are so much worse than the John Wick movies, suggesting that a future without the title character isn't so bright. With that in mind, the world may soon be in need of a new action hero.\nIf Nobody hopes to compete with — or even replace — John Wick, it will need to return with an equally compelling sequel. Fortunately, Nobody 2 is already in the works. Nobody 2 producer Kelly McCormick told Collider that, if everything goes as planned, production on the sequel should begin sometime in 2024. Writer David Leitch has been working on the script, and Odenkirk seems confident and eager to return.\nThe ending and post-credits scene of Nobody certainly leaves the door open for another go-round. Hutch hasn't addressed his inner conflict fully by the time Nobody comes to a close, and the character will need more screen time to make the decision the story is building to: should he forego his life as an assassin for his family or try to embrace both personas? This is an internal struggle that sets Nobody apart from John Wick, and it could become the action genre's next big focus.\nSource: Rotten Tomatoes, Collider\nAmanda Mullen is an entertainment writer with a passion for all things books, films, and television.

{"title": "New Stephen King Horror Movie Continues 36-Year Failure, Confirming Harsh Reality For Spinoffs", "date": "2023-10-06 00:00:26", "text": "Not even Stephen King's new horror movie can break free from a decades-long failure. Here's why not even the King of Horror can save it. \nStephen King's new horror movie Pet Sematary: Bloodline is continuing a decades-long failure that not even the King of Horror can avoid, and its performance at the box office is confirming a harsh reality for spinoffs of his original works. There have been plenty of Stephen King movie and TV remakes that have been done well, but when it comes to derivative projects, they don't seem to succeed as well. Not even following the intriguing character of Jud Crandall, and finding out the origins of the mystical burial ground introduced in the first Pet Sematary can make the film shine.\nEven working with a foundation rooted in King's works, sequels to his stories don't seem to draw nearly the sort of audience that material from his own imagination does. Beginning with A Return To Salem's Lot in 1987 and continuing with Pet Sematary 2 in 1992, movies that continue the world created in classic King novels never seem to find their footing with even his most ardent fans. In the shadow of their predecessors, a lot of pressure rides on their successfully recreating what made the originals so good, and based on everything we know about Pet Sematary: Bloodline, it's trying to tell its own story.\nDespite having an intriguing premise and promising to answer a plot hole that's plagued fans of Pet Sematary for 40 years, even Pet Sematary: Bloodline continues a negative trend of movies that are derivative of King's original books and stories. It follows Jud and his first encounter with the burial ground, something he explains many decades later to Louis Creed as he mourns the death of his family's cat and wonders how to return the smile to his young daughter's face. Jud encourages using the burial ground's power despite it being a \"curdled place\" because he wants to teach the girl that \"sometimes dead is better.\"\n Besides the odd choice to violate the natural order of things in order to enforce morals on someone else's child, fans have always wondered why Jud told Louis about the burial ground if he knew the consequences of burying anything there, and the film doesn't really answer that question, though it has many of the same thrills and chills of the original film. Lindsey Anderson Beer’s film only makes Jud's actions later seem more erratic than ever, and the low success of Pet Sematary: Bloodlines indicates that spinoffs and prequels only work when King himself is behind the story.\nDisregarding It: Chapter Two, which is simply the second part of one (albeit giant) Stephen King book, Doctor Sleep seems to be the only Stephen King movie sequel that has worked. Starring Ewan McGregor as an adult Danny Torrance, it centers on him healing from his traumatic experiences at the Overlook Hotel, exploring the supernatural power known as \"the shining\" introduced in King's novel by the same name, and Danny's relationship with a young teen who shines the same way that he does, and whose light has attracted more malevolent entities.\nOne of the main reasons why the movie works so well, aside from McGregor's magnetic performance and its truly immersive horror experience, is the fact that King had written the sequel it was based on. This helped create a solid foundation for its story, and it's no wonder why the movie clocks in at nearly three hours - the screenplay left none of King's world-building out the way Stanley Kubrick's The Shining did. Pet Sematary: Bloodline largely tries to do its own thing and flounders the most when it tries to sync up with King's book, ultimately failing because it doesn't answer any of the questions a prequel origin story should.\n"}
{"title": "DC Admits Jason Momoa Would Nail a Major Upcoming MCU Role", "date": "2023-10-06 00:00:26", "text": "DC pokes playful fun at the casting rumors surrounding Jason Momoa — including the possibility that he could play one major upcoming MCU role.\nWarning! Contains spoilers for DC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1!\nWith DC currently gearing up for a new cinematic universe, plenty of casting rumors are spinning — including the fate of the DCEU's Aquaman, Jason Momoa, who is often fancast as DC's Main Man, Lobo. In a new short story for Halloween, Lobo's daughter Crush points out his perfect MCU counterpart as well: Wolverine.\nThis surprising comparison takes place in the story \"Happy Hal(Lobo)ween!\" by Hans Rodionoff, Adam F. Goldberg, Danny Earls, Patricio Delpeche, and Dave Sharpe from DC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1. Lobo crashes his daughter's apartment to force her to help him come up with the perfect Halloween costume. This involves Crush trying to point Lobo towards Hugh Jackman's famous portrayal of Wolverine, but, due to legal issues, she can't outright say this.\nThis leads Lobo to dress up as a litany of Hugh Jackman characters, but never the iconic X-Men character. Finally, exhausted by her father, Crush suggests she dress up as the other superhero that Lobo bears a striking resemblance to: Aquaman.\nRelated: DC's Answer to Wolverine Gets Even More Savage With New Zombie Form\nLobo is one of the more extreme characters from the '80s and '90s, and a lot of fans believe that Lobo was DC's answer to Marvel's Wolverine. Lobo is an absolutely absurd satire of both over-the-top masculinity and action heroes in general. He's a wise-cracking bounty hunter who perpetually has a lit cigar in his mouth, and he travels around space on a skull-adorned motorcycle. It's obvious why Lobo is such a beloved character considering how ridiculous he is. Despite how beloved and popular Lobo is with fans, he's never been adapted into any live-action movies, and the idea of who would play him is a heated debate. It seems DC has not only confirmed who could play Lobo on the big screen — but also who could possibly play the MCU's Wolverine.\nOne of the most popular fan casts for Lobo is none other than Jason Momoa, who also plays Aquaman in the ill-fated DCEU. This fan cast is so popular that the actor has even responded to it, and it seems DC is completely aware of the demand. In this year's Halloween story, after Crush gets exhausted trying to get Lobo to dress up as Wolverine, she instead points him to dress up as Aquaman, which is a cute reference to both the actor's and fans' desire to see Momoa play Lobo. While Lobo doesn't believe he has any resemblance to Aquaman at all, he's only thinking of the Arthur Curry of the DC Universe. The version of Aquaman played by Momoa looks a lot closer to the Main Man.\nDC is well aware that fans want Momoa to play Lobo, and the actor himself is even up to the task. But, in admitting that Lobo shares a striking resemblance to both Aquaman and Wolverine, the publisher has revealed that, if Momoa can't ever play Lobo, then maybe he will find himself on the big screen playing the iconic Wolverine for the ever-expanding MCU instead.\nDC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1 is on sale now from DC Comics!\n"}
{"title": "14 Best Scary Movies To Stream", "date": "2023-10-05 23:57:17", "text": "With Halloween right around the corner, it's time to find the best scary movies to watch at home on streaming to get into the spooky mood.\nHorror movies have been becoming increasingly popular in recent years with some incredible remakes, sequels, and several new original stories that have made big waves. For years, horror movies were primarily enjoyed at the cinema with a group of friends as everyone gripped tightly onto their popcorn. Now, with the ease and availability of so many streaming platforms and their large libraries of content, more people are choosing to dim the lights in their own homes and snuggle up in a warm blanket to watch horror from the comfort of the couch.\nDedicated horror streaming platforms like Shudder are a good option for die-hard horror fans, but for more casual viewers getting into the spooky season, it's worth knowing what movies are available on other popular platforms. HBO Max, Peacock, and DirecTV appear to have the best selection of all-time great horror films for anyone interested in watching the classics like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, John Carpenter's The Thing, or Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street. And for even more of the best movies available right now on streaming, see the list below.\nThe Exorcist is widely regarded as one of the all-time greatest horror films ever made. Originally released in 1973 and then plagued by critical outrage from the Catholic Church seeking the film to be banned, The Exorcist drummed up a great deal of controversy while also being praised for its incredible screenplay and sound which helped to create a truly horrifying film. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and nominations in nine other categories. In The Exorcist, 12-year-old Regan becomes possessed by a demon and the film deals with the traumatic experience of trying desperately to exorcise her with the help of two priests. For keen horror fans, The Exorcist is a must-watch film available currently on HBO Max.\nPsycho has been adapted many times from the original novel by Robert Bloch, but perhaps none more famous or successful than the original 1960 film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. When a young woman's car breaks down on a quiet road, she is saved by the well-mannered young hotel owner, Norman Bates who provides her shelter and food in her dire need. The film becomes increasingly unsettling as the plot unfolds and it also contains one of the best twists in any horror to this day. Psycho is currently available to watch on Peacock.\nRelated: Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho: 10 Things That Still Hold Up Today\nStanley Kubrick's The Shining is adapted from the novel by famous horror writer Stephen King. Released in 1980, just three years after the book debuted and starred a young Jack Nicholson as a writer who takes his family along with him to care for a hotel in its off-season. Nicholson delivers an outstanding performance as a man slowly descending into madness and the story grows increasingly bizarre, tragic, and horrifying as events unfold. The Shining is now streaming on HBO Max and DirecTV.\nAlien, directed by Ridley Scott and starring a young Sigourney Weaver in the early days of her career, is another classic horror film that set the tone for what classic horror should be. Released in 1979, Alien expanded into a large franchise with many sequels and prequels, and still, more are being made now, the story of terrifying alien creatures that can infect and grow in the human body continues to be one of the most enduring and popular images in all of horror history. The first film in the franchise is currently available to watch on Hulu.\nHalloween was directed by the legendary John Carpenter who will appear on this list again. A deranged man in a mask sets out to commit violent murders around his hometown of Haddonfield and through this film and several sequels, the rampage only continues to get increasingly brutal and terrifying. The series also features Jamie Lee Curtis as possibly the most famous final girl of any horror franchise, Laurie Strode. Halloween is the classic slasher movie and perfect for getting into the Halloween spirit, available to watch with a subscription on Shudder, AMC+, or FuboTV, and free with ads on Crackle, Redbox, and Plex.\nChanging gears to a much more modern film for a moment, Get Out earned its place on this list of all-time great horrors thanks to incredible direction and vision from Jordan Peele and an outstanding performance by Daniel Kaluuya as a young black man who uncovers shocking secrets about his white girlfriend's family. The film plays on the uneasiness of this visit and the subtle challenges that may be experienced by an interracial couple with family who may not be accepting but takes this concept much further with unsettling twists and dark secrets. Get Out can be viewed on Peacock, FuboTV and FX Now with a subscription.\nRelated: Get Out's Inspirations Explained\n1982's The Thing is also directed by John Carpenter and tells the story of a group of researchers exploring Antarctica. During the course of their work, some thing begins to wreak havoc when their research is interrupted by disturbing occurrences. This creature has the ability to inhabit and imitate other beings and things get really weird, really fast. Starring Kurt Russell at the height of his career, The Thing is not to be missed and can be found on Peacock with a subscription.\nThis film from 1974 was originally marketed as being based on a true story in order to attract audiences, and it largely did that. However, the story is largely fictional with some details about the killer being inspired by the mass murderer Ed Gein. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has been remade and inspired sequels about the story which follows an isolated killer who wields a chainsaw and wears people's faces as a mask. This first installment steps up the intensity of classic slashers with a more high-powered weapon and a small group of victims to hunt down and can be seen over on Peacock with a subscription now.\nThe Silence of the Lambs starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins seeks to bring audiences deep into the mind of a twisted killer. Foster plays a young FBI agent who calls upon Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter for help on a case. The issue is, that Hannibal is himself a cannibalistic murderer. Despite his murderous tendencies, Hannibal is also brilliant, as a trained psychiatrist and capable of attuning his mind to that of other killers. Creepy and unsettling throughout, The Silence of the Lambs can be seen on HBO Max and DirecTV with a subscription now.\nEd and Lorraine Warren are experienced demonologists who assist others struggling with supernatural occurrences. During 2012's The Conjuring, they come face to face with exceedingly powerful demons and possessions that create an incredibly unsettling and disturbing film. Starring Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, The Conjuring is a dark and twisted tale that will make anyone look twice at unassuming dolls just in case something more sinister could be lurking within. Available to stream on both HBO Max and DirecTV with a subscription.\nRelated: The Conjuring Universe Complete Timeline\nThe haunting series of films that started with 2004's Saw follows the twisted games of a madman hiding behind a puppet played out by unsuspected and unwilling contestants. Jigsaw carefully selects his victims by watching people he deems to be unworthy, or perhaps not living up to their potential, and then he traps them in a fatal game, usually against other players in order to win their life and learn how to live a better, more grateful and attuned life. Some of the most gruesome and anxiety-inducing deaths in horror are played out in this series, but they are exceptionally well thought out and there's a twisted sense of morals to sink into with this series. Available to watch with a subscription on Peacock, Prime Video, Starz and FuboTV, or with ads on Tubi.\nWes Craven's literal nightmare fuel, A Nightmare on Elm Street was released in 1984. Following the terrifying Freddy Krueger who literally walks through children's dreams and kills them in their sleep, this movie is full of jump scares, and horrifying moments of the disfigured Krueger chasing children through lengthy dream corridors. This was also the film that launched Robert Englund as a horror icon and inspired dozens of parodies in pop culture. A Nightmare on Elm Street was also the first project that Johnny Depp performed in and can be seen on HBO Max with a subscription.\nScream is one of the most legendary franchises in horror with incredible stars like Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Matthew Lillard and even a brief appearance by Drew Barrymore. The series follows a series of murders in Woodsboro and eventually further afield. Scream does an incredible job of interacting with Horror as a medium with Scream first releasing in 1996 and playing with popular tropes from slashers that came before. Every installment seeks to subvert expectations and lead the viewers on a mystery manhunt to uncover the killer or killers under the Ghostface mask. Scream can be streamed on HBO Max for anyone with a paid subscription.\nX starring Mia Goth is a deeply harrowing film that follows a group of young people recording a porn film in rural Texas. The group has rented a property from an elderly couple who live on the land nearby and appear to become suspicious of what these holidaymakers are doing. The whole film creates an incredibly tense and challenging atmosphere as it deals with confronting and challenging imagery and once things start to go wrong, they go very, very wrong. The film also creatively uses Mia Goth to play both the role of the young starring actress and the older, more restricted woman to create interesting parallels and unsettling moments throughout. X can be seen on Showtime, FuboTV and DirecTV for those with a subscription.\n"}
{"title": "Django Unchained Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-05 23:51:23", "text": "Django Unchained has an ending that begs to be explained. Here is a deep dive into Tarantino's complex tale of love, freedom,  and redemption. \nThe complex Django Unchained ending begs for further explanation, as the story is much deeper than what it initially appears to be. Considered by many to be one of the greatest films in the Tarantino vault, Django Unchained starts as a gunslinging Western and quickly transforms into a tragic story of undying love. It's also a story of how that undying love can drive a man to darker depths than he thought possible.\nAfter their plan to fool the evil slaver Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) goes awry, Django has to shoot his way past his oppressors to set his wife free. The end of the film finds Django and Hildi riding off into the dark of night after a triumphant win from Django. Although this may seem like a happy ending, given the times and the nature of the events that just occurred, Django and Hildi may have trouble coming their way.\nThe ride off into the darkness is an ominous symbol of the dark road ahead for the couple. Not only would they have to somehow make their way out of the Deep South during a time when slavery had not yet been abolished, but Hildi and Django would also be surrounded by enemies actively hunting them for the crimes they just committed. From neighboring plantations to slave catchers and sheriffs, they'd have to keep the lowest of profiles to somehow sneak out of Mississippi unscathed and make their way up to the North to safety. Although Django could use his power of deceit to make a few allies, it's hard to imagine the couple living out their life in freedom without any consequences.\nIn the film, Candyland is a plantation in Mississippi known throughout the South for its cruelty and torture of Black people. Just the very mention of its name was enough to make Django uneasy. At the end of the third act, after Django is done shooting down every slave owner in Candyland, he takes it a step further by blowing it up with a stick of dynamite. This explosion doesn't just deliver a satisfying moment of redemption for Django's character, it's also symbolic of the concept of freedom.\nCandyland represents not just slave ownership, but oppression as a whole. Throughout the grounds, there are slaves in every room performing all sorts of unspeakable acts and being treated in the cruelest, most inhumane ways. Its destruction symbolizes the dismantling of oppressors and the idea of putting an end to enslavement once and for all, as evidenced by the film being set right before the Civil War.\nBy destroying Candyland, Django doesn't just set Hildi free, but he also frees other slaves, including Cora, Sheba, and the men who are being transported to the mines. All of their futures are tied in Candyland, and by burning it down and killing all the masters, Django sets them all free. The destruction of Candyland sends a message to onlookers and oppressors: a new future is coming, a future where the enslavement and inhumane treatment of Black people is not only unjust but will be met with consequences.\nCalvin Candie and Dr. Schultz are the polar opposites of one another. Dr. Schultz was the only White character who treated enslaved people with respect, addressing them by name and treating them like equals. He's even able to set a few free, like Django. Calvin Candie, on the other hand, is infamous for being mean, cruel, and ignorant. Not only does he prefer methods of torture, but he doesn't even see slaves as human beings. Candie genuinely views slaves as property, even watching a man get beaten to death in front of him without blinking an eye, unlike Schultz, who is visibly uncomfortable and shaken.\nIt's clear that Schultz and Candie don't like each other. They make each other uncomfortable and can not exist in the same space. One of them has to go, and when Candie calls Schultz back to shake his hand, he clearly makes the choice that it will be Schultz. At that moment, the tension between Dr. Schultz and Calvin Candie throughout Django Unchained comes to a head, and the climax is an all-out bloodbath. Although Candie insists that the handshake is just a traditional business move, the timing and context behind the request scream set up, which is why Dr. Schultz draws first blood. In the small act of a handshake, there is a greater symbolism of a shifting power dynamic, not just between the two men, but between the cruelty of oppressors and those who will rise up to defeat them in the end.\nThe moment when Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) realizes Django and Hildi know each other is the exact point in the film where things go downhill. Although this may seem like a sharp left, a reexamining of the scene gives away why it is so easy for Stephen to put two and two together. Stephen is one of Candie's most loyal servants, a traditional \"house Negro\" who enjoys privileges the other slaves don't get due to his loyalty. He is suspicious of Django and Dr. Schultz from the start, fearing they'll upset the balance of Candyland where he enjoys a relatively easy life, unlike his fellow slaves.\nKnowing the delicate nature of the situation, it is imperative that the crew be as careful as possible, for any misstep could cost them their life. But the attraction between Hildi and Django is too great, and after a tearful reunion, the two can't help but exchange a few longing glances at one another. The glances, however subtle, are evidence enough of Django and Hildi being familiar with one another, and that's the very moment that set everything in motion. If Hildi could've been assigned another task in the house, she could've avoided her public shaming and bloodbath that occurred at the plantation.\nWhen Django first tells Dr. Schultz his idea of rescuing his wife, Dr. Schultz practically takes it as a joke. The idea seems so unrealistic that he initially encourages Django to move on with his life. Then, against his better judgment, Dr. Schultz ends up accompanying Django on his impossible rescue mission. Although he claims it is because he felt responsible for Django after setting him free, a few moments in the second act show it's deeper than that.\nDr. Schultz has faith in Django's mission and truly believes that he can do it. To him, it is a matter of fate, a story written in the fairytales of German lore. Schultz knows that the bond that Hildi and Django share is too powerful and that Django will stop at nothing to achieve it; naturally, he wants to be the one to help his partner along. Schultz's compassionate heart helps him devise a clever scheme that gets him as far as the plantation–once he gets there, however, he starts to have regrets.\nWhen the reality of the situation sets in, Schultz begins to reflect on all the people who were tortured and killed to achieve Django's dream, and grows uncomfortable with the whole idea. When their cover is blown, Schultz is almost relieved that he's finally able to come clean with how much he regrets meeting Calvin Candie. It's lucky for Django that Schultz is an idealist at heart; maybe if given the chance to redo his decision, Schultz would've gone about things differently.\nTarantino is a director known for his clever use of color. Whether it's a filter or a costume, his bold use of color makes a statement about character roles and tone. Django Unchained is no exception to this rule and uses color and costumes to give the audience clues about the film's order of power.\nThroughout the movie, monochromatic costumes are often used as a symbol of importance. The powerful men in the South, like the U.S. Marshall, can be seen wearing all white or all black. The underlings tend to wear a combination of both, establishing a hierarchy through the use of color. Schultz, a man who treats everyone equally, usually wears neutral colors like gray. When characters are making a statement of status, they wear bold, bright colors, like Candie's luxurious burgundy suit and Django's royal blue ensemble.\nSince its 2012 release, there have been talks of a Django Unchained sequel, with Tarantino's plan to allegedly team Django up with the legendary sword-wielding hero Zorro. Instead, Tarantino opted to continue the story in a comic book series. However, if a sequel were to materialize on the silver screen, there are a couple of plot points it could run with.\nRight before his explosive death, Stephen yells that Django will be the one on wanted posters and that he'll be hunted down for what he did to Candyland. Django Unchained 2 could see Django go from the hunter to the hunted. As the new \"fastest gun in the south\", he could fight off those who come after him for the crimes he committed in Django Unchained. By then, he and Hildi could have started a family with gunslinging talents of their own. It would be extremely satisfying and fitting to see Hildi wield a pistol and help her beau shoot down bounty hunters.\nIG: @kysheeta_c\n\nKaillaby is a writer from NYC with a passion for anime, movies, and all things pop culture.

{"title": "Reptile Ending Explained: Who The Killer Is", "date": "2023-10-05 23:48:51", "text": "Reptile is a thrilling mystery starring Benicio del Toro as a veteran detective trying to catch a killer. But who actually killed Summer?\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for Reptile.\nGrant Singer's thriller Reptile weaves a web of deception as Benicio Del Toro's Detective Nichols tracks down the killer of a young real estate agent named Summer (Matilda Lutz), and in the process uncovers department-wide corruption within the ranks of the Scarborough police force. After going through several suspects, including Summer's lover and fellow real estate agent Will Grady (Justin Timberlake), ex-husband Sam (Karl Glusman), and disgruntled neighbor Eli Phillips (Michael Pitt), he finally discovers the identity of the killer among the characters in Reptile along with their motivation for Summer's demise. Unfortunately, his revelations put him in the crosshairs of powerful players in a convoluted game of cat-and-mouse.\nWhen he brings evidence against the killer and corrupt members of his department to the chief of police, the pair pay a visit to Captain Allen (Eric Bogosian) whose been concealing the identity of the murderer the entire time. Unbeknownst to Nichols, the deception goes all the way to his superiors, and Nichols is forced to get into a shootout with his former colleagues before he can expose the entire conspiracy. Full of red herrings, plot twists, the film delivers on the hallmarks of a gripping procedural but nevertheless leaves a few lingering questions as Nichols uncovers who Reptile's \"reptile\" really is.\nIn a rather confusing flashback, it's revealed that Will Grady killed Summer. When Detective Nichols is chasing down yet another lead and trying to figure out who Rudy Rackozy called so many times on the day that Summer was killed. It isn't stated out loud but it's implied that Rudy called Will, who is seen in yet another flashback standing over Summer's barely-breathing body. Will intended to pin the crime on Summer's ex-husband, but unfortunately for him, Detective Nichols was too good at his job and traced the burner phone to Will.\nUnfortunately, this isn't the most innovative part of the plot, as the killer is often the boyfriend in thrillers like Reptile. While it's enjoyable to see Justin Timberlake play against type, his part in the film makes it feel formulaic. Fortunately, Will isn't given a villainous monologue, but at the same time, getting more scenes involving him being a little more sinister, rather than so much time wasted on Eli and other red herring suspects would have made the reveal feel more deserved.\nDetective Nichols initially thought it was suspicious that Summer sold houses for a real estate agency yet often didn't receive any commission for the sales. These sales were part of a drug laundering scheme concocted by Wally and the majority of the police in Detective Nichols' department, and Summer had started calling the FBI in preparation to tell them the truth about White Fish being a shell company. Will finds out about what she was planning to do and kills her before she can reveal how far up the corruption goes.\nThe corruption linking the police department and the shell real estate company is somewhat convoluted, but Detective Nichols starts to piece it together once he notices that contraband has been suspiciously disappearing from the department evidence room. Wally plants drugs in certain houses and then they get seized, and White Fish buys them for a fraction of their cost and makes considerable profits. Summer was the broker for these transactions and didn't know anything about it at first, but eventually, the guilt became too overwhelming.\nRELATED: Reptile: Why Judy Puts Tom's Hand In WaxProcedurals like Reptile need to get tighter as they progress, but it's at this point that the narrative gets more convoluted. A lot of loose ends are left dangling, such as why Captain Allen agreed to keep the Chrysler Imperial, seen at the scene of Summer's murder, in his garage. The \"why\" in Reptile is not as important as the \"how,\" and understanding character motivations only gets in the way of appreciating what they end up producing as far as tension and tone.\nEli Phillips is a Nostradamus-looking suspect who appears early on with a motive to kill Summer; Will Grady swindled his family out of their property, which forced Eli's father to take his own life. Eli threatens Will and he returns the favor by showing up one night in his apartment, telling him to stop sniffing around his business. He's joined by another figure who Eli seems to recognize, but they're never revealed to the audience. This person is most likely the chief of police, whose role in the entire tawdry tableau is revealed later when Detective Nichols tries to bring evidence of the corrupt officers to his attention.\nAfter the confrontation between Eli, Will, and the mysterious third intruder, Eli is never seen again in Reptile. When Detective Nichols returns to question Eli again, he finds his entire home scrubbed clean and a bottle of bleach on the counter. While the audience never sees Eli's death, it's implied that he was killed, dismembered, and his body was disposed of at a different location with no evidence left to implicate either Will or his accomplice in the crime.\nEli's fate is left open-ended and ambiguous in keeping with the shifting nature of the case. Singer purposefully makes all the characters suspicious in the beginning, particularly Eli, and including Detective Nichols himself. Eli represents one of the most obviously nefarious characters, but he's not only harmless - he cracked the case, and his death is meant to remain unknown so that fans can make up their own minds as the case progresses, constantly guessing just like Nichols, working to solve it along with him.\nReptile's intense finale is punctuated by an innocuous moment involving a frisbee hitting the large picture window where Nichols and Wally's incredibly intense confrontation is in full view. Nichols looks over to see children's noses pressed up against the glass, taking in the horrifying tableau of Wally on the ground, his own blood pooling around him, and Nichols holding his firearm. Singer has explained Reptile's frisbee scene in terms of his own position as a novice filmmaker; \"The idea is that I'm the kids playing. This is my first movie, I'm just enjoying myself, I'm just playing and this is my thing.\"\nLooked at within the context of the narrative, the frisbee is an ironic act of God that pulls Nichols, Wally, and the audience out of the moment and redirects their focus, and the horrors of what they're participating in are juxtaposed with the everyday act of children playing outside, creating a surreal space for introspection and reflection. The corruption of Wally's world, having already infiltrated friends and family, cannot be divorced from the children's incorruptible innocence operating as a deux ex machina, highlighting that everything has consequences.\nBenicio Del Toro gives an incredibly nuanced and intense performance in Reptile, using body language and long stares to communicate trauma and a wounded psyche. He's been accused of being on the take at his old department, which makes him a perfect candidate for Captain Allen's, or so Allen thinks, but Detective Nichols wants to actually have a fresh start and peace that will never come. He's asked at one point if he needs to be redeemed, a notion he becomes defensive about, but it's clear that he needs to solve Summer's murder for more reasons than simply being a thorough investigator.\nBefore her death, Summer finds a dried snakeskin, indicating all is not what it seems inside her house. The movie is called Reptile because as each character is introduced their nature changes, and after appearing to be one thing, they soon \"shed their skin\" and are revealed to be something else. Will Grady is a skittish wasp who becomes capable of stabbing his girlfriend, Wally is an avuncular poker buddy who turns out to be the kingpin in a drug scheme and tries to kill the \"rats\" bringing him down, and Detective Nichols is a perceivably corrupt cop shedding the skin of his old reputation to be an altruistic hero.\nCinematographer Mike Gioulakis crafts Reptile stylishly and makes salient use of reflective surfaces, particularly mirrors. Characters reveal key plot points, perform exposition, and question each other from within these glossy parameters, representing the way that things aren't always what they seem even when they're right in front of character's faces. It's an interesting technique that helps give Singer's thriller a distinct aesthetic and oeuvre.\n"}
{"title": "Future Pixar Movies Have A Major Problem, Despite Elemental's $490 Million Box Office Recovery", "date": "2023-10-05 23:40:25", "text": "Elemental managed an impressive comeback at the box office, but Pixar can't count on this happening again for its future theatrical projects. \nElemental made a spectacular comeback after its disappointing opening weekend, but Pixar still has a lot of work to do going forward. The Disney studio hasn't had a lot of luck with its films recently, and it was hoped that their element-themed romance would turn this all around. Unfortunately, Elemental's opening weekend made it look as if the film would be a box office bomb, which would be especially bad news for Pixar after other such failures. Thankfully, the studio's most recent movie made a surprising $400 million comeback. Still, Pixar can't count on this for all of its future projects.\nIn its opening weekend, Elemental only managed to bring in just under $40 million at the box office. Compared to studio successes like Toy Story 3, this is a significant flop. Still, things managed to trend upward for the film. Word of mouth really seemed to do Elemental some favors, and a surprising number of audiences turned up at theaters in the weeks that followed. Pixar's chief creative officer, Pete Docter, was thrilled (via Screen Rant) that audiences had wound up resonating with Ember and Wade as he thought they would, but it isn't lost on him that Elemental's disappointing weekend is still a problem.\nRELATED: Elemental 2 - Confirmation Chances, Release Date Prediction, Possible Sequel Story & Everything We Know\nElemental may have pulled itself together at the box office, but Pixar can't count on this happening for its upcoming new releases. This is something that Docter seems to recognize. He noted that even with Elemental's $400 million recovery, he plans to take \"another look at the projects we’re working on now\" to ensure that they meet the standard of their past successes. \"I really think I want to double down on what allowed us to speak to audiences to begin with,\" he said, still standing by his love for Elemental but noting that Pixar needs to return to its roots to avoid another close call.\nOverall, the fact that Elemental failed to bring audiences in on its opening weekend means that leading up to the film's release, people simply weren't interested. It took word-of-mouth for people to decide to hit the theaters. Though this says a lot about Pixar's marketing plan (something the studio also needs to take a closer look at), it could also come down to a loss of faith in the studio's films. After all, several of their recent movies have failed to meet audiences' expectations.\nThe pressure on Pixar might be different if Elemental was the studio's first project with a disappointing opening weekend. Lightyear (2022) only brought in $50 million when it hit theaters, but unlike Elemental, it never managed to turn these numbers around. The film has a worldwide gross of only $226 million—considerably lower than Elemental's—and is considered a critical failure as well as a box office bomb.\nOther Pixar failures were relatively well received by audiences once they started streaming on Disney+, but audiences didn't seem to think it was worth it to turn up at the theaters. Onward (2020), which holds an impressive 95-percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, only managed $141 million gross. Overall, these numbers reveal that Pixar is consistently missing the mark when it comes to predicting what stories will get audiences to buy tickets—something they used to get right consistently.\nPart of the reason for many of Pixar's failures is the decision on Disney's part to give the studio's films a simultaneous streaming release or to skip over the theatrical release altogether and jump straight to Disney+. This was the case for Turning Red, Soul, and Luca—all movies with decent critic reviews but a relatively poor return on investment. It's difficult to say why Disney deems this a good idea, but if Pixar wants to earn more theatrical releases, then it needs to take full advantage of the opportunities given.\nTo justify future theatrical releases, Pixar must prove it can make magic happen at the box office, and Elemental didn't manage this. Sure, the romance wasn't a complete failure, and its surprise recovery may allow Pixar to tread water for a time. However, if the studio's next movies continue the disappointing opening weekend trend, we will likely see a lot more Disney+ releases rather than theatrical ones. Hopefully, Docter meant it when he said that Elemental's performance has him taking a closer look at their upcoming projects because audiences are ready to see the old Pixar back in theaters.\n"}

Spoilers for X-Men #27 ahead!One of the most dangerous villains the X-Men have ever faced has plans to steal the Juggernaut’s powers and turn himself into the unstoppable Dr. Juggernaut. The events of Fall of X have put the X-Men on the back foot, with most mutants having either been killed or imprisoned. Now, one of the architects of the mutants’ catastrophic new status is prepared to make things even worse.\nX-Men #27 by Gerry Duggan, Phil Noto, VC’s Clayton Cowles, Tom Muller and Jay Bowen opens with Kate Pryde breaking into an Orchis prison and discovering Juggernaut. She provides the means for him to break out the following day, but at the end of the mission it’s revealed that his breakout attempt fails. Doctor Stasis, a version of Mister Sinister and one of the leaders of Orchis, says that Juggernaut is too dangerous to be left alive.\n“Rather than execute him, I’ve realized that magic gem of his is inside his body. I’m going to extract it surgically and then ingest it,” Stasis tells Firestar. “I hope the world is ready for Dr. Juggernaut. I’ve scheduled him for an autopsy in the morning.”\nMister Sinister and Doctor Stasis are two of the four clones that 19th century scientist Nathaniel Essex made of himself. His purpose in creating these clones was to try different methods for humanity to fight back against artificial intelligence in the future. While Sinister is a version of Essex with an X-Gene, Stasis is an ordinary human, albeit one with an abnormally long life. Believing that mutants are a greater danger than artificial life, Stasis becomes one of the leaders of the anti-mutant organization Orchis and helps orchestrate the attack on the Hellfire Gala that kicks off Fall of X.\nBoth Juggernaut and Mister Sinister have been staples of the X-Men’s rogues’ gallery for decades as formidable physical and mental threats, respectively. Cain Marko is known more for his brawn than his brain, as the powers granted to him by the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak make it so that he is literally unstoppable. With the added intellectual might of Doctor Stasis, he would be able to wield his physical strengths in genius new ways. While Stasis is a relatively new character, he has the same intelligence as Sinister, who is known for his cunning and always thinking ten steps ahead of his opponents.\nSinister recently enacted a plan to incorporate his genes into the DNA of every mutant resurrected on Krakoa, resulting in the creation of the Sins of Sinister timeline. Here, everyone on Earth became a version of Mister Sinister, and he was able to exert his power to not only take over the world, but extend his reign into the far reaches of space. He was even able to come up with a brilliant way to use Juggernaut’s abilities by turning him into a bullet that was then used to assassinate both Thanos and Galactus.\nThe one hope that Juggernaut and the rest of the X-Men have is that Stasis tells his plans to Firestar, who is working as a spy within Orchis. Firestar will need to alert her fellow mutants in order to stop him. If she is unsuccessful, then Doctor Stasis will be able to supplement his own abilities with the mystically-infused powers of the Juggernaut, a deadly combination that the X-Men would have no hope of defeating.\nX-Men #27 is on sale now from Marvel Comics.\n"}

Set sixteen years after the first film, the sequel finds Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri's (Zoe Saldaña) Na'vi family under the threat of a recombinant Quaritch (Stephen Lang) as they seek refuge with the aquatic Metkayina clan. During the final battle, Jake and Neytiri's oldest son Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) is fatally shot by one of Quaritch's men and dies in front of his family.\nIn a recent episode of Cinema Therapy, licensed therapist Jonathan Decker watched Neteyam's death in Avatar: The Way of Water and broke it down in detail, including Jake and Neytiri's response to the tragedy. While Neytiri becomes \"feral with grief,\" as Decker says, the therapist notes how Jake's response is different, as he blames his younger son Lo'ak for Neteyam's death. Read a portion of his commentary or watch the full video below:\nThey're both grieving. It's a petty, mean, hurtful thing to say, and it's super relatable. He blames his son for his other son's death. Which is, again, if you're in the headspace to evaluate what's really going on, you're not going to say something like that. Cut Jake some slack here, but he's still doing what he does, which is he's compassionate with his wife and he's tough on his sons.\nHe was getting to a better place. I do think it's true. We learn and we evolve and we grow, and we often do things better, as long as things are fine. We backslide into our past behaviors. Eeven though it was, as an audience member, it was frustrating and hurtful to see Jake do this late in the film. It's true to the character and it's true to how people are. It's true to human psychology. But we do need that catharsis. For there to be an arc, it has to go to a healthy place.\nAs the oldest son of Jake and Neytiri, Neteyam was expected to safeguard and care for his younger siblings. However, it is his more impulsive younger brother, Lo'ak, who convinces him to save their symbolic sibling Spider, the biological son of Miles Quaritch. Therefore, Lo'ak feels responsible for Neteyam's death, and Jake, whose headspace is also clouded by grief, blames his youngest son for his oldest son's death. Neteyam's tragic death, and the resulting family dynamics, do set up a strong foundation for future character arcs in Avatar 3 and future sequels.\nAs already seen during the Avatar: The Way of Water ending, Jake and Neytiri should continue seeking retribution against Quaritch for their son's death as they attempt to put an end to his destructive rampage once and for all. Neteyam's death should also have a profound influence on Lo'ak, potentially making him more cautious about protecting his siblings or sending him down a dark path of pain and regret. The heartbreaking tragedy could also have an effect on Jake and Neytiri's other children, Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) and Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss), who will pursue their own paths of revenge or healing.\nSource: Cinema Therapy\n"}
{"title": "A Stephen King Adaptation In Development For Over A Decade Hits End Of The Road, Reveals Director", "date": "2023-10-05 23:02:48", "text": "The Black Phone director Scott Derrickson shares a negative update on his long-gestating horror movie adapted from a Stephen King novella.\nThe Stephen King adaptation The Breathing Method has gotten a grim development update. The movie, which was previously with director Scott Derrickson attached, is an adaptation of the King novella of the same name, originally published as part of the 1982 collection Different Seasons. The story follows a woman in the 1930s who is desperately protective of her unborn child, who was conceived out of wedlock, so much so that her \"breathing method\" for helping birth the child keeps her lungs moving even after she is decapitated in a car accident.\nCinemaBlend recently had the chance to speak with Derrickson, whose most recent work in the horror genre is the segment \"Dreamkill\" from the new anthology movie V/H/S/85. During their conversation, he shared an update on The Breathing Method. Although he \"really loved that script,\" he is \"not involved with it anymore,\" so he was not able to offer a more substantive update. Read his full quote below:\nI don't know where the rights are on that. I don't even know if it's in development now. I had a script developed with Scott Teems, who worked on the Halloween films and I think one of the Insidious films. And he did a great job, and I really loved that script, and it was very imaginative, and a really strong adaptation. It didn't end up going anywhere. I'm not involved with it anymore, so I have no idea where it's at.\nThe Breathing Method was originally announced to be in development in 2012. At the time, it was already announced that Derrickson would be attached. The director was then fresh off his Blumhouse horror hit Sinister, which earned $87.7 million off its $3 million budget and was followed by a sequel in 2015. He had also previously directed the horror titles Hellraiser: Inferno and The Exorcism of Emily Rose.\nRelated: Every Scott Derrickson Horror Movie Ranked Worst To Best (Including Black Phone)\nBack in 2012, Teems' involvement as screenwriter was also announced. However, there was no word on the project for quite some time until 2019, when a new announcement was made, confirming Teems and Derrickson's continued involvement. However, after that the project went dormant once again until Derrickson's most recent comment.\nIn the years since The Breathing Method was announced, both creators have put out other works in the horror genre, with Derrickson even directing 2022's The Black Phone, an adaptation of a story by King's son Joe Hill. However, if Derrickson is no longer involved, it may be the case that Teems (who wrote Halloween Kills, Firestarter, and Insidious: The Red Door in the meantime) is also not attached. Even if the script is still in play, with no director the movie is likely very far from going into production, if the possibility is still even being considered.\nSource: CinemaBlend\n"}

From interdimensional evils like Darkseid to more street-level foes like the Key, the League has gone up against just about every big bad in the DCU.\nNow, one of their subtlest foes is working behind the scenes to hit the Justice League harder than ever before — with the surprising help of the WildStorm legacy. Batman: The Brave and the Bold #5 features the latest entry of “Stormwatch: Down With The Kings” by Ed Brisson, Jeff Spokes, and Saida Temofonte, in which the black-ops team learns that one surprising anti-Justice League figure has been controlling their every move: Amanda Waller.\nStormwatch has been collecting weapons that could take down the Justice League itself. When Ravager learns the truth, she makes it clear to Director Bones that she’s no longer taking part in their quest, especially after learning Bones is only a figurehead. Before Bones can finish spouting another lie, Stormwatch’s true commander, Amanda Waller herself, finally makes an appearance and reveals that she’s been running the team from the start.\nRelated: Marvel Finally Has Its Own Version of Justice League's Most Powerful Hero (According to Batman)\nWhile Stormwatch has been collecting weaponry with the express purpose of taking down the Justice League, they’ve been doing so under the impression that these weapons would be used only in self-defense should the more public-facing heroes of the DCU ever try taking them down. Unfortunately, as Ravager learns, that reasoning couldn’t be farther from the truth — but that lie plays exactly into Waller’s private mission throughout the current Dawn of DC era. After all, since the finale of Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Wall has been working with the Council of Light to weaken and the world’s greatest heroes, which is a mission that would benefit from an arsenal of anti-Justice League weaponry.\nThis is far from the first connection Waller has made with the grittier WildStorm corner of the DC Universe, as the Waller vs. WildStorm Black Label miniseries by Spencer Ackerman, Evan Narcisse, Jesús Merino, and Vicente Cifuentes makes clear. Waller has always been one of the publisher’s most morally flexible spymasters, so the notion that she would employ one of WildStorm’s most famous organizations, even one consisting largely of DC Comics Earth-0 characters, is totally in-line with her personal history. All in all, her moral flexibilty and willingnes to manipulate ever the darkest anti-heroes does not bode well for the future of the Justice League.\nWhen Amanda Waller sets her sight on a goal, she moves heaven and earth to make it a reality. Unfortunately, the Wall’s current goal seems to be the destruction of the DCU's greatest heroes. If the Justice League hopes to survive an onslaught at the hands of Amanda Waller and Stormwatch, they should start preparing for the worst.\nBatman: The Brave and the Bold #5 is available now from DC Comics.\n"}
{"title": "Occlumency Theory Explained: Why Harry Potter Failed (& Draco Succeeded)", "date": "2023-10-05 23:00:26", "text": "Harry Potter was never any good at Occlumency, and the reason for this may explain why Draco Malfoy found the skill so easy to perfect. \nThe Boy Who Lived never got the hang of Occlumency in Harry Potter, but this might not have had anything to do with a lack of talent. Severus Snape began teaching Harry this obscure branch of magic in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix since Dumbledore hoped it would ensure that Voldemort couldn't use his connection with Harry to gain information or possess him. Of course, these lessons went catastrophically. By the time Snape refused to continue teaching Harry, the boy hadn't come anywhere close to gaining control over his mind's security.\nThough Harry struggled with Occlumency, Draco Malfoy excelled at it. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, it was revealed that Draco had been taking Occlumency lessons from his aunt, Bellatrix Lestrange so that no one at Hogwarts would be able to determine what he was planning with the Death Eaters and Voldemort. He was ultimately very successful at this since even Snape was unable to dive into Draco's mind and figure out what he was planning. Harry was always as equally talented a wizard as Draco, if not a little more. So, why could the Slytherin boy master this skill but not the hero of Harry Potter?\nRELATED: Harry Potter And The Order of the Phoenix Ending Explained\nThe Harry Potter series demonstrated on several occasions that Harry had stronger-than-average willpower. In the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire book, Mad-Eye Moody (really Barty Crouch Jr) began teaching students about the Unforgivable Curses and tried to teach them how to protect themselves from such attacks. When he cast the Imperius Curse on his students, Harry alone could fight off the control. He did this with his will alone and fought off the Imperius Curse both this time and later when Lord Voldemort attempted to Imperius him as well.\nThis proves that Harry's lack of skill had nothing to do with his mental capacity, as Snape had suggested. Many have blamed Harry's failure at Occlumency on the professor, who never really took teaching him seriously and ultimately lost his temper and put an end to their lessons. However, the Wizarding World website suggests that Harry would have struggled with Occlumency even if he had a more patient teacher. This is because Harry was far too emotional—unable to hold back his anger at injustice and always ready to spring into action. This is part of what made him a great hero, but it takes a calmer, more cunning wizard to shut down his mind and master Occlumency.\nThis is precisely why Draco Malfoy was far more capable at Occlumency, and Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling has supported this. She stated that \"it was perfectly consistent with Draco’s character that he would find it easy to shut down emotion, to compartmentalize, and to deny essential parts of himself.\" She went on to state that Draco's upbringing, though lavish, was a fearful one. Lucius Malfoy expected the very best from his son, so weakness and excessive displays of emotion would not have been tolerated. To cope with this, Draco learned from a young age how to shut those feelings down and present a cold, strong, and proud exterior.\nIn addition, Draco was under immense pressure when he began learning Occlumency in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. He had just become a Death Eater and was eager to prove himself on the mission that, unbeknownst to him, he was always meant to fail. Therefore, when Bellatrix—who was surely a harsh teacher—began turning her nephew into an Occlumens, he would have put his all into succeeding since the alternative would have been death. On the other hand, Harry was relatively fearless when it came to Voldemort (even to a fault). Though Dumbledore told him it was necessary, Harry never feared Voldemort seeing into his mind.\nThe reason that Severus Snape was such a good double agent was because he was an expert Occlumens. Lord Voldemort was known to be an accomplished Legilimens and could confidently see into the minds of all his Death Eaters. To deceive him, Snape had to conceal his feelings for Lily and his determination to protect her son while also feeding the Dark Lord false information and memories. This took meticulous control that most wizards couldn't have managed—especially someone like Harry, who wore his feelings on his sleeves. Still, Snape wasn't always the epitome of self-control.\nIf Harry couldn't master Occlumency because of his emotional nature, then it's a surprise that Snape could. Though he always wore a calm mask in the Harry Potter movies, the books contained several instances of the Potions Master losing his cool. These weren't simple instances of a lost temper but full-on, destructive outbursts. One example is at the end of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, when Snape threw a fit because Sirius Black escaped, and no one would believe it was Harry's fault. If a man like this could master Occlumency, then Harry simply being emotional may not be a good enough reason.\nRELATED: Harry Potter - Every Clue That Snape Wasn't A Villain\nHarry's failure to learn Occlumency had major consequences in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Voldemort managed to plant false images in Harry's head of Sirius being tortured at the Department of Mysteries, and it was this that led Harry—and then the rest of the Order of the Phoenix—to the Ministry. Unfortunately, in an effort to save his godson, Sirius lost his life. Harry immediately regretted not taking Occlumency more seriously, but if it's true that it was his own emotional tendencies that kept him from being successful, he was better off not letting this go.\nYear after year, Harry became increasingly angry at the injustices of the wizarding world. When his teachers (especially Dolores Umbridge) treated the students unfairly, Harry would stand up and fight back. When the entire magical community believed he was lying about Voldemort's return, he all but yelled at the rooftops what he had seen. It was this quality that made Harry the perfect hero to stand against Lord Voldemort. Though Snape and Draco were skilled at blending in and hiding their true feelings, Harry Potter wore his own on his sleeves, and this made him impossible for the Dark Lord to control.\n"}

Netflix has been operating for more than 25 years and has gone through several changes to get to where it is today. Starting life as a simple movie delivery service, it grew to the point that businesses like Blockbuster disappeared. Now Netflix creates its own content to rival what other studios put out.\nNetflix's catalog and the quality of its films have improved drastically over the years, but that doesn't mean that its releases are all hits. Many of the worst Netflix original movies feel rushed, poorly executed, or like a half-baked concept that just had money and star power thrown at it. Alongside its independent content, Netflix also features some really terrible movies from other studios, many of which will leave viewers confused, irritated, or downright bored.\nIn an age where superhero movies are making massive waves, Netflix tried its hand at making one of its own. Thunder Force follows the adventure of two childhood best friends who get powers from a science experiment, then team up to fight super villains. The whole film feels incredibly empty and predictable, with jokes that mostly fail to land. Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer helm the cast of Thunder Force, but everything from the chemistry to the plot is exceptionally poor, especially compared to what is being produced by larger studios.\nMarlon Wayans plays Rob Anderson, a man trapped in a time loop on the morning of his wedding, in 2017's Naked. He's cursed to reset the day over and over, during which he wakes up naked in a lift after being the victim of a crime. Naked leaves behind everything that makes a time loop film good, removing any concrete moral of the story and replacing it with cheap jokes and a silly premise. This film fails on every single front to deliver something coherent, engaging, or entertaining. For an absolutely mindless comedy, Naked delivers a sub-par experience all around.\nThe Ridiculous 6 brings together an impressive cast for a modern Happy Madison production, but despite the team in front of and behind the camera — and the funding from Netflix — it falls flat. In the movie, Adam Sandler discovers he has five half-brothers, and they set off on a Western misadventure to find their father. Everything about this film is wacky, zany, and quirky, but it's not in a good way. Everything feels over-the-top silly, and it lives up to its title as a truly ridiculous film. Sadly, it's too ridiculous to be watchable.\n2017's Death Note takes an absolutely outstanding anime series with depth and meaningful themes of morality and justice and turns it into something ugly. Death Note is subpar both visually and in concept. The film whitewashed the cast, even going so far as to change the names and locations from the anime. Death Note also does away with the motivations and background of its main character, watering down Light's most important qualities. The film destroys any semblance of meaning, and its CGI is weird and ridiculous. The anime is leagues better, so the live-action Death Note is not worth the watch.\nRELATED: 10 Live-Action Anime Adaptations That Ruined Their Source Material\nIn The Last Thing He Wanted, Anne Hathaway and Ben Affleck come together to create a film that largely loses track of itself. The narrative follows a journalist who gets mixed up in the middle of a series of crimes she's attempting to break the news on. Despite featuring talented actors, The Last Thing He Wanted meanders and wastes time, creating more loose ends than the movie knows what to do with.\nThe Last Days of American Crime is set in the alternative near future, where crime is running rampant, and the U.S. government is making a last-ditch attempt to stop it in its tracks. The intention is to somehow halt all crime through a broadcast. However, in the more than two hours this film takes to open up and explain its story, it manages to do nothing but run around in circles. The Last Days of American Crime delivers a series of clichés and action scenes in the process, none of which help the story overall. The film is excessively long and void of any meaningful resolution or concrete storyline.\nRelated: 10 Best Crime Movies On Netflix\nAdam Sandler has had an extensive career starring in comedy films, but his partnership with Netflix has seen a decline in the quality of his projects overall. He stars side-by-side with David Spade in The Do-Over, which sees the duo planning to fake their deaths to get a fresh start on life. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned. The identities they take on are in worse trouble than they were. The biggest issue with The Do-Over is that the level of the humor is well-suited for an audience of preteens — but it's rated TV-MA, so adults are the intended audience.\nThe Bubble proves that putting together a cast of incredibly talented actors does not guarantee a film with any level of actual quality. Karen Gillan, Pedro Pascal, Guz Khan, Keegan-Michael Key, and Leslie Mann are part of the cast that make up this flop. When a group of actors is trapped in a bubble due to the COVID-19 outbreak, they decide to continue making the film. Ultimately, the film gets lost, going deeper and deeper into the concept of a film within a film. The Bubble misses the irony it desperately tries to analyze, suggesting legendary director Judd Apatow may have been asleep at the wheel for this one.\nTall Girl already received a great deal of backlash from audiences who were not happy with the premise of setting up a girl with above-average height as something extremely unnatural and worth exploiting for a film. Ultimately, at the conclusion of the first film, characters wind up happy and more mature. However, Tall Girl 2 walks back any of that growth to make its lead character into a popular character struggling to connect with her old friends. Lack of plot, unfortunately bad acting, and manufactured drama converge to create a cash grab sequel for a film that didn't perform that well in the first place.\nJared Leto hasn't had the best track record with movies, and The Outsider unfortunately continues that trend. The 2018 film follows a former prisoner who ends up in the yakuza and begins a rampage of violent crime for his new employers. The main issue with this film is how it has no real character development. The story goes nowhere, and everything feels incredibly pointless. The opening scene is exciting, but after that first 10 or 15 minutes, the development stops. After that, it's essentially just a gore fest, making it one of the least worthwhile movies to watch on Netflix.\n"}
{"title": "8 Biggest Takeaways From The Exorcist: Believer's Scathing Reviews", "date": "2023-10-05 22:41:25", "text": "Most critics agree that The Exorcist: Believer is yet another unnecessary and dispirited attempt to extend the 1973 horror classic into a franchise.\nConsidering the abysmal reviews for The Exorcist: Believer, the main takeaways of the mass criticisms center around one common theme: it isn't good. The Exorcist: Believer is hardly the first attempt at implementing an entertaining and reliable horror franchise out of the celebrated 1973 original film, often heralded as the 'scariest movie of all time'. Believer was created with the intention to compete with modern independent efforts in the horror genre such as M3GAN and Talk to Me but mainly fell flat because of its lack of originality and purpose. Even with successful franchise revitalizer David Gordon Green at the helm (Halloween), most critics have lost their faith in The Exorcist franchise.\nThe original 1973 Exorcist still holds up as a terrifying movie that has unsettled audiences for some 50 years. The direct sequel The Exorcist II: The Heretic was released in 1977 under the new direction of John Boorman but failed to capture the prominence of the first film. 1990's The Exorcist III is arguably the best installment of The Exorcist franchise but still couldn't hold a match to the classic. Hollywood already got the hint that TheExorcist sequels were doomed, resorting to two even worse prequel films in 2004 and 2005 that seemed to have buried the franchise for good. Unfortunately, The Exorcist: Believer continued the trend of the woefully uninspired horror sequels.\nRELATED: The New Movie That's Perfect For Fans Of The Exorcist (Not Exorcist: Believer)\nMost critics agreed that The Exorcist: Believer was simply an unnecessary venture because it doesn't push the envelope on the already progressive state of the modern horror genre. In a time where many great horror films are finding innovative ways to terrify the masses, particularly due to standout auteur directors like Jordan Peele, Ari Aster, and Robert Eggers, The Exorcist: Believer goes in the opposite direction. The film is full of familiar horror tropes and similar situations to those found in the original movie, resulting in what feels like largely a paint-by-numbers movie which would hold up better if it weren't cast in such a monumental shadow.\nDirector David Gordan Green surely knew what he was up against when taking on The Exorcist: Believer, considering the original film's reputation as a landmark of horror. With this in mind, the one major requirement for any sequel of The Exorcist should undoubtedly be its overall fear factor, an aspect that feels like it was overlooked with 2023's Believer. Similar to The Exorcist III, which notably did not feature a single exorcism on screen, Believer's story feels like it was forced to fit under The Exorcist umbrella more than it was inspired by its actual legacy. The Exorcist III was based on a novel titled \"Legion\" and rebranded as an Exorcist movie, which feels like the case in parts of Believer.\nEllen Burstyn was wise to not reprise her role as Chris MacNeil, mother of the infamous Regan character from the original, until five decades had passed. Her big return to the franchise was effectively underwhelming, as Green and Blumhouse didn't utilize her as much as they should have in their attempts at revival. The 90-year-old Burstyn only agreed to return to The Exorcist franchise if Blumhouse agreed to increase her salary and donate it entirely to the charity of her choice. Burstyn's casting was evidently transactional and passionless, used by Blumhouse for the sake of continuity credibility and hardly any other reason besides that.\nRELATED:The Exorcist: Believer Review - Odom Jr. & Burstyn Elevate Gripping, Tame Horror Revival\nOne of the most challenging considerations with The Exorcist franchise is how impactful the original film was and how difficult as a result it is to produce something greater than one of the best horrors ever made. Several other successful and decades-spanning horror franchises didn't start out with such a high standard to live up to, such as Friday the 13th, Saw, and Child's Play. At times, the original Exorcist appears somewhat like an art film with profound, intentional cinematography, religious symbolism, and sophisticated themes of psychiatry in the face of supernatural phenomena. For anything to actually compare to the original, it would essentially have to be a modern masterpiece.\nMuch like Green's modern Halloween trilogy, The Exorcist: Believer was designed to be the first of a 21st-century Exorcist trilogy, which still might be the case. It's too early to tell whether Green would still be involved in that if Blumhouse decided to stick to that original plan. However, he is a talented enough filmmaker to possibly turn the franchise around with a redemptive Exorcist sequel. The Exorcist brand name will still always turn heads and catch the eyes of fans of the original movie, so not all hope is lost for the franchise that, by most critic's assessments, should have never started.\nLinda Blair was handed a script by Green and was prompted to become a part of The Exorcist: Believer cast. Blair declined despite studio excitement and willingness for her to reprise her role as Regan alongside Burstyn's Chris, which might have produced a more appealing film. This fault can't really be attributed to the film itself, as they at least tried to get Blair on board but were unable to convince her. Blair was a consultant on the film, primarily with the intention of creating a safe space for the child actors on set. Believer could have done more to explain Regan's absence but elected to chalk it up to her becoming estranged from her mother over time.\nRELATED: How Scary The Exorcist: Believer Is\nAt the end of the day, most critics see The Exorcist: Believer exactly for what it is: a flat and predictable horror movie hiding under the guise of a cinematic landmark. This is made even more clear by the sheer lack of imagination in the movie, almost identically hitting every beat of the original without properly building the suspense or believability to at least give it a chance of holding up to the original. Believer ultimately plays it too by the book to the point where it nearly feels like Green wants the audience to see the direct links to the original film but in formulaic structure, not in craftsmanship or effect.\nThe Exorcist: Believer only substantiates the argument that was already made clear with 1977's direct sequel which was equally disastrous. None of the three sequels or two prequels in The Exorcist franchise are any good. Believer should hit the nail on the coffin on a franchise that just wasn't meant to be. William Friedkin himself walked away from talks of The Exorcist 2 for the simple fact that he had no other story to tell with the material. Unfortunately, Blumhouse and Green did not have much of a story to tell with The Exorcist: Believer despite its potential, resulting in yet another disappointing installment of The Exorcist franchise.\n"}

The series marks the latest in a long and ongoing collaboration between Japanese manga publishing powerhouse Shueisha and American comic book publishing legend Marvel Comics.\nAs reported in Anime News Network, this month's issue of Shueisha's Saikyo Jump will feature the debut of Spider-Man: Kizuna - a brand-new ongoing manga following the adventures of a Japanese elementary student who becomes Spider-Man. While further details of the storyline were not announced before its publication, judging from the prior work of its creators, the story will likely include a fair share of high adventure mixed with humorous hijinks. The news title dropped in the October 4, 2023, issue of Saikyo Jump, which will continue to be its publishing platform thereafter.\nSpider-Man: Kizuna is based on Setta Kobayashi and Hachi Mizuno's one-shot of the same name. That story, which was published in September 2022, also appeared In Saikyo Jump. At the time Kobayashi posted a note to his X (formerly Twitter) account stating how excited he was to have the opportunity to work on a manga starring Spider-Man and how he hoped its readers would convince Shueisha or Marvel to serialize the title. While it took a few years, fan support for the Spider-Man: Kizuna one shot must have convinced Shueisha that the story deserved its own dedicated title and continuing series. More recently, Kobayashi went on to state that his aim in creating Spider-Man: Kizuna is to establish a new Japanese version of Spider-Man.\nThis is not the first time Shueisha and Marvel have collaborated. Last summer the two companies announced a manga spinoff to the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse called Spider-Man: Octopus Girl. That story follows the misadventures of Doctor Octopus who, after falling into a coma during another fight with Spider-Man, wakes up to find that he inhabits the mind and body of a Japanese middle school student. Even earlier, in 2019, the two comic publishing giants inked a deal in which a series of one-shot manga stories involving Marvel characters were produced and published on Shueisha's premier manga website Shonen Jump+. That collaboration resulted in the generation of some notable titles including Sanshiro Kasama and Hikaru Uesugi's Deadpool Samurai, and Secret Reverse by Yu-Gi-Oh! author Kazuki Takahashi.\nInterestingly, the 2019 Shueisha - Marvel collaboration also included a work by Mizuno entitled Avengers: Gag Reel which uses a traditional gag/prank manga style to poke fun at the usually super serious Avengers. Kobayashi is also not new to the parody scene. In 2018, he created Asta's Journey to Wizard King, a \"gag manga spinoff\" to Yuki Tabata's Black Clover. While Spider-Man is one of the most wisecracking heroes in Marvel, it certainly would be interesting to see him in an environment where everything could be a joke. If that's what Kobayashi and Mizuno are setting up Spider-Man: Kizuna as, it will definitely be a fresh new take on Marvel's classic hero from Shonen Jump publisher Shueisha.\nSource: Anime News Network, @settaboyashi (1), (2)\nMarcel Green is a writer for Screen Rant's Comics and Anime Sections."}
{"title": "Star Wars Is Setting Up A Villain Bigger Than The  Force Itself", "date": "2023-10-05 22:30:23", "text": "Ahsoka's finale episode sets up a massively powerful villain for Star Wars' future and will likely require the entirety of the Force to defeat.\nWarning! This post contains SPOILERS for Ahsoka episode 8\nAhsoka has set up the canonical return of one of Star Wars' most powerful villains who's bigger than the Force itself. With a powerful presence calling to the Dark Jedi Baylan Skoll (Ray Stevenson), Ahsoka's finale episode gave a major tease as to who Baylan is searching for on the extragalactic world of Peridea. As such, it's quite possible that a huge new threat is coming in Star Wars' future that would be far worse than Grand Admiral Thrawn's return to the known galaxy.\nIn search of power referenced only in myth and fairytales, Baylan Skoll is driven by his desire to break the galaxy's never-ending cycle of light and dark. Rather than wanting to restore the Empire via Thrawn's return, Baylan has his own agenda as soon as he makes it to Peridea, the fabled homeworld of the Nightsisters located in another galaxy. To that end, a major hint in Ahsoka's finale suggests Baylan is being called by Abeloth, a major cosmic entity from Legends connected to the Ones of Mortis, the trio of Force gods first seen in The Clone Wars who have now returned in this new Star Wars show.\nKnown as the Queen of Stars and Bringer of Chaos, Abeloth was first introduced in Legends' Fate of the Jedi novels by Aaron Allston, Christie Golden, and Troy Denning. Set during the New Republic era, Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order faced Abeloth, a threat far more powerful than the Sith and the dark side. However, the books and Abeloth were removed from the official canon following Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm and the Star Wars IP back in 2012. Nevertheless, the provided backstory and origins for Abeloth are directly tied to the Ones who remained part of the canon given their appearances in The Clone Wars season 3.\nAbeloth was once a mortal woman who began serving the Ones as the Father strove to keep his children in balance, the Son embodying the dark side of the Force while the Daughter represented the light. Eventually, she became part of their family as the Mother, helping the Father keep the children in balance. However, the woman continued to age unlike her family of immortals, motivating her decision to drink and swim in the forbidden Font of Power and Pool of Knowledge.\nThe Mother transformed into the Force being known as Abeloth, gaining extreme power while also being corrupted and twisted to madness. As such, the Father and his children abandoned Abeloth for Mortis as the world quickly became corrupted and darkened. The Ones also created a prison to contain Abeloth, though she would break out anytime there was a major disruption in the balance of the Force, requiring the Son and Daughter to work together to imprison her once more. Once the Mortis gods died as seen in The Clone Wars season 3, Abeloth was unleashed for good during the New Republic era.\nRelated: Thrawn's Zombie Stormtroopers Explained: Magick, Power & Star Wars Future\nKeeping Abeloth and her Legends' history in mind, it does look as though Ahsoka is setting up her return to the official Star Wars canon very soon. Believing that even the Nightsisters' Great Mothers feared the hidden power calling to him, Baylan may be searching for Abeloth herself. Considering the power and magicks at the disposal of the Great Mothers, this mysterious being has to be something incredibly dangerous to get them so scared, and Abeloth definitely fits the bill. It would certainly explain why the Mothers are so subservient to Grand Admiral Thrawn seeing as how he's their only way to escape Peridea.\nAdditionally, Abeloth's imprisonment could also be why the witch kingdom fell in the first place and why the planet is largely a wasteland. Perhaps it was corrupted over time by Abeloth's influence and containment. Abeloth on Peridea could also explain why the purrgil star whales changed their migration routes in the ancient past, seeing as how they now only come to Peridea to die, hence the planet's rings being comprised solely of the whales' bones.\nIt's not hard to see how Abeloth and Baylan's goals could align. Wanting to create a new era for the galaxy that's no longer burdened by the constant conflict of light and dark, Abeloth could certainly manipulate Baylan into releasing her (if she hasn't broken free already). Following her corruption and descent into madness, Abeloth sought to bring about a galactic apocalypse, allowing her to create a brand-new galaxy in its place where she would be loved and adored (despite being an entity of pure chaos and entropy). As such, Abeloth calling out to Baylan is more than plausible.\nRelated: 15 Star Wars Easter Eggs In Episode 8\nAbeloth was already being theorized as the one calling Baylan Skoll before Ahsoka's finale. Now, Baylan finding massive statues of the Mortis gods hugely supports those ideas for Star Wars' future. Clearly, the Ones had an influence on Peridea which could very well be Abeloth's prison and/or her original world before the Force gods abandoned her for Mortis. To that end, this unnamed world was indeed described in the novels as a \"mountainous forest world\" just like the valley Baylan discovers at the end of Ahsoka. Perhaps it's one of the last regions that hasn't been turned into a wasteland from Abeloth's own influence on Peridea.\nAs seen in the final shots of Ahsoka's finale episode, the statue of the Father points across the valley to the mountains on the other side. Likewise, one of the peaks features some sort of shining beacon or glint, clearly representing the endpoint for Baylan's quest before he discovers who or what has been calling to him ever since he came to Peridea, having fully abandoned not only Morgan Elsbeth's efforts to bring back Thrawn but also Baylan's own apprentice Shin Hati. As such, the odds are very strong that Baylan will discover far more than he bargained for, especially if it's Abeloth.\nThere's some solid evidence that Abeloth will soon make her Star Wars comeback either in a possible Ahsoka season 2 or some other Star Wars project in the works. To that end, it will likely require both the light and dark sides of the Force joining together to even have a hope of containing Abeloth (let alone destroying her for good). Thanks to Baylan Skoll's discovery in Ahsoka's finale, the future of Star Wars just got incredibly exciting and even more dangerous all at the same time.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}

Debuting nine years after Band of Brothers originally aired, The Pacific acted as a companion to the widely acclaimed miniseries. Although it didn't quite measure up to the bar set by Band of Brothers, The Pacific was renowned for its visual and technical execution and overlapping individual stories as opposed to the broader focus of Band of Brothers.\nHowever, The Pacific never achieved the same level of popularity as Band of Brothers for a litany of reasons. Part of it was certainly its coverage of the Pacific War, widely considered a much more brutal and horrifying conflict than its European counterpart in WWII, which was viscerally depicted on screen. Another key element that The Pacific was missing was the massive, star-studded cast of Band of Brothers. In that regard, Masters of the Air is already improving upon the first companion series.\nThe cast of Band of Brothers was largely made up of small-time or unknown actors, some of whom went on to become major film stars. However, it also included a long list of already-established stars like David Schwimmer, Scott Grimes, Donnie Wahlberg and Ron Livingston. The Pacific was missing the excitement of those existing stars for people to look out for. While some of the members of the cast did go on to become major stars (including Rami Malek, Jon Bernthal and James Badge Dale), they were all relative unknowns at the time the show aired.\nRelated: Masters of the Air Has Broken a Major Band of Brothers Tradition (& It's Worrying)\nMasters of the Air will not have the same issue, as its cast will be led by two of cinema's more recognizable faces--Austin Butler and Barry Keoghan. Academy Award nominee Austin Butler is fresh off playing Elvis Presley in the acclaimed biopic Elvis, and has featured roles in the highly-anticipated upcoming movies The Bikeriders and Dune: Part II. One of his primary co-stars in Masters of the Air is the also-Academy Award-nominated Barry Keoghan, who has had significant roles in cinematic juggernauts like Marvels The Eternals and Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk. Both actors are supremely talented, which is an exciting prospect for how emotionally impactful Masters of the Air will be.\nThe first images from Masters of the Air provided a glimpse of the aesthetic that will dominate the companion series, as well as the first look at Butler and Keoghan's characters. Butler is set to portray Major Gale Cleven, and Keoghan will play Lt. Curtis Biddick, both of whom were real-life members of the 100th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces. Nicknamed \"The Bloody Hundredth\" due to how few of their pilots returned from their raids in 1943, the 100th Bombardment Group attacked German forces and industrial targets across Western Europe.\nButler and Keoghan's real-life counterparts were both B-17 Flying Fortress bomber pilots, which will certainly be reflected in the show given that it is accurately based upon the book Masters of the Air from historian Donald L. Miller. Early images from Masters of the Air seem to indicate that while Butler and Keoghan may be the primary leads for the show, emphasis and screen time will be dispersed among the entire ensemble cast, much as it was for Band of Brothers. The return to that format is exciting in itself, but the fact that it will be led by two legitimate stars gives Masters of the Air and early leg up on its predecessor The Pacific.\n"}
{"title": "Totally Killer Producers Talk Blumhouse's Time Travel Slasher Thriller & Challenge Of Modest Budgets", "date": "2023-10-05 22:30:23", "text": "Totally Killer producers Greg Gilreath and Adam Hendricks talk Blumhouse's time-traveling slasher and the challenge of trimming modest budget scripts.\nFrom the studio behind hit horror-comedy mashups Freaky and Happy Death Day comes another fresh take on the slasher genre with Totally Killer. The Blumhouse-produced title centers on a teenager whose mother is killed by a serial killer who terrorized her small town almost 30 years before and finds a way to time travel back to the original killing spree, leading her to team up with the younger version of her mom and her friends to stop the killer and get back to the present before it's too late.\nThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina alum Kiernan Shipka leads the star-studded Totally Killer cast alongside Olivia Holt, Julie Bowen, Randall Park, Lochlyn Munro, Charlie Gillespie, Liana Liberato, Kelcey Mawema, Stephi Cin-Salvo and Anna Diaz. Bringing the same self-aware humor as Blumhouse's prior genre mashups for another hilarious and thrilling combo, the movie arrives just in time for the Halloween season.\nRelated: New On Amazon Prime Video: All 138 Movies & TV Shows Arriving In October\nIn anticipation of the movie's release, Screen Rant spoke exclusively with producers Greg Gilreath and Adam Hendricks to discuss Totally Killer, the search for the perfect director for the script's vision, and the challenge of trimming down scenes to accommodate larger set pieces.\nScreen Rant: Greg, I'm very excited to talk about Totally Killer. How did the script first come to you, and what about it really spoke to your interest to want to help produce it?\nGreg Gilreath: Great questions, it was a script that was floating around at Amazon, and they were kind of up on it. We had partnered with Blumhouse and Amazon on this sort of small slate of films, and it was one that was in the mix. Just reading it, it was so apparent right away that this was something that could be really memorable, really fun, and really stand out and allow you to have a great viewing experience. A lot of these comedy-horror films are really reliant on self-referential [humor], sort of really understanding the depths of the slasher genre, or things like that.\nI really love that this was kind of an entry point into the into this thing, it was like, \"You don't need the deep knowledge of slasher films,\" it could kind of be a first step in, and it really was so comedy forward, we knew that we had the right director and the right cast on this. It could be sort of a door into the horror genre for a lot of people who might tell themselves, \"I don't like horror films,\" and I think it really has succeeded in that, because it's so funny, and here's so much heart. All the comedy comes from character, and emotion, and nostalgia, and sort of subverting nostalgia, as opposed to being like, \"Hey, you remember that scene in Prom Night when this thing happened? And if you don't, you won't get the joke.\"\nAdam Hendricks: I think that there are a few things. One is that the scope is really fun, it's a challenge, there's big action set pieces, lots of extras in '80s costumes, hair even, like, hair's a big deal. I think that was really exciting. I think that for us, humor wise, the opportunity of doing a film where someone with a contemporary viewpoint goes back to the '80s where people are unfiltered, and all of a sudden, just realizing that that time that I was born in — it's so long ago from now, it's as far away as the '80s were from the '40s like, how insane is that conceptually?\nFinally, [we just] love Natch, what a cool filmmaker, what a great person to get behind. This is her only horror thing, we loved all her non-horror stuff, and Greg and I think our tastes go way beyond, even though we're like we're such horror babies, we also just love all types of film. To have someone who's succeeded in television shows, but also rom-coms, and basically saying, \"I really want to murder people on screen,\" it's like, how do you not get behind that?\nYou talked about looking for the right director and the right cast, which did you find was the most important step first? Did you feel that the script needed to be touched up, or did you feel that Blumhouse and Amazon already had it set up, and you just wanted to help get the director?\nGreg Gilreath: I think it's always director first. It was a great script, but the thing that we always look for in a director that didn't write the script is a director who is like, \"This is a great foundation, but here's how I'm going to do this and make this my own.\" We knew that the script was excellent, but that finding that director who had a vision for it and had like a real keen understanding of, \"This is how I will hone this, and shape this, and maybe change it up just a little bit from what it was originally conceived,\" that was by far the most important piece of this puzzle.\nHow challenging would you say that journey was to find the perfect person who had that vision?\nGreg Gilreath: It was both incredibly difficult and incredibly easy. It's like when it's blue skies, and in your mind, you could have anything that you could possibly ever imagine or go out to any director, you have lists with hundreds of people, and you're watching films, and you're talking about it. Then, once we kind of hit on Nahnatchka, and talked about it some more, and then once we met with her, it became clear that she is the person to direct this film, so it was really easy. Once we spent those months, dreaming big and talking about everything, and everybody you could possibly imagine, and then it really collapsed in an amazing way as soon as we talked to her.\nOne of the things that also really surprised me about this movie is that despite having Blumhouse's name attached, it feels like a very big movie, production-wise. The sets and action feel pretty high-scale. What is that like from your position as a producer, trying to help bring the script to life, bring some of those big sets to life, while maintaining a modest budget for a streaming release?\nGreg Gilreath: Yeah, so, it's true of every single movie that's ever been made, there's never enough time or money to do everything you want, unless you're doing an Adam Sandler Netflix movie, where they're just like, \"Whatever you want,\" but outside of that, there's never enough time or enough money. So, Adam [Hendricks] and I have done over 30 movies at this point, and the process is really getting in there with the writer and the director, and the department heads on the movie, and sort of being like, \"What is the essence of the story that we have to keep?\"\nThere's always scenes that go, and fat that's trimmed, and there's always calls of like, \"Okay, these seven scenes, we really need to spend all of our money, and then maybe on these ones, we could just find a location that's already got all this stuff in it, and just maybe shift it a little bit, or maybe instead of shooting a big wide for this scene, we can kind of contain it a little bit to the small part of the room, because we know there will be those two people talking. It would be great to have that big wide, but having just two people talking close up like that will really give us the scope to go do the Gravitron, or do this chase sequence, or something like that.\" So, honing in on what those pieces are — and to Nahnatchka's credit too, we were way over budget at one point, and she was so adamant — and she was correct — that the Gravitron sequence tt the end had to stay, and if that went away, there would be no movie that was worth making.\nEverybody at a certain point, everybody — not fought her on it, but questioned whether that was the best choice. Because it was like, \"What if we made everything else 15% better?\", but she was like, \"Absolutely not. We're doing this.\" So we had to reverse engineer the movie and really dig into the script with her about like, \"Okay, this scene's four pages, can it be one? We have these three scenes, can they be two, we have these five characters, can we get that information in one?\" It was a real process of breaking down the movie scene-by-scene and element-by-element, and figuring out what can go and what has to stay?\nI'm actually really glad she fought for that Gravitron scene, it's radical. In talking about going back to the script and trimming things here and there, what would you say was the hardest scene that you really reworked to fit this budget?\nGreg Gilreath: That's a great question. I think there's a lot of different ways to slice that, so like the Dollhouse of Horrors, the haunted house sequence where they sort of finally get the killer, and the pre-Gravitron sequence. That was a thing that existed at the amusement park in Vancouver, we were going to at first build this whole giant thing that we were going to do, and we couldn't figure out how to afford it, and our production designer, Liz, was pitching all these ideas about, \"Well, what if we just did like an elaborate entrance, and then everything else was kind of minimalist? Or what if it was outside?\" We had 100 different conceptions of what that area was called, it was called the Enchanted Forest at a time, just so many conceptions of what that could be, and none of them felt great.\nThen, there was this moment where I was like, \"Wait, what's that weird, spooky building over there that's kind of boarded up? Can we go in there?\" And the locations rep was like, \"Oh, sure, I guess you can.\" Once we put our heads in there, it kind of all clicked for that scene, and that's the great thing about making a movie, where you're just sort of a little bit of kismet, we just happened to be walking over there, and somebody happened to be curious about what this creepy looking building was. Then, once we went in, it became clear that we were spinning our wheels and wasting our time on trying to build a whole new thing for that sequence that was never going to work, it was just never going to work because we didn't have the resources or the time to do it properly.\nAlso, I think knowing when to cut bait and pivot is such an exceptionally rare tool right now. I think that was probably the biggest change that we made from what the script was, everything else was just little [things], like the party kill sequence. There was an extra beat on the stairs, there was another thing in the garage, so it's like very surgical, for the most part, just carving out little things.\n35 years after the shocking murder of three teens, the infamous “Sweet Sixteen Killer“ returns on Halloween night to claim a fourth victim. 17-year-old Jamie (Kiernan Shipka) ignores her overprotective mom’s (Julie Bowen) warning and comes face to face with the masked maniac and on the run for her life, accidentally time travels back to 1987, the year of the original killings.

{"title": "The Boys: 10 Characters Fans Wish Could Have Died Twice", "date": "2023-10-05 22:30:23", "text": "There's plenty of deaths in The Boys, but some are more deserved than others. Here are the Top 10 The Boys characters fans wish could have died twice!\nThe Boys has no shortage of gruesome deaths splattered throughout its fictional world, and while that may be hard for some fans to stomach, those who are killed usually more than deserve what they get, making their deaths oh so satisfying. In fact, these select characters are so despicable, one death just doesn’t seem like enough of a punishment for them.\nWithin The Boys universe (created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson), practically everyone of note with superpowers is a vile, repugnant excuse for a human being. Sexual assault is rampant, drug use is a given, and even murder is commonplace among the separate superhero teams - including and especially the Seven. That isn’t to say there aren’t regular humans who are deserving of death in this world, as there are more than a few who are even worse than those with superpowers - which is something this very list will reflect. Between those who abuse their superpowers and those who are somehow just as bad without them, here are the Top 10 worst characters in The Boys who fans wish could have died twice.\nIt doesn’t take long for The Boys to establish exactly why A-Train deserves to die. In the very first issue, A-Train callously runs through a living person - specifically, Hughie’s girlfriend, Robin - while chasing a super-villain, killing her instantly. Then, in The Boys #3, A-Train is one of the three supes who sexual assault Starlight right after she’s been brought on to the Seven. In the end, Hughie kicks A-Train’s head right off his body after getting a jolt from some Compound V Butcher gives him, and that quick death is far more than he deserved.\nThe first example of a non-powered villain on this list, Little Nina is the head of a Russian crime syndicate who plotted to overthrow the Kremlin and appoint herself as the new head of state. Her plan was to use a group of supes to pull off this coup, and if it weren’t for the Boys, she would have likely succeeded. In The Boys #14, Little Nina suffers a relatively quick - albeit incredibly bizarre - death after a bomb goes off right next to her (or possibly inside her body), killing her in the explosion. Little Nina dedicated her life to gaining power at the expense of others, as she was no stranger to manipulation, torture, and - of course - murder, making her death all the more satisfying.\nA supe who picks on those weaker than him just for a laugh, and who manipulates those around him by making them fear for their lives. That is Malchemical, and fans assuredly wanted to see him dead from the moment he first appeared in The Boys #40. Malchemical has the power to alter his body’s molecular structure in a variety of ways. He can do anything from classic shapeshifting to turning himself into a cloud of poison gas. In fact, it was the latter form that killed him, as Butcher lit a match when Malchemical was in a gaseous state, lighting him on fire and burning him to death. His anticipated demise came after Malchemical tormented a relatively innocent group of supes, who weren’t very good superheroes, but tried their best to be. Those who prey on the most vulnerable deserve the most horrific of fates, and in Malchemical’s case, he deserves it twice.\nFirst and foremost, Stormfront is a Nazi, so that in and of itself earned him a place on this list. But even if he wasn’t, Stormfront still proved to be a despicable superhero and human being all the way up until his death in The Boys #37. According to his canon history within The Boys lore, Stormfront was used by Vought-American in conjunction with the United States government to commit local atrocities like killing off the entirety of a Native American tribe for the sake of building a dam on their land. Stormfront actively enjoyed killing people, as it made him feel more powerful, and that’s why watching him get stomped to death by The Boys was so satisfying.\nEvery horrible act of sexual violence, drug abuse, or flat-out murder committed by pretty much any supe in The Boys - including and especially those of the Seven - are made possible by this man, James Stillwell. Stillwell makes sure the proverbial curtains remain closed to the public when it comes to the horrific things done by Vought-American’s supes, and he’s paid a lot of money for doing this. In fact, James Stillwell is so bad that his fate is actually far worse than anyone else on this list: he’s still alive. As revealed in The Boys: Dear Becky, James lost his mind following the events of The Boys’ series finale, as he’s spotted roaming a pineapple plantation, raving about ‘good product vs bad product’. His fate is one that he has to wake up to day after agonizing day. That moment when he finally snapped was just as finalizing as any death on this list, and it’s something fans can only hope he still remembers deep within his now-fractured psyche.\nHaving recently made his live-action debut in the new Prime series Gen V, The Boys fans should now be at least semi familiar with John Godolkin, though they may still not know the full extent of his heinous crimes in the comics. Debuting in The Boys #24, Godolkin is the leader of the G-Men, as well as the person who runs a school for young supes. On paper, Godolkin is an upstanding citizen and leader of a high-profile superhero team. Behind closed doors, however, John Godolkin is a pedophile who victimizes the young supes in his care. Godolkin is gunned down by a small army deployed by Vought-American, along with practically every supe in his school, and the world became a safer place immediately following his grisly death.\nAnything bad done by Homelander is immediately made worse by the fact that he’s supposed to be this world’s ‘Superman’, and is meant to be the shining light of inspiration and hope in a world filled with violence and terror. But, as it turns out, Homelander is a genuine piece of human garbage who deserved every bit of the gruesome death he got. In The Boys #65, Black Noir reveals himself to be an enhanced (and mentally unstable) clone of Homelander who was created to kill him if he ever got out of hand - which he does in spectacular fashion. Within the Oval Office of the White House, Black Noir rips Homelander to shreds with his bare hands, leaving nothing left of the repugnant Superman knock-off except one of his arms and a bit of his torso.\nWhile Black Noir did the world a favor by killing Homelander, he wasn’t exactly a saint himself. In fact, the only reason Homelander was worth killing at all was because of Black Noir. Since Black Noir’s entire purpose was to kill Homelander if he got out of line, Black Noir took it upon himself to push Homelander over that line. He looked just like Homelander, so Black Noir put on Homelander’s suit, committed unspeakable acts of violence, and took pictures of himself doing it. This was all done in an effort to make Homelander think he did these things, pushing him to become the villain he already thought he was, and making it acceptable for Black Noir finally fulfill his dark purpose. After that was done - and after Homelander put up a hell of a fight - Billy Butcher finished off Black Noir himself, and the supe clone deserved every moment of agony the leader of the Boys put him through.\nSamuel Butcher, husband of Connie Butcher, father to Billy and Lenny Butcher, was a baker in London’s East End, though it’s heavily implied that he moonlit as a career criminal for cash on the side. Why he’s on this list isn’t because he supposedly had a penchant for breaking the law, however, but because he was a heavily abusive husband and father. Sam would mercilessly beat his wife in front of their kids, going so far as to blind her in one eye during a particularly violent rage-filled outburst. He was a cruel, sick man with a family who feared and hated him to their core. He died an unspectacular death in The Boys storyline “Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker”, with one of his own sons urinating on his corpse.\nWhile many might think of Butcher as one of the main protagonists of The Boys, they’d be very wrong. Butcher’s entire life revolved around intimidating, threatening, and blackmailing people into doing whatever he wanted. While he used this skill for good with the Boys by keeping supe’s in-line, he also did it with Vogelbaum, the man who created Compound V, and forced him to create a new compound that would kill every single supe in the world - effectively creating a means for genocide on a global scale. Not only that, but Butcher killed every single member of the Boys himself (except Hughie), turning on the people who trusted him the most. Butcher is seductively charming, to be sure, but he’s a bona fide super-villain, and his death in The Boys #71 couldn’t have come soon enough.\nThe heinous atrocities committed by everyone on this list makes them more than deserving of their violent fates. In fact, it’s safe to say that they should have to live their deaths at least one more time all over again, as these Top 10 The Boys characters are the ones fans wish could have died twice.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

Based on the Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoons, the 1995 movie follows teenager Kat (Ricci) as she joins her father James (Bill Pullman) to communicate with Casper and his fellow ghosts, who peacefully haunt a mansion in Maine. Casper quickly falls for Kat, but his deceased nature and mischievous ghostly uncles cause trouble for the young pair. The box office hit is still as charming today as it was 28 years ago, making Casper one of the best nostalgia watches this Halloween on Netflix.\nSteven Spielberg ushered in a wave of blockbuster filmmaking with Jaws in 1975, which remains one of the scariest and most thrilling movies nearly 50 years later. Jaws, which is based on the same-titled 1974 novel, surrounds the summer resort town of Amity as a man-eating great white shark continues to attack beachgoers, leading the police chief Brody, marine biologist Hooper, and professional shark hunter Quint to team up and hunt down the sea creature. The three-time Oscar winner has been frightening people out of the water for several decades since its debut, with Jaws’ streaming availability on Netflix being apt to scare new generations of prospective beachgoers.\nA prequel to the 2014 box off hit Ouija, Mike Flanagan’s horror movie follow-up premiered in 2016 to significantly greater critical acclaim than its predecessor. Ouija: Origin of Evil takes the story back to 1967, beginning when a widow working as a spiritual medium introduces a Ouija board into her family’s phony séance business. When the board actually conjures a spirit that possesses her daughter, Ouija: Origin of Evil takes twisted turns that prove to be even scarier and dramatic than the original movie. Mike Flanagan proves to be the king of horror on Netflix, with his Universal-backed Ouija: Origin of Evil being available alongside his Netflix originals this Halloween.\nThe cult classic 2008 horror movie The Strangers stands out among Netflix’s Halloween movie catalog. While it received mixed reviews upon release and became a sleeper hit at the box office, The Strangers’ cult status turned it into a multi-film franchise with three follow-ups already confirmed. The true story-inspired psychological horror film offers plenty of scares and homages to classic slashers from the 1970s, with The Strangers itself having often been reassessed as a modern horror classic.\nRob Zombie’s movie adaptation of the classic 1960s sitcom The Munsters arrived on Netflix in 2022, serving as the origin story of the romance between Herman and Lily Munster. While Rob Zombie’s The Munsters movie wasn’t received very well by critics, the cult approach of the adaptation makes it ripe for better reception upon additional viewing. Zombie may be better known for his gorier horror outings, but Netflix original movie The Munsters provides a charming PG-rated macabre story that the entire family can enjoy.\nThe second installment in Netflix 2021 Fear Street movie trilogy, Fear Street Part Two: 1978 takes the story back to a fateful night in the Shadyside and Sunnyvale lore. The two towns are brought together for summer camp only for a killer to gruesomely attack Camp Nightwing’s kids and teens, with plenty of Easter eggs and homages to classic flasher movies like Friday the 13th. Starring Stranger Things’ Sadie Sink and One Piece’s Emily Rudd, Fear Street Part Two: 1978’s ending features some unexpected twists and that brilliantly lead into the trilogy’s third and final installment.\nFrom Coraline and The Nightmare Before Christmas director Henry Selick, Wendell & Wild revives the classic stop-motion animated horror movie trend with a spooky story about two demon brothers who receive help from an orphaned teenage girl. The 2022 Netflix original movie surprisingly boasts a PG-13 rating, making the stop-motion film’s macabre themes more suitable for older audiences. However, the critically-acclaimed movie still provides plenty of spooky humor and striking visuals that make it a perfect Halloween watch.\nAlso streaming on Netflix this Halloween is Hotel Transylvania 2, the second installment in Todd Durham’s monster franchise. The 2015 animated box office hit brings back voice actors such as Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James, and Keegan-Michael Key as Dracula, his classic monster friends and family, and human son-in-law. Coming in at under 90 minutes, the spooky family-friendly monster movie provides a brief and entertaining story to stream on Netflix this Halloween season.\nAdam Sandler’s 2020 supernatural mystery movie Hubie Halloween may not have landed with critics, but the comedy still boasts a talented ensemble cast and entertaining story to get into the Halloween spirit. The Netflix original follows the titular character (played by Sandler) on Halloween as he monitors the town of Salem, Massachusetts in an attempt to save his fellow residents from a kidnapper. Adam Sandler has produced numerous comedy movies for Netflix over the years, with Hubie Halloween providing annual holiday fun that appeals to kids and adults alike.\nThe 2008 animated horror-comedy Igor is also available to watch on Netflix this Halloween. While originally receiving mixed reviews from critics, Igor has gained a cult following over the 15 years since its release, with its availability on Netflix’s Halloween hub inevitably introducing it to a new generation of viewers. Igor is inspired by the titular character who has appeared in various forms in supernatural monster movies, typically as an assistant to an evil scientist or villainous monster. However, this animated movie flips the evil scientist assistant trope, as Igor accidentally creates a kind female monster in his attempt to move from assistant to an evil scientist himself.\nIn addition to his Ouija prequel, Mike Flanagan’s 2017 psychological horror movie Gerald’s Game is streaming on Netflix in October 2023. The Netflix original movie is based on Stephen King’s 1992 novel of the same name, which had largely been considered unfilmable before Flanagan’s critically acclaimed outing. Starring frequent Mike Flanagan collaborators Carla Gugino, Bruce Greenwood, Kate Siegel, and Henry Thomas, Gerald’s Game is centered around Jessie Burlingame, who is left stranded and handcuffed to her bed without a key after her husband dies of a heart attack. While trying to survive in the isolated cabin, Jessie is confronted with her personal demons in one of Mike Flanagan’s most chilling movies.\nJohn Carpenter’s 1998 neo-Western horror movie Vampires is streaming on Netflix just in time for Halloween viewing. The Halloween director’s film follows a team of vampire hunters who try to prevent a centuries-old cross from falling into the hands of a powerful vampire, which leads to non-stop gory showdowns. While not as critically adored his Carpenter’s classics like Halloween and The Thing, 1998’s Vampires takes him into another horror subgenre that still embodies the filmmaker’s iconic style.\nGuillermo del Toro has proven himself to be a master in the supernatural horror genre, with Crimson Peak’s gothic romance story being a brilliant execution of his visual style and themes. The 2015 movie stars Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, and Tom Hiddleston in Edwardian-era England as a newly-married young aspiring author moves into an isolated Gothic mansion with new husband and sister-in-law. However, she soon must solve a twisted mystery as ghosts haunt her new abode. With primarily positive reviews from critics and several award wins in the horror genre, Crimson Peak is a brilliantly spooky movie to watch on Netflix this Halloween.\nThe third installment in Netflix’s Fear Street movie trilogy, Fear Street Part Three: 1666 brings the tale back to the titular year while revealing the truth behind Sarah Fier and the “cursed” nature of Shadyside. The twists in the flashbacks lead to a thrilling reckoning in the “present” timeline of 1994, which continues the gory nature of the first two installments. Fear Street Part Three: 1666 received the highest critical acclaim of the three movies, marking a satisfying conclusion to the scary R.L. Stine-inspired Netflix trilogy.\nThe 2022 horror film The Invitation, inspired by the classic story Dracula, depicts the horrifying tale of a young woman who meets her long-lost family members after her mother’s death, leading to her discovery of their dangerous and dark secrets. While a modest success at the box office, The Invitation provides a chilling vampire story with a mesmerizing performance by former Game of Thrones actor Nathalie Emmanuele. Of the modern horror hits available to watch on Netflix this October, The Invitation will satisfy vampire subgenre Halloween viewing.\nThe 2019 supernatural horror movie The Wretched is another relatively recent outing available to steam on Netflix’s Halloween catalog. The creepy horror film follows a teenage boy who vies against an evil witch posing as his next-door neighbor, which satisfies many of the expected supernatural witch-in-the-woods movie tropes. The Wretched also boasts critical acclaim and a significant box office return, as the movie earned back over $4 million against a small budget under $100 thousand. With a teenage ensemble taking it upon themselves to battle a witch, The Wretched also drew frequent comparisons to Netflix’s own Stranger Things.\nCreep stands out as one of the most critically acclaimed horror movies within Netflix’s available Halloween content, as the 2014 found footage film received substantial praise from critics upon release. With plenty of thrills and captivating performances by its cast, Creep’s creepy tale follows a videographer who is tasked with filming an eccentric client at a remote cabin. The success of the Blumhouse-produced horror movie even spawned a critically acclaimed sequel in 2018, which is expected to be followed by the sequel Creep 3.\nNetflix has several Stephen King-inspired movies in its library, with 2019’s In the Tall Grass being based on the same-titled novella by King and his son Joe Hill. The Netflix original horror movie follows a brother and sister who are unable to escape a dangerous field of tall grass after entering in the hopes of saving a boy, providing plenty of scares expected of a Stephen King movie adaptation. In the Tall Grass also stars horror veteran Patrick Wilson, who is best known for his roles in The Conjuring and Insidious franchises.\nAnother Netflix original horror movie to stream this Halloween is The Babysitter, the streaming service’s 2017 black comedy horror film directed by McG. The Babysitter stars Scream Queen Samara Weaving, Judah Lewis, and Bella Thorne, with the film centering on a 12-year-old who learns that his babysitter is involved in a satanic cult that plans to kill him. The positively-reviewed Netflix original even launched a sequel in 2020, which stars Scream and Wednesday actress Jenna Ortega.\nAmong the most recent horror movies that is available to stream on Netflix for Halloween is The Pope’s Exorcist, which debuted in theaters in April 2023 to mixed reviews from critics, but proved successful at the box office. Starring Russell Crowe as the real demon-fighting exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth, The Pope’s Exorcist is inspired by the priest’s real claims, adding another creepy layer to the movie’s scares. Crowe’s performance allows Father Amorth’s demon-battling adventures to be a crowd-pleasing horror outing, providing a thrilling possession movie to watch this Halloween on Netflix.\n"}

{"title": "&quot;I Believe in Them&quot;: Red Hood Reveals the 1 Gotham Hero He Actually Respects", "date": "2023-10-05 22:00:26", "text": "Things in Gotham are changing at a rapid pace and Red Hood reveals that there’s one hero he’s come to respect (and it isn’t the Dark Knight).\nWarning! Contains spoilers for Catwoman #57!There's one hero in Gotham that Red Hood respects more than others. While facing off against his former mentor, Jason Todd informs Batman of a hero that the vigilante is starting to hold in high regard.\nIn Catwoman #57 by Tini Howard and Nico Leon, Batman is still in shock from losing his Batcave to Vandal Savage. As Bruce makes his next plans to stop Catwoman's newest criminal enterprise, Selina is one step ahead. She comes up with a plan to train her underlings to become car thieves and puts Red Hood in charge of the operation.\nAs Red Hood and a group of thieves pose as valets, Batman comes to stop him. Jason leads Bruce on a chase to distract him while Selina and several of her trainees rob a gala blind. Batman doesn't hold back from his former sidekick and yanks Red Hood off of his motorcycle with a grapple gun. As Bruce begs Jason to stop his alliance with Catwoman, Jason makes the point that he has a lot more in common with Selina than Bruce. Red Hood makes it blunt that he believes in Selina and her plan to make Gotham better.\nThe \"Gotham War\" crossover has made some major cracks in the Bat-Family. While Batman was recovering from Knight Terrors, Catwoman began training low-level criminals to break out on their own and target Gotham's wealthiest. As a result, Gotham's supervillains are floundering from a lack of henchmen and street crime has gone considerably down. All Selina asked was for the Bat-Family to not interrupt her operation, but Batman starkly refused. With no one but Damian on his side, Batman has begun pushing himself to end Catwoman's plans by any means necessary.\nBatman has lost nearly all his allies due to them seeing the validity of Catwoman's plans but it's surprising to see Jason on board with her. After all, just a few years before this, he spent his days terrorizing those who broke the law, killing an untold number of criminals. Now he's wholeheartedly endorsing Selina's plan. Admittedly, his line of logic makes sense. Both Jason and Selina didn't have the privileged upbringing that Bruce had and understand how desperation drives people to crime. For better or worse, Catwoman is actively changing Gotham for the better, and her work is doing what Batman never could: Inspire Red Hood.\nIt's not a stretch to say that Batman and Red Hood have a combative relationship. Jason has tried over and over again to get Bruce's approval but has had a tough time earning it. Selina, on the other hand, acknowledges the skills Jason has and has rewarded his efforts by making him a huge part of her plans. Red Hood is getting something from Catwoman that he hasn't gotten from Batman in a while: Respect and appreciation. In turn, Jason is confirming that he respects what Selina is doing and admits that he truly thinks she can make the city better.

{"title": "Was Halloween Ends Really That Bad? Re-Examining The $105M Disappointment, 1 Year Later", "date": "2023-10-05 21:50:25", "text": "Halloween Ends is one of the most controversial entries in the beloved horror franchise, but looking back on the film, is it really that bad?\nHalloween Ends is one of the most controversial films in the iconic horror franchise, and while the $105 million box office disappointment was initially met with poor reception, was it really that bad? Halloween Ends came out one year ago in October 2022, with the film wrapping up David Gordon Green's Halloween reboot trilogy. The third entry in the trilogy was definitely a risky move, with it putting a new spin on the Halloween franchise that hadn't been seen before. However, this spin didn't resonate with many Halloween fans, leading to Halloween Ends becoming a critical and commercial failure - but did it deserve this reception?\nHalloween Ends is the final entry in the Halloween reboot trilogy, which itself retconned all of the Halloween sequels and directly followed up on John Carpenter's 1978 original. Halloween Ends is set four years after the events of Halloween Kills, with Michael Myers having been missing for the previous few Halloweens. In his absence, the town of Haddonfield has grown increasingly paranoid and violent, almost as if Myers had put a curse on the town. Unbeknownst to Haddonfield's residents, Michael Myers has been living in the sewers, healing himself as he prepares to reign terror once again. However, this time the masked killer has some help.\nThe Halloween reboot trilogy had a pretty poor time in the critical marketplace, with none of the films being met with overwhelming positive reviews. Reviews for Halloween 2018 were ok, but the same can't be said for Halloween Kills or the subject of this analysis, 2022's Halloween Ends. As of the writing of this article, Halloween Ends sits at a 40% critical rating and a 57% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes, showing that the film didn't really gel with either fans or critics. Upon its release, Halloween Ends was torn to shreds, with a movement to reassess the movie only starting up recently.\nFans and critics had many problems with Halloween Ends, but they mostly are due to Michael Myers' connection to Corey Cunningham. In the film, Corey begins making a name for himself as a masked killer in Haddonfield, with him even acting as Michael Myers' sidekick at some points. Corey was arguably the main character in the film, which was a point of contention with fans. According to these fans, the scary part of Michael Myers is his mystery, something that doesn't work with Corey due to his prominence in the film. Some have even called Halloween Ends the worst entry in the franchise, showing how disappointing it was to some.\nHalloween Ends' critical reception wasn't the only thing that was disappointing, as the box office was pretty underwhelming as well. Halloween Ends made only $105.4 million on a $33 million budget, which is a huge step-down from Halloween 2018 making $259.9 million on a $10 million budget. While Halloween Ends was probably profitable, it most likely didn't meet the expectations of the studio. This financial failure is mostly due to Halloween Ends having a simultaneous release in theaters and on Peacock, with this streaming strategy undoubtedly kneecapping the film's box office returns. Thus, Halloween Ends failed on both critical and commercial fronts.\nRelated: Halloween Ends Cast & Character Guide\nAlthough Halloween Ends was received poorly, it is not nearly as bad as initially thought. The themes that are pulled in due to Corey Cunningham's story are truly unique to Halloween Ends, with them not having been seen in the franchise before. Halloween Ends also features some moments that are truly surprising, such as the opening scene. Halloween Ends' never lets the audience in on where it's going, so while every idea may not work out, it is at least trying something new. Corey Cunningham is the breath of fresh air that Halloween needed, which is why it's so odd that the film has been looked down upon.\nHalloween Ends may not live up to the original, but it is definitely more interesting than its two predecessors. Halloween 2018 and Halloween Kills are just lazy rehashes of the original film, with them not taking any risks. Because of this, both movies just feel like watered down versions of John Carpenter's original. Halloween Ends, on the other hand, isn't afraid to take risks, which is why it's so good. The only flaw with the film is its ending, with Michael's fight with Laurie Strode feeling completely detached from the rest of the story. Notably, this is the film's most similar scene to previous Halloween movies.\nThe Halloween franchise will continue into the future, causing many to wonder how this will affect the reception and canon status of Halloween Ends. Halloween Ends makes some wild choices near its end, including killing off Michael Myers. Due to the nature of Michael's death in Halloween Ends, it is impossible to say that he somehow lived (unless he is a supernatural entity). Because of this, future Halloween projects either have to be a prequel or they have to retcon Halloween Ends. With the rights to Halloween currently being sold, it seems as some studios have a plan for the franchise's future.\nInterestingly, Halloween Ends not truly being the end could be the best thing for the film's reception in the long-run. Many of the criticisms of Halloween Ends have to do with the film concluding the franchise by focusing on an original character rather than Laurie or Michael Myers. If more Halloween movies and TV shows are made, then Halloween Ends won't have ended the franchise on this note, fixing this problem. Halloween Ends may start seeing more positive reception as future Halloween projects get made, with this critical turnaround already being seen online.\nHalloween III: Season of the Witch was initially received poorly due to it not featuring Michael Myers, but it has become a cult classic in recent years. This same trend may repeat itself with Halloween Ends, with the film eventually being held in high regard for being so different.

{"title": "Welcome To Plathville: Ethan Plath's Cheating Rumors Explained", "date": "2023-10-05 21:50:17", "text": "Welcome to Plathville's Ethan and Olivia Plath are dealing with cheating rumors. The gossip about Ethan's date with another woman's troubling. \nIf the recent cheating rumors are true, Welcome to Plathville's Ethan and Olivia Plath are possibly on the rocks, and it's time to talk about that gossip. In season 5, the pair are dealing with so much stress, thanks to Olivia's feuds with Kim, Barry and Moriah Plath. Ethan thinks he's caught in the middle, and that kind of drama generally doesn't help a person to keep their marriage afloat. Over the years, the Plath family's made Olivia's life a living hell. Now, many Plaths, including Kim, are giving her the silent treatment. Some of the Plath kids have unloaded about their sister-in-law online.\nOlivia's had the hardest journey on the show, except perhaps for Moriah, who's talked about being in a dark place during Welcome to Plathville season 5. Kim didn't approve of Olivia, and Barry followed suit. They had no faith in their daughter-in-law, who made efforts to smooth things over. She worked hard to build bonds with some Plath family members, including Moriah. Olivia succeeded in many ways. However, during this installment, everything's falling apart onscreen. Olivia's being shunned, and she may be bailing out on her marriage. While Ethan was caught with another woman, that doesn't mean that he ended things with Olivia. She might have walked away.\nRight now, there's no proof that Ethan and Olivia are done, but there are clues that don't look good. Ethan definitely seemed to be on a date when a fan caught him dancing with another woman in a Minnesota bar, as per Without A Crystal Ball at Instagram. They were reportedly holding hands while they danced. The woman was described as a brunette who definitely wasn't redhead Olivia. Ethan doesn't really seem like the type to step out on his marriage, so possibly the divorce rumors, which have been running rampant, are one hundred percent accurate. If they are, reality TV show star Ethan's branching out following a separation, rather than actually cheating.\nIf Ethan and Olivia are still together, he might have been caught red-handed with a woman who isn't his wife. In that case, it would be very shocking. Based on what's unfolded onscreen over the years, Ethan's a loyal guy. He's stuck with Olivia, who may be the new Kim, through some very hard times, and was totally crushed when she wanted a break. He appeared to be very depressed.\nPeople change, so maybe he's not in the same state of mind now. He may feel differently about his wife, and be ready to live his life without her. It wouldn't be a surprise if Ethan and Olivia imploded, because the type of pressure they've been under through five Welcome to Plathville seasons has been significant. Most couples would have folded long ago, throwing in the towel just to avoid the mother-in-law drama and other feuds. Instead of calling it quits, Ethan and Olivia made an effort to heal their relationship. They went to Europe, traveling around to escape from the realities of being members of the Plath family.\nWhen they returned, they learned that Moriah had fled the Tampa home she shared with them without telling them first. Ethan and Olivia have been married since 2018, and they've weathered some extreme ups and downs. However, the rift with Moriah, with whom Olivia was once so close, seemed like quite a hurdle to overcome. Did it break the couple?\nOlivia's sister Sophia Meggs said that Ethan and Olivia are currently divorcing, but Olivia denied it. Nonetheless, something seems to be wrong. The pair just don't appear to be on the same page. They're not posting about each other lately, and they're sort of avoiding the elephant in the room at Instagram. Of course, their reluctance to address the rumors at IG, where they both have sizable followings, seems very relevant. It's possible that fans will see one of those polite but sad divorce announcements soon. If so, what does that mean for the future of the show? Will it end after Welcome to Plathville season 5?\nSource: Without A Crystal Ball/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "Hulk Vs She-Hulk: Who Is The Stronger Gamma-Powered Superhero?", "date": "2023-10-05 21:40:25", "text": "Hulk and She-Hulk's MCU power level is extremely high, but there's one key difference that makes one Gamma monster stronger than the other.\nAlthough the MCU's Hulk and She-Hulk draw their power from the same source, one of them has a clear advantage over the other. Gamma monsters are especially powerful MCU characters due to their sheer strength and durability. Even when they give up power in exchange for intelligence, they're still stronger than most Marvel superheroes. And to top it off, they can also become exponentially stronger according to their rage level.\nHulk's MCU origin story is inherently tied to Captain America, as the experiment that resulted in Bruce Banner's first transformation aimed to replicate the original Super Soldier serum. With the addition of Gamma radiation and Bruce Banner's pent-up rage, the experiment resulted in the birth of a monster with seemingly endless energy and strength: Hulk. Hulk then inspired the creation of other Gamma monsters, either voluntarily or accidentally — namely, the Abomination, the Leader, and She-Hulk, all of which have more natural control over their consciousness but less power and endurance.\nHulk's MCU power level has varied a lot throughout the years. First, The Incredible Hulk showed that Hulk is capable of mowing down whole military squads with ease, though he might struggle against certain weapons like Stark Industries' sonar cannons and against a similar Gamma monster, like the original no-holds-barred Abomination. Hulk's return in The Avengers increased his power to the point of being able to stop a Chitauri Leviathan on its tracks with a single punch, as well as brush off a hit from Thor's Mjolnir and survive a swarm attack from the Chitauri army. This same Hulk accomplishes a similar feat with Ultron's army in Avengers: Age of Ultron, but gets knocked out by Iron Man's Hulkbuster machine after an intense battle between the two Avengers.\nHulk's pinnacle of power in the MCU came in Thor: Ragnarok, where a smarter Hulk had already become a champion gladiator after defeating a variety of intergalactic warriors on the Grandmaster's arena. Thor: Ragnarok's Hulk is strong enough to defeat Fenrir single-handedly and land some blows on a giant-sized Surtur, though the only reason he can defeat Thor in gladiatorial combat is that the Grandmaster intervenes. After Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War showed that Hulk's strength is no match for Thanos' fighting skills, and Smart Hulk's introduction in Avengers: Endgame put an end to the Hulk's immense feats of power — but not before he proved that his body is still durable enough to withstand the power of all six Infinity Stones.\nJennifer Walters' first transformation into She-Hulk came with the reveal that she doesn't need to lose her calm in order to tap into her Gamma power. She-Hulk can take advantage of all of her abilities at any time, including super strength, super speed, a fast healing factor, and the Hulk's emblematic thunderclap. During her training with Smart Hulk, She-Hulk demonstrates her immense base-level strength by throwing Smart Hulk around and putting up a decent fight, yet it's obvious that Smart Hulk is holding back. However, this fight scene is only She-Hulk's first time getting to know her powers.\nRelated: She-Hulk Ending Explained (In Detail)\nShe-Hulk's following fights in She-Hulk: Attorney At Law don't require her to use her full strength. In fact, she walks right through most of them unharmed and mostly unbothered, with opponents like the Wrecking Crew, Leap-Frog's henchmen, and Marvel Studios' employees failing to land a single blow on her. As She-Hulk still lacks experience, she struggles to match Daredevil's agility, which leads her to resort to a thunderclap to stop him. However, more training and more demanding fights against stronger opponents could force She-Hulk to reach her full potential in a future Marvel Cinematic Universe movie or show.\nHulk, more specifically Bruce Banner's Savage Hulk persona, is undeniably the most powerful Hulk in the MCU, at least up until Phase 5. Not only is the original Hulk bigger, stronger, and more brutal, but he also has the advantage of being fueled by pure rage. Hulk feeds from Bruce Banner's repressed anger to power himself and recover from any injury, growing stronger in the process. Although clever opponents like Iron Man and Thanos have found ways to neutralize Hulk, Hulk still stands out as a highly adaptable character. Hulk's main weakness, if anything, is his will to fight, as his losses in Avengers: Age of Ultron and Avengers: Infinity War are influenced by his state of mind.\nRelated: Every Way The Original Hulk Can Return To The MCU\nShe-Hulk is also powerful, but apart from her lack of experience, she isn't interested in fighting. If she were, it's possible that all of her abilities would increase proportionally to her rage and energy. Given that Bruce Banner found a way to merge his human self with Hulk's persona, there could also be a way to unleash She-Hulk's full potential, possibly turning her into a monster as big and unstoppable as the original Savage Hulk. But while there's a precedent of such a transformation in Marvel Comics, the MCU's She-Hulk is highly unlikely to risk her human consciousness in order to pursue Hulk's full power.\n"}
{"title": "Godzilla's Name for King Kong Explains Why Their Battle Was Inevitable", "date": "2023-10-05 21:30:25", "text": "Godzilla vs Kong is an epic film with one of the best monster battles in history, & the reason why they fought was due to Godzilla's name for Kong. \nIt’s no secret that Godzilla and King Kong are rivals, as these Titans have faced off in not one, but two separate continuities, including and especially the most recent MonsterVerse film Godzilla vs Kong. While the visual spectacle of having these two behemoths battle it out on the big screen is reason enough to pit them against each other, there’s a far less meta purpose for their fight as well, and Godzilla’s name for King Kong explains exactly why their MonsterVerse battle was inevitable.\nIn the original 1962 film King Kong vs Godzilla, Kong was taken from his home and brought to Godzilla’s territory in order to fight the kaiju on behalf of humanity, despite the fact that the two monsters had never heard of each other before and had no reason to fight beyond proving which one was the strongest. There wasn’t much background or motivation for either Kong or Godzilla, but then again, there didn’t really need to be. Two iconic monsters (one more recognizable in Japan, the other an American classic) in a movie together, fighting to see who would win, is fun enough as it is. In the newly-established MonsterVerse films, however, Godzilla and Kong have a deep-seated rivalry that stretches back generations for both their species. That’s why Godzilla and Kong fought in 2021’s Godzilla vs Kong, and that’s why Godzilla had his own special name for Kong before the events of that movie even took place: the Rival.\nIn Godzilla: Dominion by Greg Keyes and Drew Johnson, readers are shown what Godzilla was doing before the events of Godzilla vs Kong following his narrow victory over King Ghidorah in Godzilla: King of the Monsters. The book gave fans a bit more insight into Godzilla’s thought process, as well as revealing another interesting ability movie fans didn’t know he had. Godzilla has the power to tap into the entire world, and feel things happening on the planet the same way one can feel something on their skin. This is how Godzilla knows when there is conflict, or when someone or something is overstepping their boundaries and needs to be put in place. More than that, though, Godzilla can constantly feel Kong’s challenging presence on his world, with every moment Kong continues to exist without recognizing his supremacy being like an itch Godzilla just can’t scratch.\nGodzilla’s species and Kong’s species used to live together in the Hollow Earth, where remnants of a great battle between them were discovered in Godzilla vs Kong (and where Kong got that sweet Godzilla-killing ax). It’s for this reason that Godzilla immediately recognizes Kong’s presence on Earth as that of his ultimate, instinctual rival, and why it was inevitable that the two would fight. Again, the issue here isn’t that Kong didn’t bow before Godzilla like the other Titans did in King of the Monsters, it’s that Kong is inherently a threat to Godzilla’s kingship. Add that to the fact that Godzilla can feel Kong’s every move with his planet-scoping power, and the ultimate battle between the two was completely unavoidable.\nThankfully, by the end of Godzilla vs Kong, the two were able to work out some sort of unspoken agreement that would allow both of them to exist on the same planet at the same time without further conflict. However, that initial conflict was necessary either way, regardless of the outcome, and Godzilla’s names for King Kong explains why.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

Prior to the Blumhouse slasher comedy, Khan had scored acclaim for her work as creator and showrunner of ABC's Fresh off the Boat and American Dad!, followed by her feature directorial debut with the Randall Park and Ali Wong-led Always Be My Maybe.\nKhan has assembled a star-studded roster for Totally Killer, including The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina alum Kiernan Shipka, Olivia Holt, Julie Bowen, Liana Liberato, Charlie Gillespie, and Randall Park. Khan's debut in the horror genre brings all of the sharp humor that has defined her work in the past while also delivering the shocking thrills expected of an entertaining slasher.\nRelated: New On Amazon Prime Video: All 138 Movies & TV Shows Arriving In October\nAhead of the movie's release, Screen Rant spoke exclusively with director Nahnatchka Khan to discuss making the jump from comedy to horror, her biggest goals for her on-set environment, and thoughts on a potential sequel.\nScreen Rant: I'm so excited to talk about Totally Killer. I've been a fan of your work since Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, and I loved what you did on Always Be My Maybe, which makes your transition towards horror with this film really intriguing. What about the script really sparked your interest to want to do that, even if it still has some comedy elements?\nNahnatchka Khan: Yeah, I'm a horror fan, just as a viewer and audience, I love the genre. So, after I did Always Be My Maybe, I kind of just sat down generally with Jason Blum and the team at Blumhouse, and I just was fanning out to them. I was like, \"I love what you guys do, and I'm a fan,\" and they were like, \"Let's figure something out. Let's do some sort of mash-up.\" So, we've been talking about it, and then they sent me Totally Killer, and usually when you get a script, it has the synopsis or whatever. But this had nothing, it was just a script, so I truly didn't know. I was like, \"It's coming from Blumhouse, so I know there's got to be some sort of horror thing,\" and so then, when I got locked into the premise, I was like, \"Oh my god, this is so much fun, I could have a ton of fun with this.\" It just made a lot of sense, and it was an exciting challenge.\nBlumhouse always has a horror edge to their stuff with Freaky with Happy Death Day, and this feels like it fits nicely in there. I said it before, but this is also a very funny movie, which is obviously in your wheelhouse. What was it like finding the right balance between the humor and some of the genuine slasher thrills?\nNahnatchka Khan: I think it was wanting to kind of lull you into this world, and not starting from too dark of a place, and then surprising you when it sort of takes a hard turn with that first kill sequence and being like, \"Oh, okay, we're going for it, we're not checking our swing here, there's a slasher on the loose, there's gonna be some gory kills and some gruesome moments.\" It's really just understanding that those two things can live together and can coexist, so always leading with comedy, I think, allows for the horror to shine. Like, those are not the comedy set pieces, right? It's around that, and then of course, the time travel element has to come into play as well, and get that in there.\nKiernan obviously has a history in horror, and you and Randall have a history together, but the rest of this ensemble around them is just incredible to watch. What was it like building this cast to really embody these characters?\nNahnatchka Khan: It was so fun. I mean, it was a challenge, because we obviously had people playing one role 35 years apart. So, starting with like Olivia Holt, who plays Kiernan's peer/young mother, she's amazing. The two of them together are just so much fun, and then getting Julie Bowen to play the older Olivia, they look like [each other], it feels like, \"Okay, that tracks.\" Then, building out the rest of the world and having these kids who were young adults now living and embodying these 1980s tropes, going back to the John Hughes era that they didn't live through, and kind of talking them through [it].\nThey have all the reference points, that was the thing that was really cool, too, about working with the cast is I came in armed with all these movies that I was going to have them watch to be prepared. Not only had they seen them, but they threw it back at me, and they were like, \"Have you seen this, this, that?\" I was like, \"No.\" So I left being like, \"Alright, let me go watch some of this stuff,\" because they are so aware, and so ready for the challenge, it was really fun.\nThat's awesome. Did you have a favorite of the movies that they gave you?\nNahnatchka Khan: There was some obscure '90s [movie], I gotta find the name of it, but it was something I'd never heard of before. It was like some, like, Brazilian movie — I'll find it, and I'll make sure it gets sent to you, because it was really amazing.\nDid you have the time to allow the actors to form a rapport with one another, especially with the adult and younger counterparts, to get the chance to join together and find the characters together?\nNahnatchka Khan: Definitely, as much as possible. When we were all on set together, we would have just actor meetings with the actors that were playing the same role, just so they can kind of get to know each other. So, Charlie Gillespie and Lochlyn Munro were together, Julie and Olivia. It was just a fun way to hang out, and kind of not mirror each other, but sort of see what the other one is doing. We had table reads, so everybody could get on the same page. Just wanted to keep it loose, so they can feel comfortable to bring their talent to it, and elevate it, and they really all stepped up. It was just such a fun challenge, and so great to watch them work.\nThis is a movie that, much like Happy Death Day, ends on a mostly conclusive note with maybe a hint or two that it could continue. Do you have any ideas about a possible sequel, or would you want to come back and continue this story?\nNahnatchka Khan: You know, it's funny, I think from like, day two of shooting, our DP, Judd Overton, kept saying every day, at the end of this movie, there's still a time travel device left in 1987, and we were like, \"That's true. That's true.\" So he's banging the drum that there could be a sequel where somebody from the '80s now comes to the present day, if they find that time machine, so you know, anything is possible.\n35 years after the shocking murder of three teens, the infamous “Sweet Sixteen Killer“ returns on Halloween night to claim a fourth victim. 17-year-old Jamie (Kiernan Shipka) ignores her overprotective mom’s (Julie Bowen) warning and comes face to face with the masked maniac and on the run for her life, accidentally time travels back to 1987, the year of the original killings. Forced to navigate the unfamiliar and outrageous culture of the 1980s, Jamie teams up with her teen mom (Olivia Holt) to take down the killer once and for all before she’s stuck in the past forever.\nCheck out our other interviews with:\nTotally Killer begins streaming on Prime Video on October 6.\nSource: Screen Rant Plus\n"}
{"title": "10 Best Thriller Movies On Amazon Prime Video", "date": "2023-10-05 21:20:17", "text": "For Amazon Prime Video subscribers, there are a number of excellent thriller movies to watch for a night of suspenseful and nail-biting viewing.\nFor Amazon Prime Video subscribers looking for a thriller movie, there are plenty of options on the platform. Thriller films can spread across different genres, from superhero films to horror to intense action movies. The primary purpose of the genre is to evoke heightened feelings of tension, anxiety, and anticipation while the film quickly builds toward its conclusion. Thriller movies are often filled with shocking plot twists that help the fast-paced narrative escalate toward a dramatic climax.\nPrime Video has a section for thriller films on the site, though there are a number of low-budget and mediocre offerings to weed through. The best thrillers to watch tend to include all-star casts and directors. However, a thriller film's script is often what makes or breaks it, as such stories tend to explore darker ideas about humanity that are meant to linger with the audience after the film's conclusion.\nBurning is a psychological thriller from South Korean writer and director Lee Chang-dong. The film follows a young man, Jong-su, who runs into his childhood friend, Hae-mi. Hae-mi introduces Jong-su to a mysterious man she's met named Ben, who Jong-su is suspicious of. This leads him to believe that his friend is in danger. Burning is engrossing and suspenseful, and it's filled with thematic depth for viewers to explore.\nDirected by Denis Villeneuve and written by Taylor Sheridan, Sicario is an excellent action/thriller film. The movie follows Emily Blunt as Kate Mercy, an FBI agent who's recruited to a team tasked with taking out a powerful cartel boss. The film is beautifully shot and well-written, as one would expect from the writer/director duo that made it happen. Sicario is a nerve-racking, action packed, and gritty thriller that builds its tension perfectly.\nSouth Korean cinema gained a ton of popularity from the 2019 film Parasite. There are a number of other great psychological thrillers to explore from South Korean directors, including Bong Joon-ho's other movies. Bong Joon-ho's Mother is the best example currently available to stream on Prime Video. The film tells the story of a widow who must clear her intellectually disabled adult son of a murder he's been accused of following a messy police investigation. Mother offers a tense murder mystery that fans of Parasite or Memories of Murder will surely enjoy.\nThe 2018 film Suspiria is a supernatural horror thriller inspired by the 1977 Italian film of the same name, directed by Luca Guadagnino (Call Me by Your Name). The film follows a young dancer from America who arrives in Berlin in the 1970s to audition for a renowned dance studio. As the narrative progresses, the young woman unearths sinister witchcraft activity. The film isn't as strong as the original, but it's still one of the best original horror movies on Prime Video. Suspiria is filled with suspense, and it also contains body horror that will freak its audience out.\nJoker is a comic book movie that's received acclaim for its dark, gritty character study. Inspired by Martin Scorsese films like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, Joker chronicles the deterioration of Arthur Fleck, an isolated man who feels rejected by society. As the film builds toward its climax, Fleck transitions further and further into becoming the Joker. Most of the praise for the film comes from the performance from Joaquin Phoenix, who captures the comic book character in a way that feels more realistic than previous variations.\nMost modern moviegoers know of Christopher Nolan and that he's capable of turning any genre or story into a sensory overloading, fast-paced, thrilling experience. His 2000 film Memento is perhaps the best bare-bones example of his style, crafting a simple story that is made complex by its scenes being displaced in time. The main character has short term memory loss, requiring him to utilize a system of notes and photographs to keep track of information as he seeks out revenge toward the men who murdered his wife. The film is complicated due to its narrative style, adding to the anticipation and its plot twists.\nRELATED: Memento Timeline & Ending Explained\nDirected by the great Sidney Lumet, Serpico is one of the earliest and best movies starring Al Pacino. While Pacino is known for playing mobsters, Serpico sees him on the other side of the law, playing a good cop in a New York City precinct full of bribery and corruption. The film depicts the true story of Frank Serpico, who was a whistleblower on police corruption in the '60s and '70s. The film is tense and gripping as obstacles build up in front of Serpico, who goes against the status quo and tries to oust the dirty cops.\nAnother comic book adaptation, The Batman is the first version of the character on the big screen to primarily focus on detective work, allowing the film to lean heavily into thriller elements. Directed by Matt Reeves, the movie sees Batman pursuing the Riddler, who's portrayed as a serial killer leaving behind clues. The film takes heavy inspiration from the mystery thrillers of David Fincher, such as Zodiac and Se7en, laying out clues and misdirection as Batman tracks down the Riddler and the motivations of the film's villains.\nChinatown is one of the greatest mystery movies ever made, and one of the best examples of the neo-noir genre. While the film isn't as fast-paced as many modern thrillers, its slower, contemplative burn allows for its script to fully take effect, maximizing the film's foreshadowing and plot twists. The conflict of Chinatown is relentless, constantly evolving as it transitions from a murder mystery to a grander story about politics and corruption. This is a film that will fill its audience with a sense of tension and dread, both as it develops and long after it ends.\nRELATED: Chinatown: 10 Reasons It's The Best Film Noir Movie Ever Made\nJordan Peele's latest film, Nope, was one of the best new releases of 2022, celebrated for Peele's usual mix of genres. Nope contains elements of sci-fi, comedy, and horror. The film follows a pair of siblings, played exceptionally by Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer, who discover what they believe to be a UFO above their horse ranch. Peele commonly subverts horror tropes, allowing his films to play out and build anticipation in ways that are unexpected, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats throughout. Nope is a must-watch thriller on Amazon Prime Video, especially for fans of thrilling narratives.\n"}
{"title": "7 Times Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny Changes History", "date": "2023-10-05 21:11:25", "text": "Indiana Jones has always played with real history, but the changes that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny makes could have huge ramifications.\nThe Indiana Jones franchise has always grappled with history, but Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’s changes to real events take this to a new level. Set in 1969, the most recent and final addition to the Indiana Jones series sees the aging archaeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) going up against the Nazis once more, this time in pursuit of Archimedes’ antikythera. Dr. Jones and his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) go on a globe-trotting adventure to save the antikythera from the clutches of the Nazis — though they travel a little further than they intended.\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny's ending takes the characters to Syracuse in 212 BC, where Indy and Helena not only end up encountering the history they study face-to-face, but manage to change it as well. While some of Dial of Destiny’s historical changes are relatively benign, other alterations would have major ramifications on the course of history. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changes history seven times during its runtime, and each of these instances would affect real-world events in one way or another.\nEven before the time travel begins in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the titular archaeologist alters the course of history during a celebration of the 1969 moon landing. After a scuffle with the Nazis and Indy’s morally gray goddaughter Helena Shaw, Indy ends up getting framed for the murder of two of his colleagues at Hunter College. This forces him to flee the university to escape his adversaries and the police. Unfortunately for Indy, New York City’s moon landing parade is in full swing, so the chase sequence between him and the Nazis interrupts the event.\nWhile this chase resembles the usual Indiana Jones antics, this is a real event that Indiana Jones and the Nazis change through their presence. The parade that Indy upends is an actual parade that took place in August 1969, which honored the astronauts of the Apollo 11 moon landing. In real life, however, the Apollo 11 moon day parade was decidedly devoid of an aging archaeologist bursting through on horseback or a car full of Nazis chasing him. This makes the Moon Day parade an early example of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changing history.\nAfter Indy and the Nazis’ unintended involvement in the Moon Day parade, their changes to history get even more drastic. Toward the end of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Dr. Voller reveals that his plan for the antikythera is to go back in time to 1939 and kill Adolf Hitler to prevent him from losing World War II. However, his miscalculation results in the time fissure delivering their plane to the Siege of Syracuse, and the plane is soon shot down. Since the airplane wouldn’t be invented until 1903, a Nazi plane certainly wouldn’t have appeared in 212 BC, making this a big change to history.\nOne of the biggest ways that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changes history is by introducing Ancient Greek inventor Archimedes to the movie’s main characters, who hail from the modern era. After the Nazi plane crashes — with Indy and Helena escaping via parachute — the two archeologists encounter Archimedes. Getting the chance to meet a major historical figure like Archimedes is a huge moment for Indy personally, but it also alters history quite a bit.\nRELATED: Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny: 31 Easter Eggs & Hidden References\nArchimedes getting to meet the time-traveling Indy and Helena changes history in several ways during the Indiana Jones movie. Obviously, it’s highly unlikely that the real-life Archimedes ever encountered time travelers, which is a big alteration. Through meeting these time travelers, Archimedes is also introduced to several modern items and inventions he never would have encountered otherwise. Additionally, Indy and Helena both speak to Archimedes with a level of reverence that hints at his modern reputation, something Archimedes wouldn’t have known about. By meeting Indy and Helena, Archimedes would have gained an awareness of modern times he never would have in real life.\nOne interesting way that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changes history is in its depiction of the antikythera. In the fifth and final Indiana Jones movie, the antikythera is able to detect fissures in time. This allows the users to travel in time, although the Indiana Jones characters later discover that the antikythera only takes them to 212 BC. While this is an interesting function for the artifact to have, the real-life antikythera had a different function.\nRelated: How The Dial Of Destiny Works In Indiana Jones 5 (Explained With Real Science & Math)\nWhen the real-life antikythera was created, its intended use was not time travel. Rather, it was capable of performing complex astronomical calculations, making the antikythera the earliest known example of an analogue computer. This is an impressive feat in its own right, but it is a far cry from the time fissure-detection that the antikythera can do in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\nMeeting time travelers isn’t the only way that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changes the life of Archimedes. In real life, Archimedes died during the Siege of Syracuse in 212 BC, where he was killed by a Roman soldier. However, the end of The Dial of Destiny shows that Archimedes is still in the process of creating the antikythera, and since Indy has a completed version of the invention, that means Archimedes has to live long enough to finish his version. Therefore, whether it was intentional or an unintended plot hole, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny extended Archimedes’ natural lifetime, thus changing history considerably.\nOne of the biggest historical changes that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny makes occurs when Indy and the Nazis interrupt the 212 BC Siege of Syracuse. When the modern characters arrive in Syracuse, the two opposing armies assume that their plane is a dragon, leading them to shift focus and shoot it down. Although it’s impossible to know everything that really happened at the Siege of Syracuse, it’s unlikely that this took place, so it’s a pretty significant divergence from the real battle. It’s also possible that Indy and the Nazis’ interruption is what prevented the Romans from killing Archimedes, which is another alteration.\nRELATED: How To Watch The Indiana Jones Movies In Order (Chronologically & By Release)\nThe appearance of time travelers during the Siege of Syracuse begets several historical changes in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, particularly when it comes to Archimedes encountering examples of modernity. When Archimedes finds the completed antikythera from the future, he also discovers a wristwatch that Dr. Voller was wearing when he died in the plane crash. Though Archimedes gives Indiana and Helena the completed antikythera back, he keeps the wristwatch.\nHaving modern technology in different time periods is always significant in time travel movies, as it marks a major deviation that could change real-life events. After all, Archimedes wouldn't have access to such technology without the time travel ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. The character getting a modern wristwatch could have huge ramifications for the course of history, especially since he's an inventor. It could mean other pieces of modern technology being created earlier, and it could also give certain nations advantages that weren't present in the prior timeline.\n"}
{"title": "Dark Side Ahsoka: Will Thrawn's Big Threat Come To Pass?", "date": "2023-10-05 21:01:38", "text": "In Ahsoka's finale, Grand Admiral Thrawn tries to use Ahsoka's relationship with Anakin against her – but he doesn't know just how much she's grown.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nGrand Admiral Thrawn implied Ahsoka could one day turn to the dark side in the Ahsoka finale, but could that ever really come to pass? Though Ahsoka never dealt with Grand Admiral Thrawn in Star Wars Rebels, she’s been chasing after him since The Mandalorian season 2, hoping to prevent him returning to Star Wars’ prime galaxy and leading the Imperial Remnant’s resurgence. She knows why Thrawn is such a fearsome adversary, just as he understands how far she’s willing to go to stop him and how powerful she truly is. He knows all this because he used to know Ahsoka’s Jedi Master, Anakin Skywalker.\nThough Thrawn confirmed he knew Anakin in Ahsoka episode 8, “Part Eight: The Jedi, the Witch, and the Warlord,” the circumstances of their meeting happened off-screen in Timothy Zahn’s canon Star Wars novel Thrawn: Alliances. Near the tail end of the Clone Wars, Thrawn and Anakin met on the planet Batuu while both were on unsanctioned missions. Thrawn was seeking information about potential allies and new technologies as a Captain of the Chiss Ascendancy, and Anakin was there to rescue his wife, Padmé Amidala. They agreed to help one another, and during their time together, Thrawn witnessed Anakin’s power and unconventional methods first-hand. Later, he was also one of the few to know of Darth Vader’s real identity, a fact which he has now weaponized to taunt Ahsoka.\nAs Ahsoka and Sabine race to catch up to Thrawn’s Star Destroyer in the Ahsoka finale, Thrawn decides to revel in his victory and opens a channel with their ship just before making the jump to hyperspace. It is during this conversation that Thrawn reveals he knew Anakin Skywalker and was aware of Darth Vader’s true identity. He says: “I know you because I knew your master. I concluded your strategies would be similar. One wonders… just how similar you might become.” The underlying threat of Thrawn’s implication is clear – he believes Ahsoka could still follow in her master’s footsteps and fall to the dark side, and that had always been one of Ahsoka’s greatest fears.\nRelated: When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline\nShe believed she abandoned Anakin when she left the Jedi Order at the end of Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 5, forcing him on a path to darkness. Ever since, she’s lamented her time with the Order, reflecting on how, instead of being taught to become a peacekeeper, she’d only ever fought in a war, being made responsible for battles and bloodshed when she was just a teenager. How could she not fear becoming someone as terrifying as Vader, when Anakin Skywalker, one of the bravest and most powerful Jedi the Order had ever known, fell victim to the temptations of the dark side as well? How could she not be afraid to fall to the dark side herself, when all she’d ever experienced as a child was violence during the Clone Wars, betrayal by those she trusted the most, and grief for her friends?\nDespite the Ahsoka show’s focus on Thrawn’s return to Star Wars’ main galaxy, it also explores Ahsoka’s growth as a character. Ahsoka episode 5, “Shadow Warrior,” sees Ahsoka confronted with her past, her relationship with Anakin, and her greatest fears whilst in the World Between Worlds. Ahsoka has long been held back by her past and her legacy – since learning of Vader’s true identity in Star Wars Rebels season 2, she’s been running from her past, abandoning meaningful connections like the one with her own Padawan Sabine Wren in favor of hunting the galaxy for threats in a misguided attempt to atone for her imagined sins.\nIn the World Between Worlds, however, Ahsoka is given the opportunity to examine how her past has affected her. She sees the battles she was forced to fight as a child, the way she grew and learned under Anakin’s tutelage, and learns that she is capable of being more than what she was trained for. Anakin, and the Order by extension, trained her to be a warrior, yes – but Ahsoka discovered her capacity for empathy and kindness on her own. Her final lesson with Anakin taught her that while her past is an important part of who she is, she has the power to change her future.\nAhsoka now knows that she is more than just Anakin’s Padawan. Instead of choosing to kill him in the World Between Worlds, she chose to live and honor his teachings instead. Her experiences in Ahsoka episode 5 changed her forever. Now, she’s “Ahsoka the White,” no longer burdened by her past but rather accepting of it. She understands that Anakin’s fall to the dark side was a consequence of his own choices, just as much as it was Palpatine’s will. She is not her master, and as such, can make her own choices as she embraces becoming a beacon of light in the galaxy rather than being self-destructive.\nOne of the reasons Thrawn is such a threatening adversary is because he is willing to take the time to get under his enemies’ skin. He learns about their history and their relationships, using that knowledge to knock them down and shake their confidence. He’s done this time and time again – for instance, in Star Wars Rebels, he meticulously studied Twi’lek culture to rip apart their rebellion on the planet Ryloth. Thrawn is an Imperial Officer who uses more than just the Empire’s brute force to overcome his enemies; he messes with their minds as well, playing games and using their biggest fears against them.\nRelated: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nThis is exactly what he hopes to achieve by taunting Ahsoka with Anakin’s tragic fate. He wants to shake her confidence because he knows that, should she make it back to Star Wars’ primary galaxy alive, she’ll be one of his most difficult opponents. Thrawn doesn’t like to take chances; any advantage he can find, he’ll utilize, and knowing about Anakin’s fate is certainly an important piece of information to have in his arsenal. Despite Anakin having been redeemed by Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi, Thrawn could still do a lot of damage with the knowledge of Vader’s true identity as the Imperial Remnant tries to expand its foothold in the galaxy. After the Ahsoka finale, Thrawn has proven himself to be as cunning and terrifying as ever.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Bridgerton Season 3: Release Date Prediction, Cast Changes & Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-05 21:00:28", "text": "Bridgerton season 3 is coming to Netflix. Here are the latest updates, its story details, who it'll focus on and how Queen Charlotte sets it up.\nBridgerton season 3 was confirmed several years ago, but the release date could finally be on the horizon for the Bridgerton sibling's return to Netflix. Season 1 adapted Julia Quinn's novel The Duke and I, telling the tale of Daphne Bridgerton and Simon Basset's romance. Despite being such a success with audiences, that was put on the back burner in season 2 — which doesn't feature Simon at all, although he is name-dropped occasionally — and adapts the second Bridgerton novel The Viscount Who Loved Me, focusing on Anthony Bridgerton and Kate Sharma's enemies-to-lovers storyline.\nInstead of adapting Benedict Bridgerton's story, An Offer From A Gentleman, for Bridgerton season 3, the Netflix show is making a huge switch-up and changing the order. Bridgerton season 3 will cover the fourth Bridgerton novel, Romancing Mister Bridgerton, and even then is making several alterations (as it did for seasons 1 and 2). Production on Bridgerton season 3 is already underway, and a release date announcement feels closer every day, with the added bonus of Bridgerton spin-off Queen Charlotte setting up the third mainline series in a surprising way.\nThere has been surprisingly little news on Bridgerton season 3 outside the occasional tease from cast members since filming wrapped in March 2023. However, this is likely due to both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. While production is reportedly more-or-less complete on the next season, the strike conditions also prohibit the cast from promoting their work in all but a very limited capacity.\nHowever, Bridgerton was expected to arrive in 2023 by many, so the lack of promotion for the show from Netflix by September is worrying. There's increasing concern that, due to the strikes and Netflix wanting to be able to promote it properly, the next season of Bridgerton could be delayed until 2024. However, a leaked report in August suggested the Bridgerton season 3 release date could be as soon as December 14, 2023 (via CBR). \nIt should be noted though that this date was only rumored, and since it's only a few months away the lack of promotion from Netflix doesn't seem to correlate — especially given both the popularity of the show and how long it's been since the next season of Bridgerton was confirmed in 2021.\nBridgerton season 3 is officially happening on Netflix, with the show's renewal confirmed in 2021 (via Deadline). What's more, the streamer confirmed a fourth season would also follow. Author Julia Quinn wrote eight Bridgerton books in total, one focusing on each sibling, and the hope is that each book will be adapted into a different season for TV. It's likely that Netflix will continue with the show long into the future should interest remain high.\nAt the time of writing, Bridgerton season 3's release date has not been confirmed. Bridgerton season 1 was released in December 2020, and season 2 was released in March 2022 following multiple delays due to COVID-19. The WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes assured that any production and development remaining which required an actor or writer couldn't continue throughout most of 2023, too — although filming was wrapped in March. The Bridgerton season 3 release date will likely arrive in 2024, although until Netflix confirms anything it's impossible to say with certainty.\nBridgerton season 3's cast will include most of the Bridgerton family: Jonathan Bailey as Anthony; Ruth Gemmell as Violet; Claudia Jessie as Eloise; Luke Thompson as Benedict; Luke Newton as Colin; Will Tilston as Gregory; and Florence Hunt as Hyacinth. Nicola Coughlan will, of course, be back as Penelope Featherington as the focal character of the season. The Bridgerton season 3 cast is likely to feature many other returning faces, including:\nPhoebe Dynevor's Daphne Bridgerton will not return. Dynevor did keep the door open to return in later seasons, but she will not be around in Bridgerton season 3. Some of Bridgerton's second-season cast additions, including Rupert Young as Jack Featherington and Calam Young as Theo Sharpe, are perhaps less likely to return since their stories are seemingly wrapped up.\nThere is one major casting change for Bridgerton season 3. Ruby Stokes is no longer playing younger sister Francesca Bridgerton. Stokes landed a starring role on Netflix’s Lockwood & Company, which conflicted with her recurring status in Bridgerton. Replacing her as Francesca is Hannah Dodd who recently appeared in Enola Holmes 2, also for Netflix, as Sarah Chapman. Black Sails actress Hannah New joins the series as Lady Tilley Arnold, a young widow. Daniel Francis, James Phoon, and Sam Phillips have also all joined the show for season 3.\nRelated: Bridgerton: 14 Movies & TV Shows That Feature The Cast\nMany expected the Bridgerton Netflix series to follow the order of the books, as the Bridgerton novels also begin with Daphne and Anthony’s stories. There’s been a change to the lineup, however. Instead of focusing on Benedict for Bridgerton season 3, the Netflix show will focus on Colin and Penelope. Colin and Penelope’s story makes up the fourth book in the series, Romancing Mister Bridgerton — albeit with some differences in the plot for Bridgerton season 3.\nFollowing the surprising events of Bridgerton season 2, Penelope decides that she needs to look for a husband that will allow her to get out of her mother’s house and still live her double life as Penelope and Lady Whistledown, but she doesn’t have the same level of confidence that other debutantes do. Colin, who misses Penelope’s company when she starts to ignore him at social events, offers to help her land a husband. According to Netflix’s official summary, Colin’s plan to help Penelope gain confidence might “work a little too well.”\nIn addition to Colin and Penelope’s love story unfolding, Eloise will also share some of the spotlight in the Bridgerton season 3 story. After discovering that Penelope is Lady Whistledown, Eloise wants nothing to do with her former best friend. That leaves her forging new relationships while still being present for the parties of the season.\nNicola Coughlan, who plays Penelope Featherington, teased that season 3 will be \"extremely spicy.\" (via Collider). Coughlan explained \"I mean Lady Whistledown is right at the center having to deal with all her little secrets and it gets harder and harder for those to come out and then scandalous love affairs popping up all over the place. [It's] the most scandalous one yet, I would say.\"\nBeyond the established Bridgerton sibling storylines from Bridgerton season 2, spin-off Queen Charlotte throws in the seed of a substantial storyline for Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell). She plays an important role in Queen Charlotte, playing part of the triptych of \"widows\" (including Charlotte herself who awaits King George's death), each representing different types of grief. She loved her husband dearly, and still mourns him, but begins to realize in Queen Charlotte that she may be ready to enjoy herself once more — to \"allow her garden to bloom\" again, as the show delightfully puts it.\nWhile it feels unlikely that Violet will remarry in Bridgerton season 3, there is the possibility of courtship and perhaps some liberated sexual activity to throw further scandal under the belly of the ton. And the unexpected source of that scandal, Violet, would make for a wonderfully entertaining new dynamic.\n\n"}
{"title": "Does The Exorcist: Believer Have A Post-Credits Scene?", "date": "2023-10-05 21:00:27", "text": "The Exorcist: Believer is the start of a new trilogy of movies, so is there a post-credits scene teasing the sequels and future of the franchise?\nThe Exorcist franchise is at the start of a new potential trilogy, but does The Exorcist: Believer have a post-credits scene teasing future installments? The 2023 horror movie is a direct sequel to the original 1973 movie that does not connect to any of the previous sequels or prequels. The Exorcist: Believer continues the story nearly 50 years after Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) and her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) encountered a demon. The sequel sees Chris recruited by Victor Fielding (Leslie Odom Jr.) to help free two young girls from demonic possession.\nIn addition to being a sequel to The Exorcist, the new entry is planned to be the first installment of a new trilogy of movies. This means that by the time that The Exorcist: Believer's ending comes to a close, some clues about where the franchise is going next have been revealed. One of the most common tactics studios use to set up future movies that have already been announced is to include mid-credits or after-credits scenes. So with multiple other movies already planned, here's if audiences should expect to see a The Exorcist: Believer post-credits scene.\nRelated: How Much Exorcist: Believer Cost To Make & What Box Office It Needs\nIt is confirmed that The Exorcist: Believer does not have a post-credits scene. The movie does not include any additional scenes or teases at any point during the credits, meaning audiences will not see a mid-credits scene or end-credits scene in tehaters or when The Exorcist: Believer releases on streaming. Not including the tag is surprising considering The Exorcist: Deceiver has already been announced. While audiences do not need to wait for an after-credits scene now, sitting through the credits still is a great way to show respect for the writers, actors, and other people who made The Exorcist: Believer.\nBy not including an after-credits scene with The Exorcist: Believer, Universal and director David Gordon Green have taken the safer approach to building out the franchise. There have already been announcements for two more movies, but details on The Exorcist: Deceiver and the untitled third installment are still largely under wraps. The 2023 horror movie not having a post-credits scene means that the franchise can evolve naturally and make corrections based on The Exorcist: Believer's reception from critics and audiences. This also prevents the franchise from being written into a corner or potentially ignoring the tease altogether.\nJust because there is no post-credits scene after The Exorcist: Believer, that does not mean audiences will leave the movie without any indication on where the franchise is going. The final moments of the movie does help provide some insight into what could come next for the main characters. It is through this ending that a rough blueprint for how the trilogy will unfold comes to light. An end-credits scene after The Exorcist: Believer could have been redundant in this case, so it works better that the movie does not have one.\n"}
{"title": "Peanuts: 10 Best Peppermint Patty and Marcie Moments", "date": "2023-10-05 21:00:27", "text": "These best buds could not be more opposite, but Peppermint Patty and Marcie have some hilarious best-friend moments in these Peanuts strips.\nMarcie and Peppermint Patty became a dynamic duo in 1971, as Marcie made her Peanuts debut when the pair were seen at camp together. However, Marcie did not originally have a name, and she didn't receive one until some time later. The two didn't form the warmest bond right away, with Peppermint Patty calling Marcie a dork shortly after meeting. Regardless, they end up sharing a close friendship that configures Marcie as Peppermint Patty's sidekick and best friend.\nPeppermint Patty and Marcie offer very different personalties, making them an example of the tried and true comic trope of the big personality and the straight man, respectively. Positioning Peppermint Patty, who is outgoing, sporty, and extroverted, as a foil to the bookish and sweet Marcie provides endless funny situations for the girls to share — and for their fans to experience. They may be very different people, but one thing they have in common is their loyalty and devoted friendship. Here are 10 moments that celebrate their iconic friendship.\nRelated: 10 Funniest Peanuts Comics Starring Lucy\nMarcie is not the best at sports, as this strip clearly points out. She stands in stark contrast to the athletic, sports-loving Peppermint Patty. Marcie is very smart about a number of subjects, but sports is not one of them. Peppermint Patty, being the helpful pal that she is, tries to teach Marcie how to kick a ball. Things don't go as Patty planned and Marcie finds her own way of playing.\nFinding the humor in everything thanks to her good nature, Marcie finds her clumsy attempt at sports funny. Based on Patty's unsettled expression, the audience can guess that she does feel the same.\nMarcie loves school. On the other hand, Peppermint Patty does not. In fact, she hates school, and she is exceptionally lazy when it comes to her education. In Peanuts, it's been established that Patty frequently sleeps during class, which has been attributed to her dad coming home late from work and Patty waiting up for him. Regardless, Patty's attitude towards school is the polar opposite to Marcie's; Marcie is high achieving and loves to learn.\nWhen Marcie has to go to the principal's office, she claims innocence, only for Patty to reply that sleeping during class ensures not getting in trouble. It often annoys Marcie that Patty doesn't try very hard at school, so it seems unlikely that Marcie will take her friend's words seriously.\nA sports fanatic Marcie is not. Although, there is one sports superstar that Marcie is well aware of and is an active fan of: tennis player Billie Jean King. The former worldwide number-one tennis player, King is often referred to as one of the best tennis players of all time. She is also an advocate for women in sports and LGBTQ+ rights.\nA major tennis star in the '60s and '70s, King's popularity in the era's zeitgeist was immense, making her way into the Peanuts comics strip. Marcie and Peppermint Patty are huge fans of King, with Patty even threatening to never introduce her to the tennis star if she doesn't help Patty with women in sports. Too bad for Patty, Marcie pokes holes in her threats, leaving Patty desperate for a change of topic — even if from the teacher.\nAll best friends look out for each other, including by giving some much-needed style advice. As readers of the Peanuts strip know, Marcie's eyes are almost always obscured by her glasses. In this strip, Peppermint Patty thinks Marcie's eyes deserve to be seen and that putting her glasses on her head will make her look sophisticated.\nUnfortunately for Marcie, she needs those glasses on her eyes to see, sophisticated or not. What ensues is unsurprising; Marcie takes her glasses off and moments later walks directly into a tree. As helpful as Patty tries to be, she's better off sticking to sports tips than fashion advice.\nSports-challenged Marcie may not be a jock like Peppermint Patty, but there is one major exception: hockey. Marcie's grandfather plays in a hockey league, and, as noted in the strip, she and her father go to hockey games. While hockey is one of the very few sports Marcie is somewhat familiar with, she is still pretty clueless about some basic parts of the game. For instance, she thinks a hockey rink is called a hockey court.\nCorrecting her friend, Patty tells her it's a rink only for Marcie to get mixed up even further and call a basketball court a basketball rink. Marcie may excel at many subjects and even different languages, but she cannot seem to get a grasp on sports — something that is endlessly frustrating to Patty.\nMarcie and Peppermint Patty have one of the best friendships in the entirety of the Peanuts strip. They are endlessly loyal to each other and are always each other's first pick for everything. As tight-knit as the pair are, they are complete inverses to each other when it comes to sports. There is the all around athletic, competitive Patty who differs greatly from Marcy, whose vast knowledge does not extend to sports.\nWhen asked by Patty to fetch her a driver and ball, Marcy gives her a driver with no hesitation or issue. However, when it comes to which ball to give her friend, Marcie stumbles hard and hands her a soccer ball instead of a golf ball.\nA bookworm of the highest order, Marcie loves to read and learn, which could not be in more opposition to Peppermint Patty. Marcie can speak French fluently and is well-read on many subjects... except for sports. Apparently, the little intellectual is also knowledgeable about the Book of Proverbs, reciting one to a perplexed Patty.\nThe ancient writing of the Book of Proverbs would be hard for most adults to grasp, let alone a child. As a result, it's not hard to blame Peppermint Patty for having no clue what she's repeating. Patty is lucky to have a best bud like Marcie who can always help her out when she's in some academic jam.\nMarcie may be sweet and unassuming, but that doesn't mean that she isn't immune to fighting with her best friend. With two pals who spend as much time together as these, it's only natural for them to clash from time to time, as evident in this strip. When Marcie questions if Patty didn't do her homework yet again, Peppermint Patty gets defensive and complains about being called \"sir.\"\nNot one to back down, Marcie intentionally calls her \"sir\" over and over until Peppermint Patty can take no more and hits her friend on the head with a book. Some hair pulling ensues and the two girls are sent to the principal's office. Marcie, instead of acting like any normal kid would in the situation, feels elated after the fight and shows no trepidation about seeing the principal, much to Peppermint Patty's annoyance and confusion.\nPeppermint Patty is ready for a sports game or a scrimmage at any time. Patty is also one to stand up for herself and others. When a peer makes fun of Patty by making a cruel joke about graduating from dog obedience school, which she was told to attend by Snoopy, Patty does not take kindly to it.\nShe delivers a line that would be just as fitting in an Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie and bops the kid right on the nose. Marcie is very impressed and voices her admiration. Although, she should be careful to not call Patty \"sir\" at the moment in case she gets a bonk on the head, too.\nPeppermint Patty is very particular about her appearance and what she likes to wear. In one show of activism, Patty fights against the school board and hires Snoopy as her attorney after her school requires her to wear a dress for the new dress code. Therefore, Patty will stick to her guns about what is right and fair, including when it regards clothing.\nPatty is not immune to mixing things up, though. When she is competing in a skating competition, she is prepared to dress the part, hairstyle included. For the competition, she wants a new hairdo and asks Marcie for help. She should've kept looking, because Marcie comes up with a style that is not the most flattering, requiring the iconic Peanuts duo to go back to the drawing board.\n"}
{"title": "Walking Dead Writer Admits One Sexist Moment Is Still 'Cringe-Worthy'", "date": "2023-10-05 20:45:12", "text": "Creator and writer of The Walking Dead Robert Kirkman acknowledges a sexist scene in the original series, and one he would change if written today.\nRobert Kirkman's The Walking Dead is a landmark series in the apocalypse genre, as a story not only about zombies, but human survival in the face of impossible odds. It's also a story that's been criticized for its depiction of women--and even Kirkman admits that there is one particular moment in the series he still finds \"cringe-worthy.\"\nThe Walking Dead Deluxe is a re-release of the original Walking Dead series, first published in 2004, with never before seen content and valuable creator commentary providing insight into a few of author Robert Kirkman's character decisions. This glimpse into Kirkman's creative process, specifically his decision-making when it comes to writing female characters, highlights one scene in need of revisiting.\nThe scene in question arrives in The Walked Dead #3, in which two of the three women excitedly discuss laundry detergent on their way to washing the survivors' clothes. Donna angrily points out the disparity in the men hunting and women cleaning, with Lori Grimes dismissing the sexism, and excusing it as \"being realistic.\" \nRelated: Walking Dead: Carl Losing His Eye Foreshadows His Tragic Future\nIn Walking Dead Deluxe #3, Kirkman notes this scene as \"cringe-worthy,\" explaining he would make different decisions today (intending to give the women the maximum amount of space to grow as the story progressed). These interpersonal interactions do indeed evolve some of these people into hardened and lethal survivors, eventually joining Michonne's level. Regardless of Kirkman's authorial intent the scene in both the comic series and the TV show caused backlash.\n\"Did I need a full page of the female characters talking about doing laundry while the men hunted? Probably not....I was going to take the female characters in some interesting directions as the series progressed. So starting them here would give me a lot of room to grow and evolve along the way. Anyway I was 23 when I started writing this comic so this is definitely not the last cringe-worthy thing (for me at least) that I wrote into this book. I'd have handled things a little differently had I written it today. I'd have maybe had Allen or Jim help with the laundry.\"\nBecause Walking Dead has so much exposure in the cultural zeitgeist, it means the more questionable scenes are open to critiques from the fans, a fact Kirkman acknowledges. To many fans the scene demonstrates that even in a zombie apocalypse the patriarchal structure endures. Kirkman has said in the past that he's not a political writer and doesn't want his work to be read as such, but he also understands that because of the platform he's been given with Walking Dead, people are going to read what they want into it. Understandably, some fans might find this scene hard to enjoy due to its parallels to the non-zombified reality, where, with a few exceptions, men are in charge of almost every group, faction, colony or community and women get few moments to shine in grisly combat.\nIt's clear that the scene in question was meant to be a commentary on the state of society, both in the world of The Walking Dead and our own. Whether or not it was in good taste has typically been up to the fans to decide. It wasn't until Robert Kirkman's creative commentary in the Walking Dead Deluxe #3 that there was a confirmation on his own gendered bias, calling the scene \"cringe-worthy.\" This isn't the only instance of Kirkman's personal feelings featured in the series, but it is one of the first times he's acknowledged the faults of an early creative decision.\nThe Walking Dead Deluxe is available now from Skybound wherever comic books are sold.\nNext: Walking Dead's 'Don't Dead Open Inside' Originally Had a Different Purpose\nEmily Stachelczyk is a Comics News writer for Screen Rant. Ever since she accidentally read Joss Wheddon's Astonishing X-Men in middle school she's loved dissecting comic books ever since.

{"title": "Pet Sematary: Bloodlines Review - A Bland Prequel Despite An Intriguing Premise", "date": "2023-10-05 20:41:17", "text": "The film will resonate with the people eager to devour more Stephen King-inspired projects; sadly, there is nothing genuinely inspired to enjoy.\nIn 2019, the Pet Sematary remake was released. Directed by Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer and written by Jeff Buhler, the remake revisited the Creed family with a few minor tweaks that ultimately did not stray too far away from the original plot of the 1989 film. The consensus was that while the film had an updated look, the resurrected story offered very little. Pet Sematary: Bloodlines, a direct prequel to the novel and the 2019 film, follows young Jud Crandall as he discovers the cemetery where the dead don’t stay dead 50 years before meeting the Creeds.\nThe one aspect that seems to indicate the underlying intentions of Pet Sematary: Bloodlines' existence is the attempt to rectify the simplistic explanation of the burial ground that reanimates dead people and animals. There is an attempt to flesh out the history of the damned burial site, but the film doesn’t fully reckon with the reality that Stephen King and plenty of other horror writers rely on the audience's willful ignorance to explain away any spooky thing as being a byproduct of Indigenous peoples' history and culture.\nThere is a point where a case could be made for a Prey-esque prequel that solely revolves around the perspectives of the Mi’kmaq tribe, whose lands were invaded by the Europeans who would build Ludlow. There is a story to be told of how this burial ground came to be a source of terror for the town's residents. Instead, the film splits its attention, giving focus to the story of Jud Crandall, a character who didn't need to be explained or understood. At the same time, the general explanation of the “pet sematary” history is a protracted flashback.\nPrequels are a reality we cannot overcome. Still, there is a sad expectation that we are somehow incapable of inferring a character's past without being explicitly told in detail all that happened before the start of a story. Somehow, filmmakers (and audiences, as a result) can't accept that a story may have many other beginnings. It is one thing to have a prequel that expands our knowledge of the dynamics and world that made the story we enjoyed so intriguing, but it's an entirely different thing to focus on an inconsequential character. Jud Crandall was an interesting character with a history connected to the supernatural burial ground that predates Louis Creed and his family. But what exactly is there to learn or experience that makes Crandall’s story worth exploring in the first place? That question often goes unanswered with many unwarranted prequels, and Pet Sematary: Bloodlines fails to raise any compelling points.\nScreenwriters Jeff Buhler and Lindsey Anderson Beer, who also directed, do their best with what they have, but Buhler’s previous writing efforts on Pet Sematary didn’t manage to elevate the source material impressively, and there is nothing much to speak of for Bloodlines, either. The scares are palpable; Beer does a good job crafting an unsettling horror that has the right amount of gore and creepy ambiance. The cast is effective in their respective roles, but Forrest Goodluck and Isabella Star LaBlanc are underserved as they could easily have carried the entire film. Pam Grier is always a delight to see, but her talents are not utilized as well as they could have been. The story never manages to be as lively as it needs to be to justify its existence, but the cast attempts to make up for that with committed performances. Sadly, the film is rather dull, lacking in genuine suspense or intrigue.\nDespite some good instincts from Beer, the material is too constricting, denying the director the chance to expand her ideas or take turns that might alienate fans expecting a movie that answers questions no one was really asking. Mythology is certainly fascinating to explore when it comes to established horror that begins with an inexplicable idea, but there is hardly anything worth digging up here. In addition to the bland story, the film isn’t all too impressive to watch. There is a flatness to the cinematography, which is unfortunate considering Benjamin Kirk Nielsen has recently done great work. Tonally, the film is a tad bit gratifying for fans of King and his atmospheric horror. The darkness permeating over these characters and town is effectively realized, and the frights are effective.\nPet Sematary: Bloodlines is mercifully shorter than the 2019 film, but it still needed trimming. There have been worse straight-to-streaming horror films, and Pet Sematary: Bloodlines is hardly the worst among them. Memorable? Hardly. Entertaining? Somewhat. Ultimately, the film will resonate with the people eager to devour more Stephen King-inspired projects; sadly, there is nothing genuinely inspired to enjoy.\nPet Sematary: Bloodlines begins streaming on Paramount+ Friday, October 6. The film is 84 minutes long and rated R for horror violence, gore and language.\nFerdosa (she/her) is a lifelong student of cinema. She dreams of being a film festival programmer and is working her way towards that goal by consuming a concerning number of films every week."}
{"title": "Kody Proves He’s Moving On From Plural Marriage By Making Major Change", "date": "2023-10-05 20:41:05", "text": "Kody Brown is moving on from his polygamous past. The Sister Wives star embraces his new monogamous life with Robyn Brown by taking a huge step.\nKody Brown from Sister Wives replaced his Claddagh ring with a new one, showing he’s confident about moving away from polygamy. The 54-year-old Brown family patriarch married four women in the last three decades, hoping to build one big family. However, he couldn’t sustain them forever and eventually fell into a monogamous relationship with his youngest wife, Robyn Brown. During Sister Wives season 18, Kody split up from Janelle Brown a year after losing Christine Brown. Kody also ended things with Meri Brown, for whom he felt no love over the last few years.\nET recently shared a preview clip from Sister Wives season 18, which shows Kody confidently flashing his new symbol of monogamy. The reality star is sitting across from his former wife Meri and his current (and only) wife Robyn. As Meri speaks to them about her plans to move away, she spots a new ring on her former husband’s hand and points it out.\nShe says, “Sorry, I am distracted by your ring. That’s a different ring.” While Kody laughs it off and says it was just a “ring,” Meri reminds the cameras that he used to wear another one. She notes, “I did notice that it was replacing the Claddagh ring we all used to wear together.”\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\n\nMeri is shocked to see the change but isn't bothered about it. She is confused about why Kody was smirking about the ring and making things awkward at the table. The 52-year-old Sister Wives star tells the cameras, “It’s weird that he is being so awkward about it. Like, if he doesn’t want me to see the ring, don’t wear it to my house.” Kody simply chuckles during the clip, like a kid who gets caught stealing cookies. However, Meri isn't impressed by his behavior. She adds, “I have no idea what this ring is or where it came from.” Meri claims she doesn't care where the ring came from.\nIt’s clear why Meri was surprised to see Kody’s new ring. The Sister Wives cast member was Kody’s first wife and had been with him for years. She assumed he would never change the Claddagh ring representing their polygamous relationship. However, Kody did the unthinkable by replacing the symbol of plural marriage. One possible reason for this change could be his newfound monogamous relationship with Robyn. Kody is no longer with Christine, Janelle, or Meri. Therefore, he has no reason to wear the Claddagh ring, as it doesn’t represent anything meaningful to him.\nWhile Meri claimed she wasn’t jealous or cared about Kody’s new piece of jewelry, she certainly seemed bothered by it. It’s clear that she was shocked by the change, but she shouldn’t have pointed it out. She should have known that her relationship with Kody wasn’t the same as it was years ago. Meri and Kody’s relationship went downhill after Meri fell for a catfish online. She stepped out of the marriage by committing emotional infidelity. If the Sister Wives star had been faithful to the rules of her marriage, Kody might still be with her as her husband.\nSister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT on TLC.\nSource: ET/YouTube\n"}
{"title": "“Choose Nepotism”: Trainspotting Parody Video Retargets Opening Satire To Perfection", "date": "2023-10-05 20:34:39", "text": "UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak chooses nepotism in a Trainspotting parody that targets the iconic opening satire of the government's scandals.\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and other politicians appear in a Trainspotting parody that retargets the movie's iconic opening satire to perfection. Danny Boyle's 1996 adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel followed a group of misfits in Edinburgh played by Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremmer, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, Peter McKullan, and Robert Carlyle. Trainspotting is celebrated for its glimpse at substance addiction in the youth subculture, with the movie also launching McGregor and Boyle into widespread recognition.\nFollowing recent policy announcements made during the UK Conservative Party Conference that included the scrapping of the high-speed railway construction project HS2, PoliticsJOE has taken inspiration from the controversial decision and reimagined Trainspotting's recognizable opening sequences with Sunak and former Conservative Prime Ministers Liz Truss, Boris Johnson, Theresa May, and David Cameron in \"Trainstopping.\"\nIn Sunak's new monologue, the current Prime Minister looks back on his own tenure full of inconsistent policies and lobbying accusations, alongside other recent controversies, including Truss's short tenure, Johnson's neglectful mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic, May's handling of the Windrush Scandal, and Cameron's Black Mirror-Esque Pig scandal. Other key UK political figures, including RMT Union Leader Mick Lynch and former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, are also imposed into the opening, having to endure the group's antics.\nPoliticsJOE's history of biting political pop culture mashups extends far beyond their recent Trainspotting parody. The channel has approached major political events with many parodies of iconic songs and television shows. From imagining Johnson's chaotic resignation as Goodfellas' \"Meet the Crew\" monologue, placing Sunak's rise to Prime Minister into the opening of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and current Labour leader Keir Starmer's ever-changing stances as The Jungle Book's \"I Want To Be Like You,\" the YouTube channel has provided humorous videos that capture ongoing issues affecting both the UK and the world.\nHowever, what makes PoliticsJOE's newest parody stand out is how \"Trainstopping\" looks compared to the original Trainspotting monologue. The fast-paced nature perfectly encapsulates the chaotic changes brought through the current Conservative government since 2010. Sunak's reimagined dialogue lists what the UK political landscape has become, similar to how Renton's (McGregor) original monologue is about how he views ordinary life. Furthermore, it concludes with Renton (McGregor) stating he chooses to take heroin, as Sunak's dialogue states how the Prime Minister framed himself as cleaning up his party's many controversies but instead chose to let them persist.\nPoliticsJOE's Trainspotting parody is a darkly comedic encapsulation of the UK's current state. Not only is the title a fun play on the Conservative Party's derided HS2 choice, but Sunak's monologue features a wide range of biting jabs at the government's tenure dating back to Cameron's election. As such, \"Trainstopping\" is a quick, memorable remix of Boyle's iconic sequence that entertains and informs viewers.\nSource: PoliticsJOE\n"}
{"title": "16 Biggest Changes Twilight's Movies Made To The Books", "date": "2023-10-05 20:31:27", "text": "The Twilight Saga brought Edward and Bella's story to life, but for that, it made a lot of changes to the books – some good and others not so much.\nThe Twilight Saga brought Stephenie Meyer's novel series to life, but turning a book into a movie is always hard work, and the movies made many changes to the books. With the series spanning four lengthy books, there's a lot of ground to cover in the world of Twilight, so it's not surprising that the writers and directors of the Twilight Saga had to change some things from the novels or completely leave plot points out.\nAlthough the Twilight movies were mostly loyal to the source material, which was key to their success with fans of the books, it also made some changes that weren’t well-received. The Twilight Saga either changed how some key scenes happened, left important information and context out, or completely skipped some scenes due to time constraints. Because of this, there are a couple of moments in the Twilight Saga that are better explained or developed in the Twilight books and which could have improved the movies, while others are exclusive to the movies and actually benefited them.\nRelated: Twilight Movies In Order: What Is The Second & Third Movie To Watch\nWhen it comes to book adaptations, many directors work closely with costume designers to create accessories that will distinguish one character from another or give the character personality. That was the case for the Cullen Crest, which even though is never mentioned in the books, features prominently throughout the films. Each Cullen family member wore their own version of it – for example, Edward's cuff, Rosalie's necklace, and Alice's thin choker all feature the family symbol.\nWhile this may seem like a small addition to the Twilight franchise, it's an important and symbolic one. With the Cullen family constantly being apart for different reasons, the Cullen Crest is the one thing that unifies them as a family, as they always have a piece of each other with them.\nOne of the most interesting things about the Cullens is that they're \"vegetarians\", which in the Twilight universe means that they don't drink human blood, and instead feed from the blood of animals – however, not every Cullen family member has led a vegetarian lifestyle. In his early years as a vampire, Edward rejected Carlisle's way of life by turning to human blood. In the books, Edward tells Bella about how he used to seek out criminals and kill them early on, but in the movies, this happens the night before their wedding.\nWhile viewers are consistently treated to the same tune by Carter Burwell throughout the Twilight movies, it's never blatantly stated that this is Bella's song, known as \"Bella's Lullaby\". It's only when Edward and Bella are seen sitting at the piano in Twilight that it's assumed Edward is playing \"Bella's Lullaby\" to her. In the books, Edward hums the song to Bella multiple times throughout the series, which doesn't happen in the movies.\nThroughout the Twilight Saga, viewers are treated to the backstories of Carlisle, Rosalie, and Jasper, but there's one crucial story that was left out completely: Alice's. In the books, readers find out the tragic backstory of Alice Cullen, from the early development of her powers to her time in a mental institution and her transformation into a vampire. Alice's backstory does have an impact on Twilight, as she was hunted by James years before.\nRelated: Twilight: How (And Why) All Of The Cullens Were Turned Into Vampires\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part Two is based around the Cullen Clan's impending fight with the Volturi in defense of Renesmee. In the books, the fight ends up being a peaceful encounter, but the movie did something different and controversial. Breaking Dawn 2 saw an all-out brawl between the Cullens and their allies against the Volturi that resulted in the deaths of some favorite characters like Carlisle, Leah, and Seth – but before viewers can process the massacre, it's revealed that all that was nothing more than Alice's premonition, so none of it actually happened.\nOne of the major plot points of New Moon is Bella engaging in reckless behavior in order to hear Edward's voice following their breakup. In the movie, Bella takes a joyride with a stranger on his motorcycle after a night at the movies with Jessica, but in the books, Bella spots the group of men who had ill intentions during her night in Port Angeles in Twilight, and as she approaches them, she hears Edward's voice for the first time.\nEclipse is widely regarded as the best book and movie in the Twilight series, in large part due to the introduction of the newborn army and the battle against these vampires led by Victoria. However, in the books, readers learn very little of the strategy of the newborn army, while in the movie, viewers get a behind-the-scenes look at Victoria's master plan.\nThose on Edward's side got a lot of joy out of Bella punching Jacob in the face after he kissed her in Eclipse, and while this scene stayed relatively true to the book, Bella and Jacob's second kiss didn't. Instead of Bella catching up to Jacob after he runs away, Edward is the one who brings Jacob back after he finds out that Edward and Bella are engaged. In addition to that, Edward and Bella are in the tent when they discuss their upcoming nuptials, and not outside.\nEdward's official proposal went great, but the first one wasn't exactly a romantic dream. In the movie, Edward proposes to Bella after he, Jacob, and Bella get into an argument in the woods, but in the book, Edward's proposal takes place in Edward's room, and Bella initially thinks he is joking.\nOne of the most iconic scenes in the whole Twilight series is when Bella tells Edward that she knows he's a vampire, but the movie version of this moment is completely different from the book one. Rather than taking to the ominous woodsy area of Forks, Bella finds out Edward is a vampire before her Port Angeles attack and reveals her knowledge in Edward's car.\nThe Twilight Saga depicted Bella as a loner, and though she had some human friends, like Jessica, Angela, Mike, and Eric, she didn’t spend much time with them. This is completely different in the books, where Bella’s friends have a bigger presence as she actually spends time with them rather than just being focused on Edward. This was a harmful change to the Twilight books, as the movies made it seem like Edward was isolating Bella from her friends, which is a huge red flag in their relationship.\nThroughout the Twilight Saga, Charlie and Bella are seen eating at a diner, but in the books, Bella actually cooked for Charlie. While this might seem like an unimportant detail, it’s actually key to Bella and Charlie’s dynamic, as well as to understanding Bella. When Bella learns Charlie can’t cook, she decides to cook for him, informing the reader that, as her mother often required care, she took on some of the responsibilities of an adult, such as cooking for others. It shows how protective Bella is of her loved ones, and adds some sweetness to her relationship with her father.\nBella and Edward’s first kiss in the Twilight movie was a lot steamier than in the book. In the source material, Edward and Bella kiss for the first time when they return to her truck after hiking to the meadow, with Bella reacting enthusiastically to it. The movie turned up the intensity and instead set Bella and Edward’s kiss in Bella’s room, with Bella only wearing a t-shirt and underwear. Bella escalates the kiss to make it more passionate, with Edward pulling back to control himself.\nTwilight ends on a cliffhanger as Victoria is revealed to be watching Bella and Edward at their prom, setting her up as a big villain in the sequels. This scene is exclusive to the movie, as in the book, Victoria never shows up at the prom – and had she done so, any of the Cullens in attendance would have immediately sensed her presence, which would have put everyone else in great danger.\nRelated: What Happened To The Original Victoria From Twilight?\nAs mentioned above, the Twilight Saga made it look as if Edward was isolating Bella, adding to complaints about the toxic relationship between Edward and Bella, but in the books, she actually focused on other areas of her life, too. In the books, Bella actually made plans to attend college, and Edward was very supportive of this. In Eclipse, Bella got accepted into the University of Alaska, and in Breaking Dawn, Bella decided to attend for a year after getting married and remain human – however, these plans changed when she got pregnant. Still, it shows that Bella wanted a lot more than to become a vampire, and Edward was supportive of her plans to have more human experiences.\nImprinting in the Twilight universe has caused a lot of controversy, mostly because Jacob imprinted on Bella’s child, Renesmee. While this is disturbing in both the books and the movie, in the source material it’s less creepy thanks to the explanation of what imprinting really is about. This, arguably, made the “Jacob imprinted on Renesmee” situation endearing, while in the movie, it became not just one of the most disturbing moments in the Twilight Saga but also one of the most mocked ones thanks to Bella’s over-the-top (but understandable) reaction.\n\n"}

In a world with so many places to explore and characters to meet, it’s little wonder that sometimes the smallest things can lead to unforeseen consequences. From unexpected quests to surprising allies for the final battle, Baldur’s Gate 3 really does deliver on the promise that choices matter.\n[Warning: This article contains spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3.]\nBaldur’s Gate 3 hurtles straight into the action, with the player character immediately fending off an apparent mind flayer plot. Throughout their journey, right the way through to the end of Baldur’s Gate 3, it is up to the party to navigate the complex world and save Faerûn. Whether it be speaking to a particular NPC, handing over an item to the wrong person or exploring secret areas in Baldur’s Gate 3, there is always something new to uncover.\nRelated: \"An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas\": Baldur's Gate 3 Review\nUsually, poking around someone’s home or private space isn’t a good idea, but there are some interesting things to be learned about Kagha for those to happen to be a little more inquisitive. Sneaking around the library just off the main area with Kagha and Rath will reveal that tucked behind a bookcase is Kagha’s secret personal chest. Unlocking it will reveal a note and a book that starts a new quest to investigate the Grove’s latest leader. This new question puts Kagha’s actions into context and opens up new dialogue not just when she is confronted but also when Halsin returns.\nA simple act of kindness can lead to something much more beneficial, especially where the tiefling children are concerned. Helping any of the kids while in the Druid Grove, such as saving Arabella from Kagha or Mirkon from the harpies, will get the party an invitation to meet Mol. Mol has taken the rest of the orphaned children under her wing and will offer her thanks for helping them as well as make herself available as a vendor. Even better though, helping the kids will mean that Mol likes you, which comes in handy at the start of Act 2, where she will speak up for the party to Jaheira when first arriving at the Last Light Inn.\nSpeak with animals is an amazing spell taken to brilliant new levels in Baldur’s Gate 3. Every animal has something to say and all wonderfully voice acted. While speaking with the various animals found along the Sword Coast will often provide extra insight into the world, the strange ox in the Druid Grove is something else entirely. This peculiar beast is clearly not what it seems, but speaking to it at first will yield no answers.\nRelated: How To Talk To Animals in Baldur's Gate 3\nIt is only after running into this particular ox again in Act Two that more knowledge is gained, with the ox giving the party terrible flashbacks to its crimes. However, the real twist comes in Act 3 when the ox requests passage into Baldur’s Gate in apple form. Doing this will gain the party not only Shapeshifter's Boon Ring, which pairs well with the Mask of the Shapeshifter to give +1d4 bonus to all ability checks, but the ox will also appear just before the final battle with the Netherbrain as an unexpected ally.\nWhen first entering the Druid Grove in Act 1, the party will come across three siblings having an argument about whether or not to stay. The sister, Lia, wants to stay and help fight, while Rolan wants to leave. Here, the party can intervene and take a side; however, if Lia is sided with, more quests will be available further into Baldur’s Gate 3.\nIn Act Two, Rolan can be met again, where it is revealed that he helped save the tiefling children from the cultists of the Absolute. His siblings have been taken, though, and if they are rescued, and Rolan survives the Shadow-Cursed Lands, he can be met again in Act Three. This time, Rolan will be working in Lorrokan’s shop and can be persuaded to turn on his new master if his siblings were saved in Act 2. Strangely, in the simple act of settling an argument between siblings, children are saved, and a new ally can be gained.\nVenturing into an owlbear cave might not seem like the best of ideas, but any party determined to explore every inch of the map in Act 1 will no doubt have stumbled across this area. Inside a mother owlbear will fiercely protect her young, and the sensible thing to do might be to leave before a fight starts. However, if the mother is killed, then her baby can be found again at the Goblin Camp, where he can be coaxed into joining the team and following the party to camp. Doing so not only gives the group one of the cutest characters that can join the camp but also a great boost in the final battle in Act 3.\nRomances play a significant part in Baldur's Gate 3, with there even being options for polyamory. However, two characters who are most definitely not willing to share with each other are Lae'zel and Shadowheart. One decision to be careful with for those planning to romance the cleric of Shar is that any 'evenings' with Lae'zel could complicate this. Lae'zel will be very forward with her intentions toward the player character, and it is possible to sleep with her before forming a deeper relationship. However, doing so will lock out Shadowheart from being romanced if the relationship is not ended before the camp celebration in Act 1.\nWhen arriving in the Last Light Inn at the very beginning of Act 2, the party will almost immediately be sent to speak with Isobel, a cleric of Selune, by Jaheira. This seems like a simple matter of getting her blessing before venturing out into the Shadow-Cursed Land. However, speaking to Isobel will trigger an attack by the Absolute’s forces, led by former Flaming Fist Marcus.\nAs the Inn itself will be the focus of the attack, there are many NPCs crammed in there who can die during the fight, such as Rolan, Art Cullagh, and even Halsin, and this can lead to some quests ending prematurely. There is also the issue of Isobel herself; if she is killed or knocked out during the battle, it will doom everyone in the area as the shield keeping the curse at bay will fall. So, while chatting with Isobel might seem like the obvious choice, it is best to avoid her room to keep everyone safe in the long run.\nWhen venturing into the Mountain Pass area, the party will meet Lady Esther, a member of the Society of Brilliance, who will ask the party to retrieve a githyanki egg for her. There are a few ways to complete this quest by either giving her what she wants or giving her an owlbear egg. However, if either egg is handed over, the Society of Brilliance in Baldur’s Gate is doomed as both the hatched githyanki or the owlbear will kill everyone in their lodge.\nThere is a chance to visit a Zhentarim hideout during Act 1 and meet a captured artist named Oskar. He will thank the party for their assistance if freed and promise a reward when they finally reach Baldur’s Gate. This seems to be the end of it; however, when Oskar is met again in Act 3, things have gone terribly wrong.\nRescuing Oskar can snowball into a much longer questline, which will lead the party to cross paths with the Mystic Carrion, a mummy lord living in Baldur’s Gate. This, in turn, will lead to its own quest as some of the Mystic’s servants have run away. There is some great loot and lore from both of these questlines that all start with one chat in Act 1.\nOne of the smallest decisions in Baldur’s Gate 3 that can lead to massive implications is Raphael’s deal in Act 3. While the choice to free Prince Orpheus or help the Emperor might seem like a big decision, on the grand cosmic scale, it isn’t that important. Both will aid the party in much the same way when facing the Netherbrain.\nHowever, it is what Raphael wants that makes this decision’s consequences matter. In exchange for the Orphic Hammer, Raphael wants the Crown of Karsus and he makes it very clear that he wishes to rule the Nine Hells. An after-credits cutscene with Raphael further drives home the true implications of this decision as it becomes obvious that Raphael has no intention of stopping with the Nine Hells, meaning that the hero of Baldur’s Gate 3 has doomed millions with the stroke of a pen.\n"}

One cackling villain ups the ante and creates even more copies of himself during his final showdown with his copycat.\nWarning! Spoilers ahead for The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #11!Fans who thought three Jokers were enough might want to prepare themselves. As two Clown Princes of Crime wage war, one goes all out by making an entire army of grinning doppelgangers with a devious purpose.\nIn The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #11 by Matthew Rosenberg, Carmine Di Giandomenico, and Romulo Fajardo Jr., Gotham is going to hell in a handbasket as the Gotham and LA Jokers continue their epic war against each other. Gotham's Joker and his crew roll up on a poor custodian and kidnap him, adding him to the collection of other victims that the Joker has snatched.\nAs chaos reigns throughout the city, Ravager and Manhunter run into each other, stumbling upon the van the Joker's gang was driving, now empty. They track the Joker down to his lair and attempt to take him out. Though Joker gets the better of Manhunter, Ravager shoots the villain in the shoulder. With no other option, Joker retreats and pulls out an unexpected surprise. He reveals his kidnapping victims have all been surgically altered to resemble the Joker.

One Joker moved out to Los Angeles, intent on expanding his criminal endeavors across the entire nation. But another remained in Gotham, trying to recover after being shot in the head and suffering gaps in his memory as a result. Both Harlequins of Hate were certain that they were the original, but Gotham's Joker finally regained his memory and remembered the impostor Joker was actually a former henchman that had been poisoned by Joker venom and surgically altered to resemble the Joker.\nEver since the publication of the Black Label miniseries Three Jokers, copies of the iconic villain have become an increasingly common sight. DC has even introduced a new villain known as Red Mask who can create Jokers on a whim. However, the latest batch of clowns doesn't seem to be intended as anything more than a trump card for Gotham's Joker. He used one doppelganger to attack LA's Joker and experienced a reluctance to use his victims on Ravager and Manhunter. Gotham's Joker likely wanted to take his copycat out in the most ironic way possible by killing him with other false Jokers.\nWhether he's the real one or not, Gotham's Joker has taken umbrage at another Joker existing in the DCU. Gotham's Joker swore he'd win in the end, and it looks like his final move was intended to put an end to the entire copycat Joker movement. It's a pretty creative manner of killing: It's violent, attention-grabbing, and essentially says LA's Joker was a fake like all the rest. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like Gotham's Joker will get the chance to use this creative method of execution. Seeing more than one Joker might be wearing thin for some, but this is a hell of a closing act for the multiple Joker shtick. The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #11 is on sale now.\n"}

With the popularity of this genre soaring, Netflix has consistently delivered engaging and thought-provoking detective series. Whether it's in a big city or a small town, a crime or investigation can go anywhere, and more often than not, no character is safe.\nFor crime drama enthusiasts, it may feel that all available storylines have been exhausted. However, 2023 has seen a wave of new releases for Netflix, including new episodes of viewer favorites Luther and season 5 of Top Boy. Netflix also saw a huge audience response to the release of Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story in 2022, and the streaming giant is clearly keen to grow its impact within the genre by producing more riveting detective series.\nFeaturing eccentric American star James Spader, The Blacklist is a crime thriller series that follows a wanted fugitive as he assists the FBI in catching deadly criminals. This fast-paced mystery was praised for its overall entertainment, and Spader's incredible performance added an extra layer of tension to the screen. Despite some elements that require a suspension of disbelief and comedic moments that feel out of place, The Blacklist was generally positively received and well-worth watching.\nThe psychological drama Mindhunter follows two FBI agents in a unique take on the 1955 non-fiction book Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit. The show ran for three seasons, but Mindhunter was canceled in 2023. The one silver lining of Mindhunter's cancellation is it means that viewers can now binge every episode on Netflix. Unlike other shows that revolve around the FBI, Mindhunter follows a research project trying to understand the in-depth psyche of serial killers, rather than being out in the field, offering a unique perspective on real-world practices.\nIn The Sinner, Bill Pullman plays Detective Harry Ambrose, who focuses on crimes committed by surprising and typically unlikely culprits, trying to work out the motivation that led to their crimes. The show started as an eight-part miniseries, but due to an overwhelmingly positive response, the series was commissioned for a further three seasons. The Sinner also received multiple nominations for several awards while it was airing, including a Golden Globe nomination for Best Miniseries or Television Film.\nRelated: 10 Best Crime Movies On Netflix\nLupin is a retelling of the story of fictional French thief Arsène Lupin, created by author Maurice Leblanc. Lupin follows Assane Diop, a young thief who models himself after Arsène Lupin. The French language drama was watched by seventy-six million people in its first month, making it the most popular non-English language show on Netflix at that time (per The Hollywood Reporter). The show was then renewed for two further installments, the latest airing in October 2023, with no announcements for further episodes at this time.\nStarring David Tennant and Stanley Tucci, Inside Man tells the intense story of two very different people whose lives end up intercrossing: a prisoner in the United States, currently on death row, and a woman trapped in the cellar of an old, English vicarage. Tennant's performance is laced with anticipation and drama, and the dark themes throughout have the occasional comedic moment, although the ending of Inside Man proves somewhat confusing.\nStarring EGOT winner Viola Davis, How to Get Away with Murder made an incredible impact upon its initial release in 2014. The show ran for six years and finished in 2020. It follows Davis' character Annalise Keating, a defense attorney based in Philadelphia who, alongside five of her students, manages to get caught up in a murder plot. Davis' performance earned her a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, making her the first black woman to ever win the award (per NPR).\nRelated: How To Get Away With Murder: 15 Shows To Watch If You Love This Series\nWhen the stories of a suburban mother, a photographer, and a detective overlap, the mystery of missing father Stewart Green begins to rear its head once again, seventeen years after his disappearance in Stay Close. The Netflix detective series is based on the novel of the same name by author Harlan Coben. Coben has adapted more of his crime novels for Netflix, including Safe and The Stranger which also rank highly among the best detective series on Netflix.\nFour-part criminal thriller Collateral stars The Great Gatsby's Carey Mulligan as DI Kip Glaspie, who is thrown into the murder investigation of a delivery driver in South West London. Set across four days, the gripping British drama interweaves the lives of several seemingly unconnected characters. Collateral does a great job of making a comment on societal structures, while still focusing on the mystery at its core.\nAnother international detective series from Netflix, Deadwind is a Finnish crime drama that follows Detective Sofia Karppi who returns to work following the very sudden and accidental death of her husband. Upon her immediate return, Sofia is thrown into a murder investigation of a woman with suspicious connections to a construction company, while still having to raise her two children by herself. Deadwind has a gripping story that elevates it to one of Netflix's strongest outings.\nThe comedy-mystery Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency is based on the book of the same name, which was inspired by two episodes of Doctor Who written by the author Douglas Adams. It was then adapted for television in 2010, but only lasted for two years before it was adapted once again by BBC America and Netflix in 2016. However, the show was canceled again less than a year on the air.

Unfortunately, Netflix canceled American Vandal season 3, but the producers announced their hopes to move the show to elsewhere in the future.\nThe German miniseries Dear Child arrived on Netflix in September 2023 and was immediately praised for how it tackles the topic of child abduction. The show follows Lena, who manages to escape thirteen years of captivity, having birthed a son and a daughter in this time.

Intense and distressing, Dear Child is a gripping and fast-paced thriller ideal for audiences who enjoyed Broadchurch.\nAnother French drama, The Forest follows the arrest of a teacher after her student disappears in the same forest that she has a suspicious history with. The series aired in France and Belgium in 2017, before being broadcast internationally on Netflix in 2018, running as a mini-series spanning six fifty-seven-minute episodes.
