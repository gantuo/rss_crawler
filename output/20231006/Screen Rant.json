However, when she received the first date card of the season, Aven wasn't in Paradise yet.\nKylee asked Will Urena to join her for the first Bachelor in Paradise season 9 date, and they hit it off. However, when Aven arrived on the beach the next day, and asked Kylee on a date, she accepted. They had a wonderful time, and Kylee broke things off with a heartbroken Will. Kylee and Aven seem to be making a connection, leaving people wondering if they're still together today.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nKylee is a 25-year-old postpartum nurse from Charlotte, North Carolina. She made her Bachelor Nation debut on Zach Shallcross' Bachelor season. She and Zach didn't really have much of a connection. Zach eliminated Kylee over Zoom when he had COVID-19.\nKylee was also known for her conflict with Anastasia Keramidas, which led to an important discussion about microaggressions toward women of color. While on a group date, Kylee tried to steal Zach away from Anastasia. When Anastasia refused, Kylee said, \"I don't like to fight but...\" Anastasia told the others that Kylee was aggressive, and that she was scared of her. At \"The Women Tell All\" special, Genevie Mayo explained how this was an example of a microaggression because Kylee was not a threatening person. Anastasia apologized and said that it wasn't her intention.\nAven is a 29-year-old sales executive from Salem Massachusetts. He first appeared on Rachel Recchia and Gabby Windey's Bachelorette season. He shared a deep connection with Rachel, and was her runner-up.

He assumes that they left the show as a couple, but didn't go to the Fantasy Suites, and he doesn't think that they were there at the end. However, Reality Steve said that it's very clear that they're together post-show\nOn August 10, both Kylee and Aven posted from the Jason Aldean concert in Charlotte. The following Saturday afternoon, they posted Instagram stories within ten minutes of each other from the same exact section of the Carolina Panthers exhibition game. Charlotte is Kylee's hometown. As of now, Reality Steve hasn't announced that they've broken up, so they're probably still together.\nAlthough Kylee and Aven's relationship began with Kylee having to break up with Will, they seem like had a great connection on their date. They had good chemistry and shared some kisses. Hopefully, Aven and Kylee found the love that they've been searching for on Bachelor in Paradise season 9.\nBachelor in Paradise airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. EDT on ABC.\nSource: Daily Roundup\n"}
{"title": "&quot;Looking Like Tarzan&quot;: Prey Cut A Wild Scene Where The Predator & Naru Meet Much Earlier", "date": "2023-10-06 02:59:20", "text": "Prey director Dan Trachtenberg cut an early scene where the Predator and Naru met earlier in the treetops due to budget and execution concerns.\nPrey director Dan Trachtenberg explains why a scene introducing Naru to the new Predator sooner was cut. The Predator franchise's return to feature movies saw Amber Midthunder's determined young hunter set out to prove herself when another hunter from across the stars began its own bloody game across the Great Plains in 1719. While Prey passed over a theatrical release and instead went straight to Hulu, it earned widespread acclaim from critics and has been seen as a return to form for the franchise.\nWith Prey now receiving a home release, Trachtenberg sat down with /Film and opened up about the movie's production, shedding some light on moments that didn't make it into the final cut. The director revealed that initially, Naru would encounter the Predator in the trees early on. For various reasons, which he explained, this was cut. Check out Trachtenberg's complete explanation below:\nI don't. This was a little bit of a filmmaking director trick of the trade. On the one hand, it was a sequence as we were devising it — Naru was in the tree in the beginning, so in my mind, it was to set up the sequence at the end, that the physical capabilities were there and the visual language was sort of already in the movie. I love the idea of seeing her running through the tree, and the Predator up there, because he's up in the tree so often in these films. Putting her up there, too, it could have been really fun. But I was also incredibly nervous that it ended up looking like Tarzan. The execution had to be perfect for it to be great. Then, it was also becoming very costly to do, and [it was] time-consuming, which, sometimes, is the same thing.\nIt was in the parking lot next to our stage, starting to map out where the trees were going to go, and having a talk with my producers about the cost and the implications and what's our schedule and other things that we needed also. So rather than fight to make it work, when other things were getting squeezed, I sort of waited until the things that were also critical were getting impacted. I said, \"You know what? What if we lost the thing? What if I took out that whole sequence? Then we could do this other ... Surely, you can't tell me that we can't.\"\nBut in the back of my mind, it was like, Okay, Dan. You're nervous about it already. Listen to your gut. It might not be great. The thing that I was the saddest to lose was, I thought, a clever use of the cut clamp, one of the Predator's weapons that Naru has in the sequence. So now, I'm glad that people can kind of see what it was. Previz is a tool that we use all the time in movies and TV sometimes, and movie fans and potential future filmmakers never get to see that stuff, so it's cool that they have it now.\nWhile Trachtenberg's initial idea for Naru and the Predator's first meeting was scrapped, the idea of it leaves the question of how Prey's narrative would be impacted by the sequence. It could be argued that seeing Naru's keen hunting skills could've impacted her journey, as her growth from a young hunter to the slayer of an advanced alien rival helped endear her to the audience, solidifying her as a captivating protagonist. While it likely wouldn't dampen her growth too much, it would make her actions in during the ending of Prey less of a surprise, as her skills would've already been shown.\nRelated: What Would Happen If Naru Met Other Predator Heroes?\nFurthermore, Naru's first true encounter with the Predator in Prey's final cut would surely be diminished if the pair met earlier. Naru's first glimpse at the Predator is both a surprise for her and the audience, as the alien makes his presence known when he slays a grizzly bear that she has been battling alone. Not only is the Predator's bloody intervention a shock, but it being able to annihilate large threats like bears with ease instantly makes Naru see how dangerous her foe truly is, raising the stakes further than before.\nWhile Prey's alternate first encounter established Naru's skill set and parallels with her Predator rival, the final execution proves that a longer wait may have been worth it. Alongside making her growth more captivating to watch and allowing further surprises, the greater build-up allowed for more anticipation around the Predator's on-screen debut. However, Trachtenberg still ensured a pre-visualized concept of this scene exists to give viewers a glimpse at an alternate take on the movie.\nSource: /Film\n"}
{"title": "Every Loki Season 2 Episode 1 MCU Easter Egg & Reference", "date": "2023-10-06 02:43:21", "text": "Loki season 2 continues the God of Mischief’s MCU time-travel journey with episode 1, an installment filled with wider MCU Easter eggs and references.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Loki season 2, episode 1.\nLoki season 2, episode 1 continues the titular God of Mischief's MCU journey, bringing plenty of references and connections to the wider franchise with it. More so than many other Marvel Disney+ shows, Loki is tied intrinsically to the status of the MCU. The events of Loki season 1 were instrumental in the foundation of the MCU multiverse that led to stories like Spider-Man: No Way Home and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness becoming possible.\nJust as Loki season 1 kickstarted the events of the Multiverse Saga, Loki season 2 will be integral to its progression. This means that Loki season 2 will be filled with wider references to other MCU properties as well as other fun Easter eggs pertaining to different elements of the character. As such, here is every Easter egg, reference, and fun nod found in Loki season 2, episode 1, \"Ouroborus.\"\nMidway through Loki season 2, episode 1, Loki is introduced to Ke Huy Quan's character named Ouroboros, seemingly explaining the Loki season 2, episode 1 title. However, it has a deeper meaning than simply referencing the lovable new TVA agent. In the real world, an Ouroboros is a circular symbol often depicting a snake or a dragon devouring its own tail to signify the endless cycle of destruction and rebirth. Given the events of Loki season 2, episode 1, this seems fitting while also propping up Quan's O.B. to have a major role in the upcoming season.\nA common Easter egg that has come to be expected by every new Marvel Studios project is the updated logo for the company. With Loki season 2, episode 1, the Marvel Studios logo is gold and green. This reflects the two primary colors of Loki's design throughout the MCU as both an Easter egg to the character's past and the prominent color scheme of the first season.\nIn the opening chase sequence of Loki season 2, episode 1, Kang's statue is shown towering above the TVA. While this could be seen as simply a reference to the overall villain of the Multiverse Saga, it holds a deeper meaning. The camera pans backward from the statue and back into the TVA building in which Loki is being chased almost as if the statue is watching the events unfold. This is an Easter egg to both He Who Remains and Kang's presence in Loki season 2, with both versions of the character having presided over timelines as they watched events take place.\nJust as Marvel Studios properties have delved into the multiverse, so too have Sony's Spider-Verse movies. In the latter franchise, characters are shown to \"glitch\" when they are in a universe different from their own. The visual representation of glitching is incredibly similar to Loki's time-slipping. While a slightly different phenomenon in context, the visual design of Loki's time-slipping was likely an intentional Easter egg to another prominent Marvel multiversal story.\nAs is known from Loki season 1 and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Jonathan Majors will be responsible for bringing Kang the Conqueror's many variants to life. In Loki season 2, episode 1, a neat Easter egg features Majors' first appearance in the season. When slipping into the past, Loki finds a recording of He Who Remains and Ravonna Renslayer from the time of the Multiversal War which provides context to the TVA's history while also providing a fun Easter egg to Majors' overarching MCU role.\nThe character of Loki in Marvel is based on Norse mythology as is the rest of Asgard. In Norse myth, it is said that a world tree known as Yggdrasil holds together the Nine Realms on its branches. In Loki season 2, the Temporal Loom provides a similar function. The Temporal Loom takes branches of the timeline and forms them into physical matter, essentially acting as the Yggdrasil of the MCU and providing an Easter egg to Loki's Norse origins.\nOne of the more memed aspects of Loki's character in the MCU is his endless amount of hair flips. In Loki season 2, episode 1, this continues in abundance. After every time slip, Loki dramatically flips his hair over his shoulder. Given the countless time-slips shown in Loki season 2, episode 1, Loki's extra, over-the-top dramatic tendencies continue.\nThe new end-credit sequence of Loki season 2 provides an Easter egg to the state of the overall story. In Loki season 1, it was revealed that He Who Remains essentially constructed the Sacred Timeline to lead Loki and Sylvie to the Citadel at the End of Time. In Loki season 2, episode 1's end credit sequence, someone is shown reconstructing the events of the episode with miniatures and models. This references the central themes of Loki's story which center on the idea of free will against predetermination that will undoubtedly continue in season 2.\nThe end-credit scene of Loki season 2, episode 1 sees Sylvie exiting the Citadel at the End of Time in Broxton, Oklahoma. At first, this may seem like an innocuous location, yet it has deeper comic-book connections. In Marvel Comics, Broxton is where Thor rebuilds Asgard after the events of Ragnarok. While the MCU depicted this differently with New Asgard being situated in Norway, Loki season 2, episode 1's end-credit sequence including Broxton is a neat Easter egg to Marvel Comics.\nNew episodes of Loki release every Tuesday on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Loki Season 2 Episode 1 Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-06 02:16:08", "text": "Loki season 2 hits the ground running in episode 1 which culminates in a twist-filled ending to set the tone for the God of Mischief’s second outing.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Loki season 2, episode 1.\nLoki season 2 begins almost exactly where the first season left off, with episode 1's ending providing plenty of twists and turns for the beginning of the God of Mischief's second solo MCU outing. In Loki season 2, episode 1, the titular Asgardian is attempting to deal with his new reality: a TVA under the control of Kang the Conqueror. What's more, Loki's former ally - Owen Wilson's Mobius - does not remember him as the lovable rouge begins slipping through time be it the past, present, or future.\nAs such, much of Loki season 2, episode 1 centers on Loki's predicament. Loki discovers that the Mobius who does not remember him is a result of him time-slipping into the past which provides plenty of Loki season 2, episode 1 Easter eggs. The episode is chaotic, to say the least, as the present timeline features Loki, Mobius, and Ke Huy Quan's O.B. finding a way to stop Loki's time-slipping before it is too late as the rest of the TVA deals with the aftermath of He Who Remains' death. With such a confusing, time-travel-oriented plot, here is everything explained about Loki season 2, episode 1's ending.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Episode 1's Post-Credits Scene Is Way Deeper Than You Realize\nThe episode opens exactly where Loki season 1 left off with Loki having time-slipped into the past of the TVA. After escaping the pursuing TVA soldiers, Loki crashes through a building and encounters the past version of Casey who does not remember him. Loki then slips for the first time back into the present as he tries to reunite with Mobius to explain his issue. After slipping between the past and present a few more times in his pursuit of Mobius, Loki finds himself in the War Room of the TVA in the past.\nHere he finds recordings of He Who Remains and Ravonna Renslayer from the Multiversal War and sees the original designs of the former's face adorning the War Room walls. Loki subsequently slips back into the present to finally encounter the versions of Mobius and B-15 that remember him, finally reuniting the cast of characters for Loki season 2. Loki begins explaining the complex situation to everyone present before Mobius opts to take Loki to Ouroborus - or O.B. for short - in an attempt to fix the time-slipping.\nLoki's time-slipping becomes more frequent from this point, often used for humor with his destination not shown until O.B.'s first scene. During this scene, Loki talks to the O.B. of the past while Mobius converses with the O.B. of the present. Eventually, Loki returns to the present until the third act of Loki season 2, episode 1 adds another twist to the tale.\nThe final time slip of the episode sees Loki travel into the TVA's future. Here, everything is in chaos. Loki frantically searches for a Timestick to conduct his part of O.B.'s plan to stop the time-skipping but not before he encounters Sylvie in the future. Sylvie makes it seem as though she has been searching for Loki before an unknown assailant prunes the latter, returning him to the present with Mobius and O.B. before the episode ends.\nConcerning how Loki managed to stop time-slipping, the answer is somewhat convoluted. O.B.'s plan to stop Loki's time-slipping was to have Loki prune himself as a means of stripping all traces of himself from every timeline. To make the plan succeed though, Loki had to prune himself at the same moment as Mobius activated a device called a Temporal Aura Extractor. According to O.B.'s theorizing, these two events happening at the same time would allow Loki to be pulled back into the present to stop him slipping through time.\nBy the time of Loki season 2, episode 1's ending, this plan is thrown into action. Loki slips into the future of the TVA as he frantically searches for a Timestick to prune himself when the time comes. Mobius puts the Temporal Aura Extractor in place, connected to the Temporal Loom - the aspect of the TVA that converts raw time into physical timelines. Eventually, Loki is pruned in the future by an unknown person meaning the Temporal Aura Extractor can pull him into the present, stopping the time-slipping seemingly for good.\nOne of the burning mysteries of Loki season 2, episode 1 was who pruned Loki in the future. As Loki is captivated by Sylvie's sudden appearance, someone prunes him from behind before anything else can be explained leaving both the audience and Loki without answers. Similarly, Loki returns to the present meaning it was not revealed who pruned him. The likely answer is that it was Loki who pruned himself. Loki is now aware that, at some point, a version of himself will appear at that exact point in time needing to be pruned to stop the time-slipping meaning he takes it upon himself to provide this.\nAlongside the question of who pruned Loki in the future, this scene provides many other questions. One of those is what Sylvie is doing in the TVA. As of the ending of Loki season 2, episode 1, the answer to this is unclear. It is likely that these events will be shown from the perspective of Loki and Sylvie as the season goes on given they take place in the future, potentially even in the final episode as the season delves even deeper than its predecessor into complicated time-travel storytelling.\nAnother unanswered question as of Loki season 2, episode 1's ending is who is calling the TVA phone in the future. As Loki sees Sylvie just before being pruned, a phone can be heard ringing in the TVA. The phone receives a lot of attention from both Loki and the camera meaning whoever is on the other end will likely be vital to the series' overarching story yet the identity of this mysterious caller is left frustratingly unclear as of the ending of Loki season 2, episode 1.\nAn interesting element of Loki season 2, episode 1 is that it changes the established time-travel rules of the MCU. In Avengers: Endgame, Hulk stated that it was impossible for someone who had traveled back to the past to change the future. Hulk explained that anything that happens in the past simply causes a brand-new timeline. However, Loki season 2, episode 1 proved different. Loki was directly impacting the events of the present when he time-slipped into the past as evident in his conversation with O.B. This could be because of the different time rules of the TVA yet regardless, it proves the MCU's time-travel rules are changing with Loki season 2.\nOne of the new elements of the MCU multiverse in Loki season 2, episode 1 is the Temporal Loom. O.B. describes the Temporal Loom as the section of the TVA in which raw time is refined to create physical timelines. O.B. also states that the endless branching of the timeline caused by He Who Remains' death is causing the Temporal Loom to overload which is causing Loki's time-slipping and the power surges at the TVA.\nConcerning what this means for the MCU multiverse, the ramifications could be huge. O.B. mentions that he will attempt to retrofit the Temporal Loom to handle the endless expansion of branching timelines. This could mean that the events of Loki season 2 essentially create the multiverse as O.B. figures this out which allows countless timelines to exist together. Regarding how else the Temporal Loom will affect the MCU multiverse, Loki season 2's next five episodes will hopefully reveal more.\nFinally, regarding what General Dox has planned for Sylvie in Loki season 2, episode 1, she simply wants answers. The TVA is in chaos after the death of He Who Remains which causes higher-ups like General Dox to somewhat panic. As a result, Dox states that she needs to know exactly what happened at the End of Time. To do so, Dox begins sending every single available TVA agent after Sylvie to extract an explanation from her, something that will undoubtedly cause trouble going into Loki season 2's future episodes.\nNew episodes of Loki release every Tuesday on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Is Jonathan Majors' Kang In Loki Season 2?", "date": "2023-10-06 01:56:26", "text": "Audiences might wonder if Jonathan Majors' Kang is in Loki season 2 after He Who Remains and Kang the Conqueror were introduced in the MCU.\nWARNING: This article contains SPOILERS for Loki season 2, episode 1\nAfter he was introduced in season 1 and set up to become the next main villain of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, audiences may be wondering if Jonathan Majors' Kang is in Loki season 2. Majors joined the MCU in the Loki season 1 finale as the Kang variant He Who Remains, a version of Nathaniel Richards who had defeated all others and kept them at bay by creating the sacred timeline. Although Sylvie ended up killing He Who Remains and setting the multiverse loose, Marvel had made it clear that it wouldn't be the last viewers saw of Kang.\nSince then, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania introduced another variant, Kang the Conqueror, who was the main villain to Scott Lang and his family. Though that particular iteration of Kang was defeated by Ant-Man, the Quantumania post-credits scenes established there were innumerable other Kangs from across the multiverse. The second of the scenes also revealed a new version of Majors' Kang would be in Loki season 2, but now that the first episode has aired and he was nowhere to be seen, there might be some confusion over whether the villain will appear.\nAs seen in the Loki season 2 trailer, Majors will reprise his role as Kang variant Victor Timely in the show after appearing in the Quantumania credits scene. Little is known about the MCU's version of Victor Timely, since all that's been revealed is that he's an inventor/scientist of some kind working with time theory. In the Marvel Comics, Victor Timely is a persona adopted by Nathaniel Richards after he time travels from the future to the past.\nA month following the release of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Majors was arrested March 25 in New York City on charges of strangulation, assault and harassment. Although a trial date has not been set as of publication, the allegations against the actor have sparked speculation about his future in the MCU. Marvel Studios hasn't commented on the situation, but Loki executive producer Kevin Wright told Variety that Majors' arrest didn't affect season 2 because filming had wrapped in 2022.\nWright went on to explain there weren't any discussions about changing Majors' role in Loki season 2, saying, \"No. And that mainly came from — I know as much as you do at the moment. It felt hasty to do anything without knowing how all of this plays out.\" Given Wright's comments, it seems Marvel is waiting to see the final verdict of Majors' trial before deciding on his MCU future. Since the season was done before Majors' arrest, the show wasn't affected and Majors is still expected to appear in Loki season 2.\nIt's not known exactly which episode or episodes Majors will appear in during Loki season 2, but now that the premiere has aired, it's confirmed he wasn't in it. It's unlikely Majors' Victor Timely will be saved for the season 2 finale since he appeared in the trailer. After all, He Who Remains was hidden from all the Loki season 1 marketing, and he didn't appear until the finale. Since Victor Timely is shown in the trailers, he'll presumably appear earlier in the season, but exactly which episode of Loki season 2 remains to be seen.\nLoki season 2 continues next Thursday, Oct. 12 at 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "The MCU Just Broke A Time Travel Rule The Avengers Called Unbreakable Only 4 Years Ago", "date": "2023-10-06 01:50:26", "text": "The MCU just broke one of its biggest time travel rules, only four years after it was established as unbreakable by Marvel movie canon.\nWARNING: This Article Contains SPOILERS For Loki Season 2, Episode 1\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe introduced time travel in Avengers: Endgame, but four years later, Loki season 2 has broken one of the major rules established by Marvel Studios' 2019 movie. After Thanos snapped away half the universe in Avengers: Infinity War, Earth's Mightiest Heroes set out to figure out how to travel through time in order to undo the devastation wreaked by the Mad Titan. With the help of Tony Stark's genius and Scott Lang's knowledge of the Quantum Realm, they managed it, and used time travel to gather the Infinity Stones and defeat Thanos.\nEndgame also established a certain number of time travel rules, the biggest of which was that if someone traveled back in time and changed the past, it wouldn't affect the present. As Smart Hulk explains, \"If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future, and your former present becomes the past, which can't now be changed by your new future.\" The scene further established that time travel in movies like Back to the Future and The Terminator are incorrect because their premises are based on the theory that changing the past does, in fact, change the future. However, the Loki season 2 premiere completely breaks this rule in a big way.\nRelated: Loki’s Powers Explained In Full: How Each Ability Is Different\nIn Loki season 2, episode 1, Loki is having trouble time-slipping, which essentially means he's being pulled between the past, present and future at random. This actually comes in handy when he and Mobius visit the TVA's chief engineer Ouroboros, aka OB, for help putting an end to the time-slipping. Loki meets OB in the present, then time-slips to the past, where he has a conversation with the engineer about how to fix his time-slipping problem, leading the past OB to create a Temporal Aura Extractor that will help solve the problem in the present. Since OB is shown remembering the conversation with Loki as it's happening in the past, the audience can deduce that Loki's actions in the past are changing the future.\nThis goes against everything Smart Hulk, and by extension Avengers: Endgame, established in terms of how time travel works in the MCU. If changing the past affected the future, then everything from the Avengers' time heist would've had ripple effects and when they returned to their present, it would've been completely different. Thanos may never have been able to achieve the snap in the first place, and it would've been an anticlimactic ending to the Infinity Saga. However, establishing one set of rules in Endgame and then proceeding to retcon them over and over and over again in Marvel movies and shows since has only led to more confusion. Still, there's an easy way for Marvel to explain Loki breaking Endgame's time travel rules.\nThere's one repeating line in Loki that helps to explain why the God of Mischief was able to change the future by changing the past: Time works differently in the TVA. It's a constant refrain in Loki season 1, and that theme has continued into season 2. If time as a whole works differently, it stands to reason that time travel works differently as well. This would be an easy explanation for Loki being able to break Endgame's rules, because Loki time-slipping breaks even the rules known by the TVA. However, the episode also establishes that the way time works in the TVA is changing, which may be explained by the creation of the multiverse.\nEndgame took place before Sylvie killed He Who Remains, so the MCU was existing within the Sacred Timeline, and any changes to it would've been pruned by the TVA. Hulk's time travel rules may have been true for the Sacred Timeline, due to factors outside his and the audience's knowledge, but now that the multiverse exists, time travel doesn't work in the same way. This explanation would set up the MCU to not have to adhere to the rules established in Endgame, while not actively retconning the movie. \nOf course, it still means that Marvel needs to re-establish what the MCU's time travel rules are and ensure all movies and shows stick to them. Considering the massive multiversal war teased by Loki, and the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania post-credits scene, it's important audiences are clear on how time travel and travel between multiverses works—not just in a single movie or show, but across the entire franchise. Endgame's time travel rules were already confusing and have been made worse because they've been retconned so many times that it's become a running joke, and even Loki season 2 joined in on poking fun.\nWhen Loki, OB and Mobius are having their conversation across time, Mobius realizes that Loki is changing the present by changing the past, and OB says \"there's no flaw in that logic.\" Although the dialogue doesn't call out the Avengers or Endgame by name, it feels like a major diss to the 2019 MCU movie due to how many times Endgame's logic has been called into question. The pithy comment is played as a joke, and considering Endgame established rules directly contrary to the scene, it makes the Avengers movie the butt of the joke.\nThat said, the Loki season 2 premiere likely isn't trying to be maliciously mean to Endgame, especially since the movie is beloved by many and was by far the MCU's most successful film to date. But Endgame's time travel rules have been widely discussed and dissected ever since it released, and even within the movie itself, they don't make much sense. Having Loki rewrite the time travel rules of the MCU, while poking a bit of fun at Endgame, is a good way to show audiences that Marvel knows what they're doing and are trying to fix their mistakes.\nIt also shows that Endgame's time travel issues are incredibly far-reaching and, even four years later, Loki is still working to fix them so the MCU can move forward into its Multiverse Saga. With Loki potentially changing Marvel's time travel rules (again), hopefully future MCU movies and shows will make more sense, especially Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars. While that remains to be seen, we do know Loki was able to break a major time travel rule established in Avengers: Endgame—while poking fun of the Marvel movie in the process.\nLoki season 2 continues next Thursday, Oct. 12 at 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}

Following directly on from the daring mission to pull Tom Hiddleston's Loki out of the timeline and stop his time-slipping, the first Loki season 2 stinger is also an important one.\nLoki season 2 has already started off strongly, with a complicated storyline injected with a lot of scientific jargon (not least from Ke Huy Quan’s Ouroboros). It’s also very obvious that the show is less interested in tying to wider MCU timeline events, and focusing instead on the continued battle for the Sacred Timeline set up by Loki season 1’s ending. But that doesn’t mean all MCU traits are out the window, with the post-credits scene offering that element of familiarity.\n Watch Loki On Disney+\nAfter the credits role on Loki season 2 episode 1’s ending and Loki has avoided being spaghettified or lost in time, the post-credits scene flips back to Sophia Di Martino’s Sylvie in the immediate aftermath of He Who Remain's death. Sylvie transports herself to 1982, enters a McDonalds (perfectly rebuilt from the early 1980s designs, including the freakish cartoon tree), speaks to the young manager and orders one of everything on the menu. Quite how she pays for all of those burgers, fries and nuggets is anyone's guess, but since the marketing has spoiled that Sylvie ends up working at the same McDonalds, maybe she's forced initially to do so to pay off the fast food debt. Or she uses magic.\nRelated: How Powerful Each Loki Variant Really Is (& Who Is The Strongest)\nAs confirmed by the Loki season 2 episode 1 post-credits scene, Sylvie didn't stay in the Citadel at the End of Time after killing Jonathan Majors' He Who Remains in season 1's finale. Having completed her mission, she did exactly as Thanos did, seeking her own personal peace, by leaving and jumping somewhere else in the timeline. Sylvie's outfit all but confirms that the McDonalds scene happens immediately after He Who Remains' death.\nThe question most will have watching the Loki season 2 episode 1 post-credits scene is why McDonalds and why 1982. For the first answer, you have to consider Sylvie's tragic origin story. As she reveals in Loki's Lamentis episode, the TVA attempted to prune her when she was roughly ten years old in human terms (but a lot older as a Frost Giant). She flees and spends the rest of her life on the run, which, judging by the life-span of Frost Giants (at least around 5000 years), would mean she'd probably been on the run for thousands of years. She never got her chance of her truly formative years, which would have included simple pleasures like the Asgardian equivalent of McDonalds.\nSylvie seems drawn to McDonalds because of the same wonder that made the fast food giants so popular with children. It's a simple, almost naive pleasure, completely in contrast with Sylvie's life of fight and flight. Sylvie has also never been able to enjoy anything, constantly looking over her shoulder and having to move everywhere to keep ahead of the TVA. Being able to go somewhere as innocuous as McDonalds and not be worried about how conspicuous she is in her Asgardian outfit, which she noticeably doesn't disguise, is a huge indication that she believes she's beaten the TVA.\nRelated: How Old Is Sylvie Compared To Loki?\nLoki season 2 episode 1 suggests that Loki time slips because Sylvie kicks him back into the past from the Citadel at the End of Time before she kills He Who Remains. Because he was previously pruned - i.e. removed from the timeline - his presence back on the timeline causes a glitch, sending him randomly slipping through time without warning. In contrast, Sylvie was never pruned - or at least wasn't \"deleted\" using one of the TVA time sticks - so is able to go back to the timeline in 1982 without the same danger of time slipping.Related: Why Loki Is Glitching In Season 2: Time-Slipping Explained\nSylvie's choice of the small town of Broxton, Oklahoma for her new home may not seem to have any significance in Loki's TV show lore, but it is an important site in Marvel Comics, which suggests it may be some sort of nexus location in wider Marvel lore. In the comics, Thor purchases land just outside of Broxton (paying with a truck load of gold), to rebuild Asgard in the wake of Ragnarok.\nObviously, in the MCU, Thor and Valkyrie rebuilt Asgard in Norway, but the new Asgard was in America on the page, setting up the events of Siege, which took place around Broxton. In that event, Norman Osborn seeks to invade Asgard, under the pretense of a threat to the United States, but really as a means to strengthen his own power. Loki actually plays a key role in that Siege, convincing Osborn to orchestrate a tragedy at Soldier Field football stadium, where thousands of civilians are killed during a battle between Volstagg and villains working for Osborn, as he and Loki watch on.\nOther notable events in Broxton include it being the site of the death of Cul Borson (AKA Serpent), as well as a war between the Asgardians and Galactus, and finally, its destruction by the God Of Hammers, which killed its residents, as a means to draw Thor's anger. Sylvie heading there in Loki's season 2 episode 1 post-credits scene doesn't tie to those events - though it could similarly endanger the town and its people - but it fits a rich Marvel history.\nLoki season 2 continues next Thursday, Oct. 12 at 9pm ET on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Suits Officially Breaks Another Streaming Record After Previously Tying With A Netflix Original", "date": "2023-10-06 01:32:17", "text": "Suits' relentless streaming dominance continues after breaking another streaming record it once tied for alongside a hit Netflix Original.\nContinuing its record-breaking streaming trend, the 2011 legal drama Suits has officially smashed another record in Nielsen’s viewership rankings, overtaking yet another massive Netflix original. First climbing back into widespread public consciousness when the hit drama began dominating streaming charts four years after it ended, Suits would eventually overtake Netflix’s hit show Wednesday for weekly viewership minutes. More recently, it also tied with Netflix’s Ozark for spending the longest time atop Nielsen’s Top 10 Overall Charts.\nPer The Hollywood Reporter, Suits can now officially add this new record to its ever-growing list of accolades, as finally overtook Ozark’s 11-week record thanks to the legal drama’s 12 consecutive weeks in the top slot. Making the feat even more impressive, Suits achieved its record in a single continuous streak, while Ozark had previously held its title spread across multiple season releases.\nWhile Suits’ original 2011 release was a success for USA Network, earning favorable reviews and strong viewership numbers, the show’s popularity gradually waned following the departure of key cast members such as Meghan Markle and Patrick J. Adams. Nonetheless, the show’s recent resurgence on streaming reveals the enduring appeal of its quick wit and largely formula-driven narratives. However, the timing of Suits' continued record-breaking streak on streaming television coincides perfectly with many important conversations currently taking place about streaming services and the equity of continuing residuals paid to actors and creatives.\nEarlier this year, Suits writer Ethan Drogin admitted that while he was elated to see the show’s resurgence on Netflix and Peacock, he had earned less than $300 in streaming residuals despite its overwhelming success. While the Writers Guild of America has recently come to an agreement with streaming services, which includes a dramatic new performance-based pay bonus structure for writers, members of SAG-AFTRA are still currently waiting to see the outcome of their own ongoing strike action.\nWhile Suits’ recent resurgence in popularity may have no direct connection to the wave of industrial action sweeping through Hollywood, its timing perfectly demonstrated many of the growing inequities that industry guilds were attempting to challenge. Perhaps once the recent public interest in Suits begins to die down, the show’s enduring legacy will come to mean much more than its growing collection of streaming records. Instead, its unlikely resurgence may have also potentially done much to help shine a light on important industry concerns and bring them out into the open.\nSource: THR\n"}
{"title": "2000's Dune Miniseries Director Hopes Denis Villeneuve's Movies Bring New Viewers To His Adaptation", "date": "2023-10-06 01:19:18", "text": "Dune miniseries director John Harrison praises Denis Villeneuve's Dune movies and hopes they will introduce new viewers to his previous adaptation.\nThe Dune miniseries director John Harrison hopes Denis Villeneuve's movies will bring new viewers to his adaptation. Frank Herbert's seminal 1965 sci-fi novel has been adapted to the screen several times starting with David Lynch's Dune from 1984, which was a critical and commercial failure and was disowned by the director due to studio interference. In 2000, a three-part miniseries officially titled Frank Herbert's Dune aired on the Sci-Fi Channel. Villeneuve's Dune, with the first film released in 2021, has become the definitive Dune adaptation due to its critical and commercial success.\nAhead of the Dune: Part Two release date in March 2024, the Dune miniseries director spoke to ComicBook and shared his praise for Villeneuve's movies. Harrison, who wrote and directed the Dune miniseries, says he is \"very excited\" about what Villeneuve is doing with the story and hopes it will introduce newcomers to his previous adaptation. Read what he shared below:\nI'm very excited about it. Richard Rubenstein and I were still involved in the development of several attempts to try and get it off the ground after my miniseries. And maybe fortunately, some of those never came to pass because I think what Denis Villeneuve has done is just fantastic. And I love him as a director. I wasn't involved at all in the latest movies except to have my name put up there. But I think it's just fantastic and I'm really looking forward to the new ones.\nAnd I hope it does introduce a whole new audience to the Dune world. If they are able to get back and see my miniseries, I'm very proud of them. We were able to ... I think the success of them, they won a couple of Emmys and they were hugely successful here and abroad. I think they gave people faith that Dune actually could be adapted again.\nThe Dune miniseries was generally well-received by critics and audiences. At the time, it was considered a vast improvement over Lynch's Dune which tried to cram the entire story, including all its intricate mythology and sprawling scope, into a single 2-hour 17-minute movie. However, it's worth mentioning that Lynch's preferred cut was three hours. Nevertheless, the Dune miniseries functioned better as an adaptation with a total runtime of 265 minutes. Today, the Dune miniseries still stands among the highest-rated programs ever broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel. As Harrison mentions, it also won two Emmys for Outstanding Cinematography and Visual Effects.\nRelated: Dune: What Sandworms Look Like In Every Adaptation\nBy breaking the book up into two parts, Villeneuve's movies adopted a similar approach as the miniseries, which is probably why Harrison appreciates them so much. Similarly, Villeneuve's Dune won several Oscars for its technical accomplishments, including cinematography, visual effects, production design, and sound. Villeneuve and Harrison's Dune adaptations actually have much in common, so it's possible the movies could bring new viewers to the miniseries, as the director hopes. However, one should temper their expectations considering the miniseries is now over 20 years old and was made on a fraction of the budget for $20 million.\nSource: ComicBook\n"}

A new series of sequel films was announced in August, the result of a months-long fan campaign to revive the Netflix show. Recently, it was revealed that another update surrounding the film series would be revealed.\nNow, Warrior Nun Saved has revealed a contest for an original redesign of the Halo ahead of the upcoming Warrior Nun continuation. The contest will run until 11:59 p.m. ET on October 31, 2023 for participants in the US and Canada, and will be overseen by the creator of the Warrior Nun Areala comic Ben Dunn. The winner of the contest will receive an original, signed illustration from Dunn.\nThe upcoming Warrior Nun film trilogy was announced following an international campaign to revive the TV series after it was cancelled by Netflix in December 2022. Because of this, it seems the new movies will be continuing the story from the end of season 2. This would mean the return of characters like Ava, Beatrice, and Lilith, whose stories ended on cliffhangers when the show was axed.\nThe end of Warrior Nun season 2 featured Ava falling into the Ark, going to Reya's dimension in order to heal from mortal wounds caused in the final battle against Adriel. This results in Beatrice quitting the OCS, just as Lilith warns of an oncoming holy war, setting up the future of the series. It appears this future will also feature a new design for the Halo, which could indicate new developments surrounding the object in the trilogy.\nWhile it's unclear why the Halo is being redesigned, answers likely won't arrive until more information about the movie trilogy is revealed. It's possible the new design will involve Ava's arrival in Reya's dimension, revealing something new about the object and its origins.

{"title": "Who Is Ouroboros? Ke Huy Quan's Loki Season 2 Character Explained", "date": "2023-10-06 01:00:27", "text": "Academy Award winner Ke Huy Quan will be joining the cast of Loki season 2 as a new MCU character, with an interesting origin in Norse Mythology.\nPhase 5's Loki season 2 sees the addition of an exciting new character known as Ouroboros to the MCU. The second season of Tom Hiddleston's solo Disney+ series was announced on July 14, 2021, during Loki's season 1 finale, and is set to follow on from the events of the first season, which saw the eponymous God of Mischief exploring the Time Variance Authority (TVA), dealing with multiversal variants of himself, and coming face-to-face with Jonathan Majors' He Who Remains, a variant of Kang the Conqueror. The post-credits scene of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania teased the storyline for the next season of the MCU show, especially by teasing one of the new characters in the Loki season 2 cast.\nLoki's season 1 finale ended with Sylvie, played brilliantly be Sophia Di Martino, killing He Who Remains, which created thousands of branching timelines, and trapping Loki in a very different version of the TVA, ruled over by Kang the Conqueror himself rather than the fictitious Time Keepers. While Loki season 2 is set to introduce Victor Timely, another Kang variant, to the franchise, the MCU will also be blessed with the debut of Ke Huy Quan, fresh off a win for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards for his role in Everything Everywhere All At Once.\nRelated: Loki Season 1 Ending & Future Set-Up Explained\nKe Huy Quan assumes the role of Ouroboros in Loki season 2, confirming the rumors before the show's release that this would be his character. Quan is a brilliant addition to the MCU, having been featured as Short Round in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom when he was only twelve, and appearing as inventor Richard \"Data\" Wang a year later in The Goonies. After taking a lengthy break from acting, Quan returned as Waymond Wang in Everything Everywhere All At Once opposite Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, and Jamie Lee Curtis.\nKe Huy Quan's Ouroboros is revealed to be the chief engineer of the TVA - and, in fact, their only engineer. As such, he's responsible for the upkeep and repair of all of the faction's tools, including their time travel devices, which gives him some complicated tech to take care of. Luckily, OB is both shown to be an outright genius, and committed to his work, as the first episode of Loki season 2 sees him spend 400 years toiling away without a single visitor - until Loki himself appears.\nThere are a few different representations of Ouroboros in the pages of Marvel Comics. The Oculus Oroboros is introduced as a conduit of elemental magic, that depicts a variation on the classic ouroboros shape of a snake eating its tail by featuring a second snake. Doctor Doom once attempted to harness the power of the Oculus Oroboros, though was stopped by Doctor Strange. There is also an Admiral Ouroboros, who appeared in 2015's Silver Surfer Vol. 7 #11, depicted as an antagonistic character who comes face-to-face with the Silver Surfer after the latter becomes trapped in a time loop, reminiscent of Groundhog Day or Palm Springs.\nIt's unclear whether these idea will translate into Loki season 2, though the TVA's time-twisting technology has already been shown to trap individuals in time loops, as Loki was berated by Lady Sif over and over again as punishment. Interestingly, the time loop that the Silver Surfer finds himself in is referred to as a Möbius strip - Owen Wilson's Loki character is named Mobius M. Mobius, and Tony Stark utilized an inverted Möbius strip to crack time travel in Avengers: Endgame. It's possible that this time loop theme could play a major role in Loki season 2, but the name Ouroboros could also suggest a deeper connection to Loki himself.\nThe shape of an ouroboros is depicted as a snake forming a circle, with the end of its tail in its mouth. This image has roots in Ancient Egyptian and Ancient Greek iconography, but also has a deep connection to Norse Mythology, on which most of Thor and Loki's MCU storylines are based. In Norse Mythology, the ouroboros is formed by Jörmungandr, otherwise known as the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent, an unfathomably large snake-like creature that resides in the world sea, and is large enough to encircle the entire Earth and bite its own tail. Legend notes that when Jörmungandr releases its tail, the catastrophic Ragnarök event will occur.\nWhat deepens the mystery, however, is the fact that the Midgard Serpent is actually one of Loki's own children in Norse Mythology, along with Hel, the Goddess of Death, and the wolf Fenrir, both of whom were adapted for Thor: Ragnarok, though Cate Blanchett's Hela was Loki's sister in the MCU. In Norse Mythology, Thor often has run-ins with Jörmungandr, engaging in epic battles with the serpent, even fighting to the death during Ragnarök. It's unclear how much of this will be adapted by Ke Huy Quan in Loki season 2, but it could even point to a deeper link between Quan's character and the God of Mischief himself.\n"}
{"title": "The Exorcist: Believer Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-06 00:51:10", "text": "The Exorcist: Believer builds to a final exorcism to deliver an ending with twists and sequel setup. Here's everything that happens and what it means.\nWarning: Contains SPOILERS for The Exorcist: Believer!\nThe Exorcist: Believer's ending revolves around a final exorcism to save Katherine and Angela's lives, and the event includes major revelations, death, and set up for a new trilogy of movies. Picking up almost 50 years after the original The Exorcist's story, the sequel shifts the franchise's focus to new families whose lives are changed when their daughters become possessed by demons. This brings Victor (Leslie Odom Jr.) to find Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) in the hope that she'll help the two families save the young girls. Ultimately, the fate of the girls is put in the hands of their parents and various spiritual leaders.\nIt is no surprise that The Exorcist: Believer builds to a final exorcism that puts the fates of Katherine (Olivia O'Neill) and Angela (Lidya Jewett) in the balance. This comes after Angela is confined to a mental institution while Katherine's parents attempt to help her at home. Chris is absent from the final exorcism after being stabbed in the eyes by Katherine, but she encourages Victor to recruit different people from all types of backgrounds and religious beliefs to help perform the final exorcism. The entire story wraps up rather neatly as there is no The Exorcist: Believer post-credits scene, but the final revelations still leave room for sequels.\nThe final exorcism in The Exorcist: Believer takes place at Victor's house. Katherine and Angela are both brought to the location after it is fitted for an exorcism. Victor is joined by Katherine's parents, the pastor at Katherine's church, Victor's nurse neighbor who previously wanted to be a nun, a local root doctor, and another one of Victor's neighbors who believes in God. The plan immediately goes awry when the Catholic priest tells them he cannot lead the exorcism as promised, but he passes leadership to the nurse, Ann (Ann Dowd).\nThe initial attempts to get the demon out of the girls are unsuccessful, as they mock Ann for her past, but the root doctor helps turn the night around. This leads to the demon revealing an impossible choice has to be made among the people in attendance; they must choose which girl lives and which one dies. The demon states that only one of them will survive, which connects to a deadly decision from Victor's past. While Victor and Katherine's mom Miranda (Jennifer Nettles) agree that they cannot and will not make that choice, Katherine's dad Tony (Norbert Leo Butz) panics and tells the demon he chooses Katherine to live.\nRelated: When Will The Exorcist: Believer Release On Streaming?\nIt initially appears as if Tony's decision is accepted by the demon, as Angela begins to float in the air before collapsing on the ground with no heartbeat and Katherine begins talking and looking like normal. However, this is where the demon's deceitful nature comes into play, as Angela begins to breathe again but Katherine dies. While attempts are made to save Katherine's life, she is taken away from the world of living. The death choice made by Tony in The Exorcist: Believer mirrors the one Victor made in his past, where who is chosen to live actually dies.\nOne of the big revelations in how The Exorcist: Believer ends goes back to the movie's opening sequence which results in the death of Victor's wife. An earthquake in Haiti leaves his pregnant wife with severe injuries, and Victor is told that he must make a difficult decision to choose between keeping his wife or unborn baby girl alive. His wife's wish was for him to protect the child at all costs, and the fact that Angela is alive after the 13-year time jump indicates that he followed through.\nIt is only during the exorcism that the demon reveals to everyone that Victor actually chose to save his wife instead of Angela, but the baby survived the operation instead. The revelation that Victor chose his wife over Angela recontextualizes much of their relationship. This is not something that Angela knew on her own, but it does explain why Victor is so protective and watchful over her now. The Exorcist: Believer's scary focus means there is no time for Victor and Angela to talk about the revelation after she gets better, but it would not be surprising if this puts a strain on their relationship going forward if she remembers.\nAngela surviving the exorcism leaves her with a clear fate as she returns to school, but where Katherine ends up in The Exorcist: Believer is more tragic. The movie indicates that she is pulled to Hell after her death. Katherine is shown in the woods again before she begins to be pulled underwater by many hands. This appears to be a visual representation of Katherine being taken to Hell by demons after she is tricked into being the sacrifice. It is unclear if The Exorcist: Believer is the last the franchise will show of Katherine or if her experience in Hell will factor into the sequel somehow.\nThe biggest surprise of the movie's ending is Linda Blair's return as Regan in The Exorcist: Believer. The movie makes multiple references to what happened to Regan after The Exorcist, but she is not an active part of the story. Her fate is instead left as a lingering mystery for most of the runtime. Thankfully, The Exorcist: Believer confirms Regan is alive and well by bringing Linda Blair back for a quick cameo. Regan is shown reuniting with Chris in the hospital during one of the final scenes. The appearance is an indication that viewers could see much more of Regan in The Exorcist: Deceiver.\nOne story point in The Exorcist: Believer that could create some confusion is the identity of the main demon that possesses Katherine and Angela. It is never named, but there are references made that the demon knows Chris and that she's encountered this spiritual being before. Despite the implication that The Exorcist: Believer's demon is Pazuzu, it has been confirmed that this is not the case. Director David Gordon Green revealed as much during interviews pre-release (via IGN), noting that the sequel has a new demon. However, he refuses to confirm the identity of the new demon, and The Exorcist: Believer does not confirm it either.\nThe fact that Angela's life is saved in The Exorcist: Believer might also have more to it than meets the eye. During the final moments, flashes of the blessing of protection Angela's mom gets while she is still pregnant are shown. This could mean that the blessing is actually what saved Angela's life, making the parallels to Victor's death choice before a coincidence. This would mean that the blessing is strong enough to prevent the demon from killing Angela but still allows her to be possessed. Ultimately, it is up to each viewer to decide which reading they want to believe.\nConsidering Universal announced The Exorcist: Believer as the start of a new trilogy, it is no surprise that the ending leaves the door open for its sequel. The follow-up is confirmed to be called The Exorcist: Deceiver, which indicates that there is more to what audiences witness here. The pastor specifically calls the demon a deceiver after the initial proposal of the death choice, so that could be a sign that Katherine and Angela's fates are not quite as sealed as believed. In any case, there is no doubt that the demon will return in some form, possibly pulling on the grief Katherine's parents struggle with.\nThe Exorcist: Deceiver's story is also sure to build on Chris and Regan's reunion too. The decision to bring Linda Blair back for a quick scene is certainly meant to get audiences excited to have her and Ellen Burstyn play bigger roles in the sequel. Both actresses had plenty of input on The Exorcist: Believer, and while their roles in the sequel are not yet officially confirmed, the intention is rather clear. The question then becomes if The Exorcist: Deceiver will fully shift the franchise's focus back to the MacNeil family or if Victor, Angela, and others will remain prominently featured.\nThe meaning of The Exorcist: Believer's ending is one of hope and belief. Despite it being a horror movie about the demonic possession of two young girls that features brutal deaths, The Exorcist: Believer leaves audiences with a message that believing in the good, and even God, is what everyone needs. It is seemingly only after Victor believes that the exorcism can work and reconnects with his daughter through his wife's scarf that his attitude and her fate begin to change. If there is any doubt about The Exorcist: Believer's true meaning of hope and belief, the final voice-over monologue provided by Ann Dowd makes it clear.\nSource: IGN\n"}

He started dating Victoria Adams in 1997 following her success as a singer in the popular Spice Girls group.\nBeckham aims to shine a light on David and Victoria's lesser-known qualities while revealing several new details on their careers and relationship history in the process. While everybody now recognizes the name Beckham, the documentary provides previously inaccessible coverage of the intricacies of what it's actually like to be David Beckham. The Netflix doc also chronicles David's humble beginnings and the internal battles that the superstar faced through the most intense and demanding parts of his celebrated career. David retired from soccer in 2013, fourteen years after marrying Victoria. Here are the ten biggest reveals from the four-partNetflix miniseries Beckham.\nRELATED: Untold Johnny Football – 10 Biggest Reveals About Manziel's Rise & Fall In Netflix's Documentary\nBeckham's first episode opens up with scenes of David Beckham tending to his bee farm fulling clothed in beekeeper's attire. He collects honey very naturally and hands some over to director Fisher Stevens, who is just as impressed as the viewing audience likely is. Outside of soccer, which Beckham has not played professionally in over ten years, beekeeping is just one of David's many hobbies that he enjoys regularly. Another favorite pastime of David's is to collect and assemble Legos. He unsurprisingly also loves to shop and invest in luxury items such as designer watches.\nBefore one of the most infamous games in David Beckham's career, Victoria revealed in Beckham that she told David that she was pregnant with their firstborn and eldest son Brooklyn. Victoria called David to tell him the news while he was in France awaiting a hotly contested matchup with the powerful Argentinian National team while she was in Brooklyn, New York, which inspired the name choice. Victoria reveals that while she and David were both incredibly happy about the news, she did not think much about how it would affect David going into one of the biggest games of his life.\nBefore David ever met Victoria in real life, he pointed her Spice Girls persona out on TV one day and announced that he was going to marry her. Beckham recalls being with former teammate Gary Neville and stating that he would marry \"the posh one\" in the future. Gary, of course, thought he was joking and started to laugh at David's earnestness. David soon proved to be incredibly serious about Victoria, who he knew nothing about at the time. By some magic, David turned out to be spot-on with his fortune-telling and he and Victoria have been together ever since.\nRELATED: 10 Biggest Reveals About Jason & Travis In Amazon's Kelce Documentary\nDavid and Victoria's marriage fell into very hot water when allegations surfaced about David's alleged infidelity with a former assistant of his by the name of Rebecca Loos. Loos came forward to the press that she and David had an affair that lasted four months when he first traveled to play in Spain for Real Madrid. David has always denied the allegations and Victoria has supported him, although both admit that it was the hardest part of their marriage by far. David recalls in the Beckham documentary that he is grateful that he and Victoria were able to come out of the difficult situation with their marriage intact.\nAfter the notorious incident in which David Beckham was ejected from the 1988 World Cup game against Argentina, he revealed that he was depressed after all of the public and media hate he received as a result. David recalls feeling hated by the entire country of England and not knowing how to handle all of the relentless public ridicule. Every time David would go anywhere in public, people would spit and cuss him out with fierce and intense hatred which left David feeling incredibly broken. David claims in Beckham that he was never quite the same after experiencing such public backlash on a national scale.\nDavid reveals in Beckham that he had a terrible spending habit when he first came into wealth. David is currently worth roughly $450 million so his early spending days did not do much to set him back financially. Beckham reveals that David's first paychecks that he revived on a Friday were typically gone by the following Saturday. He loved to spend his money on luxurious items, clothes, and even a brand-new BMW M3 from an Adidas endorsement deal. Considering Beckham's humble beginnings, it's hard to blame Beckham for indulging in the finer things.\nRELATED: Untold Hall Of Shame: The BALCO Drug Scandal & What Happened To Major Athletes After Investigation\nDavid's former soccer coach Sir Alex Ferguson expressed disapproval that David was starting to date Victoria Adams when he was still just a young player on Manchester United. Ferguson believed that dating a celebrity might steer David off the right path of becoming the world-class soccer player he could be. He instructed David not to take any photos together with Victoria in order to maintain their privacy. David obeyed and initially dated Victoria in secret, meeting in places like parks and avoiding the lurking eye of the paparazzi.\nDavid reveals that he charged his former Manchester United coach Alex Ferguson after the manager kicked a cleat at David, hitting him just above the eye. What was later revealed to be a freak accident and completely unintentional, an angry Ferguson kicked the soccer cleat at David which resulted in him apparently getting stitches. The following season, David was traded to Real Madrid, which was when his life began to spiral out of his control. He reveals in Beckham he never got to properly say goodbye to Ferguson.\nOne of the most unsettling revelations in Beckham is the horrific truth that David and Victoria received random threats that their newborn son Brooklyn would be kidnapped. These threats arose due to the lingering public hatred towards David after he was sent off in the 1998 World Cup. David recalls being afraid to leave the hospital in Beckham, sleeping up against the hospital room door where Victoria was staying. The couple recalls how they were somewhat robbed of the joy of their first newborn because of the intense paranoia circling around Daviid and the angry public.\nA lighthearted moment in Beckham arrives when Victoria recalls the instance in which David nearly missed the birth of his third son Cruz because he was tied up at a photo shoot with Jennifer Lopez. While the couple can laugh about it now in the Netflix documentary Beckham, David had cut it a little too close for Victoria to feel comfortable that he would be at the hospital with her when Cruz was born. In David's defense, he asked his wife what Posh would do, which ended up being one of the funniest moments in the four-part miniseries.\n"}

{"title": "John Wick's Perfect Replacement Hero Debuted 2 Years Ago In This Action Movie Hidden Gem", "date": "2023-10-06 00:00:26", "text": "The future of the John Wick franchise feels increasingly unclear, but the perfect action movie replacement already hit theaters two years ago. \nJohn Wick is one of the most iconic action franchises out there, but even if John Wick: Part 5 happens, the future of the Lionsgate movies is uncertain — and there's one existing action hero who could replace Keanu Reeves' if it comes to it. Reeves made his debut as the assassin John Wick in 2014, winning the hearts of critics and general audiences alike. The success of the first John Wick movie spawned multiple sequels, as well as the less-loved TV series The Continental. John Wick: Part 4 could have served as a definitive ending for the film series, but it seems like Lionsgate isn't ready to let go yet.\nDespite John Wick 4's ending, John Wick 5 is starting to seem increasingly more likely. Additionally, the John Wick universe is expanding with spinoffs like The Continental. It's very possible the series will continue, even if it changes drastically. However, given recent developments, it's just as likely to conclude sometime in the near future. Either way, the perfect replacement for the John Wick franchise already exists; the hidden gem actually released in movie theaters two years ago.\nJohn Wick may have a hold on the action genre, but one 2021 movie has the potential to become its replacement: Nobody. Starring Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul alum Bob Odenkirk, Nobody debuted to stellar reviews, receiving an 84% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes and a whopping 94% from audiences. Nobody also fared well at the box office considering the circumstances — it released as the industry was still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic — and it's easy to see why audiences enjoyed Odenkirk's first outing as an action hero.\nNobody follows Odenkirk's Hutch Mansell, a former assassin whose deadly skills are reawakened when his home in the suburbs is broken into. The incident leads to a number of revelations, with Hutch's family eventually finding themselves in the midst of all the danger. Odenkirk gives a compelling performance as the movie's lead, and he could easily hold his own if Nobody were to become a full-fledged action franchise. Although the first movie didn't add anything particularly groundbreaking to the genre, it served as a promising and action-packed beginning to a story that could take over when the John Wick craze fades.\nAlthough John Wick doesn't need a replacement just yet, the franchise's future is feeling less certain. There are a few reasons for that, but the most obvious goes back to John Wick 4's ending. The most recent installment of the series concluded with Reeves' titular hero supposedly perishing during a face-off with Donnie Yen's Caine. It's possible the Baba Yaga faked his own death. However, if Reeves' character truly is gone, it'll be difficult for John Wick: Part 5 to keep the franchise going. The lead character — and the actor who plays him — is the main draw, so it's hard to see the series faring nearly as well without him.\nAnd while John Wick's franchise future could lean into spinoffs, prequels, and sequels, that approach may not be as promising as it once seemed. After all, The Continental attempted to explore the world of John Wick from a different perspective, but the 2023 series didn't capture the heart of the films. The Continental reviews are so much worse than the John Wick movies, suggesting that a future without the title character isn't so bright. With that in mind, the world may soon be in need of a new action hero.\nIf Nobody hopes to compete with — or even replace — John Wick, it will need to return with an equally compelling sequel. Fortunately, Nobody 2 is already in the works. Nobody 2 producer Kelly McCormick told Collider that, if everything goes as planned, production on the sequel should begin sometime in 2024. Writer David Leitch has been working on the script, and Odenkirk seems confident and eager to return.\nThe ending and post-credits scene of Nobody certainly leaves the door open for another go-round. Hutch hasn't addressed his inner conflict fully by the time Nobody comes to a close, and the character will need more screen time to make the decision the story is building to: should he forego his life as an assassin for his family or try to embrace both personas? This is an internal struggle that sets Nobody apart from John Wick, and it could become the action genre's next big focus.\nSource: Rotten Tomatoes, Collider\nAmanda Mullen is an entertainment writer with a passion for all things books, films, and television.

{"title": "New Stephen King Horror Movie Continues 36-Year Failure, Confirming Harsh Reality For Spinoffs", "date": "2023-10-06 00:00:26", "text": "Not even Stephen King's new horror movie can break free from a decades-long failure. Here's why not even the King of Horror can save it. \nStephen King's new horror movie Pet Sematary: Bloodline is continuing a decades-long failure that not even the King of Horror can avoid, and its performance at the box office is confirming a harsh reality for spinoffs of his original works. There have been plenty of Stephen King movie and TV remakes that have been done well, but when it comes to derivative projects, they don't seem to succeed as well. Not even following the intriguing character of Jud Crandall, and finding out the origins of the mystical burial ground introduced in the first Pet Sematary can make the film shine.\nEven working with a foundation rooted in King's works, sequels to his stories don't seem to draw nearly the sort of audience that material from his own imagination does. Beginning with A Return To Salem's Lot in 1987 and continuing with Pet Sematary 2 in 1992, movies that continue the world created in classic King novels never seem to find their footing with even his most ardent fans. In the shadow of their predecessors, a lot of pressure rides on their successfully recreating what made the originals so good, and based on everything we know about Pet Sematary: Bloodline, it's trying to tell its own story.\nDespite having an intriguing premise and promising to answer a plot hole that's plagued fans of Pet Sematary for 40 years, even Pet Sematary: Bloodline continues a negative trend of movies that are derivative of King's original books and stories. It follows Jud and his first encounter with the burial ground, something he explains many decades later to Louis Creed as he mourns the death of his family's cat and wonders how to return the smile to his young daughter's face. Jud encourages using the burial ground's power despite it being a \"curdled place\" because he wants to teach the girl that \"sometimes dead is better.\"\n Besides the odd choice to violate the natural order of things in order to enforce morals on someone else's child, fans have always wondered why Jud told Louis about the burial ground if he knew the consequences of burying anything there, and the film doesn't really answer that question, though it has many of the same thrills and chills of the original film. Lindsey Anderson Beer’s film only makes Jud's actions later seem more erratic than ever, and the low success of Pet Sematary: Bloodlines indicates that spinoffs and prequels only work when King himself is behind the story.\nDisregarding It: Chapter Two, which is simply the second part of one (albeit giant) Stephen King book, Doctor Sleep seems to be the only Stephen King movie sequel that has worked. Starring Ewan McGregor as an adult Danny Torrance, it centers on him healing from his traumatic experiences at the Overlook Hotel, exploring the supernatural power known as \"the shining\" introduced in King's novel by the same name, and Danny's relationship with a young teen who shines the same way that he does, and whose light has attracted more malevolent entities.\nOne of the main reasons why the movie works so well, aside from McGregor's magnetic performance and its truly immersive horror experience, is the fact that King had written the sequel it was based on. This helped create a solid foundation for its story, and it's no wonder why the movie clocks in at nearly three hours - the screenplay left none of King's world-building out the way Stanley Kubrick's The Shining did. Pet Sematary: Bloodline largely tries to do its own thing and flounders the most when it tries to sync up with King's book, ultimately failing because it doesn't answer any of the questions a prequel origin story should.\n"}
{"title": "DC Admits Jason Momoa Would Nail a Major Upcoming MCU Role", "date": "2023-10-06 00:00:26", "text": "DC pokes playful fun at the casting rumors surrounding Jason Momoa — including the possibility that he could play one major upcoming MCU role.\nWarning! Contains spoilers for DC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1!\nWith DC currently gearing up for a new cinematic universe, plenty of casting rumors are spinning — including the fate of the DCEU's Aquaman, Jason Momoa, who is often fancast as DC's Main Man, Lobo. In a new short story for Halloween, Lobo's daughter Crush points out his perfect MCU counterpart as well: Wolverine.\nThis surprising comparison takes place in the story \"Happy Hal(Lobo)ween!\" by Hans Rodionoff, Adam F. Goldberg, Danny Earls, Patricio Delpeche, and Dave Sharpe from DC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1. Lobo crashes his daughter's apartment to force her to help him come up with the perfect Halloween costume. This involves Crush trying to point Lobo towards Hugh Jackman's famous portrayal of Wolverine, but, due to legal issues, she can't outright say this.\nThis leads Lobo to dress up as a litany of Hugh Jackman characters, but never the iconic X-Men character. Finally, exhausted by her father, Crush suggests she dress up as the other superhero that Lobo bears a striking resemblance to: Aquaman.\nRelated: DC's Answer to Wolverine Gets Even More Savage With New Zombie Form\nLobo is one of the more extreme characters from the '80s and '90s, and a lot of fans believe that Lobo was DC's answer to Marvel's Wolverine. Lobo is an absolutely absurd satire of both over-the-top masculinity and action heroes in general. He's a wise-cracking bounty hunter who perpetually has a lit cigar in his mouth, and he travels around space on a skull-adorned motorcycle. It's obvious why Lobo is such a beloved character considering how ridiculous he is. Despite how beloved and popular Lobo is with fans, he's never been adapted into any live-action movies, and the idea of who would play him is a heated debate. It seems DC has not only confirmed who could play Lobo on the big screen — but also who could possibly play the MCU's Wolverine.\nOne of the most popular fan casts for Lobo is none other than Jason Momoa, who also plays Aquaman in the ill-fated DCEU. This fan cast is so popular that the actor has even responded to it, and it seems DC is completely aware of the demand. In this year's Halloween story, after Crush gets exhausted trying to get Lobo to dress up as Wolverine, she instead points him to dress up as Aquaman, which is a cute reference to both the actor's and fans' desire to see Momoa play Lobo. While Lobo doesn't believe he has any resemblance to Aquaman at all, he's only thinking of the Arthur Curry of the DC Universe. The version of Aquaman played by Momoa looks a lot closer to the Main Man.\nDC is well aware that fans want Momoa to play Lobo, and the actor himself is even up to the task. But, in admitting that Lobo shares a striking resemblance to both Aquaman and Wolverine, the publisher has revealed that, if Momoa can't ever play Lobo, then maybe he will find himself on the big screen playing the iconic Wolverine for the ever-expanding MCU instead.\nDC's Ghouls Just Wanna Have Fun #1 is on sale now from DC Comics!\n"}
{"title": "14 Best Scary Movies To Stream", "date": "2023-10-05 23:57:17", "text": "With Halloween right around the corner, it's time to find the best scary movies to watch at home on streaming to get into the spooky mood.\nHorror movies have been becoming increasingly popular in recent years with some incredible remakes, sequels, and several new original stories that have made big waves. For years, horror movies were primarily enjoyed at the cinema with a group of friends as everyone gripped tightly onto their popcorn. Now, with the ease and availability of so many streaming platforms and their large libraries of content, more people are choosing to dim the lights in their own homes and snuggle up in a warm blanket to watch horror from the comfort of the couch.\nDedicated horror streaming platforms like Shudder are a good option for die-hard horror fans, but for more casual viewers getting into the spooky season, it's worth knowing what movies are available on other popular platforms. HBO Max, Peacock, and DirecTV appear to have the best selection of all-time great horror films for anyone interested in watching the classics like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, John Carpenter's The Thing, or Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street. And for even more of the best movies available right now on streaming, see the list below.\nThe Exorcist is widely regarded as one of the all-time greatest horror films ever made. Originally released in 1973 and then plagued by critical outrage from the Catholic Church seeking the film to be banned, The Exorcist drummed up a great deal of controversy while also being praised for its incredible screenplay and sound which helped to create a truly horrifying film. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and nominations in nine other categories. In The Exorcist, 12-year-old Regan becomes possessed by a demon and the film deals with the traumatic experience of trying desperately to exorcise her with the help of two priests. For keen horror fans, The Exorcist is a must-watch film available currently on HBO Max.\nPsycho has been adapted many times from the original novel by Robert Bloch, but perhaps none more famous or successful than the original 1960 film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. When a young woman's car breaks down on a quiet road, she is saved by the well-mannered young hotel owner, Norman Bates who provides her shelter and food in her dire need. The film becomes increasingly unsettling as the plot unfolds and it also contains one of the best twists in any horror to this day. Psycho is currently available to watch on Peacock.\nRelated: Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho: 10 Things That Still Hold Up Today\nStanley Kubrick's The Shining is adapted from the novel by famous horror writer Stephen King. Released in 1980, just three years after the book debuted and starred a young Jack Nicholson as a writer who takes his family along with him to care for a hotel in its off-season. Nicholson delivers an outstanding performance as a man slowly descending into madness and the story grows increasingly bizarre, tragic, and horrifying as events unfold. The Shining is now streaming on HBO Max and DirecTV.\nAlien, directed by Ridley Scott and starring a young Sigourney Weaver in the early days of her career, is another classic horror film that set the tone for what classic horror should be. Released in 1979, Alien expanded into a large franchise with many sequels and prequels, and still, more are being made now, the story of terrifying alien creatures that can infect and grow in the human body continues to be one of the most enduring and popular images in all of horror history. The first film in the franchise is currently available to watch on Hulu.\nHalloween was directed by the legendary John Carpenter who will appear on this list again. A deranged man in a mask sets out to commit violent murders around his hometown of Haddonfield and through this film and several sequels, the rampage only continues to get increasingly brutal and terrifying. The series also features Jamie Lee Curtis as possibly the most famous final girl of any horror franchise, Laurie Strode. Halloween is the classic slasher movie and perfect for getting into the Halloween spirit, available to watch with a subscription on Shudder, AMC+, or FuboTV, and free with ads on Crackle, Redbox, and Plex.\nChanging gears to a much more modern film for a moment, Get Out earned its place on this list of all-time great horrors thanks to incredible direction and vision from Jordan Peele and an outstanding performance by Daniel Kaluuya as a young black man who uncovers shocking secrets about his white girlfriend's family. The film plays on the uneasiness of this visit and the subtle challenges that may be experienced by an interracial couple with family who may not be accepting but takes this concept much further with unsettling twists and dark secrets. Get Out can be viewed on Peacock, FuboTV and FX Now with a subscription.\nRelated: Get Out's Inspirations Explained\n1982's The Thing is also directed by John Carpenter and tells the story of a group of researchers exploring Antarctica. During the course of their work, some thing begins to wreak havoc when their research is interrupted by disturbing occurrences. This creature has the ability to inhabit and imitate other beings and things get really weird, really fast. Starring Kurt Russell at the height of his career, The Thing is not to be missed and can be found on Peacock with a subscription.\nThis film from 1974 was originally marketed as being based on a true story in order to attract audiences, and it largely did that. However, the story is largely fictional with some details about the killer being inspired by the mass murderer Ed Gein. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has been remade and inspired sequels about the story which follows an isolated killer who wields a chainsaw and wears people's faces as a mask. This first installment steps up the intensity of classic slashers with a more high-powered weapon and a small group of victims to hunt down and can be seen over on Peacock with a subscription now.\nThe Silence of the Lambs starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins seeks to bring audiences deep into the mind of a twisted killer. Foster plays a young FBI agent who calls upon Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter for help on a case. The issue is, that Hannibal is himself a cannibalistic murderer. Despite his murderous tendencies, Hannibal is also brilliant, as a trained psychiatrist and capable of attuning his mind to that of other killers. Creepy and unsettling throughout, The Silence of the Lambs can be seen on HBO Max and DirecTV with a subscription now.\nEd and Lorraine Warren are experienced demonologists who assist others struggling with supernatural occurrences. During 2012's The Conjuring, they come face to face with exceedingly powerful demons and possessions that create an incredibly unsettling and disturbing film. Starring Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, The Conjuring is a dark and twisted tale that will make anyone look twice at unassuming dolls just in case something more sinister could be lurking within. Available to stream on both HBO Max and DirecTV with a subscription.\nRelated: The Conjuring Universe Complete Timeline\nThe haunting series of films that started with 2004's Saw follows the twisted games of a madman hiding behind a puppet played out by unsuspected and unwilling contestants. Jigsaw carefully selects his victims by watching people he deems to be unworthy, or perhaps not living up to their potential, and then he traps them in a fatal game, usually against other players in order to win their life and learn how to live a better, more grateful and attuned life. Some of the most gruesome and anxiety-inducing deaths in horror are played out in this series, but they are exceptionally well thought out and there's a twisted sense of morals to sink into with this series. Available to watch with a subscription on Peacock, Prime Video, Starz and FuboTV, or with ads on Tubi.\nWes Craven's literal nightmare fuel, A Nightmare on Elm Street was released in 1984. Following the terrifying Freddy Krueger who literally walks through children's dreams and kills them in their sleep, this movie is full of jump scares, and horrifying moments of the disfigured Krueger chasing children through lengthy dream corridors. This was also the film that launched Robert Englund as a horror icon and inspired dozens of parodies in pop culture. A Nightmare on Elm Street was also the first project that Johnny Depp performed in and can be seen on HBO Max with a subscription.\nScream is one of the most legendary franchises in horror with incredible stars like Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Matthew Lillard and even a brief appearance by Drew Barrymore. The series follows a series of murders in Woodsboro and eventually further afield. Scream does an incredible job of interacting with Horror as a medium with Scream first releasing in 1996 and playing with popular tropes from slashers that came before. Every installment seeks to subvert expectations and lead the viewers on a mystery manhunt to uncover the killer or killers under the Ghostface mask. Scream can be streamed on HBO Max for anyone with a paid subscription.\nX starring Mia Goth is a deeply harrowing film that follows a group of young people recording a porn film in rural Texas. The group has rented a property from an elderly couple who live on the land nearby and appear to become suspicious of what these holidaymakers are doing. The whole film creates an incredibly tense and challenging atmosphere as it deals with confronting and challenging imagery and once things start to go wrong, they go very, very wrong. The film also creatively uses Mia Goth to play both the role of the young starring actress and the older, more restricted woman to create interesting parallels and unsettling moments throughout. X can be seen on Showtime, FuboTV and DirecTV for those with a subscription.\n"}
{"title": "Django Unchained Ending Explained", "date": "2023-10-05 23:51:23", "text": "Django Unchained has an ending that begs to be explained. Here is a deep dive into Tarantino's complex tale of love, freedom,  and redemption. \nThe complex Django Unchained ending begs for further explanation, as the story is much deeper than what it initially appears to be. Considered by many to be one of the greatest films in the Tarantino vault, Django Unchained starts as a gunslinging Western and quickly transforms into a tragic story of undying love. It's also a story of how that undying love can drive a man to darker depths than he thought possible.\nAfter their plan to fool the evil slaver Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) goes awry, Django has to shoot his way past his oppressors to set his wife free. The end of the film finds Django and Hildi riding off into the dark of night after a triumphant win from Django. Although this may seem like a happy ending, given the times and the nature of the events that just occurred, Django and Hildi may have trouble coming their way.\nThe ride off into the darkness is an ominous symbol of the dark road ahead for the couple. Not only would they have to somehow make their way out of the Deep South during a time when slavery had not yet been abolished, but Hildi and Django would also be surrounded by enemies actively hunting them for the crimes they just committed. From neighboring plantations to slave catchers and sheriffs, they'd have to keep the lowest of profiles to somehow sneak out of Mississippi unscathed and make their way up to the North to safety. Although Django could use his power of deceit to make a few allies, it's hard to imagine the couple living out their life in freedom without any consequences.\nIn the film, Candyland is a plantation in Mississippi known throughout the South for its cruelty and torture of Black people. Just the very mention of its name was enough to make Django uneasy. At the end of the third act, after Django is done shooting down every slave owner in Candyland, he takes it a step further by blowing it up with a stick of dynamite. This explosion doesn't just deliver a satisfying moment of redemption for Django's character, it's also symbolic of the concept of freedom.\nCandyland represents not just slave ownership, but oppression as a whole. Throughout the grounds, there are slaves in every room performing all sorts of unspeakable acts and being treated in the cruelest, most inhumane ways. Its destruction symbolizes the dismantling of oppressors and the idea of putting an end to enslavement once and for all, as evidenced by the film being set right before the Civil War.\nBy destroying Candyland, Django doesn't just set Hildi free, but he also frees other slaves, including Cora, Sheba, and the men who are being transported to the mines. All of their futures are tied in Candyland, and by burning it down and killing all the masters, Django sets them all free. The destruction of Candyland sends a message to onlookers and oppressors: a new future is coming, a future where the enslavement and inhumane treatment of Black people is not only unjust but will be met with consequences.\nCalvin Candie and Dr. Schultz are the polar opposites of one another. Dr. Schultz was the only White character who treated enslaved people with respect, addressing them by name and treating them like equals. He's even able to set a few free, like Django. Calvin Candie, on the other hand, is infamous for being mean, cruel, and ignorant. Not only does he prefer methods of torture, but he doesn't even see slaves as human beings. Candie genuinely views slaves as property, even watching a man get beaten to death in front of him without blinking an eye, unlike Schultz, who is visibly uncomfortable and shaken.\nIt's clear that Schultz and Candie don't like each other. They make each other uncomfortable and can not exist in the same space. One of them has to go, and when Candie calls Schultz back to shake his hand, he clearly makes the choice that it will be Schultz. At that moment, the tension between Dr. Schultz and Calvin Candie throughout Django Unchained comes to a head, and the climax is an all-out bloodbath. Although Candie insists that the handshake is just a traditional business move, the timing and context behind the request scream set up, which is why Dr. Schultz draws first blood. In the small act of a handshake, there is a greater symbolism of a shifting power dynamic, not just between the two men, but between the cruelty of oppressors and those who will rise up to defeat them in the end.\nThe moment when Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) realizes Django and Hildi know each other is the exact point in the film where things go downhill. Although this may seem like a sharp left, a reexamining of the scene gives away why it is so easy for Stephen to put two and two together. Stephen is one of Candie's most loyal servants, a traditional \"house Negro\" who enjoys privileges the other slaves don't get due to his loyalty. He is suspicious of Django and Dr. Schultz from the start, fearing they'll upset the balance of Candyland where he enjoys a relatively easy life, unlike his fellow slaves.\nKnowing the delicate nature of the situation, it is imperative that the crew be as careful as possible, for any misstep could cost them their life. But the attraction between Hildi and Django is too great, and after a tearful reunion, the two can't help but exchange a few longing glances at one another. The glances, however subtle, are evidence enough of Django and Hildi being familiar with one another, and that's the very moment that set everything in motion. If Hildi could've been assigned another task in the house, she could've avoided her public shaming and bloodbath that occurred at the plantation.\nWhen Django first tells Dr. Schultz his idea of rescuing his wife, Dr. Schultz practically takes it as a joke. The idea seems so unrealistic that he initially encourages Django to move on with his life. Then, against his better judgment, Dr. Schultz ends up accompanying Django on his impossible rescue mission. Although he claims it is because he felt responsible for Django after setting him free, a few moments in the second act show it's deeper than that.\nDr. Schultz has faith in Django's mission and truly believes that he can do it. To him, it is a matter of fate, a story written in the fairytales of German lore. Schultz knows that the bond that Hildi and Django share is too powerful and that Django will stop at nothing to achieve it; naturally, he wants to be the one to help his partner along. Schultz's compassionate heart helps him devise a clever scheme that gets him as far as the plantation–once he gets there, however, he starts to have regrets.\nWhen the reality of the situation sets in, Schultz begins to reflect on all the people who were tortured and killed to achieve Django's dream, and grows uncomfortable with the whole idea. When their cover is blown, Schultz is almost relieved that he's finally able to come clean with how much he regrets meeting Calvin Candie. It's lucky for Django that Schultz is an idealist at heart; maybe if given the chance to redo his decision, Schultz would've gone about things differently.\nTarantino is a director known for his clever use of color. Whether it's a filter or a costume, his bold use of color makes a statement about character roles and tone. Django Unchained is no exception to this rule and uses color and costumes to give the audience clues about the film's order of power.\nThroughout the movie, monochromatic costumes are often used as a symbol of importance. The powerful men in the South, like the U.S. Marshall, can be seen wearing all white or all black. The underlings tend to wear a combination of both, establishing a hierarchy through the use of color. Schultz, a man who treats everyone equally, usually wears neutral colors like gray. When characters are making a statement of status, they wear bold, bright colors, like Candie's luxurious burgundy suit and Django's royal blue ensemble.\nSince its 2012 release, there have been talks of a Django Unchained sequel, with Tarantino's plan to allegedly team Django up with the legendary sword-wielding hero Zorro. Instead, Tarantino opted to continue the story in a comic book series. However, if a sequel were to materialize on the silver screen, there are a couple of plot points it could run with.\nRight before his explosive death, Stephen yells that Django will be the one on wanted posters and that he'll be hunted down for what he did to Candyland. Django Unchained 2 could see Django go from the hunter to the hunted. As the new \"fastest gun in the south\", he could fight off those who come after him for the crimes he committed in Django Unchained. By then, he and Hildi could have started a family with gunslinging talents of their own. It would be extremely satisfying and fitting to see Hildi wield a pistol and help her beau shoot down bounty hunters.\nIG: @kysheeta_c\n\nKaillaby is a writer from NYC with a passion for anime, movies, and all things pop culture.

{"title": "Reptile Ending Explained: Who The Killer Is", "date": "2023-10-05 23:48:51", "text": "Reptile is a thrilling mystery starring Benicio del Toro as a veteran detective trying to catch a killer. But who actually killed Summer?\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for Reptile.\nGrant Singer's thriller Reptile weaves a web of deception as Benicio Del Toro's Detective Nichols tracks down the killer of a young real estate agent named Summer (Matilda Lutz), and in the process uncovers department-wide corruption within the ranks of the Scarborough police force. After going through several suspects, including Summer's lover and fellow real estate agent Will Grady (Justin Timberlake), ex-husband Sam (Karl Glusman), and disgruntled neighbor Eli Phillips (Michael Pitt), he finally discovers the identity of the killer among the characters in Reptile along with their motivation for Summer's demise. Unfortunately, his revelations put him in the crosshairs of powerful players in a convoluted game of cat-and-mouse.\nWhen he brings evidence against the killer and corrupt members of his department to the chief of police, the pair pay a visit to Captain Allen (Eric Bogosian) whose been concealing the identity of the murderer the entire time. Unbeknownst to Nichols, the deception goes all the way to his superiors, and Nichols is forced to get into a shootout with his former colleagues before he can expose the entire conspiracy. Full of red herrings, plot twists, the film delivers on the hallmarks of a gripping procedural but nevertheless leaves a few lingering questions as Nichols uncovers who Reptile's \"reptile\" really is.\nIn a rather confusing flashback, it's revealed that Will Grady killed Summer. When Detective Nichols is chasing down yet another lead and trying to figure out who Rudy Rackozy called so many times on the day that Summer was killed. It isn't stated out loud but it's implied that Rudy called Will, who is seen in yet another flashback standing over Summer's barely-breathing body. Will intended to pin the crime on Summer's ex-husband, but unfortunately for him, Detective Nichols was too good at his job and traced the burner phone to Will.\nUnfortunately, this isn't the most innovative part of the plot, as the killer is often the boyfriend in thrillers like Reptile. While it's enjoyable to see Justin Timberlake play against type, his part in the film makes it feel formulaic. Fortunately, Will isn't given a villainous monologue, but at the same time, getting more scenes involving him being a little more sinister, rather than so much time wasted on Eli and other red herring suspects would have made the reveal feel more deserved.\nDetective Nichols initially thought it was suspicious that Summer sold houses for a real estate agency yet often didn't receive any commission for the sales. These sales were part of a drug laundering scheme concocted by Wally and the majority of the police in Detective Nichols' department, and Summer had started calling the FBI in preparation to tell them the truth about White Fish being a shell company. Will finds out about what she was planning to do and kills her before she can reveal how far up the corruption goes.\nThe corruption linking the police department and the shell real estate company is somewhat convoluted, but Detective Nichols starts to piece it together once he notices that contraband has been suspiciously disappearing from the department evidence room. Wally plants drugs in certain houses and then they get seized, and White Fish buys them for a fraction of their cost and makes considerable profits. Summer was the broker for these transactions and didn't know anything about it at first, but eventually, the guilt became too overwhelming.\nRELATED: Reptile: Why Judy Puts Tom's Hand In WaxProcedurals like Reptile need to get tighter as they progress, but it's at this point that the narrative gets more convoluted. A lot of loose ends are left dangling, such as why Captain Allen agreed to keep the Chrysler Imperial, seen at the scene of Summer's murder, in his garage. The \"why\" in Reptile is not as important as the \"how,\" and understanding character motivations only gets in the way of appreciating what they end up producing as far as tension and tone.\nEli Phillips is a Nostradamus-looking suspect who appears early on with a motive to kill Summer; Will Grady swindled his family out of their property, which forced Eli's father to take his own life. Eli threatens Will and he returns the favor by showing up one night in his apartment, telling him to stop sniffing around his business. He's joined by another figure who Eli seems to recognize, but they're never revealed to the audience. This person is most likely the chief of police, whose role in the entire tawdry tableau is revealed later when Detective Nichols tries to bring evidence of the corrupt officers to his attention.\nAfter the confrontation between Eli, Will, and the mysterious third intruder, Eli is never seen again in Reptile. When Detective Nichols returns to question Eli again, he finds his entire home scrubbed clean and a bottle of bleach on the counter. While the audience never sees Eli's death, it's implied that he was killed, dismembered, and his body was disposed of at a different location with no evidence left to implicate either Will or his accomplice in the crime.\nEli's fate is left open-ended and ambiguous in keeping with the shifting nature of the case. Singer purposefully makes all the characters suspicious in the beginning, particularly Eli, and including Detective Nichols himself. Eli represents one of the most obviously nefarious characters, but he's not only harmless - he cracked the case, and his death is meant to remain unknown so that fans can make up their own minds as the case progresses, constantly guessing just like Nichols, working to solve it along with him.\nReptile's intense finale is punctuated by an innocuous moment involving a frisbee hitting the large picture window where Nichols and Wally's incredibly intense confrontation is in full view. Nichols looks over to see children's noses pressed up against the glass, taking in the horrifying tableau of Wally on the ground, his own blood pooling around him, and Nichols holding his firearm. Singer has explained Reptile's frisbee scene in terms of his own position as a novice filmmaker; \"The idea is that I'm the kids playing. This is my first movie, I'm just enjoying myself, I'm just playing and this is my thing.\"\nLooked at within the context of the narrative, the frisbee is an ironic act of God that pulls Nichols, Wally, and the audience out of the moment and redirects their focus, and the horrors of what they're participating in are juxtaposed with the everyday act of children playing outside, creating a surreal space for introspection and reflection. The corruption of Wally's world, having already infiltrated friends and family, cannot be divorced from the children's incorruptible innocence operating as a deux ex machina, highlighting that everything has consequences.\nBenicio Del Toro gives an incredibly nuanced and intense performance in Reptile, using body language and long stares to communicate trauma and a wounded psyche. He's been accused of being on the take at his old department, which makes him a perfect candidate for Captain Allen's, or so Allen thinks, but Detective Nichols wants to actually have a fresh start and peace that will never come. He's asked at one point if he needs to be redeemed, a notion he becomes defensive about, but it's clear that he needs to solve Summer's murder for more reasons than simply being a thorough investigator.\nBefore her death, Summer finds a dried snakeskin, indicating all is not what it seems inside her house. The movie is called Reptile because as each character is introduced their nature changes, and after appearing to be one thing, they soon \"shed their skin\" and are revealed to be something else. Will Grady is a skittish wasp who becomes capable of stabbing his girlfriend, Wally is an avuncular poker buddy who turns out to be the kingpin in a drug scheme and tries to kill the \"rats\" bringing him down, and Detective Nichols is a perceivably corrupt cop shedding the skin of his old reputation to be an altruistic hero.\nCinematographer Mike Gioulakis crafts Reptile stylishly and makes salient use of reflective surfaces, particularly mirrors. Characters reveal key plot points, perform exposition, and question each other from within these glossy parameters, representing the way that things aren't always what they seem even when they're right in front of character's faces. It's an interesting technique that helps give Singer's thriller a distinct aesthetic and oeuvre.\n"}
{"title": "Future Pixar Movies Have A Major Problem, Despite Elemental's $490 Million Box Office Recovery", "date": "2023-10-05 23:40:25", "text": "Elemental managed an impressive comeback at the box office, but Pixar can't count on this happening again for its future theatrical projects. \nElemental made a spectacular comeback after its disappointing opening weekend, but Pixar still has a lot of work to do going forward. The Disney studio hasn't had a lot of luck with its films recently, and it was hoped that their element-themed romance would turn this all around. Unfortunately, Elemental's opening weekend made it look as if the film would be a box office bomb, which would be especially bad news for Pixar after other such failures. Thankfully, the studio's most recent movie made a surprising $400 million comeback. Still, Pixar can't count on this for all of its future projects.\nIn its opening weekend, Elemental only managed to bring in just under $40 million at the box office. Compared to studio successes like Toy Story 3, this is a significant flop. Still, things managed to trend upward for the film. Word of mouth really seemed to do Elemental some favors, and a surprising number of audiences turned up at theaters in the weeks that followed. Pixar's chief creative officer, Pete Docter, was thrilled (via Screen Rant) that audiences had wound up resonating with Ember and Wade as he thought they would, but it isn't lost on him that Elemental's disappointing weekend is still a problem.\nRELATED: Elemental 2 - Confirmation Chances, Release Date Prediction, Possible Sequel Story & Everything We Know\nElemental may have pulled itself together at the box office, but Pixar can't count on this happening for its upcoming new releases. This is something that Docter seems to recognize. He noted that even with Elemental's $400 million recovery, he plans to take \"another look at the projects we’re working on now\" to ensure that they meet the standard of their past successes. \"I really think I want to double down on what allowed us to speak to audiences to begin with,\" he said, still standing by his love for Elemental but noting that Pixar needs to return to its roots to avoid another close call.\nOverall, the fact that Elemental failed to bring audiences in on its opening weekend means that leading up to the film's release, people simply weren't interested. It took word-of-mouth for people to decide to hit the theaters. Though this says a lot about Pixar's marketing plan (something the studio also needs to take a closer look at), it could also come down to a loss of faith in the studio's films. After all, several of their recent movies have failed to meet audiences' expectations.\nThe pressure on Pixar might be different if Elemental was the studio's first project with a disappointing opening weekend. Lightyear (2022) only brought in $50 million when it hit theaters, but unlike Elemental, it never managed to turn these numbers around. The film has a worldwide gross of only $226 million—considerably lower than Elemental's—and is considered a critical failure as well as a box office bomb.\nOther Pixar failures were relatively well received by audiences once they started streaming on Disney+, but audiences didn't seem to think it was worth it to turn up at the theaters. Onward (2020), which holds an impressive 95-percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, only managed $141 million gross. Overall, these numbers reveal that Pixar is consistently missing the mark when it comes to predicting what stories will get audiences to buy tickets—something they used to get right consistently.\nPart of the reason for many of Pixar's failures is the decision on Disney's part to give the studio's films a simultaneous streaming release or to skip over the theatrical release altogether and jump straight to Disney+. This was the case for Turning Red, Soul, and Luca—all movies with decent critic reviews but a relatively poor return on investment. It's difficult to say why Disney deems this a good idea, but if Pixar wants to earn more theatrical releases, then it needs to take full advantage of the opportunities given.\nTo justify future theatrical releases, Pixar must prove it can make magic happen at the box office, and Elemental didn't manage this. Sure, the romance wasn't a complete failure, and its surprise recovery may allow Pixar to tread water for a time. However, if the studio's next movies continue the disappointing opening weekend trend, we will likely see a lot more Disney+ releases rather than theatrical ones. Hopefully, Docter meant it when he said that Elemental's performance has him taking a closer look at their upcoming projects because audiences are ready to see the old Pixar back in theaters.\n"}

Spoilers for X-Men #27 ahead!One of the most dangerous villains the X-Men have ever faced has plans to steal the Juggernaut’s powers and turn himself into the unstoppable Dr. Juggernaut. The events of Fall of X have put the X-Men on the back foot, with most mutants having either been killed or imprisoned. Now, one of the architects of the mutants’ catastrophic new status is prepared to make things even worse.\nX-Men #27 by Gerry Duggan, Phil Noto, VC’s Clayton Cowles, Tom Muller and Jay Bowen opens with Kate Pryde breaking into an Orchis prison and discovering Juggernaut. She provides the means for him to break out the following day, but at the end of the mission it’s revealed that his breakout attempt fails. Doctor Stasis, a version of Mister Sinister and one of the leaders of Orchis, says that Juggernaut is too dangerous to be left alive.\n“Rather than execute him, I’ve realized that magic gem of his is inside his body. I’m going to extract it surgically and then ingest it,” Stasis tells Firestar. “I hope the world is ready for Dr. Juggernaut. I’ve scheduled him for an autopsy in the morning.”\nMister Sinister and Doctor Stasis are two of the four clones that 19th century scientist Nathaniel Essex made of himself. His purpose in creating these clones was to try different methods for humanity to fight back against artificial intelligence in the future. While Sinister is a version of Essex with an X-Gene, Stasis is an ordinary human, albeit one with an abnormally long life. Believing that mutants are a greater danger than artificial life, Stasis becomes one of the leaders of the anti-mutant organization Orchis and helps orchestrate the attack on the Hellfire Gala that kicks off Fall of X.\nBoth Juggernaut and Mister Sinister have been staples of the X-Men’s rogues’ gallery for decades as formidable physical and mental threats, respectively. Cain Marko is known more for his brawn than his brain, as the powers granted to him by the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak make it so that he is literally unstoppable. With the added intellectual might of Doctor Stasis, he would be able to wield his physical strengths in genius new ways. While Stasis is a relatively new character, he has the same intelligence as Sinister, who is known for his cunning and always thinking ten steps ahead of his opponents.\nSinister recently enacted a plan to incorporate his genes into the DNA of every mutant resurrected on Krakoa, resulting in the creation of the Sins of Sinister timeline. Here, everyone on Earth became a version of Mister Sinister, and he was able to exert his power to not only take over the world, but extend his reign into the far reaches of space. He was even able to come up with a brilliant way to use Juggernaut’s abilities by turning him into a bullet that was then used to assassinate both Thanos and Galactus.\nThe one hope that Juggernaut and the rest of the X-Men have is that Stasis tells his plans to Firestar, who is working as a spy within Orchis. Firestar will need to alert her fellow mutants in order to stop him. If she is unsuccessful, then Doctor Stasis will be able to supplement his own abilities with the mystically-infused powers of the Juggernaut, a deadly combination that the X-Men would have no hope of defeating.\nX-Men #27 is on sale now from Marvel Comics.\n"}

Set sixteen years after the first film, the sequel finds Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri's (Zoe Saldaña) Na'vi family under the threat of a recombinant Quaritch (Stephen Lang) as they seek refuge with the aquatic Metkayina clan. During the final battle, Jake and Neytiri's oldest son Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) is fatally shot by one of Quaritch's men and dies in front of his family.\nIn a recent episode of Cinema Therapy, licensed therapist Jonathan Decker watched Neteyam's death in Avatar: The Way of Water and broke it down in detail, including Jake and Neytiri's response to the tragedy. While Neytiri becomes \"feral with grief,\" as Decker says, the therapist notes how Jake's response is different, as he blames his younger son Lo'ak for Neteyam's death. Read a portion of his commentary or watch the full video below:\nThey're both grieving. It's a petty, mean, hurtful thing to say, and it's super relatable. He blames his son for his other son's death. Which is, again, if you're in the headspace to evaluate what's really going on, you're not going to say something like that. Cut Jake some slack here, but he's still doing what he does, which is he's compassionate with his wife and he's tough on his sons.\nHe was getting to a better place. I do think it's true. We learn and we evolve and we grow, and we often do things better, as long as things are fine. We backslide into our past behaviors. Eeven though it was, as an audience member, it was frustrating and hurtful to see Jake do this late in the film. It's true to the character and it's true to how people are. It's true to human psychology. But we do need that catharsis. For there to be an arc, it has to go to a healthy place.\nAs the oldest son of Jake and Neytiri, Neteyam was expected to safeguard and care for his younger siblings. However, it is his more impulsive younger brother, Lo'ak, who convinces him to save their symbolic sibling Spider, the biological son of Miles Quaritch. Therefore, Lo'ak feels responsible for Neteyam's death and Jake, whose headspace is also clouded by grief, blames his youngest son for his oldest son's death. Neteyam's tragic death, and the resulting family dynamics, do set up a strong foundation for future character arcs in Avatar 3 and future sequels.\nAs already seen during the Avatar: The Way of Water ending, Jake and Neytiri should continue seeking retribution against Quaritch for their son's death as they attempt to put an end to his destructive rampage once and for all. Neteyam's death should also have a profound influence on Lo'ak, potentially making him more cautious about protecting his siblings or sending him down a dark path of pain and regret. The heartbreaking tragedy could also have an effect on Jake and Neytiri's other children, Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) and Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss), who will pursue their own paths of revenge or healing.\nSource: Cinema Therapy\n"}
{"title": "Long-Awaited Stephen King Adaptation From Black Phone Director Gets Grim Update", "date": "2023-10-05 23:02:48", "text": "The Black Phone director Scott Derrickson shares a negative update on his long-gestating horror movie adapted from a Stephen King novella.\nThe Stephen King adaptation The Breathing Method has gotten a grim development update. The movie, which was previously with director Scott Derrickson attached, is an adaptation of the King novella of the same name, originally published as part of the 1982 collection Different Seasons. The story follows a woman in the 1930s who is desperately protective of her unborn child, who was conceived out of wedlock, so much so that her \"breathing method\" for helping birth the child keeps her lungs moving even after she is decapitated in a car accident.\nCinemaBlend recently had the chance to speak with Derrickson, whose most recent work in the horror genre is the segment \"Dreamkill\" from the new anthology movie V/H/S/85. During their conversation, he shared an update on The Breathing Method. Although he \"really loved that script,\" he is \"not involved with it anymore,\" so he was not able to offer a more substantive update. Read his full quote below:\nI don't know where the rights are on that. I don't even know if it's in development now. I had a script developed with Scott Teems, who worked on the Halloween films and I think one of the Insidious films. And he did a great job, and I really loved that script, and it was very imaginative, and a really strong adaptation. It didn't end up going anywhere. I'm not involved with it anymore, so I have no idea where it's at.\nThe Breathing Method was originally announced to be in development in 2012. At the time, it was already announced that Derrickson would be attached. The director was then fresh off his Blumhouse horror hit Sinister, which earned $87.7 million off its $3 million budget and was followed by a sequel in 2015. He had also previously directed the horror titles Hellraiser: Inferno and The Exorcism of Emily Rose.\nRelated: Every Scott Derrickson Horror Movie Ranked Worst To Best (Including Black Phone)\nBack in 2012, Teems' involvement as screenwriter was also announced. However, there was no word on the project for quite some time until 2019, when a new announcement was made, confirming Teems and Derrickson's continued involvement. However, after that the project went dormant once again until Derrickson's most recent comment.\nIn the years since The Breathing Method was announced, both creators have put out other works in the horror genre, with Derrickson even directing 2022's The Black Phone, an adaptation of a story by King's son Joe Hill. However, if Derrickson is no longer involved, it may be the case that Teems (who wrote Halloween Kills, Firestarter, and Insidious: The Red Door in the meantime) is also not attached. Even if the script is still in play, with no director the movie is likely very far from going into production, if the possibility is still even being considered.\nSource: CinemaBlend\n"}

Before Bones can finish spouting another lie, Stormwatch’s true commander, Amanda Waller herself, finally makes an appearance and reveals that she’s been running the team from the start.\nRelated: Marvel Finally Has Its Own Version of Justice League's Most Powerful Hero (According to Batman)\nWhile Stormwatch has been collecting weaponry with the express purpose of taking down the Justice League, they’ve been doing so under the impression that these weapons would be used only in self-defense should the more public-facing heroes of the DCU ever try taking them down. Unfortunately, as Ravager learns, that reasoning couldn’t be farther from the truth — but that lie plays exactly into Waller’s private mission throughout the current Dawn of DC era. After all, since the finale of Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Wall has been working with the Council of Light to weaken and the world’s greatest heroes, which is a mission that would benefit from an arsenal of anti-Justice League weaponry.\nThis is far from the first connection Waller has made with the grittier WildStorm corner of the DC Universe, as the Waller vs. WildStorm Black Label miniseries by Spencer Ackerman, Evan Narcisse, Jesús Merino, and Vicente Cifuentes makes clear. Waller has always been one of the publisher’s most morally flexible spymasters, so the notion that she would employ one of WildStorm’s most famous organizations, even one consisting largely of DC Comics Earth-0 characters, is totally in-line with her personal history. All in all, her moral flexibilty and willingnes to manipulate ever the darkest anti-heroes does not bode well for the future of the Justice League.\nWhen Amanda Waller sets her sight on a goal, she moves heaven and earth to make it a reality. Unfortunately, the Wall’s current goal seems to be the destruction of the DCU's greatest heroes. If the Justice League hopes to survive an onslaught at the hands of Amanda Waller and Stormwatch, they should start preparing for the worst.\nBatman: The Brave and the Bold #5 is available now from DC Comics.\n"}
{"title": "Occlumency Theory Explained: Why Harry Potter Failed (& Draco Succeeded)", "date": "2023-10-05 23:00:26", "text": "Harry Potter was never any good at Occlumency, and the reason for this may explain why Draco Malfoy found the skill so easy to perfect. \nThe Boy Who Lived never got the hang of Occlumency in Harry Potter, but this might not have had anything to do with a lack of talent. Severus Snape began teaching Harry this obscure branch of magic in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix since Dumbledore hoped it would ensure that Voldemort couldn't use his connection with Harry to gain information or possess him. Of course, these lessons went catastrophically. By the time Snape refused to continue teaching Harry, the boy hadn't come anywhere close to gaining control over his mind's security.\nThough Harry struggled with Occlumency, Draco Malfoy excelled at it. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, it was revealed that Draco had been taking Occlumency lessons from his aunt, Bellatrix Lestrange so that no one at Hogwarts would be able to determine what he was planning with the Death Eaters and Voldemort. He was ultimately very successful at this since even Snape was unable to dive into Draco's mind and figure out what he was planning. Harry was always as equally talented a wizard as Draco, if not a little more. So, why could the Slytherin boy master this skill but not the hero of Harry Potter?\nRELATED: Harry Potter And The Order of the Phoenix Ending Explained\nThe Harry Potter series demonstrated on several occasions that Harry had stronger-than-average willpower. In the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire book, Mad-Eye Moody (really Barty Crouch Jr) began teaching students about the Unforgivable Curses and tried to teach them how to protect themselves from such attacks. When he cast the Imperius Curse on his students, Harry alone could fight off the control. He did this with his will alone and fought off the Imperius Curse both this time and later when Lord Voldemort attempted to Imperius him as well.\nThis proves that Harry's lack of skill had nothing to do with his mental capacity, as Snape had suggested. Many have blamed Harry's failure at Occlumency on the professor, who never really took teaching him seriously and ultimately lost his temper and put an end to their lessons. However, the Wizarding World website suggests that Harry would have struggled with Occlumency even if he had a more patient teacher. This is because Harry was far too emotional—unable to hold back his anger at injustice and always ready to spring into action. This is part of what made him a great hero, but it takes a calmer, more cunning wizard to shut down his mind and master Occlumency.\nThis is precisely why Draco Malfoy was far more capable at Occlumency, and Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling has supported this. She stated that \"it was perfectly consistent with Draco’s character that he would find it easy to shut down emotion, to compartmentalize, and to deny essential parts of himself.\" She went on to state that Draco's upbringing, though lavish, was a fearful one. Lucius Malfoy expected the very best from his son, so weakness and excessive displays of emotion would not have been tolerated. To cope with this, Draco learned from a young age how to shut those feelings down and present a cold, strong, and proud exterior.\nIn addition, Draco was under immense pressure when he began learning Occlumency in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. He had just become a Death Eater and was eager to prove himself on the mission that, unbeknownst to him, he was always meant to fail. Therefore, when Bellatrix—who was surely a harsh teacher—began turning her nephew into an Occlumens, he would have put his all into succeeding since the alternative would have been death. On the other hand, Harry was relatively fearless when it came to Voldemort (even to a fault). Though Dumbledore told him it was necessary, Harry never feared Voldemort seeing into his mind.\nThe reason that Severus Snape was such a good double agent was because he was an expert Occlumens. Lord Voldemort was known to be an accomplished Legilimens and could confidently see into the minds of all his Death Eaters. To deceive him, Snape had to conceal his feelings for Lily and his determination to protect her son while also feeding the Dark Lord false information and memories. This took meticulous control that most wizards couldn't have managed—especially someone like Harry, who wore his feelings on his sleeves. Still, Snape wasn't always the epitome of self-control.\nIf Harry couldn't master Occlumency because of his emotional nature, then it's a surprise that Snape could. Though he always wore a calm mask in the Harry Potter movies, the books contained several instances of the Potions Master losing his cool. These weren't simple instances of a lost temper but full-on, destructive outbursts. One example is at the end of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, when Snape threw a fit because Sirius Black escaped, and no one would believe it was Harry's fault. If a man like this could master Occlumency, then Harry simply being emotional may not be a good enough reason.\nRELATED: Harry Potter - Every Clue That Snape Wasn't A Villain\nHarry's failure to learn Occlumency had major consequences in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Voldemort managed to plant false images in Harry's head of Sirius being tortured at the Department of Mysteries, and it was this that led Harry—and then the rest of the Order of the Phoenix—to the Ministry. Unfortunately, in an effort to save his godson, Sirius lost his life. Harry immediately regretted not taking Occlumency more seriously, but if it's true that it was his own emotional tendencies that kept him from being successful, he was better off not letting this go.\nYear after year, Harry became increasingly angry at the injustices of the wizarding world. When his teachers (especially Dolores Umbridge) treated the students unfairly, Harry would stand up and fight back. When the entire magical community believed he was lying about Voldemort's return, he all but yelled at the rooftops what he had seen. It was this quality that made Harry the perfect hero to stand against Lord Voldemort. Though Snape and Draco were skilled at blending in and hiding their true feelings, Harry Potter wore his own on his sleeves, and this made him impossible for the Dark Lord to control.\n"}
{"title": "10 Worst Movies On Netflix", "date": "2023-10-05 22:50:26", "text": "Netflix is known for its incredible library of content, but the streaming service’s worst offerings include some truly terrible movies.\nNetflix has made a name for itself in the realm of streaming thanks to its incredible selection of movies and TV shows, but there are some truly terrible movies available to watch on the platform. Netflix has been operating for more than 25 years and has gone through several changes to get to where it is today. Starting life as a simple movie delivery service, it grew to the point that businesses like Blockbuster disappeared. Now Netflix creates its own content to rival what other studios put out.\nNetflix's catalog and the quality of its films have improved drastically over the years, but that doesn't mean that its releases are all hits. Many of the worst Netflix original movies feel rushed, poorly executed, or like a half-baked concept that just had money and star power thrown at it. Alongside its independent content, Netflix also features some really terrible movies from other studios, many of which will leave viewers confused, irritated, or downright bored.\nIn an age where superhero movies are making massive waves, Netflix tried its hand at making one of its own. Thunder Force follows the adventure of two childhood best friends who get powers from a science experiment, then team up to fight super villains. The whole film feels incredibly empty and predictable, with jokes that mostly fail to land. Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer helm the cast of Thunder Force, but everything from the chemistry to the plot is exceptionally poor, especially compared to what is being produced by larger studios.\nMarlon Wayans plays Rob Anderson, a man trapped in a time loop on the morning of his wedding, in 2017's Naked. He's cursed to reset the day over and over, during which he wakes up naked in a lift after being the victim of a crime. Naked leaves behind everything that makes a time loop film good, removing any concrete moral of the story and replacing it with cheap jokes and a silly premise. This film fails on every single front to deliver something coherent, engaging, or entertaining. For an absolutely mindless comedy, Naked delivers a sub-par experience all around.\nThe Ridiculous 6 brings together an impressive cast for a modern Happy Madison production, but despite the team in front of and behind the camera — and the funding from Netflix — it falls flat. In the movie, Adam Sandler discovers he has five half-brothers, and they set off on a Western misadventure to find their father. Everything about this film is wacky, zany, and quirky, but it's not in a good way. Everything feels over-the-top silly, and it lives up to its title as a truly ridiculous film. Sadly, it's too ridiculous to be watchable.\n2017's Death Note takes an absolutely outstanding anime series with depth and meaningful themes of morality and justice and turns it into something ugly. Death Note is subpar both visually and in concept. The film whitewashed the cast, even going so far as to change the names and locations from the anime. Death Note also does away with the motivations and background of its main character, watering down Light's most important qualities. The film destroys any semblance of meaning, and its CGI is weird and ridiculous. The anime is leagues better, so the live-action Death Note is not worth the watch.\nRELATED: 10 Live-Action Anime Adaptations That Ruined Their Source Material\nIn The Last Thing He Wanted, Anne Hathaway and Ben Affleck come together to create a film that largely loses track of itself. The narrative follows a journalist who gets mixed up in the middle of a series of crimes she's attempting to break the news on. Despite featuring talented actors, The Last Thing He Wanted meanders and wastes time, creating more loose ends than the movie knows what to do with.\nThe Last Days of American Crime is set in the alternative near future, where crime is running rampant, and the U.S. government is making a last-ditch attempt to stop it in its tracks. The intention is to somehow halt all crime through a broadcast. However, in the more than two hours this film takes to open up and explain its story, it manages to do nothing but run around in circles. The Last Days of American Crime delivers a series of clichés and action scenes in the process, none of which help the story overall. The film is excessively long and void of any meaningful resolution or concrete storyline.\nRelated: 10 Best Crime Movies On Netflix\nAdam Sandler has had an extensive career starring in comedy films, but his partnership with Netflix has seen a decline in the quality of his projects overall. He stars side-by-side with David Spade in The Do-Over, which sees the duo planning to fake their deaths to get a fresh start on life. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned. The identities they take on are in worse trouble than they were. The biggest issue with The Do-Over is that the level of the humor is well-suited for an audience of preteens — but it's rated TV-MA, so adults are the intended audience.\nThe Bubble proves that putting together a cast of incredibly talented actors does not guarantee a film with any level of actual quality. Karen Gillan, Pedro Pascal, Guz Khan, Keegan-Michael Key, and Leslie Mann are part of the cast that make up this flop. When a group of actors is trapped in a bubble due to the COVID-19 outbreak, they decide to continue making the film. Ultimately, the film gets lost, going deeper and deeper into the concept of a film within a film. The Bubble misses the irony it desperately tries to analyze, suggesting legendary director Judd Apatow may have been asleep at the wheel for this one.\nTall Girl already received a great deal of backlash from audiences who were not happy with the premise of setting up a girl with above-average height as something extremely unnatural and worth exploiting for a film. Ultimately, at the conclusion of the first film, characters wind up happy and more mature. However, Tall Girl 2 walks back any of that growth to make its lead character into a popular character struggling to connect with her old friends. Lack of plot, unfortunately bad acting, and manufactured drama converge to create a cash grab sequel for a film that didn't perform that well in the first place.\nJared Leto hasn't had the best track record with movies, and The Outsider unfortunately continues that trend. The 2018 film follows a former prisoner who ends up in the yakuza and begins a rampage of violent crime for his new employers. The main issue with this film is how it has no real character development. The story goes nowhere, and everything feels incredibly pointless. The opening scene is exciting, but after that first 10 or 15 minutes, the development stops. After that, it's essentially just a gore fest, making it one of the least worthwhile movies to watch on Netflix.\n"}
{"title": "8 Biggest Takeaways From The Exorcist: Believer's Scathing Reviews", "date": "2023-10-05 22:41:25", "text": "Most critics agree that The Exorcist: Believer is yet another unnecessary and dispirited attempt to extend the 1973 horror classic into a franchise.\nConsidering the abysmal reviews for The Exorcist: Believer, the main takeaways of the mass criticisms center around one common theme: it isn't good. The Exorcist: Believer is hardly the first attempt at implementing an entertaining and reliable horror franchise out of the celebrated 1973 original film, often heralded as the 'scariest movie of all time'. Believer was created with the intention to compete with modern independent efforts in the horror genre such as M3GAN and Talk to Me but mainly fell flat because of its lack of originality and purpose. Even with successful franchise revitalizer David Gordon Green at the helm (Halloween), most critics have lost their faith in The Exorcist franchise.\nThe original 1973 Exorcist still holds up as a terrifying movie that has unsettled audiences for some 50 years. The direct sequel The Exorcist II: The Heretic was released in 1977 under the new direction of John Boorman but failed to capture the prominence of the first film. 1990's The Exorcist III is arguably the best installment of The Exorcist franchise but still couldn't hold a match to the classic. Hollywood already got the hint that TheExorcist sequels were doomed, resorting to two even worse prequel films in 2004 and 2005 that seemed to have buried the franchise for good. Unfortunately, The Exorcist: Believer continued the trend of the woefully uninspired horror sequels.\nRELATED: The New Movie That's Perfect For Fans Of The Exorcist (Not Exorcist: Believer)\nMost critics agreed that The Exorcist: Believer was simply an unnecessary venture because it doesn't push the envelope on the already progressive state of the modern horror genre. In a time where many great horror films are finding innovative ways to terrify the masses, particularly due to standout auteur directors like Jordan Peele, Ari Aster, and Robert Eggers, The Exorcist: Believer goes in the opposite direction. The film is full of familiar horror tropes and similar situations to those found in the original movie, resulting in what feels like largely a paint-by-numbers movie which would hold up better if it weren't cast in such a monumental shadow.\nDirector David Gordan Green surely knew what he was up against when taking on The Exorcist: Believer, considering the original film's reputation as a landmark of horror. With this in mind, the one major requirement for any sequel of The Exorcist should undoubtedly be its overall fear factor, an aspect that feels like it was overlooked with 2023's Believer. Similar to The Exorcist III, which notably did not feature a single exorcism on screen, Believer's story feels like it was forced to fit under The Exorcist umbrella more than it was inspired by its actual legacy. The Exorcist III was based on a novel titled \"Legion\" and rebranded as an Exorcist movie, which feels like the case in parts of Believer.\nEllen Burstyn was wise to not reprise her role as Chris MacNeil, mother of the infamous Regan character from the original, until five decades had passed. Her big return to the franchise was effectively underwhelming, as Green and Blumhouse didn't utilize her as much as they should have in their attempts at revival. The 90-year-old Burstyn only agreed to return to The Exorcist franchise if Blumhouse agreed to increase her salary and donate it entirely to the charity of her choice. Burstyn's casting was evidently transactional and passionless, used by Blumhouse for the sake of continuity credibility and hardly any other reason besides that.\nRELATED:The Exorcist: Believer Review - Odom Jr. & Burstyn Elevate Gripping, Tame Horror Revival\nOne of the most challenging considerations with The Exorcist franchise is how impactful the original film was and how difficult as a result it is to produce something greater than one of the best horrors ever made. Several other successful and decades-spanning horror franchises didn't start out with such a high standard to live up to, such as Friday the 13th, Saw, and Child's Play. At times, the original Exorcist appears somewhat like an art film with profound, intentional cinematography, religious symbolism, and sophisticated themes of psychiatry in the face of supernatural phenomena. For anything to actually compare to the original, it would essentially have to be a modern masterpiece.\nMuch like Green's modern Halloween trilogy, The Exorcist: Believer was designed to be the first of a 21st-century Exorcist trilogy, which still might be the case. It's too early to tell whether Green would still be involved in that if Blumhouse decided to stick to that original plan. However, he is a talented enough filmmaker to possibly turn the franchise around with a redemptive Exorcist sequel. The Exorcist brand name will still always turn heads and catch the eyes of fans of the original movie, so not all hope is lost for the franchise that, by most critic's assessments, should have never started.\nLinda Blair was handed a script by Green and was prompted to become a part of The Exorcist: Believer cast. Blair declined despite studio excitement and willingness for her to reprise her role as Regan alongside Burstyn's Chris, which might have produced a more appealing film. This fault can't really be attributed to the film itself, as they at least tried to get Blair on board but were unable to convince her. Blair was a consultant on the film, primarily with the intention of creating a safe space for the child actors on set. Believer could have done more to explain Regan's absence but elected to chalk it up to her becoming estranged from her mother over time.\nRELATED: How Scary The Exorcist: Believer Is\nAt the end of the day, most critics see The Exorcist: Believer exactly for what it is: a flat and predictable horror movie hiding under the guise of a cinematic landmark. This is made even more clear by the sheer lack of imagination in the movie, almost identically hitting every beat of the original without properly building the suspense or believability to at least give it a chance of holding up to the original. Believer ultimately plays it too by the book to the point where it nearly feels like Green wants the audience to see the direct links to the original film but in formulaic structure, not in craftsmanship or effect.\nThe Exorcist: Believer only substantiates the argument that was already made clear with 1977's direct sequel which was equally disastrous. None of the three sequels or two prequels in The Exorcist franchise are any good. Believer should hit the nail on the coffin on a franchise that just wasn't meant to be. William Friedkin himself walked away from talks of The Exorcist 2 for the simple fact that he had no other story to tell with the material. Unfortunately, Blumhouse and Green did not have much of a story to tell with The Exorcist: Believer despite its potential, resulting in yet another disappointing installment of The Exorcist franchise.\n"}

The series marks the latest in a long and ongoing collaboration between Japanese manga publishing powerhouse Shueisha and American comic book publishing legend Marvel Comics.\nAs reported in Anime News Network, this month's issue of Shueisha's Saikyo Jump will feature the debut of Spider-Man: Kizuna - a brand-new ongoing manga following the adventures of a Japanese elementary student who becomes Spider-Man. While further details of the storyline were not announced before its publication, judging from the prior work of its creators, the story will likely include a fair share of high adventure mixed with humorous hijinks. The news title dropped in the October 4, 2023, issue of Saikyo Jump, which will continue to be its publishing platform thereafter.\nSpider-Man: Kizuna is based on Setta Kobayashi and Hachi Mizuno's one-shot of the same name. That story, which was published in September 2022, also appeared In Saikyo Jump. At the time Kobayashi posted a note to his X (formerly Twitter) account stating how excited he was to have the opportunity to work on a manga starring Spider-Man and how he hoped its readers would convince Shueisha or Marvel to serialize the title. While it took a few years, fan support for the Spider-Man: Kizuna one shot must have convinced Shueisha that the story deserved its own dedicated title and continuing series. More recently, Kobayashi went on to state that his aim in creating Spider-Man: Kizuna is to establish a new Japanese version of Spider-Man.\nThis is not the first time Shueisha and Marvel have collaborated. Last summer the two companies announced a manga spinoff to the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse called Spider-Man: Octopus Girl. That story follows the misadventures of Doctor Octopus who, after falling into a coma during another fight with Spider-Man, wakes up to find that he inhabits the mind and body of a Japanese middle school student. Even earlier, in 2019, the two comic publishing giants inked a deal in which a series of one-shot manga stories involving Marvel characters were produced and published on Shueisha's premier manga website Shonen Jump+. That collaboration resulted in the generation of some notable titles including Sanshiro Kasama and Hikaru Uesugi's Deadpool Samurai, and Secret Reverse by Yu-Gi-Oh! author Kazuki Takahashi.\nInterestingly, the 2019 Shueisha - Marvel collaboration also included a work by Mizuno entitled Avengers: Gag Reel which uses a traditional gag/prank manga style to poke fun at the usually super serious Avengers. Kobayashi is also not new to the parody scene. In 2018, he created Asta's Journey to Wizard King, a \"gag manga spinoff\" to Yuki Tabata's Black Clover. While Spider-Man is one of the most wisecracking heroes in Marvel, it certainly would be interesting to see him in an environment where everything could be a joke. If that's what Kobayashi and Mizuno are setting up Spider-Man: Kizuna as, it will definitely be a fresh new take on Marvel's classic hero from Shonen Jump publisher Shueisha.\nSource: Anime News Network, @settaboyashi (1), (2)\nMarcel Green is a writer for Screen Rant's Comics and Anime Sections."}
{"title": "Star Wars Is Setting Up A Villain Bigger Than The  Force Itself", "date": "2023-10-05 22:30:23", "text": "Ahsoka's finale episode sets up a massively powerful villain for Star Wars' future and will likely require the entirety of the Force to defeat.\nWarning! This post contains SPOILERS for Ahsoka episode 8\nAhsoka has set up the canonical return of one of Star Wars' most powerful villains who's bigger than the Force itself. With a powerful presence calling to the Dark Jedi Baylan Skoll (Ray Stevenson), Ahsoka's finale episode gave a major tease as to who Baylan is searching for on the extragalactic world of Peridea. As such, it's quite possible that a huge new threat is coming in Star Wars' future that would be far worse than Grand Admiral Thrawn's return to the known galaxy.\nIn search of power referenced only in myth and fairytales, Baylan Skoll is driven by his desire to break the galaxy's never-ending cycle of light and dark. Rather than wanting to restore the Empire via Thrawn's return, Baylan has his own agenda as soon as he makes it to Peridea, the fabled homeworld of the Nightsisters located in another galaxy. To that end, a major hint in Ahsoka's finale suggests Baylan is being called by Abeloth, a major cosmic entity from Legends connected to the Ones of Mortis, the trio of Force gods first seen in The Clone Wars who have now returned in this new Star Wars show.\nKnown as the Queen of Stars and Bringer of Chaos, Abeloth was first introduced in Legends' Fate of the Jedi novels by Aaron Allston, Christie Golden, and Troy Denning. Set during the New Republic era, Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order faced Abeloth, a threat far more powerful than the Sith and the dark side. However, the books and Abeloth were removed from the official canon following Disney's purchase of Lucasfilm and the Star Wars IP back in 2012. Nevertheless, the provided backstory and origins for Abeloth are directly tied to the Ones who remained part of the canon given their appearances in The Clone Wars season 3.\nAbeloth was once a mortal woman who began serving the Ones as the Father strove to keep his children in balance, the Son embodying the dark side of the Force while the Daughter represented the light. Eventually, she became part of their family as the Mother, helping the Father keep the children in balance. However, the woman continued to age unlike her family of immortals, motivating her decision to drink and swim in the forbidden Font of Power and Pool of Knowledge.\nThe Mother transformed into the Force being known as Abeloth, gaining extreme power while also being corrupted and twisted to madness. As such, the Father and his children abandoned Abeloth for Mortis as the world quickly became corrupted and darkened. The Ones also created a prison to contain Abeloth, though she would break out anytime there was a major disruption in the balance of the Force, requiring the Son and Daughter to work together to imprison her once more. Once the Mortis gods died as seen in The Clone Wars season 3, Abeloth was unleashed for good during the New Republic era.\nRelated: Thrawn's Zombie Stormtroopers Explained: Magick, Power & Star Wars Future\nKeeping Abeloth and her Legends' history in mind, it does look as though Ahsoka is setting up her return to the official Star Wars canon very soon. Believing that even the Nightsisters' Great Mothers feared the hidden power calling to him, Baylan may be searching for Abeloth herself. Considering the power and magicks at the disposal of the Great Mothers, this mysterious being has to be something incredibly dangerous to get them so scared, and Abeloth definitely fits the bill. It would certainly explain why the Mothers are so subservient to Grand Admiral Thrawn seeing as how he's their only way to escape Peridea.\nAdditionally, Abeloth's imprisonment could also be why the witch kingdom fell in the first place and why the planet is largely a wasteland. Perhaps it was corrupted over time by Abeloth's influence and containment. Abeloth on Peridea could also explain why the purrgil star whales changed their migration routes in the ancient past, seeing as how they now only come to Peridea to die, hence the planet's rings being comprised solely of the whales' bones.\nIt's not hard to see how Abeloth and Baylan's goals could align. Wanting to create a new era for the galaxy that's no longer burdened by the constant conflict of light and dark, Abeloth could certainly manipulate Baylan into releasing her (if she hasn't broken free already). Following her corruption and descent into madness, Abeloth sought to bring about a galactic apocalypse, allowing her to create a brand-new galaxy in its place where she would be loved and adored (despite being an entity of pure chaos and entropy). As such, Abeloth calling out to Baylan is more than plausible.\nRelated: 15 Star Wars Easter Eggs In Episode 8\nAbeloth was already being theorized as the one calling Baylan Skoll before Ahsoka's finale. Now, Baylan finding massive statues of the Mortis gods hugely supports those ideas for Star Wars' future. Clearly, the Ones had an influence on Peridea which could very well be Abeloth's prison and/or her original world before the Force gods abandoned her for Mortis. To that end, this unnamed world was indeed described in the novels as a \"mountainous forest world\" just like the valley Baylan discovers at the end of Ahsoka. Perhaps it's one of the last regions that hasn't been turned into a wasteland from Abeloth's own influence on Peridea.\nAs seen in the final shots of Ahsoka's finale episode, the statue of the Father points across the valley to the mountains on the other side. Likewise, one of the peaks features some sort of shining beacon or glint, clearly representing the endpoint for Baylan's quest before he discovers who or what has been calling to him ever since he came to Peridea, having fully abandoned not only Morgan Elsbeth's efforts to bring back Thrawn but also Baylan's own apprentice Shin Hati. As such, the odds are very strong that Baylan will discover far more than he bargained for, especially if it's Abeloth.\nThere's some solid evidence that Abeloth will soon make her Star Wars comeback either in a possible Ahsoka season 2 or some other Star Wars project in the works. To that end, it will likely require both the light and dark sides of the Force joining together to even have a hope of containing Abeloth (let alone destroying her for good). Thanks to Baylan Skoll's discovery in Ahsoka's finale, the future of Star Wars just got incredibly exciting and even more dangerous all at the same time.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Masters Of The Air Is Already Beating Band Of Brothers' First Follow-Up In One Major Way", "date": "2023-10-05 22:30:23", "text": "The Pacific never reached the same heights as Band of Brothers, and Masters of Air has already gotten closer to the original series in one big way.\nThe team behind HBO's beloved series Band of Brothers is dipping back into WWII with Masters of the Air, and the latest follow-up already has a leg up on its predecessor, The Pacific. Debuting nine years after Band of Brothers originally aired, The Pacific acted as a companion to the widely acclaimed miniseries. Although it didn't quite measure up to the bar set by Band of Brothers, The Pacific was renowned for its visual and technical execution and overlapping individual stories as opposed to the broader focus of Band of Brothers.\nHowever, The Pacific never achieved the same level of popularity as Band of Brothers for a litany of reasons. Part of it was certainly its coverage of the Pacific War, widely considered a much more brutal and horrifying conflict than its European counterpart in WWII, which was viscerally depicted on screen. Another key element that The Pacific was missing was the massive, star-studded cast of Band of Brothers. In that regard, Masters of the Air is already improving upon the first companion series.\nThe cast of Band of Brothers was largely made up of small-time or unknown actors, some of whom went on to become major film stars. However, it also included a long list of already-established stars like David Schwimmer, Scott Grimes, Donnie Wahlberg and Ron Livingston. The Pacific was missing the excitement of those existing stars for people to look out for. While some of the members of the cast did go on to become major stars (including Rami Malek, Jon Bernthal and James Badge Dale), they were all relative unknowns at the time the show aired.\nRelated: Masters of the Air Has Broken a Major Band of Brothers Tradition (& It's Worrying)\nMasters of the Air will not have the same issue, as its cast will be led by two of cinema's more recognizable faces--Austin Butler and Barry Keoghan. Academy Award nominee Austin Butler is fresh off playing Elvis Presley in the acclaimed biopic Elvis, and has featured roles in the highly-anticipated upcoming movies The Bikeriders and Dune: Part II. One of his primary co-stars in Masters of the Air is the also-Academy Award-nominated Barry Keoghan, who has had significant roles in cinematic juggernauts like Marvels The Eternals and Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk. Both actors are supremely talented, which is an exciting prospect for how emotionally impactful Masters of the Air will be.\nThe first images from Masters of the Air provided a glimpse of the aesthetic that will dominate the companion series, as well as the first look at Butler and Keoghan's characters. Butler is set to portray Major Gale Cleven, and Keoghan will play Lt. Curtis Biddick, both of whom were real-life members of the 100th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces. Nicknamed \"The Bloody Hundredth\" due to how few of their pilots returned from their raids in 1943, the 100th Bombardment Group attacked German forces and industrial targets across Western Europe.\nButler and Keoghan's real-life counterparts were both B-17 Flying Fortress bomber pilots, which will certainly be reflected in the show given that it is accurately based upon the book Masters of the Air from historian Donald L. Miller. Early images from Masters of the Air seem to indicate that while Butler and Keoghan may be the primary leads for the show, emphasis and screen time will be dispersed among the entire ensemble cast, much as it was for Band of Brothers. The return to that format is exciting in itself, but the fact that it will be led by two legitimate stars gives Masters of the Air and early leg up on its predecessor The Pacific.\n"}
{"title": "Totally Killer Producers Talk Blumhouse's Time Travel Slasher Thriller & Challenge Of Modest Budgets", "date": "2023-10-05 22:30:23", "text": "Totally Killer producers Greg Gilreath and Adam Hendricks talk Blumhouse's time-traveling slasher and the challenge of trimming modest budget scripts.\nFrom the studio behind hit horror-comedy mashups Freaky and Happy Death Day comes another fresh take on the slasher genre with Totally Killer. The Blumhouse-produced title centers on a teenager whose mother is killed by a serial killer who terrorized her small town almost 30 years before and finds a way to time travel back to the original killing spree, leading her to team up with the younger version of her mom and her friends to stop the killer and get back to the present before it's too late.\nThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina alum Kiernan Shipka leads the star-studded Totally Killer cast alongside Olivia Holt, Julie Bowen, Randall Park, Lochlyn Munro, Charlie Gillespie, Liana Liberato, Kelcey Mawema, Stephi Cin-Salvo and Anna Diaz. Bringing the same self-aware humor as Blumhouse's prior genre mashups for another hilarious and thrilling combo, the movie arrives just in time for the Halloween season.\nRelated: New On Amazon Prime Video: All 138 Movies & TV Shows Arriving In October\nIn anticipation of the movie's release, Screen Rant spoke exclusively with producers Greg Gilreath and Adam Hendricks to discuss Totally Killer, the search for the perfect director for the script's vision, and the challenge of trimming down scenes to accommodate larger set pieces.\nScreen Rant: Greg, I'm very excited to talk about Totally Killer. How did the script first come to you, and what about it really spoke to your interest to want to help produce it?\nGreg Gilreath: Great questions, it was a script that was floating around at Amazon, and they were kind of up on it. We had partnered with Blumhouse and Amazon on this sort of small slate of films, and it was one that was in the mix. Just reading it, it was so apparent right away that this was something that could be really memorable, really fun, and really stand out and allow you to have a great viewing experience. A lot of these comedy-horror films are really reliant on self-referential [humor], sort of really understanding the depths of the slasher genre, or things like that.\nI really love that this was kind of an entry point into the into this thing, it was like, \"You don't need the deep knowledge of slasher films,\" it could kind of be a first step in, and it really was so comedy forward, we knew that we had the right director and the right cast on this. It could be sort of a door into the horror genre for a lot of people who might tell themselves, \"I don't like horror films,\" and I think it really has succeeded in that, because it's so funny, and here's so much heart. All the comedy comes from character, and emotion, and nostalgia, and sort of subverting nostalgia, as opposed to being like, \"Hey, you remember that scene in Prom Night when this thing happened? And if you don't, you won't get the joke.\"\nAdam Hendricks: I think that there are a few things. One is that the scope is really fun, it's a challenge, there's big action set pieces, lots of extras in '80s costumes, hair even, like, hair's a big deal. I think that was really exciting. I think that for us, humor wise, the opportunity of doing a film where someone with a contemporary viewpoint goes back to the '80s where people are unfiltered, and all of a sudden, just realizing that that time that I was born in — it's so long ago from now, it's as far away as the '80s were from the '40s like, how insane is that conceptually?\nFinally, [we just] love Natch, what a cool filmmaker, what a great person to get behind. This is her only horror thing, we loved all her non-horror stuff, and Greg and I think our tastes go way beyond, even though we're like we're such horror babies, we also just love all types of film. To have someone who's succeeded in television shows, but also rom-coms, and basically saying, \"I really want to murder people on screen,\" it's like, how do you not get behind that?\nYou talked about looking for the right director and the right cast, which did you find was the most important step first? Did you feel that the script needed to be touched up, or did you feel that Blumhouse and Amazon already had it set up, and you just wanted to help get the director?\nGreg Gilreath: I think it's always director first. It was a great script, but the thing that we always look for in a director that didn't write the script is a director who is like, \"This is a great foundation, but here's how I'm going to do this and make this my own.\" We knew that the script was excellent, but that finding that director who had a vision for it and had like a real keen understanding of, \"This is how I will hone this, and shape this, and maybe change it up just a little bit from what it was originally conceived,\" that was by far the most important piece of this puzzle.\nHow challenging would you say that journey was to find the perfect person who had that vision?\nGreg Gilreath: It was both incredibly difficult and incredibly easy. It's like when it's blue skies, and in your mind, you could have anything that you could possibly ever imagine or go out to any director, you have lists with hundreds of people, and you're watching films, and you're talking about it. Then, once we kind of hit on Nahnatchka, and talked about it some more, and then once we met with her, it became clear that she is the person to direct this film, so it was really easy. Once we spent those months, dreaming big and talking about everything, and everybody you could possibly imagine, and then it really collapsed in an amazing way as soon as we talked to her.\nOne of the things that also really surprised me about this movie is that despite having Blumhouse's name attached, it feels like a very big movie, production-wise. The sets and action feel pretty high-scale. What is that like from your position as a producer, trying to help bring the script to life, bring some of those big sets to life, while maintaining a modest budget for a streaming release?\nGreg Gilreath: Yeah, so, it's true of every single movie that's ever been made, there's never enough time or money to do everything you want, unless you're doing an Adam Sandler Netflix movie, where they're just like, \"Whatever you want,\" but outside of that, there's never enough time or enough money. So, Adam [Hendricks] and I have done over 30 movies at this point, and the process is really getting in there with the writer and the director, and the department heads on the movie, and sort of being like, \"What is the essence of the story that we have to keep?\"\nThere's always scenes that go, and fat that's trimmed, and there's always calls of like, \"Okay, these seven scenes, we really need to spend all of our money, and then maybe on these ones, we could just find a location that's already got all this stuff in it, and just maybe shift it a little bit, or maybe instead of shooting a big wide for this scene, we can kind of contain it a little bit to the small part of the room, because we know there will be those two people talking. It would be great to have that big wide, but having just two people talking close up like that will really give us the scope to go do the Gravitron, or do this chase sequence, or something like that.\" So, honing in on what those pieces are — and to Nahnatchka's credit too, we were way over budget at one point, and she was so adamant — and she was correct — that the Gravitron sequence tt the end had to stay, and if that went away, there would be no movie that was worth making.\nEverybody at a certain point, everybody — not fought her on it, but questioned whether that was the best choice. Because it was like, \"What if we made everything else 15% better?\", but she was like, \"Absolutely not. We're doing this.\" So we had to reverse engineer the movie and really dig into the script with her about like, \"Okay, this scene's four pages, can it be one? We have these three scenes, can they be two, we have these five characters, can we get that information in one?\" It was a real process of breaking down the movie scene-by-scene and element-by-element, and figuring out what can go and what has to stay?\nI'm actually really glad she fought for that Gravitron scene, it's radical. In talking about going back to the script and trimming things here and there, what would you say was the hardest scene that you really reworked to fit this budget?\nGreg Gilreath: That's a great question. I think there's a lot of different ways to slice that, so like the Dollhouse of Horrors, the haunted house sequence where they sort of finally get the killer, and the pre-Gravitron sequence. That was a thing that existed at the amusement park in Vancouver, we were going to at first build this whole giant thing that we were going to do, and we couldn't figure out how to afford it, and our production designer, Liz, was pitching all these ideas about, \"Well, what if we just did like an elaborate entrance, and then everything else was kind of minimalist? Or what if it was outside?\" We had 100 different conceptions of what that area was called, it was called the Enchanted Forest at a time, just so many conceptions of what that could be, and none of them felt great.\nThen, there was this moment where I was like, \"Wait, what's that weird, spooky building over there that's kind of boarded up? Can we go in there?\" And the locations rep was like, \"Oh, sure, I guess you can.\" Once we put our heads in there, it kind of all clicked for that scene, and that's the great thing about making a movie, where you're just sort of a little bit of kismet, we just happened to be walking over there, and somebody happened to be curious about what this creepy looking building was. Then, once we went in, it became clear that we were spinning our wheels and wasting our time on trying to build a whole new thing for that sequence that was never going to work, it was just never going to work because we didn't have the resources or the time to do it properly.\nAlso, I think knowing when to cut bait and pivot is such an exceptionally rare tool right now. I think that was probably the biggest change that we made from what the script was, everything else was just little [things], like the party kill sequence. There was an extra beat on the stairs, there was another thing in the garage, so it's like very surgical, for the most part, just carving out little things.\n35 years after the shocking murder of three teens, the infamous “Sweet Sixteen Killer“ returns on Halloween night to claim a fourth victim. 17-year-old Jamie (Kiernan Shipka) ignores her overprotective mom’s (Julie Bowen) warning and comes face to face with the masked maniac and on the run for her life, accidentally time travels back to 1987, the year of the original killings. Forced to navigate the unfamiliar and outrageous culture of the 1980s, Jamie teams up with her teen mom (Olivia Holt) to take down the killer once and for all before she’s stuck in the past forever.\nCheck out our other interviews with:\nTotally Killer begins streaming on Prime Video on October 6.\nSource: Screen Rant Plus\n"}
{"title": "The Boys: 10 Characters Fans Wish Could Have Died Twice", "date": "2023-10-05 22:30:23", "text": "There's plenty of deaths in The Boys, but some are more deserved than others. Here are the Top 10 The Boys characters fans wish could have died twice!\nThe Boys has no shortage of gruesome deaths splattered throughout its fictional world, and while that may be hard for some fans to stomach, those who are killed usually more than deserve what they get, making their deaths oh so satisfying. In fact, these select characters are so despicable, one death just doesn’t seem like enough of a punishment for them.\nWithin The Boys universe (created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson), practically everyone of note with superpowers is a vile, repugnant excuse for a human being. Sexual assault is rampant, drug use is a given, and even murder is commonplace among the separate superhero teams - including and especially the Seven. That isn’t to say there aren’t regular humans who are deserving of death in this world, as there are more than a few who are even worse than those with superpowers - which is something this very list will reflect. Between those who abuse their superpowers and those who are somehow just as bad without them, here are the Top 10 worst characters in The Boys who fans wish could have died twice.\nIt doesn’t take long for The Boys to establish exactly why A-Train deserves to die. In the very first issue, A-Train callously runs through a living person - specifically, Hughie’s girlfriend, Robin - while chasing a super-villain, killing her instantly. Then, in The Boys #3, A-Train is one of the three supes who sexual assault Starlight right after she’s been brought on to the Seven. In the end, Hughie kicks A-Train’s head right off his body after getting a jolt from some Compound V Butcher gives him, and that quick death is far more than he deserved.\nThe first example of a non-powered villain on this list, Little Nina is the head of a Russian crime syndicate who plotted to overthrow the Kremlin and appoint herself as the new head of state. Her plan was to use a group of supes to pull off this coup, and if it weren’t for the Boys, she would have likely succeeded. In The Boys #14, Little Nina suffers a relatively quick - albeit incredibly bizarre - death after a bomb goes off right next to her (or possibly inside her body), killing her in the explosion. Little Nina dedicated her life to gaining power at the expense of others, as she was no stranger to manipulation, torture, and - of course - murder, making her death all the more satisfying.\nA supe who picks on those weaker than him just for a laugh, and who manipulates those around him by making them fear for their lives. That is Malchemical, and fans assuredly wanted to see him dead from the moment he first appeared in The Boys #40. Malchemical has the power to alter his body’s molecular structure in a variety of ways. He can do anything from classic shapeshifting to turning himself into a cloud of poison gas. In fact, it was the latter form that killed him, as Butcher lit a match when Malchemical was in a gaseous state, lighting him on fire and burning him to death. His anticipated demise came after Malchemical tormented a relatively innocent group of supes, who weren’t very good superheroes, but tried their best to be. Those who prey on the most vulnerable deserve the most horrific of fates, and in Malchemical’s case, he deserves it twice.\nFirst and foremost, Stormfront is a Nazi, so that in and of itself earned him a place on this list. But even if he wasn’t, Stormfront still proved to be a despicable superhero and human being all the way up until his death in The Boys #37. According to his canon history within The Boys lore, Stormfront was used by Vought-American in conjunction with the United States government to commit local atrocities like killing off the entirety of a Native American tribe for the sake of building a dam on their land. Stormfront actively enjoyed killing people, as it made him feel more powerful, and that’s why watching him get stomped to death by The Boys was so satisfying.\nEvery horrible act of sexual violence, drug abuse, or flat-out murder committed by pretty much any supe in The Boys - including and especially those of the Seven - are made possible by this man, James Stillwell. Stillwell makes sure the proverbial curtains remain closed to the public when it comes to the horrific things done by Vought-American’s supes, and he’s paid a lot of money for doing this. In fact, James Stillwell is so bad that his fate is actually far worse than anyone else on this list: he’s still alive. As revealed in The Boys: Dear Becky, James lost his mind following the events of The Boys’ series finale, as he’s spotted roaming a pineapple plantation, raving about ‘good product vs bad product’. His fate is one that he has to wake up to day after agonizing day. That moment when he finally snapped was just as finalizing as any death on this list, and it’s something fans can only hope he still remembers deep within his now-fractured psyche.\nHaving recently made his live-action debut in the new Prime series Gen V, The Boys fans should now be at least semi familiar with John Godolkin, though they may still not know the full extent of his heinous crimes in the comics. Debuting in The Boys #24, Godolkin is the leader of the G-Men, as well as the person who runs a school for young supes. On paper, Godolkin is an upstanding citizen and leader of a high-profile superhero team. Behind closed doors, however, John Godolkin is a pedophile who victimizes the young supes in his care. Godolkin is gunned down by a small army deployed by Vought-American, along with practically every supe in his school, and the world became a safer place immediately following his grisly death.\nAnything bad done by Homelander is immediately made worse by the fact that he’s supposed to be this world’s ‘Superman’, and is meant to be the shining light of inspiration and hope in a world filled with violence and terror. But, as it turns out, Homelander is a genuine piece of human garbage who deserved every bit of the gruesome death he got. In The Boys #65, Black Noir reveals himself to be an enhanced (and mentally unstable) clone of Homelander who was created to kill him if he ever got out of hand - which he does in spectacular fashion. Within the Oval Office of the White House, Black Noir rips Homelander to shreds with his bare hands, leaving nothing left of the repugnant Superman knock-off except one of his arms and a bit of his torso.\nWhile Black Noir did the world a favor by killing Homelander, he wasn’t exactly a saint himself. In fact, the only reason Homelander was worth killing at all was because of Black Noir. Since Black Noir’s entire purpose was to kill Homelander if he got out of line, Black Noir took it upon himself to push Homelander over that line. He looked just like Homelander, so Black Noir put on Homelander’s suit, committed unspeakable acts of violence, and took pictures of himself doing it. This was all done in an effort to make Homelander think he did these things, pushing him to become the villain he already thought he was, and making it acceptable for Black Noir finally fulfill his dark purpose. After that was done - and after Homelander put up a hell of a fight - Billy Butcher finished off Black Noir himself, and the supe clone deserved every moment of agony the leader of the Boys put him through.\nSamuel Butcher, husband of Connie Butcher, father to Billy and Lenny Butcher, was a baker in London’s East End, though it’s heavily implied that he moonlit as a career criminal for cash on the side. Why he’s on this list isn’t because he supposedly had a penchant for breaking the law, however, but because he was a heavily abusive husband and father. Sam would mercilessly beat his wife in front of their kids, going so far as to blind her in one eye during a particularly violent rage-filled outburst. He was a cruel, sick man with a family who feared and hated him to their core. He died an unspectacular death in The Boys storyline “Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker”, with one of his own sons urinating on his corpse.\nWhile many might think of Butcher as one of the main protagonists of The Boys, they’d be very wrong. Butcher’s entire life revolved around intimidating, threatening, and blackmailing people into doing whatever he wanted. While he used this skill for good with the Boys by keeping supe’s in-line, he also did it with Vogelbaum, the man who created Compound V, and forced him to create a new compound that would kill every single supe in the world - effectively creating a means for genocide on a global scale. Not only that, but Butcher killed every single member of the Boys himself (except Hughie), turning on the people who trusted him the most. Butcher is seductively charming, to be sure, but he’s a bona fide super-villain, and his death in The Boys #71 couldn’t have come soon enough.\nThe heinous atrocities committed by everyone on this list makes them more than deserving of their violent fates. In fact, it’s safe to say that they should have to live their deaths at least one more time all over again, as these Top 10 The Boys characters are the ones fans wish could have died twice.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

In addition to the streaming service’s exclusive original films, Netflix’s new movies in October 2023 bring numerous titles that fill its hub of Halloween content. While Netflix also boasts numerous horror TV shows fitting for the spooky season, such as Mike Flanagan’s various series and Tim Burton’s Wednesday, the platform is offering a plethora of Halloween-appropriate movie selections that vary in scariness.\nWith so much variety, the best Halloween movies on Netflix in 2023 appeal to many different moods, ages, and audience preferences. Whether Netflix subscribers are looking for critically acclaimed horror and thrillers movies from directors such as Steven Spielberg and Mike Flanagan or prefer family-friendly spooky ‘90s favorites, there’s something for everyone on the October 2023 catalog. From Casper to The Pope’s Exorcist, Netflix’s selection of supernatural and horror-related movies are perfect for revisiting old favorites or experiencing a story’s thrills and scares for the first time.\nRelated: 10 Best Horror Movies On Netflix In October\nAmong the greatest Halloween movies available on Netflix is Casper, the 1995 supernatural coming-of-age dramedy starring The Addams Family’s Christina Ricci. Based on the Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoons, the 1995 movie follows teenager Kat (Ricci) as she joins her father James (Bill Pullman) to communicate with Casper and his fellow ghosts, who peacefully haunt a mansion in Maine. Casper quickly falls for Kat, but his deceased nature and mischievous ghostly uncles cause trouble for the young pair. The box office hit is still as charming today as it was 28 years ago, making Casper one of the best nostalgia watches this Halloween on Netflix.\nSteven Spielberg ushered in a wave of blockbuster filmmaking with Jaws in 1975, which remains one of the scariest and most thrilling movies nearly 50 years later. Jaws, which is based on the same-titled 1974 novel, surrounds the summer resort town of Amity as a man-eating great white shark continues to attack beachgoers, leading the police chief Brody, marine biologist Hooper, and professional shark hunter Quint to team up and hunt down the sea creature. The three-time Oscar winner has been frightening people out of the water for several decades since its debut, with Jaws’ streaming availability on Netflix being apt to scare new generations of prospective beachgoers.\nA prequel to the 2014 box off hit Ouija, Mike Flanagan’s horror movie follow-up premiered in 2016 to significantly greater critical acclaim than its predecessor. Ouija: Origin of Evil takes the story back to 1967, beginning when a widow working as a spiritual medium introduces a Ouija board into her family’s phony séance business. When the board actually conjures a spirit that possesses her daughter, Ouija: Origin of Evil takes twisted turns that prove to be even scarier and dramatic than the original movie. Mike Flanagan proves to be the king of horror on Netflix, with his Universal-backed Ouija: Origin of Evil being available alongside his Netflix originals this Halloween.\nThe cult classic 2008 horror movie The Strangers stands out among Netflix’s Halloween movie catalog. While it received mixed reviews upon release and became a sleeper hit at the box office, The Strangers’ cult status turned it into a multi-film franchise with three follow-ups already confirmed. The true story-inspired psychological horror film offers plenty of scares and homages to classic slashers from the 1970s, with The Strangers itself having often been reassessed as a modern horror classic.\nRob Zombie’s movie adaptation of the classic 1960s sitcom The Munsters arrived on Netflix in 2022, serving as the origin story of the romance between Herman and Lily Munster. While Rob Zombie’s The Munsters movie wasn’t received very well by critics, the cult approach of the adaptation makes it ripe for better reception upon additional viewing. Zombie may be better known for his gorier horror outings, but Netflix original movie The Munsters provides a charming PG-rated macabre story that the entire family can enjoy.\nThe second installment in Netflix 2021 Fear Street movie trilogy, Fear Street Part Two: 1978 takes the story back to a fateful night in the Shadyside and Sunnyvale lore. The two towns are brought together for summer camp only for a killer to gruesomely attack Camp Nightwing’s kids and teens, with plenty of Easter eggs and homages to classic flasher movies like Friday the 13th. Starring Stranger Things’ Sadie Sink and One Piece’s Emily Rudd, Fear Street Part Two: 1978’s ending features some unexpected twists and that brilliantly lead into the trilogy’s third and final installment.\nFrom Coraline and The Nightmare Before Christmas director Henry Selick, Wendell & Wild revives the classic stop-motion animated horror movie trend with a spooky story about two demon brothers who receive help from an orphaned teenage girl. The 2022 Netflix original movie surprisingly boasts a PG-13 rating, making the stop-motion film’s macabre themes more suitable for older audiences. However, the critically-acclaimed movie still provides plenty of spooky humor and striking visuals that make it a perfect Halloween watch.\nAlso streaming on Netflix this Halloween is Hotel Transylvania 2, the second installment in Todd Durham’s monster franchise. The 2015 animated box office hit brings back voice actors such as Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James, and Keegan-Michael Key as Dracula, his classic monster friends and family, and human son-in-law. Coming in at under 90 minutes, the spooky family-friendly monster movie provides a brief and entertaining story to stream on Netflix this Halloween season.\nAdam Sandler’s 2020 supernatural mystery movie Hubie Halloween may not have landed with critics, but the comedy still boasts a talented ensemble cast and entertaining story to get into the Halloween spirit. The Netflix original follows the titular character (played by Sandler) on Halloween as he monitors the town of Salem, Massachusetts in an attempt to save his fellow residents from a kidnapper. Adam Sandler has produced numerous comedy movies for Netflix over the years, with Hubie Halloween providing annual holiday fun that appeals to kids and adults alike.\nThe 2008 animated horror-comedy Igor is also available to watch on Netflix this Halloween. While originally receiving mixed reviews from critics, Igor has gained a cult following over the 15 years since its release, with its availability on Netflix’s Halloween hub inevitably introducing it to a new generation of viewers. Igor is inspired by the titular character who has appeared in various forms in supernatural monster movies, typically as an assistant to an evil scientist or villainous monster. However, this animated movie flips the evil scientist assistant trope, as Igor accidentally creates a kind female monster in his attempt to move from assistant to an evil scientist himself.\nIn addition to his Ouija prequel, Mike Flanagan’s 2017 psychological horror movie Gerald’s Game is streaming on Netflix in October 2023. The Netflix original movie is based on Stephen King’s 1992 novel of the same name, which had largely been considered unfilmable before Flanagan’s critically acclaimed outing. Starring frequent Mike Flanagan collaborators Carla Gugino, Bruce Greenwood, Kate Siegel, and Henry Thomas, Gerald’s Game is centered around Jessie Burlingame, who is left stranded and handcuffed to her bed without a key after her husband dies of a heart attack. While trying to survive in the isolated cabin, Jessie is confronted with her personal demons in one of Mike Flanagan’s most chilling movies.\nJohn Carpenter’s 1998 neo-Western horror movie Vampires is streaming on Netflix just in time for Halloween viewing. The Halloween director’s film follows a team of vampire hunters who try to prevent a centuries-old cross from falling into the hands of a powerful vampire, which leads to non-stop gory showdowns. While not as critically adored his Carpenter’s classics like Halloween and The Thing, 1998’s Vampires takes him into another horror subgenre that still embodies the filmmaker’s iconic style.\nGuillermo del Toro has proven himself to be a master in the supernatural horror genre, with Crimson Peak’s gothic romance story being a brilliant execution of his visual style and themes. The 2015 movie stars Mia Wasikowska, Jessica Chastain, and Tom Hiddleston in Edwardian-era England as a newly-married young aspiring author moves into an isolated Gothic mansion with new husband and sister-in-law. However, she soon must solve a twisted mystery as ghosts haunt her new abode. With primarily positive reviews from critics and several award wins in the horror genre, Crimson Peak is a brilliantly spooky movie to watch on Netflix this Halloween.\nThe third installment in Netflix’s Fear Street movie trilogy, Fear Street Part Three: 1666 brings the tale back to the titular year while revealing the truth behind Sarah Fier and the “cursed” nature of Shadyside. The twists in the flashbacks lead to a thrilling reckoning in the “present” timeline of 1994, which continues the gory nature of the first two installments. Fear Street Part Three: 1666 received the highest critical acclaim of the three movies, marking a satisfying conclusion to the scary R.L. Stine-inspired Netflix trilogy.\nThe 2022 horror film The Invitation, inspired by the classic story Dracula, depicts the horrifying tale of a young woman who meets her long-lost family members after her mother’s death, leading to her discovery of their dangerous and dark secrets. While a modest success at the box office, The Invitation provides a chilling vampire story with a mesmerizing performance by former Game of Thrones actor Nathalie Emmanuele. Of the modern horror hits available to watch on Netflix this October, The Invitation will satisfy vampire subgenre Halloween viewing.\nThe 2019 supernatural horror movie The Wretched is another relatively recent outing available to steam on Netflix’s Halloween catalog. The creepy horror film follows a teenage boy who vies against an evil witch posing as his next-door neighbor, which satisfies many of the expected supernatural witch-in-the-woods movie tropes. The Wretched also boasts critical acclaim and a significant box office return, as the movie earned back over $4 million against a small budget under $100 thousand. With a teenage ensemble taking it upon themselves to battle a witch, The Wretched also drew frequent comparisons to Netflix’s own Stranger Things.\nCreep stands out as one of the most critically acclaimed horror movies within Netflix’s available Halloween content, as the 2014 found footage film received substantial praise from critics upon release. With plenty of thrills and captivating performances by its cast, Creep’s creepy tale follows a videographer who is tasked with filming an eccentric client at a remote cabin. The success of the Blumhouse-produced horror movie even spawned a critically acclaimed sequel in 2018, which is expected to be followed by the sequel Creep 3.\nNetflix has several Stephen King-inspired movies in its library, with 2019’s In the Tall Grass being based on the same-titled novella by King and his son Joe Hill. The Netflix original horror movie follows a brother and sister who are unable to escape a dangerous field of tall grass after entering in the hopes of saving a boy, providing plenty of scares expected of a Stephen King movie adaptation. In the Tall Grass also stars horror veteran Patrick Wilson, who is best known for his roles in The Conjuring and Insidious franchises.\nAnother Netflix original horror movie to stream this Halloween is The Babysitter, the streaming service’s 2017 black comedy horror film directed by McG. The Babysitter stars Scream Queen Samara Weaving, Judah Lewis, and Bella Thorne, with the film centering on a 12-year-old who learns that his babysitter is involved in a satanic cult that plans to kill him. The positively-reviewed Netflix original even launched a sequel in 2020, which stars Scream and Wednesday actress Jenna Ortega.\nAmong the most recent horror movies that is available to stream on Netflix for Halloween is The Pope’s Exorcist, which debuted in theaters in April 2023 to mixed reviews from critics, but proved successful at the box office. Starring Russell Crowe as the real demon-fighting exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth, The Pope’s Exorcist is inspired by the priest’s real claims, adding another creepy layer to the movie’s scares. Crowe’s performance allows Father Amorth’s demon-battling adventures to be a crowd-pleasing horror outing, providing a thrilling possession movie to watch this Halloween on Netflix.\n"}

{"title": "&quot;I Believe in Them&quot;: Red Hood Reveals the 1 Gotham Hero He Actually Respects", "date": "2023-10-05 22:00:26", "text": "Things in Gotham are changing at a rapid pace and Red Hood reveals that there’s one hero he’s come to respect (and it isn’t the Dark Knight).\nWarning! Contains spoilers for Catwoman #57!There's one hero in Gotham that Red Hood respects more than others. While facing off against his former mentor, Jason Todd informs Batman of a hero that the vigilante is starting to hold in high regard.\nIn Catwoman #57 by Tini Howard and Nico Leon, Batman is still in shock from losing his Batcave to Vandal Savage. As Bruce makes his next plans to stop Catwoman's newest criminal enterprise, Selina is one step ahead. She comes up with a plan to train her underlings to become car thieves and puts Red Hood in charge of the operation.\nAs Red Hood and a group of thieves pose as valets, Batman comes to stop him. Jason leads Bruce on a chase to distract him while Selina and several of her trainees rob a gala blind. Batman doesn't hold back from his former sidekick and yanks Red Hood off of his motorcycle with a grapple gun. As Bruce begs Jason to stop his alliance with Catwoman, Jason makes the point that he has a lot more in common with Selina than Bruce. Red Hood makes it blunt that he believes in Selina and her plan to make Gotham better.\nThe \"Gotham War\" crossover has made some major cracks in the Bat-Family. While Batman was recovering from Knight Terrors, Catwoman began training low-level criminals to break out on their own and target Gotham's wealthiest. As a result, Gotham's supervillains are floundering from a lack of henchmen and street crime has gone considerably down. All Selina asked was for the Bat-Family to not interrupt her operation, but Batman starkly refused. With no one but Damian on his side, Batman has begun pushing himself to end Catwoman's plans by any means necessary.\nBatman has lost nearly all his allies due to them seeing the validity of Catwoman's plans but it's surprising to see Jason on board with her. After all, just a few years before this, he spent his days terrorizing those who broke the law, killing an untold number of criminals. Now he's wholeheartedly endorsing Selina's plan. Admittedly, his line of logic makes sense. Both Jason and Selina didn't have the privileged upbringing that Bruce had and understand how desperation drives people to crime. For better or worse, Catwoman is actively changing Gotham for the better, and her work is doing what Batman never could: Inspire Red Hood.\nIt's not a stretch to say that Batman and Red Hood have a combative relationship. Jason has tried over and over again to get Bruce's approval but has had a tough time earning it. Selina, on the other hand, acknowledges the skills Jason has and has rewarded his efforts by making him a huge part of her plans. Red Hood is getting something from Catwoman that he hasn't gotten from Batman in a while: Respect and appreciation. In turn, Jason is confirming that he respects what Selina is doing and admits that he truly thinks she can make the city better. Fans can see more of Red Hood assisting Selina in Catwoman #57, on sale now.\n"}
{"title": "Was Halloween Ends Really That Bad? Re-Examining The $105M Disappointment, 1 Year Later", "date": "2023-10-05 21:50:25", "text": "Halloween Ends is one of the most controversial entries in the beloved horror franchise, but looking back on the film, is it really that bad?\nHalloween Ends is one of the most controversial films in the iconic horror franchise, and while the $105 million box office disappointment was initially met with poor reception, was it really that bad? Halloween Ends came out one year ago in October 2022, with the film wrapping up David Gordon Green's Halloween reboot trilogy. The third entry in the trilogy was definitely a risky move, with it putting a new spin on the Halloween franchise that hadn't been seen before. However, this spin didn't resonate with many Halloween fans, leading to Halloween Ends becoming a critical and commercial failure - but did it deserve this reception?\nHalloween Ends is the final entry in the Halloween reboot trilogy, which itself retconned all of the Halloween sequels and directly followed up on John Carpenter's 1978 original. Halloween Ends is set four years after the events of Halloween Kills, with Michael Myers having been missing for the previous few Halloweens. In his absence, the town of Haddonfield has grown increasingly paranoid and violent, almost as if Myers had put a curse on the town. Unbeknownst to Haddonfield's residents, Michael Myers has been living in the sewers, healing himself as he prepares to reign terror once again. However, this time the masked killer has some help.\nThe Halloween reboot trilogy had a pretty poor time in the critical marketplace, with none of the films being met with overwhelming positive reviews. Reviews for Halloween 2018 were ok, but the same can't be said for Halloween Kills or the subject of this analysis, 2022's Halloween Ends. As of the writing of this article, Halloween Ends sits at a 40% critical rating and a 57% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes, showing that the film didn't really gel with either fans or critics. Upon its release, Halloween Ends was torn to shreds, with a movement to reassess the movie only starting up recently.\nFans and critics had many problems with Halloween Ends, but they mostly are due to Michael Myers' connection to Corey Cunningham. In the film, Corey begins making a name for himself as a masked killer in Haddonfield, with him even acting as Michael Myers' sidekick at some points. Corey was arguably the main character in the film, which was a point of contention with fans. According to these fans, the scary part of Michael Myers is his mystery, something that doesn't work with Corey due to his prominence in the film. Some have even called Halloween Ends the worst entry in the franchise, showing how disappointing it was to some.\nHalloween Ends' critical reception wasn't the only thing that was disappointing, as the box office was pretty underwhelming as well. Halloween Ends made only $105.4 million on a $33 million budget, which is a huge step-down from Halloween 2018 making $259.9 million on a $10 million budget. While Halloween Ends was probably profitable, it most likely didn't meet the expectations of the studio. This financial failure is mostly due to Halloween Ends having a simultaneous release in theaters and on Peacock, with this streaming strategy undoubtedly kneecapping the film's box office returns. Thus, Halloween Ends failed on both critical and commercial fronts.\nRelated: Halloween Ends Cast & Character Guide\nAlthough Halloween Ends was received poorly, it is not nearly as bad as initially thought. The themes that are pulled in due to Corey Cunningham's story are truly unique to Halloween Ends, with them not having been seen in the franchise before. Halloween Ends also features some moments that are truly surprising, such as the opening scene. Halloween Ends' never lets the audience in on where it's going, so while every idea may not work out, it is at least trying something new. Corey Cunningham is the breath of fresh air that Halloween needed, which is why it's so odd that the film has been looked down upon.\nHalloween Ends may not live up to the original, but it is definitely more interesting than its two predecessors. Halloween 2018 and Halloween Kills are just lazy rehashes of the original film, with them not taking any risks. Because of this, both movies just feel like watered down versions of John Carpenter's original. Halloween Ends, on the other hand, isn't afraid to take risks, which is why it's so good. The only flaw with the film is its ending, with Michael's fight with Laurie Strode feeling completely detached from the rest of the story. Notably, this is the film's most similar scene to previous Halloween movies.\nThe Halloween franchise will continue into the future, causing many to wonder how this will affect the reception and canon status of Halloween Ends. Halloween Ends makes some wild choices near its end, including killing off Michael Myers. Due to the nature of Michael's death in Halloween Ends, it is impossible to say that he somehow lived (unless he is a supernatural entity). Because of this, future Halloween projects either have to be a prequel or they have to retcon Halloween Ends. With the rights to Halloween currently being sold, it seems as some studios have a plan for the franchise's future.\nInterestingly, Halloween Ends not truly being the end could be the best thing for the film's reception in the long-run. Many of the criticisms of Halloween Ends have to do with the film concluding the franchise by focusing on an original character rather than Laurie or Michael Myers. If more Halloween movies and TV shows are made, then Halloween Ends won't have ended the franchise on this note, fixing this problem. Halloween Ends may start seeing more positive reception as future Halloween projects get made, with this critical turnaround already being seen online.\nHalloween III: Season of the Witch was initially received poorly due to it not featuring Michael Myers, but it has become a cult classic in recent years. This same trend may repeat itself with Halloween Ends, with the film eventually being held in high regard for being so different. No other Halloween movie is like Halloween III: Season of the Witch, and the same can be said for Halloween Ends. Thus, it can be expected that fans and critics alike will have a more positive outlook on Halloween Ends in the future, redeeming the film that was already great from the start.\nRobert Pitman is a Movies/TV features writer for ScreenRant and loves all things nerdy.

{"title": "Welcome To Plathville: Ethan Plath's Cheating Rumors Explained", "date": "2023-10-05 21:50:17", "text": "Welcome to Plathville's Ethan and Olivia Plath are dealing with cheating rumors. The gossip about Ethan's date with another woman's troubling. \nIf the recent cheating rumors are true, Welcome to Plathville's Ethan and Olivia Plath are possibly on the rocks, and it's time to talk about that gossip. In season 5, the pair are dealing with so much stress, thanks to Olivia's feuds with Kim, Barry and Moriah Plath. Ethan thinks he's caught in the middle, and that kind of drama generally doesn't help a person to keep their marriage afloat. Over the years, the Plath family's made Olivia's life a living hell. Now, many Plaths, including Kim, are giving her the silent treatment. Some of the Plath kids have unloaded about their sister-in-law online.\nOlivia's had the hardest journey on the show, except perhaps for Moriah, who's talked about being in a dark place during Welcome to Plathville season 5. Kim didn't approve of Olivia, and Barry followed suit. They had no faith in their daughter-in-law, who made efforts to smooth things over. She worked hard to build bonds with some Plath family members, including Moriah. Olivia succeeded in many ways. However, during this installment, everything's falling apart onscreen. Olivia's being shunned, and she may be bailing out on her marriage. While Ethan was caught with another woman, that doesn't mean that he ended things with Olivia. She might have walked away.\nRight now, there's no proof that Ethan and Olivia are done, but there are clues that don't look good. Ethan definitely seemed to be on a date when a fan caught him dancing with another woman in a Minnesota bar, as per Without A Crystal Ball at Instagram. They were reportedly holding hands while they danced. The woman was described as a brunette who definitely wasn't redhead Olivia. Ethan doesn't really seem like the type to step out on his marriage, so possibly the divorce rumors, which have been running rampant, are one hundred percent accurate. If they are, reality TV show star Ethan's branching out following a separation, rather than actually cheating.\nIf Ethan and Olivia are still together, he might have been caught red-handed with a woman who isn't his wife. In that case, it would be very shocking. Based on what's unfolded onscreen over the years, Ethan's a loyal guy. He's stuck with Olivia, who may be the new Kim, through some very hard times, and was totally crushed when she wanted a break. He appeared to be very depressed.\nPeople change, so maybe he's not in the same state of mind now. He may feel differently about his wife, and be ready to live his life without her. It wouldn't be a surprise if Ethan and Olivia imploded, because the type of pressure they've been under through five Welcome to Plathville seasons has been significant. Most couples would have folded long ago, throwing in the towel just to avoid the mother-in-law drama and other feuds. Instead of calling it quits, Ethan and Olivia made an effort to heal their relationship. They went to Europe, traveling around to escape from the realities of being members of the Plath family.\nWhen they returned, they learned that Moriah had fled the Tampa home she shared with them without telling them first. Ethan and Olivia have been married since 2018, and they've weathered some extreme ups and downs. However, the rift with Moriah, with whom Olivia was once so close, seemed like quite a hurdle to overcome. Did it break the couple?\nOlivia's sister Sophia Meggs said that Ethan and Olivia are currently divorcing, but Olivia denied it. Nonetheless, something seems to be wrong. The pair just don't appear to be on the same page. They're not posting about each other lately, and they're sort of avoiding the elephant in the room at Instagram. Of course, their reluctance to address the rumors at IG, where they both have sizable followings, seems very relevant. It's possible that fans will see one of those polite but sad divorce announcements soon. If so, what does that mean for the future of the show? Will it end after Welcome to Plathville season 5?\nSource: Without A Crystal Ball/Instagram\n"}
{"title": "Hulk Vs She-Hulk: Who Is The Stronger Gamma-Powered Superhero?", "date": "2023-10-05 21:40:25", "text": "Hulk and She-Hulk's MCU power level is extremely high, but there's one key difference that makes one Gamma monster stronger than the other.\nAlthough the MCU's Hulk and She-Hulk draw their power from the same source, one of them has a clear advantage over the other. Gamma monsters are especially powerful MCU characters due to their sheer strength and durability. Even when they give up power in exchange for intelligence, they're still stronger than most Marvel superheroes. And to top it off, they can also become exponentially stronger according to their rage level.\nHulk's MCU origin story is inherently tied to Captain America, as the experiment that resulted in Bruce Banner's first transformation aimed to replicate the original Super Soldier serum. With the addition of Gamma radiation and Bruce Banner's pent-up rage, the experiment resulted in the birth of a monster with seemingly endless energy and strength: Hulk. Hulk then inspired the creation of other Gamma monsters, either voluntarily or accidentally — namely, the Abomination, the Leader, and She-Hulk, all of which have more natural control over their consciousness but less power and endurance.\nHulk's MCU power level has varied a lot throughout the years. First, The Incredible Hulk showed that Hulk is capable of mowing down whole military squads with ease, though he might struggle against certain weapons like Stark Industries' sonar cannons and against a similar Gamma monster, like the original no-holds-barred Abomination. Hulk's return in The Avengers increased his power to the point of being able to stop a Chitauri Leviathan on its tracks with a single punch, as well as brush off a hit from Thor's Mjolnir and survive a swarm attack from the Chitauri army. This same Hulk accomplishes a similar feat with Ultron's army in Avengers: Age of Ultron, but gets knocked out by Iron Man's Hulkbuster machine after an intense battle between the two Avengers.\nHulk's pinnacle of power in the MCU came in Thor: Ragnarok, where a smarter Hulk had already become a champion gladiator after defeating a variety of intergalactic warriors on the Grandmaster's arena. Thor: Ragnarok's Hulk is strong enough to defeat Fenrir single-handedly and land some blows on a giant-sized Surtur, though the only reason he can defeat Thor in gladiatorial combat is that the Grandmaster intervenes. After Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War showed that Hulk's strength is no match for Thanos' fighting skills, and Smart Hulk's introduction in Avengers: Endgame put an end to the Hulk's immense feats of power — but not before he proved that his body is still durable enough to withstand the power of all six Infinity Stones.\nJennifer Walters' first transformation into She-Hulk came with the reveal that she doesn't need to lose her calm in order to tap into her Gamma power. She-Hulk can take advantage of all of her abilities at any time, including super strength, super speed, a fast healing factor, and the Hulk's emblematic thunderclap. During her training with Smart Hulk, She-Hulk demonstrates her immense base-level strength by throwing Smart Hulk around and putting up a decent fight, yet it's obvious that Smart Hulk is holding back. However, this fight scene is only She-Hulk's first time getting to know her powers.\nRelated: She-Hulk Ending Explained (In Detail)\nShe-Hulk's following fights in She-Hulk: Attorney At Law don't require her to use her full strength. In fact, she walks right through most of them unharmed and mostly unbothered, with opponents like the Wrecking Crew, Leap-Frog's henchmen, and Marvel Studios' employees failing to land a single blow on her. As She-Hulk still lacks experience, she struggles to match Daredevil's agility, which leads her to resort to a thunderclap to stop him. However, more training and more demanding fights against stronger opponents could force She-Hulk to reach her full potential in a future Marvel Cinematic Universe movie or show.\nHulk, more specifically Bruce Banner's Savage Hulk persona, is undeniably the most powerful Hulk in the MCU, at least up until Phase 5. Not only is the original Hulk bigger, stronger, and more brutal, but he also has the advantage of being fueled by pure rage. Hulk feeds from Bruce Banner's repressed anger to power himself and recover from any injury, growing stronger in the process. Although clever opponents like Iron Man and Thanos have found ways to neutralize Hulk, Hulk still stands out as a highly adaptable character. Hulk's main weakness, if anything, is his will to fight, as his losses in Avengers: Age of Ultron and Avengers: Infinity War are influenced by his state of mind.\nRelated: Every Way The Original Hulk Can Return To The MCU\nShe-Hulk is also powerful, but apart from her lack of experience, she isn't interested in fighting. If she were, it's possible that all of her abilities would increase proportionally to her rage and energy. Given that Bruce Banner found a way to merge his human self with Hulk's persona, there could also be a way to unleash She-Hulk's full potential, possibly turning her into a monster as big and unstoppable as the original Savage Hulk. But while there's a precedent of such a transformation in Marvel Comics, the MCU's She-Hulk is highly unlikely to risk her human consciousness in order to pursue Hulk's full power.\n"}
{"title": "Godzilla's Name for King Kong Explains Why Their Battle Was Inevitable", "date": "2023-10-05 21:30:25", "text": "Godzilla vs Kong is an epic film with one of the best monster battles in history, & the reason why they fought was due to Godzilla's name for Kong. \nIt’s no secret that Godzilla and King Kong are rivals, as these Titans have faced off in not one, but two separate continuities, including and especially the most recent MonsterVerse film Godzilla vs Kong. While the visual spectacle of having these two behemoths battle it out on the big screen is reason enough to pit them against each other, there’s a far less meta purpose for their fight as well, and Godzilla’s name for King Kong explains exactly why their MonsterVerse battle was inevitable.\nIn the original 1962 film King Kong vs Godzilla, Kong was taken from his home and brought to Godzilla’s territory in order to fight the kaiju on behalf of humanity, despite the fact that the two monsters had never heard of each other before and had no reason to fight beyond proving which one was the strongest. There wasn’t much background or motivation for either Kong or Godzilla, but then again, there didn’t really need to be. Two iconic monsters (one more recognizable in Japan, the other an American classic) in a movie together, fighting to see who would win, is fun enough as it is. In the newly-established MonsterVerse films, however, Godzilla and Kong have a deep-seated rivalry that stretches back generations for both their species. That’s why Godzilla and Kong fought in 2021’s Godzilla vs Kong, and that’s why Godzilla had his own special name for Kong before the events of that movie even took place: the Rival.\nIn Godzilla: Dominion by Greg Keyes and Drew Johnson, readers are shown what Godzilla was doing before the events of Godzilla vs Kong following his narrow victory over King Ghidorah in Godzilla: King of the Monsters. The book gave fans a bit more insight into Godzilla’s thought process, as well as revealing another interesting ability movie fans didn’t know he had. Godzilla has the power to tap into the entire world, and feel things happening on the planet the same way one can feel something on their skin. This is how Godzilla knows when there is conflict, or when someone or something is overstepping their boundaries and needs to be put in place. More than that, though, Godzilla can constantly feel Kong’s challenging presence on his world, with every moment Kong continues to exist without recognizing his supremacy being like an itch Godzilla just can’t scratch.\nGodzilla’s species and Kong’s species used to live together in the Hollow Earth, where remnants of a great battle between them were discovered in Godzilla vs Kong (and where Kong got that sweet Godzilla-killing ax). It’s for this reason that Godzilla immediately recognizes Kong’s presence on Earth as that of his ultimate, instinctual rival, and why it was inevitable that the two would fight. Again, the issue here isn’t that Kong didn’t bow before Godzilla like the other Titans did in King of the Monsters, it’s that Kong is inherently a threat to Godzilla’s kingship. Add that to the fact that Godzilla can feel Kong’s every move with his planet-scoping power, and the ultimate battle between the two was completely unavoidable.\nThankfully, by the end of Godzilla vs Kong, the two were able to work out some sort of unspoken agreement that would allow both of them to exist on the same planet at the same time without further conflict. However, that initial conflict was necessary either way, regardless of the outcome, and Godzilla’s names for King Kong explains why.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

Prior to the Blumhouse slasher comedy, Khan had scored acclaim for her work as creator and showrunner of ABC's Fresh off the Boat and American Dad!, followed by her feature directorial debut with the Randall Park and Ali Wong-led Always Be My Maybe.\nKhan has assembled a star-studded roster for Totally Killer, including The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina alum Kiernan Shipka, Olivia Holt, Julie Bowen, Liana Liberato, Charlie Gillespie, and Randall Park. Khan's debut in the horror genre brings all of the sharp humor that has defined her work in the past while also delivering the shocking thrills expected of an entertaining slasher.\nRelated: New On Amazon Prime Video: All 138 Movies & TV Shows Arriving In October\nAhead of the movie's release, Screen Rant spoke exclusively with director Nahnatchka Khan to discuss making the jump from comedy to horror, her biggest goals for her on-set environment, and thoughts on a potential sequel.\nScreen Rant: I'm so excited to talk about Totally Killer. I've been a fan of your work since Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, and I loved what you did on Always Be My Maybe, which makes your transition towards horror with this film really intriguing. What about the script really sparked your interest to want to do that, even if it still has some comedy elements?\nNahnatchka Khan: Yeah, I'm a horror fan, just as a viewer and audience, I love the genre. So, after I did Always Be My Maybe, I kind of just sat down generally with Jason Blum and the team at Blumhouse, and I just was fanning out to them. I was like, \"I love what you guys do, and I'm a fan,\" and they were like, \"Let's figure something out. Let's do some sort of mash-up.\" So, we've been talking about it, and then they sent me Totally Killer, and usually when you get a script, it has the synopsis or whatever. But this had nothing, it was just a script, so I truly didn't know. I was like, \"It's coming from Blumhouse, so I know there's got to be some sort of horror thing,\" and so then, when I got locked into the premise, I was like, \"Oh my god, this is so much fun, I could have a ton of fun with this.\" It just made a lot of sense, and it was an exciting challenge.\nBlumhouse always has a horror edge to their stuff with Freaky with Happy Death Day, and this feels like it fits nicely in there. I said it before, but this is also a very funny movie, which is obviously in your wheelhouse. What was it like finding the right balance between the humor and some of the genuine slasher thrills?\nNahnatchka Khan: I think it was wanting to kind of lull you into this world, and not starting from too dark of a place, and then surprising you when it sort of takes a hard turn with that first kill sequence and being like, \"Oh, okay, we're going for it, we're not checking our swing here, there's a slasher on the loose, there's gonna be some gory kills and some gruesome moments.\" It's really just understanding that those two things can live together and can coexist, so always leading with comedy, I think, allows for the horror to shine. Like, those are not the comedy set pieces, right? It's around that, and then of course, the time travel element has to come into play as well, and get that in there.\nKiernan obviously has a history in horror, and you and Randall have a history together, but the rest of this ensemble around them is just incredible to watch. What was it like building this cast to really embody these characters?\nNahnatchka Khan: It was so fun. I mean, it was a challenge, because we obviously had people playing one role 35 years apart. So, starting with like Olivia Holt, who plays Kiernan's peer/young mother, she's amazing. The two of them together are just so much fun, and then getting Julie Bowen to play the older Olivia, they look like [each other], it feels like, \"Okay, that tracks.\" Then, building out the rest of the world and having these kids who were young adults now living and embodying these 1980s tropes, going back to the John Hughes era that they didn't live through, and kind of talking them through [it].\nThey have all the reference points, that was the thing that was really cool, too, about working with the cast is I came in armed with all these movies that I was going to have them watch to be prepared. Not only had they seen them, but they threw it back at me, and they were like, \"Have you seen this, this, that?\" I was like, \"No.\" So I left being like, \"Alright, let me go watch some of this stuff,\" because they are so aware, and so ready for the challenge, it was really fun.\nThat's awesome. Did you have a favorite of the movies that they gave you?\nNahnatchka Khan: There was some obscure '90s [movie], I gotta find the name of it, but it was something I'd never heard of before. It was like some, like, Brazilian movie — I'll find it, and I'll make sure it gets sent to you, because it was really amazing.\nDid you have the time to allow the actors to form a rapport with one another, especially with the adult and younger counterparts, to get the chance to join together and find the characters together?\nNahnatchka Khan: Definitely, as much as possible. When we were all on set together, we would have just actor meetings with the actors that were playing the same role, just so they can kind of get to know each other. So, Charlie Gillespie and Lochlyn Munro were together, Julie and Olivia. It was just a fun way to hang out, and kind of not mirror each other, but sort of see what the other one is doing. We had table reads, so everybody could get on the same page. Just wanted to keep it loose, so they can feel comfortable to bring their talent to it, and elevate it, and they really all stepped up. It was just such a fun challenge, and so great to watch them work.\nThis is a movie that, much like Happy Death Day, ends on a mostly conclusive note with maybe a hint or two that it could continue. Do you have any ideas about a possible sequel, or would you want to come back and continue this story?\nNahnatchka Khan: You know, it's funny, I think from like, day two of shooting, our DP, Judd Overton, kept saying every day, at the end of this movie, there's still a time travel device left in 1987, and we were like, \"That's true. That's true.\" So he's banging the drum that there could be a sequel where somebody from the '80s now comes to the present day, if they find that time machine, so you know, anything is possible.\n35 years after the shocking murder of three teens, the infamous “Sweet Sixteen Killer“ returns on Halloween night to claim a fourth victim. 17-year-old Jamie (Kiernan Shipka) ignores her overprotective mom’s (Julie Bowen) warning and comes face to face with the masked maniac and on the run for her life, accidentally time travels back to 1987, the year of the original killings. Forced to navigate the unfamiliar and outrageous culture of the 1980s, Jamie teams up with her teen mom (Olivia Holt) to take down the killer once and for all before she’s stuck in the past forever.\nCheck out our other interviews with:\nTotally Killer begins streaming on Prime Video on October 6.\nSource: Screen Rant Plus\n"}
{"title": "10 Best Thriller Movies On Amazon Prime Video", "date": "2023-10-05 21:20:17", "text": "For Amazon Prime Video subscribers, there are a number of excellent thriller movies to watch for a night of suspenseful and nail-biting viewing.\nFor Amazon Prime Video subscribers looking for a thriller movie, there are plenty of options on the platform. Thriller films can spread across different genres, from superhero films to horror to intense action movies. The primary purpose of the genre is to evoke heightened feelings of tension, anxiety, and anticipation while the film quickly builds toward its conclusion. Thriller movies are often filled with shocking plot twists that help the fast-paced narrative escalate toward a dramatic climax.\nPrime Video has a section for thriller films on the site, though there are a number of low-budget and mediocre offerings to weed through. The best thrillers to watch tend to include all-star casts and directors. However, a thriller film's script is often what makes or breaks it, as such stories tend to explore darker ideas about humanity that are meant to linger with the audience after the film's conclusion.\nBurning is a psychological thriller from South Korean writer and director Lee Chang-dong. The film follows a young man, Jong-su, who runs into his childhood friend, Hae-mi. Hae-mi introduces Jong-su to a mysterious man she's met named Ben, who Jong-su is suspicious of. This leads him to believe that his friend is in danger. Burning is engrossing and suspenseful, and it's filled with thematic depth for viewers to explore.\nDirected by Denis Villeneuve and written by Taylor Sheridan, Sicario is an excellent action/thriller film. The movie follows Emily Blunt as Kate Mercy, an FBI agent who's recruited to a team tasked with taking out a powerful cartel boss. The film is beautifully shot and well-written, as one would expect from the writer/director duo that made it happen. Sicario is a nerve-racking, action packed, and gritty thriller that builds its tension perfectly.\nSouth Korean cinema gained a ton of popularity from the 2019 film Parasite. There are a number of other great psychological thrillers to explore from South Korean directors, including Bong Joon-ho's other movies. Bong Joon-ho's Mother is the best example currently available to stream on Prime Video. The film tells the story of a widow who must clear her intellectually disabled adult son of a murder he's been accused of following a messy police investigation. Mother offers a tense murder mystery that fans of Parasite or Memories of Murder will surely enjoy.\nThe 2018 film Suspiria is a supernatural horror thriller inspired by the 1977 Italian film of the same name, directed by Luca Guadagnino (Call Me by Your Name). The film follows a young dancer from America who arrives in Berlin in the 1970s to audition for a renowned dance studio. As the narrative progresses, the young woman unearths sinister witchcraft activity. The film isn't as strong as the original, but it's still one of the best original horror movies on Prime Video. Suspiria is filled with suspense, and it also contains body horror that will freak its audience out.\nJoker is a comic book movie that's received acclaim for its dark, gritty character study. Inspired by Martin Scorsese films like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, Joker chronicles the deterioration of Arthur Fleck, an isolated man who feels rejected by society. As the film builds toward its climax, Fleck transitions further and further into becoming the Joker. Most of the praise for the film comes from the performance from Joaquin Phoenix, who captures the comic book character in a way that feels more realistic than previous variations.\nMost modern moviegoers know of Christopher Nolan and that he's capable of turning any genre or story into a sensory overloading, fast-paced, thrilling experience. His 2000 film Memento is perhaps the best bare-bones example of his style, crafting a simple story that is made complex by its scenes being displaced in time. The main character has short term memory loss, requiring him to utilize a system of notes and photographs to keep track of information as he seeks out revenge toward the men who murdered his wife. The film is complicated due to its narrative style, adding to the anticipation and its plot twists.\nRELATED: Memento Timeline & Ending Explained\nDirected by the great Sidney Lumet, Serpico is one of the earliest and best movies starring Al Pacino. While Pacino is known for playing mobsters, Serpico sees him on the other side of the law, playing a good cop in a New York City precinct full of bribery and corruption. The film depicts the true story of Frank Serpico, who was a whistleblower on police corruption in the '60s and '70s. The film is tense and gripping as obstacles build up in front of Serpico, who goes against the status quo and tries to oust the dirty cops.\nAnother comic book adaptation, The Batman is the first version of the character on the big screen to primarily focus on detective work, allowing the film to lean heavily into thriller elements. Directed by Matt Reeves, the movie sees Batman pursuing the Riddler, who's portrayed as a serial killer leaving behind clues. The film takes heavy inspiration from the mystery thrillers of David Fincher, such as Zodiac and Se7en, laying out clues and misdirection as Batman tracks down the Riddler and the motivations of the film's villains.\nChinatown is one of the greatest mystery movies ever made, and one of the best examples of the neo-noir genre. While the film isn't as fast-paced as many modern thrillers, its slower, contemplative burn allows for its script to fully take effect, maximizing the film's foreshadowing and plot twists. The conflict of Chinatown is relentless, constantly evolving as it transitions from a murder mystery to a grander story about politics and corruption. This is a film that will fill its audience with a sense of tension and dread, both as it develops and long after it ends.\nRELATED: Chinatown: 10 Reasons It's The Best Film Noir Movie Ever Made\nJordan Peele's latest film, Nope, was one of the best new releases of 2022, celebrated for Peele's usual mix of genres. Nope contains elements of sci-fi, comedy, and horror. The film follows a pair of siblings, played exceptionally by Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer, who discover what they believe to be a UFO above their horse ranch. Peele commonly subverts horror tropes, allowing his films to play out and build anticipation in ways that are unexpected, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats throughout. Nope is a must-watch thriller on Amazon Prime Video, especially for fans of thrilling narratives.\n"}
{"title": "7 Times Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny Changes History", "date": "2023-10-05 21:11:25", "text": "Indiana Jones has always played with real history, but the changes that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny makes could have huge ramifications.\nThe Indiana Jones franchise has always grappled with history, but Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny’s changes to real events take this to a new level. Set in 1969, the most recent and final addition to the Indiana Jones series sees the aging archaeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) going up against the Nazis once more, this time in pursuit of Archimedes’ antikythera. Dr. Jones and his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) go on a globe-trotting adventure to save the antikythera from the clutches of the Nazis — though they travel a little further than they intended.\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny's ending takes the characters to Syracuse in 212 BC, where Indy and Helena not only end up encountering the history they study face-to-face, but manage to change it as well. While some of Dial of Destiny’s historical changes are relatively benign, other alterations would have major ramifications on the course of history. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changes history seven times during its runtime, and each of these instances would affect real-world events in one way or another.\nEven before the time travel begins in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the titular archaeologist alters the course of history during a celebration of the 1969 moon landing. After a scuffle with the Nazis and Indy’s morally gray goddaughter Helena Shaw, Indy ends up getting framed for the murder of two of his colleagues at Hunter College. This forces him to flee the university to escape his adversaries and the police. Unfortunately for Indy, New York City’s moon landing parade is in full swing, so the chase sequence between him and the Nazis interrupts the event.\nWhile this chase resembles the usual Indiana Jones antics, this is a real event that Indiana Jones and the Nazis change through their presence. The parade that Indy upends is an actual parade that took place in August 1969, which honored the astronauts of the Apollo 11 moon landing. In real life, however, the Apollo 11 moon day parade was decidedly devoid of an aging archaeologist bursting through on horseback or a car full of Nazis chasing him. This makes the Moon Day parade an early example of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changing history.\nAfter Indy and the Nazis’ unintended involvement in the Moon Day parade, their changes to history get even more drastic. Toward the end of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Dr. Voller reveals that his plan for the antikythera is to go back in time to 1939 and kill Adolf Hitler to prevent him from losing World War II. However, his miscalculation results in the time fissure delivering their plane to the Siege of Syracuse, and the plane is soon shot down. Since the airplane wouldn’t be invented until 1903, a Nazi plane certainly wouldn’t have appeared in 212 BC, making this a big change to history.\nOne of the biggest ways that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changes history is by introducing Ancient Greek inventor Archimedes to the movie’s main characters, who hail from the modern era. After the Nazi plane crashes — with Indy and Helena escaping via parachute — the two archeologists encounter Archimedes. Getting the chance to meet a major historical figure like Archimedes is a huge moment for Indy personally, but it also alters history quite a bit.\nRELATED: Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny: 31 Easter Eggs & Hidden References\nArchimedes getting to meet the time-traveling Indy and Helena changes history in several ways during the Indiana Jones movie. Obviously, it’s highly unlikely that the real-life Archimedes ever encountered time travelers, which is a big alteration. Through meeting these time travelers, Archimedes is also introduced to several modern items and inventions he never would have encountered otherwise. Additionally, Indy and Helena both speak to Archimedes with a level of reverence that hints at his modern reputation, something Archimedes wouldn’t have known about. By meeting Indy and Helena, Archimedes would have gained an awareness of modern times he never would have in real life.\nOne interesting way that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changes history is in its depiction of the antikythera. In the fifth and final Indiana Jones movie, the antikythera is able to detect fissures in time. This allows the users to travel in time, although the Indiana Jones characters later discover that the antikythera only takes them to 212 BC. While this is an interesting function for the artifact to have, the real-life antikythera had a different function.\nRelated: How The Dial Of Destiny Works In Indiana Jones 5 (Explained With Real Science & Math)\nWhen the real-life antikythera was created, its intended use was not time travel. Rather, it was capable of performing complex astronomical calculations, making the antikythera the earliest known example of an analogue computer. This is an impressive feat in its own right, but it is a far cry from the time fissure-detection that the antikythera can do in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\nMeeting time travelers isn’t the only way that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny changes the life of Archimedes. In real life, Archimedes died during the Siege of Syracuse in 212 BC, where he was killed by a Roman soldier. However, the end of The Dial of Destiny shows that Archimedes is still in the process of creating the antikythera, and since Indy has a completed version of the invention, that means Archimedes has to live long enough to finish his version. Therefore, whether it was intentional or an unintended plot hole, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny extended Archimedes’ natural lifetime, thus changing history considerably.\nOne of the biggest historical changes that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny makes occurs when Indy and the Nazis interrupt the 212 BC Siege of Syracuse. When the modern characters arrive in Syracuse, the two opposing armies assume that their plane is a dragon, leading them to shift focus and shoot it down. Although it’s impossible to know everything that really happened at the Siege of Syracuse, it’s unlikely that this took place, so it’s a pretty significant divergence from the real battle. It’s also possible that Indy and the Nazis’ interruption is what prevented the Romans from killing Archimedes, which is another alteration.\nRELATED: How To Watch The Indiana Jones Movies In Order (Chronologically & By Release)\nThe appearance of time travelers during the Siege of Syracuse begets several historical changes in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, particularly when it comes to Archimedes encountering examples of modernity. When Archimedes finds the completed antikythera from the future, he also discovers a wristwatch that Dr. Voller was wearing when he died in the plane crash. Though Archimedes gives Indiana and Helena the completed antikythera back, he keeps the wristwatch.\nHaving modern technology in different time periods is always significant in time travel movies, as it marks a major deviation that could change real-life events. After all, Archimedes wouldn't have access to such technology without the time travel ofIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. The character getting a modern wristwatch could have huge ramifications for the course of history, especially since he's an inventor. It could mean other pieces of modern technology being created earlier, and it could also give certain nations advantages that weren't present in the prior timeline.\n"}
{"title": "Dark Side Ahsoka: Will Thrawn's Big Threat Come To Pass?", "date": "2023-10-05 21:01:38", "text": "In Ahsoka's finale, Grand Admiral Thrawn tries to use Ahsoka's relationship with Anakin against her – but he doesn't know just how much she's grown.\nWarning! This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nGrand Admiral Thrawn implied Ahsoka could one day turn to the dark side in the Ahsoka finale, but could that ever really come to pass? Though Ahsoka never dealt with Grand Admiral Thrawn in Star Wars Rebels, she’s been chasing after him since The Mandalorian season 2, hoping to prevent him returning to Star Wars’ prime galaxy and leading the Imperial Remnant’s resurgence. She knows why Thrawn is such a fearsome adversary, just as he understands how far she’s willing to go to stop him and how powerful she truly is. He knows all this because he used to know Ahsoka’s Jedi Master, Anakin Skywalker.\nThough Thrawn confirmed he knew Anakin in Ahsoka episode 8, “Part Eight: The Jedi, the Witch, and the Warlord,” the circumstances of their meeting happened off-screen in Timothy Zahn’s canon Star Wars novel Thrawn: Alliances. Near the tail end of the Clone Wars, Thrawn and Anakin met on the planet Batuu while both were on unsanctioned missions. Thrawn was seeking information about potential allies and new technologies as a Captain of the Chiss Ascendancy, and Anakin was there to rescue his wife, Padmé Amidala. They agreed to help one another, and during their time together, Thrawn witnessed Anakin’s power and unconventional methods first-hand. Later, he was also one of the few to know of Darth Vader’s real identity, a fact which he has now weaponized to taunt Ahsoka.\nAs Ahsoka and Sabine race to catch up to Thrawn’s Star Destroyer in the Ahsoka finale, Thrawn decides to revel in his victory and opens a channel with their ship just before making the jump to hyperspace. It is during this conversation that Thrawn reveals he knew Anakin Skywalker and was aware of Darth Vader’s true identity. He says: “I know you because I knew your master. I concluded your strategies would be similar. One wonders… just how similar you might become.” The underlying threat of Thrawn’s implication is clear – he believes Ahsoka could still follow in her master’s footsteps and fall to the dark side, and that had always been one of Ahsoka’s greatest fears.\nRelated: When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline\nShe believed she abandoned Anakin when she left the Jedi Order at the end of Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 5, forcing him on a path to darkness. Ever since, she’s lamented her time with the Order, reflecting on how, instead of being taught to become a peacekeeper, she’d only ever fought in a war, being made responsible for battles and bloodshed when she was just a teenager. How could she not fear becoming someone as terrifying as Vader, when Anakin Skywalker, one of the bravest and most powerful Jedi the Order had ever known, fell victim to the temptations of the dark side as well? How could she not be afraid to fall to the dark side herself, when all she’d ever experienced as a child was violence during the Clone Wars, betrayal by those she trusted the most, and grief for her friends?\nDespite the Ahsoka show’s focus on Thrawn’s return to Star Wars’ main galaxy, it also explores Ahsoka’s growth as a character. Ahsoka episode 5, “Shadow Warrior,” sees Ahsoka confronted with her past, her relationship with Anakin, and her greatest fears whilst in the World Between Worlds. Ahsoka has long been held back by her past and her legacy – since learning of Vader’s true identity in Star Wars Rebels season 2, she’s been running from her past, abandoning meaningful connections like the one with her own Padawan Sabine Wren in favor of hunting the galaxy for threats in a misguided attempt to atone for her imagined sins.\nIn the World Between Worlds, however, Ahsoka is given the opportunity to examine how her past has affected her. She sees the battles she was forced to fight as a child, the way she grew and learned under Anakin’s tutelage, and learns that she is capable of being more than what she was trained for. Anakin, and the Order by extension, trained her to be a warrior, yes – but Ahsoka discovered her capacity for empathy and kindness on her own. Her final lesson with Anakin taught her that while her past is an important part of who she is, she has the power to change her future.\nAhsoka now knows that she is more than just Anakin’s Padawan. Instead of choosing to kill him in the World Between Worlds, she chose to live and honor his teachings instead. Her experiences in Ahsoka episode 5 changed her forever. Now, she’s “Ahsoka the White,” no longer burdened by her past but rather accepting of it. She understands that Anakin’s fall to the dark side was a consequence of his own choices, just as much as it was Palpatine’s will. She is not her master, and as such, can make her own choices as she embraces becoming a beacon of light in the galaxy rather than being self-destructive.\nOne of the reasons Thrawn is such a threatening adversary is because he is willing to take the time to get under his enemies’ skin. He learns about their history and their relationships, using that knowledge to knock them down and shake their confidence. He’s done this time and time again – for instance, in Star Wars Rebels, he meticulously studied Twi’lek culture to rip apart their rebellion on the planet Ryloth. Thrawn is an Imperial Officer who uses more than just the Empire’s brute force to overcome his enemies; he messes with their minds as well, playing games and using their biggest fears against them.\nRelated: Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know\nThis is exactly what he hopes to achieve by taunting Ahsoka with Anakin’s tragic fate. He wants to shake her confidence because he knows that, should she make it back to Star Wars’ primary galaxy alive, she’ll be one of his most difficult opponents. Thrawn doesn’t like to take chances; any advantage he can find, he’ll utilize, and knowing about Anakin’s fate is certainly an important piece of information to have in his arsenal. Despite Anakin having been redeemed by Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi, Thrawn could still do a lot of damage with the knowledge of Vader’s true identity as the Imperial Remnant tries to expand its foothold in the galaxy. After the Ahsoka finale, Thrawn has proven himself to be as cunning and terrifying as ever.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "Bridgerton Season 3: Release Date Prediction, Cast Changes & Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-05 21:00:28", "text": "Bridgerton season 3 is coming to Netflix. Here are the latest updates, its story details, who it'll focus on and how Queen Charlotte sets it up.\nBridgerton season 3 was confirmed several years ago, but the release date could finally be on the horizon for the Bridgerton sibling's return to Netflix. Season 1 adapted Julia Quinn's novel The Duke and I, telling the tale of Daphne Bridgerton and Simon Basset's romance. Despite being such a success with audiences, that was put on the back burner in season 2 — which doesn't feature Simon at all, although he is name-dropped occasionally — and adapts the second Bridgerton novel The Viscount Who Loved Me, focusing on Anthony Bridgerton and Kate Sharma's enemies-to-lovers storyline.\nInstead of adapting Benedict Bridgerton's story, An Offer From A Gentleman, for Bridgerton season 3, the Netflix show is making a huge switch-up and changing the order. Bridgerton season 3 will cover the fourth Bridgerton novel, Romancing Mister Bridgerton, and even then is making several alterations (as it did for seasons 1 and 2). Production on Bridgerton season 3 is already underway, and a release date announcement feels closer every day, with the added bonus of Bridgerton spin-off Queen Charlotte setting up the third mainline series in a surprising way.\nThere has been surprisingly little news on Bridgerton season 3 outside the occasional tease from cast members since filming wrapped in March 2023. However, this is likely due to both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. While production is reportedly more-or-less complete on the next season, the strike conditions also prohibit the cast from promoting their work in all but a very limited capacity.\nHowever, Bridgerton was expected to arrive in 2023 by many, so the lack of promotion for the show from Netflix by September is worrying. There's increasing concern that, due to the strikes and Netflix wanting to be able to promote it properly, the next season of Bridgerton could be delayed until 2024. However, a leaked report in August suggested the Bridgerton season 3 release date could be as soon as December 14, 2023 (via CBR). \nIt should be noted though that this date was only rumored, and since it's only a few months away the lack of promotion from Netflix doesn't seem to correlate — especially given both the popularity of the show and how long it's been since the next season of Bridgerton was confirmed in 2021.\nBridgerton season 3 is officially happening on Netflix, with the show's renewal confirmed in 2021 (via Deadline). What's more, the streamer confirmed a fourth season would also follow. Author Julia Quinn wrote eight Bridgerton books in total, one focusing on each sibling, and the hope is that each book will be adapted into a different season for TV. It's likely that Netflix will continue with the show long into the future should interest remain high.\nAt the time of writing, Bridgerton season 3's release date has not been confirmed. Bridgerton season 1 was released in December 2020, and season 2 was released in March 2022 following multiple delays due to COVID-19. The WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes assured that any production and development remaining which required an actor or writer couldn't continue throughout most of 2023, too — although filming was wrapped in March. The Bridgerton season 3 release date will likely arrive in 2024, although until Netflix confirms anything it's impossible to say with certainty.\nBridgerton season 3's cast will include most of the Bridgerton family: Jonathan Bailey as Anthony; Ruth Gemmell as Violet; Claudia Jessie as Eloise; Luke Thompson as Benedict; Luke Newton as Colin; Will Tilston as Gregory; and Florence Hunt as Hyacinth. Nicola Coughlan will, of course, be back as Penelope Featherington as the focal character of the season. The Bridgerton season 3 cast is likely to feature many other returning faces, including:\nPhoebe Dynevor's Daphne Bridgerton will not return. Dynevor did keep the door open to return in later seasons, but she will not be around in Bridgerton season 3. Some of Bridgerton's second-season cast additions, including Rupert Young as Jack Featherington and Calam Young as Theo Sharpe, are perhaps less likely to return since their stories are seemingly wrapped up.\nThere is one major casting change for Bridgerton season 3. Ruby Stokes is no longer playing younger sister Francesca Bridgerton. Stokes landed a starring role on Netflix’s Lockwood & Company, which conflicted with her recurring status in Bridgerton. Replacing her as Francesca is Hannah Dodd who recently appeared in Enola Holmes 2, also for Netflix, as Sarah Chapman. Black Sails actress Hannah New joins the series as Lady Tilley Arnold, a young widow. Daniel Francis, James Phoon, and Sam Phillips have also all joined the show for season 3.\nRelated: Bridgerton: 14 Movies & TV Shows That Feature The Cast\nMany expected the Bridgerton Netflix series to follow the order of the books, as the Bridgerton novels also begin with Daphne and Anthony’s stories. There’s been a change to the lineup, however. Instead of focusing on Benedict for Bridgerton season 3, the Netflix show will focus on Colin and Penelope. Colin and Penelope’s story makes up the fourth book in the series, Romancing Mister Bridgerton — albeit with some differences in the plot for Bridgerton season 3.\nFollowing the surprising events of Bridgerton season 2, Penelope decides that she needs to look for a husband that will allow her to get out of her mother’s house and still live her double life as Penelope and Lady Whistledown, but she doesn’t have the same level of confidence that other debutantes do. Colin, who misses Penelope’s company when she starts to ignore him at social events, offers to help her land a husband. According to Netflix’s official summary, Colin’s plan to help Penelope gain confidence might “work a little too well.”\nIn addition to Colin and Penelope’s love story unfolding, Eloise will also share some of the spotlight in the Bridgerton season 3 story. After discovering that Penelope is Lady Whistledown, Eloise wants nothing to do with her former best friend. That leaves her forging new relationships while still being present for the parties of the season.\nNicola Coughlan, who plays Penelope Featherington, teased that season 3 will be \"extremely spicy.\" (via Collider). Coughlan explained \"I mean Lady Whistledown is right at the center having to deal with all her little secrets and it gets harder and harder for those to come out and then scandalous love affairs popping up all over the place. [It's] the most scandalous one yet, I would say.\"\nBeyond the established Bridgerton sibling storylines from Bridgerton season 2, spin-off Queen Charlotte throws in the seed of a substantial storyline for Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell). She plays an important role in Queen Charlotte, playing part of the triptych of \"widows\" (including Charlotte herself who awaits King George's death), each representing different types of grief. She loved her husband dearly, and still mourns him, but begins to realize in Queen Charlotte that she may be ready to enjoy herself once more — to \"allow her garden to bloom\" again, as the show delightfully puts it.\nWhile it feels unlikely that Violet will remarry in Bridgerton season 3, there is the possibility of courtship and perhaps some liberated sexual activity to throw further scandal under the belly of the ton. And the unexpected source of that scandal, Violet, would make for a wonderfully entertaining new dynamic.\n\n"}

The 2023 horror movie is a direct sequel to the original 1973 movie that does not connect to any of the previous sequels or prequels. The Exorcist: Believer continues the story nearly 50 years after Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) and her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) encountered a demon. The sequel sees Chris recruited by Victor Fielding (Leslie Odom Jr.) to help free two young girls from demonic possession.\nIn addition to being a sequel to The Exorcist, the new entry is planned to be the first installment of a new trilogy of movies. This means that by the time that The Exorcist: Believer's ending comes to a close, some clues about where the franchise is going next have been revealed. One of the most common tactics studios use to set up future movies that have already been announced is to include mid-credits or after-credits scenes.

The movie does not include any additional scenes or teases at any point during the credits, meaning audiences will not see a mid-credits scene or end-credits scene in tehaters or when The Exorcist: Believer releases on streaming. Not including the tag is surprising considering The Exorcist: Deceiver has already been announced. While audiences do not need to wait for an after-credits scene now, sitting through the credits still is a great way to show respect for the writers, actors, and other people who made The Exorcist: Believer.\nBy not including an after-credits scene with The Exorcist: Believer, Universal and director David Gordon Green have taken the safer approach to building out the franchise. There have already been announcements for two more movies, but details on The Exorcist: Deceiver and the untitled third installment are still largely under wraps. The 2023 horror movie not having a post-credits scene means that the franchise can evolve naturally and make corrections based on The Exorcist: Believer's reception from critics and audiences. This also prevents the franchise from being written into a corner or potentially ignoring the tease altogether.\nJust because there is no post-credits scene after The Exorcist: Believer, that does not mean audiences will leave the movie without any indication on where the franchise is going. The final moments of the movie does help provide some insight into what could come next for the main characters. It is through this ending that a rough blueprint for how the trilogy will unfold comes to light. An end-credits scene after The Exorcist: Believer could have been redundant in this case, so it works better that the movie does not have one.\n"}
{"title": "Peanuts: 10 Best Peppermint Patty and Marcie Moments", "date": "2023-10-05 21:00:27", "text": "These best buds could not be more opposite, but Peppermint Patty and Marcie have some hilarious best-friend moments in these Peanuts strips.\nMarcie and Peppermint Patty became a dynamic duo in 1971, as Marcie made her Peanuts debut when the pair were seen at camp together. However, Marcie did not originally have a name, and she didn't receive one until some time later. The two didn't form the warmest bond right away, with Peppermint Patty calling Marcie a dork shortly after meeting. Regardless, they end up sharing a close friendship that configures Marcie as Peppermint Patty's sidekick and best friend.\nPeppermint Patty and Marcie offer very different personalties, making them an example of the tried and true comic trope of the big personality and the straight man, respectively. Positioning Peppermint Patty, who is outgoing, sporty, and extroverted, as a foil to the bookish and sweet Marcie provides endless funny situations for the girls to share — and for their fans to experience. They may be very different people, but one thing they have in common is their loyalty and devoted friendship. Here are 10 moments that celebrate their iconic friendship.\nRelated: 10 Funniest Peanuts Comics Starring Lucy\nMarcie is not the best at sports, as this strip clearly points out. She stands in stark contrast to the athletic, sports-loving Peppermint Patty. Marcie is very smart about a number of subjects, but sports is not one of them. Peppermint Patty, being the helpful pal that she is, tries to teach Marcie how to kick a ball. Things don't go as Patty planned and Marcie finds her own way of playing.\nFinding the humor in everything thanks to her good nature, Marcie finds her clumsy attempt at sports funny. Based on Patty's unsettled expression, the audience can guess that she does feel the same.\nMarcie loves school. On the other hand, Peppermint Patty does not. In fact, she hates school, and she is exceptionally lazy when it comes to her education. In Peanuts, it's been established that Patty frequently sleeps during class, which has been attributed to her dad coming home late from work and Patty waiting up for him. Regardless, Patty's attitude towards school is the polar opposite to Marcie's; Marcie is high achieving and loves to learn.\nWhen Marcie has to go to the principal's office, she claims innocence, only for Patty to reply that sleeping during class ensures not getting in trouble. It often annoys Marcie that Patty doesn't try very hard at school, so it seems unlikely that Marcie will take her friend's words seriously.\nA sports fanatic Marcie is not. Although, there is one sports superstar that Marcie is well aware of and is an active fan of: tennis player Billie Jean King. The former worldwide number-one tennis player, King is often referred to as one of the best tennis players of all time. She is also an advocate for women in sports and LGBTQ+ rights.\nA major tennis star in the '60s and '70s, King's popularity in the era's zeitgeist was immense, making her way into the Peanuts comics strip. Marcie and Peppermint Patty are huge fans of King, with Patty even threatening to never introduce her to the tennis star if she doesn't help Patty with women in sports. Too bad for Patty, Marcie pokes holes in her threats, leaving Patty desperate for a change of topic — even if from the teacher.\nAll best friends look out for each other, including by giving some much-needed style advice. As readers of the Peanuts strip know, Marcie's eyes are almost always obscured by her glasses. In this strip, Peppermint Patty thinks Marcie's eyes deserve to be seen and that putting her glasses on her head will make her look sophisticated.\nUnfortunately for Marcie, she needs those glasses on her eyes to see, sophisticated or not. What ensues is unsurprising; Marcie takes her glasses off and moments later walks directly into a tree. As helpful as Patty tries to be, she's better off sticking to sports tips than fashion advice.\nSports-challenged Marcie may not be a jock like Peppermint Patty, but there is one major exception: hockey. Marcie's grandfather plays in a hockey league, and, as noted in the strip, she and her father go to hockey games. While hockey is one of the very few sports Marcie is somewhat familiar with, she is still pretty clueless about some basic parts of the game. For instance, she thinks a hockey rink is called a hockey court.\nCorrecting her friend, Patty tells her it's a rink only for Marcie to get mixed up even further and call a basketball court a basketball rink. Marcie may excel at many subjects and even different languages, but she cannot seem to get a grasp on sports — something that is endlessly frustrating to Patty.\nMarcie and Peppermint Patty have one of the best friendships in the entirety of the Peanuts strip. They are endlessly loyal to each other and are always each other's first pick for everything. As tight-knit as the pair are, they are complete inverses to each other when it comes to sports. There is the all around athletic, competitive Patty who differs greatly from Marcy, whose vast knowledge does not extend to sports.\nWhen asked by Patty to fetch her a driver and ball, Marcy gives her a driver with no hesitation or issue. However, when it comes to which ball to give her friend, Marcie stumbles hard and hands her a soccer ball instead of a golf ball.\nA bookworm of the highest order, Marcie loves to read and learn, which could not be in more opposition to Peppermint Patty. Marcie can speak French fluently and is well-read on many subjects... except for sports. Apparently, the little intellectual is also knowledgeable about the Book of Proverbs, reciting one to a perplexed Patty.\nThe ancient writing of the Book of Proverbs would be hard for most adults to grasp, let alone a child. As a result, it's not hard to blame Peppermint Patty for having no clue what she's repeating. Patty is lucky to have a best bud like Marcie who can always help her out when she's in some academic jam.\nMarcie may be sweet and unassuming, but that doesn't mean that she isn't immune to fighting with her best friend. With two pals who spend as much time together as these, it's only natural for them to clash from time to time, as evident in this strip. When Marcie questions if Patty didn't do her homework yet again, Peppermint Patty gets defensive and complains about being called \"sir.\"\nNot one to back down, Marcie intentionally calls her \"sir\" over and over until Peppermint Patty can take no more and hits her friend on the head with a book. Some hair pulling ensues and the two girls are sent to the principal's office. Marcie, instead of acting like any normal kid would in the situation, feels elated after the fight and shows no trepidation about seeing the principal, much to Peppermint Patty's annoyance and confusion.\nPeppermint Patty is ready for a sports game or a scrimmage at any time. Patty is also one to stand up for herself and others. When a peer makes fun of Patty by making a cruel joke about graduating from dog obedience school, which she was told to attend by Snoopy, Patty does not take kindly to it.\nShe delivers a line that would be just as fitting in an Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie and bops the kid right on the nose. Marcie is very impressed and voices her admiration. Although, she should be careful to not call Patty \"sir\" at the moment in case she gets a bonk on the head, too.\nPeppermint Patty is very particular about her appearance and what she likes to wear. In one show of activism, Patty fights against the school board and hires Snoopy as her attorney after her school requires her to wear a dress for the new dress code. Therefore, Patty will stick to her guns about what is right and fair, including when it regards clothing.\nPatty is not immune to mixing things up, though. When she is competing in a skating competition, she is prepared to dress the part, hairstyle included. For the competition, she wants a new hairdo and asks Marcie for help. She should've kept looking, because Marcie comes up with a style that is not the most flattering, requiring the iconic Peanuts duo to go back to the drawing board.\n"}
{"title": "Walking Dead Writer Admits One Sexist Moment Is Still 'Cringe-Worthy'", "date": "2023-10-05 20:45:12", "text": "Creator and writer of The Walking Dead Robert Kirkman acknowledges a sexist scene in the original series, and one he would change if written today.\nRobert Kirkman's The Walking Dead is a landmark series in the apocalypse genre, as a story not only about zombies, but human survival in the face of impossible odds. It's also a story that's been criticized for its depiction of women--and even Kirkman admits that there is one particular moment in the series he still finds \"cringe-worthy.\"\nThe Walking Dead Deluxe is a re-release of the original Walking Dead series, first published in 2004, with never before seen content and valuable creator commentary providing insight into a few of author Robert Kirkman's character decisions. This glimpse into Kirkman's creative process, specifically his decision-making when it comes to writing female characters, highlights one scene in need of revisiting.\nThe scene in question arrives in The Walked Dead #3, in which two of the three women excitedly discuss laundry detergent on their way to washing the survivors' clothes. Donna angrily points out the disparity in the men hunting and women cleaning, with Lori Grimes dismissing the sexism, and excusing it as \"being realistic.\" \nRelated: Walking Dead: Carl Losing His Eye Foreshadows His Tragic Future\nIn Walking Dead Deluxe #3, Kirkman notes this scene as \"cringe-worthy,\" explaining he would make different decisions today (intending to give the women the maximum amount of space to grow as the story progressed). These interpersonal interactions do indeed evolve some of these people into hardened and lethal survivors, eventually joining Michonne's level. Regardless of Kirkman's authorial intent the scene in both the comic series and the TV show caused backlash.\n\"Did I need a full page of the female characters talking about doing laundry while the men hunted? Probably not....I was going to take the female characters in some interesting directions as the series progressed. So starting them here would give me a lot of room to grow and evolve along the way. Anyway I was 23 when I started writing this comic so this is definitely not the last cringe-worthy thing (for me at least) that I wrote into this book. I'd have handled things a little differently had I written it today. I'd have maybe had Allen or Jim help with the laundry.\"\nBecause Walking Dead has so much exposure in the cultural zeitgeist, it means the more questionable scenes are open to critiques from the fans, a fact Kirkman acknowledges. To many fans the scene demonstrates that even in a zombie apocalypse the patriarchal structure endures. Kirkman has said in the past that he's not a political writer and doesn't want his work to be read as such, but he also understands that because of the platform he's been given with Walking Dead, people are going to read what they want into it. Understandably, some fans might find this scene hard to enjoy due to its parallels to the non-zombified reality, where, with a few exceptions, men are in charge of almost every group, faction, colony or community and women get few moments to shine in grisly combat.\nIt's clear that the scene in question was meant to be a commentary on the state of society, both in the world of The Walking Dead and our own. Whether or not it was in good taste has typically been up to the fans to decide. It wasn't until Robert Kirkman's creative commentary in the Walking Dead Deluxe #3 that there was a confirmation on his own gendered bias, calling the scene \"cringe-worthy.\" This isn't the only instance of Kirkman's personal feelings featured in the series, but it is one of the first times he's acknowledged the faults of an early creative decision.\nThe Walking Dead Deluxe is available now from Skybound wherever comic books are sold.\nNext: Walking Dead's 'Don't Dead Open Inside' Originally Had a Different Purpose\nEmily Stachelczyk is a Comics News writer for Screen Rant. Ever since she accidentally read Joss Wheddon's Astonishing X-Men in middle school she's loved dissecting comic books ever since. Although her career is in SEO project management, Emily loves to write about all things comics and Marvel.

{"title": "Pet Sematary: Bloodlines Review - A Bland Prequel Despite An Intriguing Premise", "date": "2023-10-05 20:41:17", "text": "The film will resonate with the people eager to devour more Stephen King-inspired projects; sadly, there is nothing genuinely inspired to enjoy.\nIn 2019, the Pet Sematary remake was released. Directed by Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer and written by Jeff Buhler, the remake revisited the Creed family with a few minor tweaks that ultimately did not stray too far away from the original plot of the 1989 film. The consensus was that while the film had an updated look, the resurrected story offered very little. Pet Sematary: Bloodlines, a direct prequel to the novel and the 2019 film, follows young Jud Crandall as he discovers the cemetery where the dead don’t stay dead 50 years before meeting the Creeds.\nThe one aspect that seems to indicate the underlying intentions of Pet Sematary: Bloodlines' existence is the attempt to rectify the simplistic explanation of the burial ground that reanimates dead people and animals. There is an attempt to flesh out the history of the damned burial site, but the film doesn’t fully reckon with the reality that Stephen King and plenty of other horror writers rely on the audience's willful ignorance to explain away any spooky thing as being a byproduct of Indigenous peoples' history and culture.\nThere is a point where a case could be made for a Prey-esque prequel that solely revolves around the perspectives of the Mi’kmaq tribe, whose lands were invaded by the Europeans who would build Ludlow. There is a story to be told of how this burial ground came to be a source of terror for the town's residents. Instead, the film splits its attention, giving focus to the story of Jud Crandall, a character who didn't need to be explained or understood. At the same time, the general explanation of the “pet sematary” history is a protracted flashback.\nPrequels are a reality we cannot overcome. Still, there is a sad expectation that we are somehow incapable of inferring a character's past without being explicitly told in detail all that happened before the start of a story. Somehow, filmmakers (and audiences, as a result) can't accept that a story may have many other beginnings. It is one thing to have a prequel that expands our knowledge of the dynamics and world that made the story we enjoyed so intriguing, but it's an entirely different thing to focus on an inconsequential character. Jud Crandall was an interesting character with a history connected to the supernatural burial ground that predates Louis Creed and his family. But what exactly is there to learn or experience that makes Crandall’s story worth exploring in the first place? That question often goes unanswered with many unwarranted prequels, and Pet Sematary: Bloodlines fails to raise any compelling points.\nScreenwriters Jeff Buhler and Lindsey Anderson Beer, who also directed, do their best with what they have, but Buhler’s previous writing efforts on Pet Sematary didn’t manage to elevate the source material impressively, and there is nothing much to speak of for Bloodlines, either. The scares are palpable; Beer does a good job crafting an unsettling horror that has the right amount of gore and creepy ambiance. The cast is effective in their respective roles, but Forrest Goodluck and Isabella Star LaBlanc are underserved as they could easily have carried the entire film. Pam Grier is always a delight to see, but her talents are not utilized as well as they could have been. The story never manages to be as lively as it needs to be to justify its existence, but the cast attempts to make up for that with committed performances. Sadly, the film is rather dull, lacking in genuine suspense or intrigue.\nDespite some good instincts from Beer, the material is too constricting, denying the director the chance to expand her ideas or take turns that might alienate fans expecting a movie that answers questions no one was really asking. Mythology is certainly fascinating to explore when it comes to established horror that begins with an inexplicable idea, but there is hardly anything worth digging up here. In addition to the bland story, the film isn’t all too impressive to watch. There is a flatness to the cinematography, which is unfortunate considering Benjamin Kirk Nielsen has recently done great work. Tonally, the film is a tad bit gratifying for fans of King and his atmospheric horror. The darkness permeating over these characters and town is effectively realized, and the frights are effective.\nPet Sematary: Bloodlines is mercifully shorter than the 2019 film, but it still needed trimming. There have been worse straight-to-streaming horror films, and Pet Sematary: Bloodlines is hardly the worst among them. Memorable? Hardly. Entertaining? Somewhat. Ultimately, the film will resonate with the people eager to devour more Stephen King-inspired projects; sadly, there is nothing genuinely inspired to enjoy.\nPet Sematary: Bloodlines begins streaming on Paramount+ Friday, October 6. The film is 84 minutes long and rated R for horror violence, gore and language.\nFerdosa (she/her) is a lifelong student of cinema. She dreams of being a film festival programmer and is working her way towards that goal by consuming a concerning number of films every week."}
{"title": "Kody Proves He’s Moving On From Plural Marriage By Making Major Change", "date": "2023-10-05 20:41:05", "text": "Kody Brown is moving on from his polygamous past. The Sister Wives star embraces his new monogamous life with Robyn Brown by taking a huge step.\nKody Brown from Sister Wives replaced his Claddagh ring with a new one, showing he’s confident about moving away from polygamy. The 54-year-old Brown family patriarch married four women in the last three decades, hoping to build one big family. However, he couldn’t sustain them forever and eventually fell into a monogamous relationship with his youngest wife, Robyn Brown. During Sister Wives season 18, Kody split up from Janelle Brown a year after losing Christine Brown. Kody also ended things with Meri Brown, for whom he felt no love over the last few years.\nET recently shared a preview clip from Sister Wives season 18, which shows Kody confidently flashing his new symbol of monogamy. The reality star is sitting across from his former wife Meri and his current (and only) wife Robyn. As Meri speaks to them about her plans to move away, she spots a new ring on her former husband’s hand and points it out.\nShe says, “Sorry, I am distracted by your ring. That’s a different ring.” While Kody laughs it off and says it was just a “ring,” Meri reminds the cameras that he used to wear another one. She notes, “I did notice that it was replacing the Claddagh ring we all used to wear together.”\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\n\nMeri is shocked to see the change but isn't bothered about it. She is confused about why Kody was smirking about the ring and making things awkward at the table. The 52-year-old Sister Wives star tells the cameras, “It’s weird that he is being so awkward about it. Like, if he doesn’t want me to see the ring, don’t wear it to my house.” Kody simply chuckles during the clip, like a kid who gets caught stealing cookies. However, Meri isn't impressed by his behavior. She adds, “I have no idea what this ring is or where it came from.” Meri claims she doesn't care where the ring came from.\nIt’s clear why Meri was surprised to see Kody’s new ring. The Sister Wives cast member was Kody’s first wife and had been with him for years. She assumed he would never change the Claddagh ring representing their polygamous relationship. However, Kody did the unthinkable by replacing the symbol of plural marriage. One possible reason for this change could be his newfound monogamous relationship with Robyn. Kody is no longer with Christine, Janelle, or Meri. Therefore, he has no reason to wear the Claddagh ring, as it doesn’t represent anything meaningful to him.\nWhile Meri claimed she wasn’t jealous or cared about Kody’s new piece of jewelry, she certainly seemed bothered by it. It’s clear that she was shocked by the change, but she shouldn’t have pointed it out. She should have known that her relationship with Kody wasn’t the same as it was years ago. Meri and Kody’s relationship went downhill after Meri fell for a catfish online. She stepped out of the marriage by committing emotional infidelity. If the Sister Wives star had been faithful to the rules of her marriage, Kody might still be with her as her husband.\nSister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT on TLC.\nSource: ET/YouTube\n"}
{"title": "“Choose Nepotism”: Trainspotting Parody Video Retargets Opening Satire To Perfection", "date": "2023-10-05 20:34:39", "text": "UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak chooses nepotism in a Trainspotting parody that targets the iconic opening satire of the government's scandals.\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and other politicians appear in a Trainspotting parody that retargets the movie's iconic opening satire to perfection. Danny Boyle's 1996 adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel followed a group of misfits in Edinburgh played by Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremmer, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, Peter McKullan, and Robert Carlyle. Trainspotting is celebrated for its glimpse at substance addiction in the youth subculture, with the movie also launching McGregor and Boyle into widespread recognition.\nFollowing recent policy announcements made during the UK Conservative Party Conference that included the scrapping of the high-speed railway construction project HS2, PoliticsJOE has taken inspiration from the controversial decision and reimagined Trainspotting's recognizable opening sequences with Sunak and former Conservative Prime Ministers Liz Truss, Boris Johnson, Theresa May, and David Cameron in \"Trainstopping.\"\nIn Sunak's new monologue, the current Prime Minister looks back on his own tenure full of inconsistent policies and lobbying accusations, alongside other recent controversies, including Truss's short tenure, Johnson's neglectful mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic, May's handling of the Windrush Scandal, and Cameron's Black Mirror-Esque Pig scandal. Other key UK political figures, including RMT Union Leader Mick Lynch and former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, are also imposed into the opening, having to endure the group's antics.\nPoliticsJOE's history of biting political pop culture mashups extends far beyond their recent Trainspotting parody. The channel has approached major political events with many parodies of iconic songs and television shows. From imagining Johnson's chaotic resignation as Goodfellas' \"Meet the Crew\" monologue, placing Sunak's rise to Prime Minister into the opening of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and current Labour leader Keir Starmer's ever-changing stances as The Jungle Book's \"I Want To Be Like You,\" the YouTube channel has provided humorous videos that capture ongoing issues affecting both the UK and the world.\nHowever, what makes PoliticsJOE's newest parody stand out is how \"Trainstopping\" looks compared to the original Trainspotting monologue. The fast-paced nature perfectly encapsulates the chaotic changes brought through the current Conservative government since 2010. Sunak's reimagined dialogue lists what the UK political landscape has become, similar to how Renton's (McGregor) original monologue is about how he views ordinary life. Furthermore, it concludes with Renton (McGregor) stating he chooses to take heroin, as Sunak's dialogue states how the Prime Minister framed himself as cleaning up his party's many controversies but instead chose to let them persist.\nPoliticsJOE's Trainspotting parody is a darkly comedic encapsulation of the UK's current state. Not only is the title a fun play on the Conservative Party's derided HS2 choice, but Sunak's monologue features a wide range of biting jabs at the government's tenure dating back to Cameron's election. As such, \"Trainstopping\" is a quick, memorable remix of Boyle's iconic sequence that entertains and informs viewers.\nSource: PoliticsJOE\n"}
{"title": "16 Biggest Changes Twilight's Movies Made To The Books", "date": "2023-10-05 20:31:27", "text": "The Twilight Saga brought Edward and Bella's story to life, but for that, it made a lot of changes to the books – some good and others not so much.\nThe Twilight Saga brought Stephenie Meyer's novel series to life, but turning a book into a movie is always hard work, and the movies made many changes to the books. With the series spanning four lengthy books, there's a lot of ground to cover in the world of Twilight, so it's not surprising that the writers and directors of the Twilight Saga had to change some things from the novels or completely leave plot points out.\nAlthough the Twilight movies were mostly loyal to the source material, which was key to their success with fans of the books, it also made some changes that weren’t well-received. The Twilight Saga either changed how some key scenes happened, left important information and context out, or completely skipped some scenes due to time constraints. Because of this, there are a couple of moments in the Twilight Saga that are better explained or developed in the Twilight books and which could have improved the movies, while others are exclusive to the movies and actually benefited them.\nRelated: Twilight Movies In Order: What Is The Second & Third Movie To Watch\nWhen it comes to book adaptations, many directors work closely with costume designers to create accessories that will distinguish one character from another or give the character personality. That was the case for the Cullen Crest, which even though is never mentioned in the books, features prominently throughout the films. Each Cullen family member wore their own version of it – for example, Edward's cuff, Rosalie's necklace, and Alice's thin choker all feature the family symbol.\nWhile this may seem like a small addition to the Twilight franchise, it's an important and symbolic one. With the Cullen family constantly being apart for different reasons, the Cullen Crest is the one thing that unifies them as a family, as they always have a piece of each other with them.\nOne of the most interesting things about the Cullens is that they're \"vegetarians\", which in the Twilight universe means that they don't drink human blood, and instead feed from the blood of animals – however, not every Cullen family member has led a vegetarian lifestyle. In his early years as a vampire, Edward rejected Carlisle's way of life by turning to human blood. In the books, Edward tells Bella about how he used to seek out criminals and kill them early on, but in the movies, this happens the night before their wedding.\nWhile viewers are consistently treated to the same tune by Carter Burwell throughout the Twilight movies, it's never blatantly stated that this is Bella's song, known as \"Bella's Lullaby\". It's only when Edward and Bella are seen sitting at the piano in Twilight that it's assumed Edward is playing \"Bella's Lullaby\" to her. In the books, Edward hums the song to Bella multiple times throughout the series, which doesn't happen in the movies.\nThroughout the Twilight Saga, viewers are treated to the backstories of Carlisle, Rosalie, and Jasper, but there's one crucial story that was left out completely: Alice's. In the books, readers find out the tragic backstory of Alice Cullen, from the early development of her powers to her time in a mental institution and her transformation into a vampire. Alice's backstory does have an impact on Twilight, as she was hunted by James years before.\nRelated: Twilight: How (And Why) All Of The Cullens Were Turned Into Vampires\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part Two is based around the Cullen Clan's impending fight with the Volturi in defense of Renesmee. In the books, the fight ends up being a peaceful encounter, but the movie did something different and controversial. Breaking Dawn 2 saw an all-out brawl between the Cullens and their allies against the Volturi that resulted in the deaths of some favorite characters like Carlisle, Leah, and Seth – but before viewers can process the massacre, it's revealed that all that was nothing more than Alice's premonition, so none of it actually happened.\nOne of the major plot points of New Moon is Bella engaging in reckless behavior in order to hear Edward's voice following their breakup. In the movie, Bella takes a joyride with a stranger on his motorcycle after a night at the movies with Jessica, but in the books, Bella spots the group of men who had ill intentions during her night in Port Angeles in Twilight, and as she approaches them, she hears Edward's voice for the first time.\nEclipse is widely regarded as the best book and movie in the Twilight series, in large part due to the introduction of the newborn army and the battle against these vampires led by Victoria. However, in the books, readers learn very little of the strategy of the newborn army, while in the movie, viewers get a behind-the-scenes look at Victoria's master plan.\nThose on Edward's side got a lot of joy out of Bella punching Jacob in the face after he kissed her in Eclipse, and while this scene stayed relatively true to the book, Bella and Jacob's second kiss didn't. Instead of Bella catching up to Jacob after he runs away, Edward is the one who brings Jacob back after he finds out that Edward and Bella are engaged. In addition to that, Edward and Bella are in the tent when they discuss their upcoming nuptials, and not outside.\nEdward's official proposal went great, but the first one wasn't exactly a romantic dream. In the movie, Edward proposes to Bella after he, Jacob, and Bella get into an argument in the woods, but in the book, Edward's proposal takes place in Edward's room, and Bella initially thinks he is joking.\nOne of the most iconic scenes in the whole Twilight series is when Bella tells Edward that she knows he's a vampire, but the movie version of this moment is completely different from the book one. Rather than taking to the ominous woodsy area of Forks, Bella finds out Edward is a vampire before her Port Angeles attack and reveals her knowledge in Edward's car.\nThe Twilight Saga depicted Bella as a loner, and though she had some human friends, like Jessica, Angela, Mike, and Eric, she didn’t spend much time with them. This is completely different in the books, where Bella’s friends have a bigger presence as she actually spends time with them rather than just being focused on Edward. This was a harmful change to the Twilight books, as the movies made it seem like Edward was isolating Bella from her friends, which is a huge red flag in their relationship.\nThroughout the Twilight Saga, Charlie and Bella are seen eating at a diner, but in the books, Bella actually cooked for Charlie. While this might seem like an unimportant detail, it’s actually key to Bella and Charlie’s dynamic, as well as to understanding Bella. When Bella learns Charlie can’t cook, she decides to cook for him, informing the reader that, as her mother often required care, she took on some of the responsibilities of an adult, such as cooking for others. It shows how protective Bella is of her loved ones, and adds some sweetness to her relationship with her father.\nBella and Edward’s first kiss in the Twilight movie was a lot steamier than in the book. In the source material, Edward and Bella kiss for the first time when they return to her truck after hiking to the meadow, with Bella reacting enthusiastically to it. The movie turned up the intensity and instead set Bella and Edward’s kiss in Bella’s room, with Bella only wearing a t-shirt and underwear. Bella escalates the kiss to make it more passionate, with Edward pulling back to control himself.\nTwilight ends on a cliffhanger as Victoria is revealed to be watching Bella and Edward at their prom, setting her up as a big villain in the sequels. This scene is exclusive to the movie, as in the book, Victoria never shows up at the prom – and had she done so, any of the Cullens in attendance would have immediately sensed her presence, which would have put everyone else in great danger.\nRelated: What Happened To The Original Victoria From Twilight?\nAs mentioned above, the Twilight Saga made it look as if Edward was isolating Bella, adding to complaints about the toxic relationship between Edward and Bella, but in the books, she actually focused on other areas of her life, too. In the books, Bella actually made plans to attend college, and Edward was very supportive of this. In Eclipse, Bella got accepted into the University of Alaska, and in Breaking Dawn, Bella decided to attend for a year after getting married and remain human – however, these plans changed when she got pregnant. Still, it shows that Bella wanted a lot more than to become a vampire, and Edward was supportive of her plans to have more human experiences.\nImprinting in the Twilight universe has caused a lot of controversy, mostly because Jacob imprinted on Bella’s child, Renesmee. While this is disturbing in both the books and the movie, in the source material it’s less creepy thanks to the explanation of what imprinting really is about. This, arguably, made the “Jacob imprinted on Renesmee” situation endearing, while in the movie, it became not just one of the most disturbing moments in the Twilight Saga but also one of the most mocked ones thanks to Bella’s over-the-top (but understandable) reaction.\n\n"}
{"title": "10 Tiny Decisions In Baldur's Gate 3 That Have Huge Story Implications", "date": "2023-10-05 20:31:26", "text": "Baldur's Gate 3 is filled with choices big and small, but some of the tiniest decisions can lead to story-changing outcomes, both good and bad.\nBaldur’s Gate 3 has impressed everyone with its complex and interweaving story, where even the tiniest of decisions can have an impact on the plot. In a world with so many places to explore and characters to meet, it’s little wonder that sometimes the smallest things can lead to unforeseen consequences. From unexpected quests to surprising allies for the final battle, Baldur’s Gate 3 really does deliver on the promise that choices matter.\n[Warning: This article contains spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3.]\nBaldur’s Gate 3 hurtles straight into the action, with the player character immediately fending off an apparent mind flayer plot. Throughout their journey, right the way through to the end of Baldur’s Gate 3, it is up to the party to navigate the complex world and save Faerûn. Whether it be speaking to a particular NPC, handing over an item to the wrong person or exploring secret areas in Baldur’s Gate 3, there is always something new to uncover.\nRelated: \"An Iconic, Engaging Mess Of Brilliant Ideas\": Baldur's Gate 3 Review\nUsually, poking around someone’s home or private space isn’t a good idea, but there are some interesting things to be learned about Kagha for those to happen to be a little more inquisitive. Sneaking around the library just off the main area with Kagha and Rath will reveal that tucked behind a bookcase is Kagha’s secret personal chest. Unlocking it will reveal a note and a book that starts a new quest to investigate the Grove’s latest leader. This new question puts Kagha’s actions into context and opens up new dialogue not just when she is confronted but also when Halsin returns.\nA simple act of kindness can lead to something much more beneficial, especially where the tiefling children are concerned. Helping any of the kids while in the Druid Grove, such as saving Arabella from Kagha or Mirkon from the harpies, will get the party an invitation to meet Mol. Mol has taken the rest of the orphaned children under her wing and will offer her thanks for helping them as well as make herself available as a vendor. Even better though, helping the kids will mean that Mol likes you, which comes in handy at the start of Act 2, where she will speak up for the party to Jaheira when first arriving at the Last Light Inn.\nSpeak with animals is an amazing spell taken to brilliant new levels in Baldur’s Gate 3. Every animal has something to say and all wonderfully voice acted. While speaking with the various animals found along the Sword Coast will often provide extra insight into the world, the strange ox in the Druid Grove is something else entirely. This peculiar beast is clearly not what it seems, but speaking to it at first will yield no answers.\nRelated: How To Talk To Animals in Baldur's Gate 3\nIt is only after running into this particular ox again in Act Two that more knowledge is gained, with the ox giving the party terrible flashbacks to its crimes. However, the real twist comes in Act 3 when the ox requests passage into Baldur’s Gate in apple form. Doing this will gain the party not only Shapeshifter's Boon Ring, which pairs well with the Mask of the Shapeshifter to give +1d4 bonus to all ability checks, but the ox will also appear just before the final battle with the Netherbrain as an unexpected ally.\nWhen first entering the Druid Grove in Act 1, the party will come across three siblings having an argument about whether or not to stay. The sister, Lia, wants to stay and help fight, while Rolan wants to leave. Here, the party can intervene and take a side; however, if Lia is sided with, more quests will be available further into Baldur’s Gate 3.\nIn Act Two, Rolan can be met again, where it is revealed that he helped save the tiefling children from the cultists of the Absolute. His siblings have been taken, though, and if they are rescued, and Rolan survives the Shadow-Cursed Lands, he can be met again in Act Three. This time, Rolan will be working in Lorrokan’s shop and can be persuaded to turn on his new master if his siblings were saved in Act 2. Strangely, in the simple act of settling an argument between siblings, children are saved, and a new ally can be gained.\nVenturing into an owlbear cave might not seem like the best of ideas, but any party determined to explore every inch of the map in Act 1 will no doubt have stumbled across this area. Inside a mother owlbear will fiercely protect her young, and the sensible thing to do might be to leave before a fight starts. However, if the mother is killed, then her baby can be found again at the Goblin Camp, where he can be coaxed into joining the team and following the party to camp. Doing so not only gives the group one of the cutest characters that can join the camp but also a great boost in the final battle in Act 3.\nRomances play a significant part in Baldur's Gate 3, with there even being options for polyamory. However, two characters who are most definitely not willing to share with each other are Lae'zel and Shadowheart. One decision to be careful with for those planning to romance the cleric of Shar is that any 'evenings' with Lae'zel could complicate this. Lae'zel will be very forward with her intentions toward the player character, and it is possible to sleep with her before forming a deeper relationship. However, doing so will lock out Shadowheart from being romanced if the relationship is not ended before the camp celebration in Act 1.\nWhen arriving in the Last Light Inn at the very beginning of Act 2, the party will almost immediately be sent to speak with Isobel, a cleric of Selune, by Jaheira. This seems like a simple matter of getting her blessing before venturing out into the Shadow-Cursed Land. However, speaking to Isobel will trigger an attack by the Absolute’s forces, led by former Flaming Fist Marcus.\nAs the Inn itself will be the focus of the attack, there are many NPCs crammed in there who can die during the fight, such as Rolan, Art Cullagh, and even Halsin, and this can lead to some quests ending prematurely. There is also the issue of Isobel herself; if she is killed or knocked out during the battle, it will doom everyone in the area as the shield keeping the curse at bay will fall. So, while chatting with Isobel might seem like the obvious choice, it is best to avoid her room to keep everyone safe in the long run.\nWhen venturing into the Mountain Pass area, the party will meet Lady Esther, a member of the Society of Brilliance, who will ask the party to retrieve a githyanki egg for her. There are a few ways to complete this quest by either giving her what she wants or giving her an owlbear egg. However, if either egg is handed over, the Society of Brilliance in Baldur’s Gate is doomed as both the hatched githyanki or the owlbear will kill everyone in their lodge.\nThere is a chance to visit a Zhentarim hideout during Act 1 and meet a captured artist named Oskar. He will thank the party for their assistance if freed and promise a reward when they finally reach Baldur’s Gate. This seems to be the end of it; however, when Oskar is met again in Act 3, things have gone terribly wrong.\nRescuing Oskar can snowball into a much longer questline, which will lead the party to cross paths with the Mystic Carrion, a mummy lord living in Baldur’s Gate. This, in turn, will lead to its own quest as some of the Mystic’s servants have run away. There is some great loot and lore from both of these questlines that all start with one chat in Act 1.\nOne of the smallest decisions in Baldur’s Gate 3 that can lead to massive implications is Raphael’s deal in Act 3. While the choice to free Prince Orpheus or help the Emperor might seem like a big decision, on the grand cosmic scale, it isn’t that important. Both will aid the party in much the same way when facing the Netherbrain.\nHowever, it is what Raphael wants that makes this decision’s consequences matter. In exchange for the Orphic Hammer, Raphael wants the Crown of Karsus and he makes it very clear that he wishes to rule the Nine Hells. An after-credits cutscene with Raphael further drives home the true implications of this decision as it becomes obvious that Raphael has no intention of stopping with the Nine Hells, meaning that the hero of Baldur’s Gate 3 has doomed millions with the stroke of a pen.\n"}

One cackling villain ups the ante and creates even more copies of himself during his final showdown with his copycat.\nWarning! Spoilers ahead for The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #11!Fans who thought three Jokers were enough might want to prepare themselves. As two Clown Princes of Crime wage war, one goes all out by making an entire army of grinning doppelgangers with a devious purpose.\nIn The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #11 by Matthew Rosenberg, Carmine Di Giandomenico, and Romulo Fajardo Jr., Gotham is going to hell in a handbasket as the Gotham and LA Jokers continue their epic war against each other. Gotham's Joker and his crew roll up on a poor custodian and kidnap him, adding him to the collection of other victims that the Joker has snatched.\nAs chaos reigns throughout the city, Ravager and Manhunter run into each other, stumbling upon the van the Joker's gang was driving, now empty. They track the Joker down to his lair and attempt to take him out. Though Joker gets the better of Manhunter, Ravager shoots the villain in the shoulder. With no other option, Joker retreats and pulls out an unexpected surprise. He reveals his kidnapping victims have all been surgically altered to resemble the Joker. Even worse, they've also become living bombs that Joker detonates in his getaway.\nThe DC Universe has been haunted by dual Jokers for the past few months. One Joker moved out to Los Angeles, intent on expanding his criminal endeavors across the entire nation. But another remained in Gotham, trying to recover after being shot in the head and suffering gaps in his memory as a result. Both Harlequins of Hate were certain that they were the original, but Gotham's Joker finally regained his memory and remembered the impostor Joker was actually a former henchman that had been poisoned by Joker venom and surgically altered to resemble the Joker.\nEver since the publication of the Black Label miniseries Three Jokers, copies of the iconic villain have become an increasingly common sight. DC has even introduced a new villain known as Red Mask who can create Jokers on a whim. However, the latest batch of clowns doesn't seem to be intended as anything more than a trump card for Gotham's Joker. He used one doppelganger to attack LA's Joker and experienced a reluctance to use his victims on Ravager and Manhunter. Gotham's Joker likely wanted to take his copycat out in the most ironic way possible by killing him with other false Jokers.\nWhether he's the real one or not, Gotham's Joker has taken umbrage at another Joker existing in the DCU. Gotham's Joker swore he'd win in the end, and it looks like his final move was intended to put an end to the entire copycat Joker movement. It's a pretty creative manner of killing: It's violent, attention-grabbing, and essentially says LA's Joker was a fake like all the rest. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like Gotham's Joker will get the chance to use this creative method of execution. Seeing more than one Joker might be wearing thin for some, but this is a hell of a closing act for the multiple Joker shtick. The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #11 is on sale now.\n"}
{"title": "15 Best Detective Series On Netflix", "date": "2023-10-05 20:20:28", "text": "Crime drama has never quite looked like this: the 15 best detective series' airing on Netflix filled with anticipation, suspense, and mystery. \nNetflix is home to a wide variety of crime dramas which keep audiences on their toes as they try to eagerly predict the story's conclusion. With the popularity of this genre soaring, Netflix has consistently delivered engaging and thought-provoking detective series. Whether it's in a big city or a small town, a crime or investigation can go anywhere, and more often than not, no character is safe.\nFor crime drama enthusiasts, it may feel that all available storylines have been exhausted. However, 2023 has seen a wave of new releases for Netflix, including new episodes of viewer favorites Luther and season 5 of Top Boy. Netflix also saw a huge audience response to the release of Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story in 2022, and the streaming giant is clearly keen to grow its impact within the genre by producing more riveting detective series.\nFeaturing eccentric American star James Spader, The Blacklist is a crime thriller series that follows a wanted fugitive as he assists the FBI in catching deadly criminals. This fast-paced mystery was praised for its overall entertainment, and Spader's incredible performance added an extra layer of tension to the screen. Despite some elements that require a suspension of disbelief and comedic moments that feel out of place, The Blacklist was generally positively received and well-worth watching.\nThe psychological drama Mindhunter follows two FBI agents in a unique take on the 1955 non-fiction book Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit. The show ran for three seasons, but Mindhunter was canceled in 2023. The one silver lining of Mindhunter's cancellation is it means that viewers can now binge every episode on Netflix. Unlike other shows that revolve around the FBI, Mindhunter follows a research project trying to understand the in-depth psyche of serial killers, rather than being out in the field, offering a unique perspective on real-world practices.\nIn The Sinner, Bill Pullman plays Detective Harry Ambrose, who focuses on crimes committed by surprising and typically unlikely culprits, trying to work out the motivation that led to their crimes. The show started as an eight-part miniseries, but due to an overwhelmingly positive response, the series was commissioned for a further three seasons. The Sinner also received multiple nominations for several awards while it was airing, including a Golden Globe nomination for Best Miniseries or Television Film.\nRelated: 10 Best Crime Movies On Netflix\nLupin is a retelling of the story of fictional French thief Arsène Lupin, created by author Maurice Leblanc. Lupin follows Assane Diop, a young thief who models himself after Arsène Lupin. The French language drama was watched by seventy-six million people in its first month, making it the most popular non-English language show on Netflix at that time (per The Hollywood Reporter). The show was then renewed for two further installments, the latest airing in October 2023, with no announcements for further episodes at this time.\nStarring David Tennant and Stanley Tucci, Inside Man tells the intense story of two very different people whose lives end up intercrossing: a prisoner in the United States, currently on death row, and a woman trapped in the cellar of an old, English vicarage. Tennant's performance is laced with anticipation and drama, and the dark themes throughout have the occasional comedic moment, although the ending of Inside Man proves somewhat confusing.\nStarring EGOT winner Viola Davis, How to Get Away with Murder made an incredible impact upon its initial release in 2014. The show ran for six years and finished in 2020. It follows Davis' character Annalise Keating, a defense attorney based in Philadelphia who, alongside five of her students, manages to get caught up in a murder plot. Davis' performance earned her a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, making her the first black woman to ever win the award (per NPR).\nRelated: How To Get Away With Murder: 15 Shows To Watch If You Love This Series\nWhen the stories of a suburban mother, a photographer, and a detective overlap, the mystery of missing father Stewart Green begins to rear its head once again, seventeen years after his disappearance in Stay Close. The Netflix detective series is based on the novel of the same name by author Harlan Coben. Coben has adapted more of his crime novels for Netflix, including Safe and The Stranger which also rank highly among the best detective series on Netflix.\nFour-part criminal thriller Collateral stars The Great Gatsby's Carey Mulligan as DI Kip Glaspie, who is thrown into the murder investigation of a delivery driver in South West London. Set across four days, the gripping British drama interweaves the lives of several seemingly unconnected characters. Collateral does a great job of making a comment on societal structures, while still focusing on the mystery at its core.\nAnother international detective series from Netflix, Deadwind is a Finnish crime drama that follows Detective Sofia Karppi who returns to work following the very sudden and accidental death of her husband. Upon her immediate return, Sofia is thrown into a murder investigation of a woman with suspicious connections to a construction company, while still having to raise her two children by herself. Deadwind has a gripping story that elevates it to one of Netflix's strongest outings.\nThe comedy-mystery Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency is based on the book of the same name, which was inspired by two episodes of Doctor Who written by the author Douglas Adams. It was then adapted for television in 2010, but only lasted for two years before it was adapted once again by BBC America and Netflix in 2016. However, the show was canceled again less than a year on the air. Despite this, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency is light and funny, laced with darker elements throughout, but it is generally more of a feel good watch compared to other detective series.\nSatirical crime mockumentary American Vandal ran for two seasons, with each one covering a ridiculous crime in full seriousness, as two high schoolers try and find the culprit. American Vandal was highly praised for its commitment to replicating the tension found in real crime documentaries but still layered in dry humor. Unfortunately, Netflix canceled American Vandal season 3, but the producers announced their hopes to move the show to elsewhere in the future.\nThe German miniseries Dear Child arrived on Netflix in September 2023 and was immediately praised for how it tackles the topic of child abduction. The show follows Lena, who manages to escape thirteen years of captivity, having birthed a son and a daughter in this time. At the same time as these events, other decades-old disappearances start to be dusted off by authorities who suspect a connection. Intense and distressing, Dear Child is a gripping and fast-paced thriller ideal for audiences who enjoyed Broadchurch.\nAnother French drama, The Forest follows the arrest of a teacher after her student disappears in the same forest that she has a suspicious history with. The series aired in France and Belgium in 2017, before being broadcast internationally on Netflix in 2018, running as a mini-series spanning six fifty-seven-minute episodes. The series was generally well-received, with criticisms leveled at some outlandish moments in the plot. While season 1 is solid overall, the show was not renewed for another season.\nRelated: 15 Famous TV Detectives, Ranked By Intelligence\nSet in a small, Midwestern town in the United States, Dare Me follows the story of competitive high school cheerleading, as the squad gets caught up in a mess of anxious secrets and panic when they meet their new coach, Colette French. Dare Me, based on the 2012 novel of the same name by Megan Abbott (who is also co-developer of the show), lasted only one season before being canceled by Netflix less than one month after it finished airing. Despite its cancelation, the show was generally well-received by critics, earning an 85% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\nBased on a real-life news article from 2015, Unbelievable follows the arrest of a young girl accused of lying about being assaulted and the two detectives who discovered the very complicated truth. The series received huge critical acclaim, and has an incredible 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and just thirty-four days after its release, Netflix announced the miniseries had been watched by over thirty-two million viewers (via X). Unbelievable was praised for its grittiness and realism, as well as the gripping performances from the cast.\nSources: The Hollywood Reporter, NPR, Rotten Tomatoes, @netflix/X\nRebecca is an experienced freelance writer from the UK, with two degrees focussing on narrative design and characterisation, as well as being a doctoral candidate on the discussion of the wider public's understanding of minority groups and the issues they live with, through mainstream television, film, and video games. \n\nIn her spare time, you'll find her with her cats, a cup of coffee, and gaming."}
{"title": "8 MCU Heroes We Think Will Get A Happy Ending", "date": "2023-10-05 20:10:31", "text": "The MCU has had its fair share of tragic deaths so far, but a lucky few characters seem like they may actually find some kind of happy ending.\nEvery MCU hero will eventually have to have their stories come to a close, and there are several who seem like prime candidates for a happy ending. By its very nature as an action movie franchise, the Marvel Cinematic Universe involves a great deal of death and destruction. Furthermore, as the stories being told focus on those able and willing to stand up and fight, many have already found their end in a tragic manner. Assuredly, many more will follow suit in the MCU Phases 5 and 6 films.\nHowever, though several heroes have died tragically, involvement as a hero in the MCU doesn't cement one's fate or guarantee one won't be able to find happiness. Already, several iconic characters have ended their stories without tragedy, retiring or dying a good death after a life well lived. Of all the characters currently living in the MCU, these seem most likely to find a similarly happy ending.\nClint Barton, aka Hawkeye, has undergone his fair share of pain and suffering, losing his family in The Blip and later having to witness the sacrifice of Natasha Romanoff, perhaps his closest friend, on Vormir for the Soul Stone. He also spent dark time as the violent vigilant Ronin, which is still, in ways, haunting him. However, things actually look fairly bright for Hawkeye's future MCU timeline. Things seem in perfect position for the Avenger's sharp-shooter to finally retire - his family is back and safe, and Kate Bishop is ready to carry on the Hawkeye mantle. Hopefully, Clint can retire and enjoy some much-earned peace.\nIn many ways, Steve Rogers already got the perfect MCU ending. After an incredibly tumultuous life split in half by his suspended animation in the Arctic, it seemed difficult to imagine how Steve could ever relax and step back from superheroics. Endgame's time travel presented such an opportunity, allowing him to live the life with Peggy Carter he always wanted. However, despite his absence from the MCU, Steve Rogers is still alive - somewhere. It's possible that he could be revisited despite being quite an old man, but it seems most likely that the MCU will let his Endgame closure ride.\nHulk may seem like the last MCU character destined for a happy ending, but his current station in the franchise at least presents the opportunity. While Bruce Banner and the Hulk originally had a combative relationship as they vied for control of one body, the two have somehow come to an agreement and have merged. Hulk also has several MCU replacements at the ready, including his niece, She-Hulk, and his son, Skaar. Something could easily go wrong, and Hulk could devolve back into something more savage, but it's equally likely that Bruce steps out of the spotlight and lets other Hulks do the smashing.\nA year ago, Ant-Man seemed high on the list of heroes most likely to die in the MCU Phase 5 or 6. Not only did Quantumania close his trilogy, but it also introduced the Multiverse Saga's big bad - Kang the Conqueror. It seemed to make sense that Scott might die to assert Kang as a threat, especially with Hope and his daughter, Cassie, able to carry on his role as a Pym-powered Avenger. However, that didn't come to pass, and if the MCU spared what was a perfectly set-up death, it may be possible that it's because they want him to survive the franchise.\nPeter Parker is famous for never finding lasting happiness in the pages of Marvel Comics, but the MCU can finally give him a happy life with loved ones. Tom Holland's upcoming Spider-Man trilogy is likely his last, and it's starting Peter Parker out on an incredibly low note. It seems unlikely the new trilogy will start low and drop even lower, but there's another reason Peter may live on after his time as Spider-Man. The wonderful Spider-Verse movies have famously covered the death of Peter Parker, and if Miles comes to live action, the MCU may not want to repeat a story people have seen so recently.\nWhile Tony Stark was still alive, Rhodey seemed more at risk, as it's a classic superhero trope to use the death of a friend to motivate another hero. How, though, there doesn't seem to be anyone close enough with Rhodey to warrant his death as a narrative device. After Secret Invasion's ending revealed that Rhodey had been a Skrull for an indeterminate amount of time, the Avenger may commit himself even more to politics, trying to instigate change through more traditional means. Especially if Thunderbolt Ross continues to butt heads with The Avengers, the team may want a powerful ally on the political inside.\nSince his apparent death in Captain America: The First Avenger, Bucky Barnes has had nothing but struggle in his life. Brainwashed by Hyrdra and used as a mindless assassin, the now-free Bucky has to deal with both his own guilt and the fallout of actions that weren't in any way his fault or choice. At this point, giving Bucky a tragic death would simply be one more piece of pain on an already tall stack. Letting him finally find true peace is by far the most exciting way to end his story, though he'll have to survive Thunderbolts first.\nGiven that Loki started out as a villain and would-be dictator of Earth, it's impressive that he's seemingly earned himself a happy ending. Time will tell what the MCU has in store for the God of Mischief in Loki season 2, but having him meet a tragic end would feel disappointingly repetitively. Loki's death at the hands of Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War was tragic and narratively effective, and the same thing can't happen again. Perhaps somehow Loki and Sylvie can find a way to be happy together, perhaps even in control of their own more heroic TVA moving forward in the MCU.\n"}
{"title": "Severance Season 2: Release Date Prediction, Delays & Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-05 20:00:29", "text": "Here's what we know about Apple TV+'s Severance season 2, including returning cast, release info, and plot threads from the season 1 finale.\nSeverance season 2 is on the way to Apple TV+, although despite being confirmed for a while the future of the show is still uncertain. Created by Dan Erickson and produced by Ben Stiller, the first season of Severance ended on a dramatic cliffhanger, which more than set up season 2. Severance gradually revealed its dystopian science fiction world, in which the cult-like Lumon Corporation uses a technology called Severance to separate an employee's memories and personalities into two: an innie for the workplace, and an outie for the outside world, with both having no access to the other's experiences.\nSeverance was a breakout success for Apple TV+, thanks in no small part to the intriguing and mysterious premise spawning a number of Severance fan theories. Severance saw the four severed innies of the Macro-Data Refinement department grow more curious and resentful of the system they are a part of. However, the first chapter of the story was clearly just the beginning as nothing was close to being resolved where the show left off, meaning anticipation for the delayed Severance season 2 remains incredibly high.\nNews on Severance season 2 has been quiet throughout most of 2023. However, this is largely due to production shutting down in May due to the commencement of the WGA screenwriters going on strike (via Deadline). Since no work has been carried out on the show since — and with the cast themselves going on strike when the still-ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike began — it's unsurprising there have not been any updates from Apple or Severance producer Ben Stiller.\nThe WGA strikes were resolved on September 27, 2023. While SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP have yet to reach an agreement talks are ongoing, and the dispute is expected to be resolved by the end of 2023 (though this isn't a guarantee). It's possible that production on the show could resume once the strikes are completely resolved, which means the long-awaited Severance season 2 release date could be announced, or at least given a speculative window by Apple TV+, shortly after.\nSeverance season 2 is confirmed, with Apple announcing the renewal in August 2022 (via Variety).  Reports came in April 2023 of behind-the-scenes delays due to drama between Severance showrunners Dan Erickson and Mark Friedman were addressed by Ben Stiller who assured fans the second season was still going ahead.\nUnfortunately, Apple has yet to announce a release date for Severance season 2. Production began in October 2022 but was delayed indefinitely when production on the second season of Severance shut down due to the WGA and then SAG-AFTRA strikes in May 2023. While the WGA has since resolved its dispute with the AMPTP, and SAG-AFTRA is expected to within a few weeks, Apple has yet to offer an updated release date for Severance season 2. It's likely that, until the SAG-AFTRA strikes are officially resolved, production cannot continue. A 2024 or even 2025 release date seems like the most probable outcome for Severance as of October 2023.\nThe cast of Severance season 2 will mostly be made up of returning faces from the first chapter of the quirky Apple TV+ sci-fi. Adam Scott (Step Brothers) will once more lead the cast as Mark, with Patricia Arquette (Medium) returning as Harmony. Provided there are no unexpected exits between now and when the release date for Severance season 2 arrives, the cast will include:\nThere have also been eight new cast members added for Severance season 2 in undisclosed roles (via Variety). The new Severance cast members in the third season will include Gwendoline Christie (The Sandman), Alia Shawkat (Arrested Development), Bob Balaban (The French Dispatch), Merrit Wever (Godless), Robby Benson (Beauty and the Beast), Stefano Carannante (Mirabilia), John Noble (The Lord of the Rings), and Ólafur Darri Ólafsson (The Tourist). There's been no hints or teases when it comes to the characters these cast members are playing, however.\nThere haven't been any concrete reveals regarding the Severance season 2 story, but the first season left some teases to set it up. The final episode of Severance season 1 sees the innies gain control of themselves outside the office using the Overtime Contingency built into their Lumon Severance Chips. Their actions in the world will be hard to undo, including Mark telling his sister Devon about the abuse going on at Lumon, Helly — who's apparently an Eagan — publicly denouncing Severance at a Lumon gala, and Irving trying to meet up with Burt. Cobel promised Helly punishment for her actions, and Severance season 2 is likely to see Lumon trying to respond to MDR's rebellion without compromising their outies.\nThere are also a number of mysteries surrounding Lumon that Severance season 2 could shed more light on. These include what happened to Mark's wife Gemma, who reappeared in the Lumon workspace as Ms. Casey, why Lumon has a room of baby goats in Severance, and the company's larger ambitions with the Severance Chips, hinted at in Helly's conversation with her father.\nSeverance season 2 could also explore more of its outies' lives, including the bizarre clues regarding Irving's outside life. Moreover, in Severance creator Dan Erickson's Reddit AMA on April 2022, while fielding viewer questions, Erickson implied that Helena Eagan would be the villain of Severance season 2, and that there might be levels to the Severance procedure.\n\nRob Hutton is a feature writer for Screen Rant.

This article contains spoilers for Ahsoka episode 8.\nAhsoka’s season 1 finale was jam-packed with lore details and action sequences, but one of the more puzzling aspects of Ahsoka episode 8 was what happened to Nightsister Morgan Elsbeth. Elsbeth had proven to be a worthy foe for Ahsoka Tano and her apprentice Sabine Wren, and the more audiences saw of Lady Morgan, the more questions arose. The eventual appearance of the three Nightsister Great Mothers—Klothow, Aktropaw, and Lakesis—made Morgan’s story and background even more intriguing, as she answered their call across galaxies.\nThe Nightsisters of Dathomir were a race of witches who used magick to tap into the Force. However, their power resided in the dark side, though their magick remained unattainable for figures like Emperor Palpatine. The majority of the Nightsisters would be massacred in the final year of the Clone Wars, with General Grievous leading the attack on Dathomir that would decimate the Nightsister’s population. It’s known that Morgan Elsbeth was one of the survivors, and she aligned herself with Grand Admiral Thrawn and the Empire after the fall of the Republic in the pursuit of greater power.\nAhsoka episode 8 showed the Great Mothers reward Morgan Elsbeth with the “gift of shadows.” Morgan’s face was altered during the ceremony, with her eyes becoming all black. The Great Mothers essentially infused Morgan with ichor, which is also known as the power of the dark side. Morgan Elsbeth was already a formidable foe, but with this extra power and the Blade of Talzin, she was instantly more dangerous. Nightsister magick generally taps into the dark side of the Force, but this ritual to physically transform Morgan focuses that energy into a living being.\nIt's known from Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels that the Nightsisters of Dathomir, even after death, can affect the living world. Not only can the dead be resurrected—which was seen with the Night Troopers in Ahsoka episode 8—but the deceased Nightsisters can also possess living beings. This was seen in Rebels season 3 when Darth Maul lures Sabine Wren and Kanan Jarrus to Dathomir. Elsbeth’s transformation makes her not only look more like other Nightsisters audiences have seen in Star Wars canon, but also infuses her with a similar kind of communal magick she couldn’t access beforehand.\nRelated: When Ahsoka Takes Place In The Star Wars Timeline\nAfter Morgan Elsbeth was given the gift of the shadows, her power significantly increased. When Morgan first appeared in The Mandalorian season 2, it was a challenge for Ahsoka Tano to beat her, but the former Jedi would eventually come out victorious. However, when the two dueled again in the Ahsoka season 1 finale, the combatants were far more evenly matched. In fact, the duel was seemingly decided when the reincarnated Night Troopers appeared to help Elsbeth finish off Ahsoka. The only reason Morgan lost to Ahsoka was because Sabine Wren chose not to join Ezra Bridger aboard Grand Admiral Thrawn’s ship.\nThe Blade of Talzin also contributed to Morgan Elsbeth’s growth of power. With the sword being a relic of the Nightsisters, she was able to quickly master the weapon that appeared with green flames on the metal blade. While the Blade of Talzin is not a lightsaber, it could deflect the Jedi weapon like beskar and even cut through one of Ahsoka's hilts. If the sword is a kind of Force-infused weapon, then for the Nightsisters, the Blade of Talzin may be their own version of a lightsaber, though it is only bestowed on a certain few.\nOne of the most important parts of Morgan Elsbeth’s transformation at the beginning of Ahsoka episode 8 was the oath she swore before the Great Mothers gifted her. Audiences familiar with the Nightsisters from The Clone Wars may have noticed that the oath Morgan swore was the same that Mother Talzin had Asajj Ventress recite when she was welcomed back into the coven on Dathomir. This shows that Morgan was likely already familiar with the oath, and that it demanded a commitment to her sisters and to the Nightsister community as a whole.\nThere could be a good reason why Thrawn was quick to have Morgan be the one left behind, and that is because of the oath she took. Part of the oath was swearing to abandon her old life, and that likely included loyalty to Thrawn. If Morgan had pledged herself to the Nightsisters, Thrawn easily could’ve seen this as her no longer being fully on his side. For someone who inspires such loyalty from his troops—so much so that Night Troopers volunteered to die and become zombies—it’s not hard to see why Thrawn would be wary of an oath like this.\nRelated: Why Grand Admiral Thrawn Goes To Dathomir In Ahsoka Episode 8\nIt's likely that when Morgan Elsbeth took this oath, she knew she was entering into a deeper level of commitment to the communal magick of the Nightsisters. By taking the oath, Morgan was essentially getting baptized as a stronger member of the Nightsister clan. Not only did she swear her allegiance to the Nightsisters, but she vowed to put the needs of the whole community above all else. She was no longer seen as an individual survivor, but part of a sisterhood. For someone like Grand Admiral Thrawn, who had instilled such a sense of loyalty throughout his ranks, he could’ve viewed this oath and subsequent transformation as problematic for his goals.\nWhile the loss of a villain like Morgan Elsbeth is a blow for Thrawn's cause, the three Great Mothers will certainly reveal more about their larger plan and how their magick works in Ahsoka season 2. With Thrawn willing to sacrifice a loyal servant like Morgan, a potential change in dynamic with the Great Mothers could be in store with the antagonists all back in the main Star Wars galaxy. Ahsoka scratched the surface of what the Great Mothers are capable of, and future stories can allow them to demonstrate their power in ways Morgan Elsbeth never could.\nAll episodes of Ahsoka are available to stream on Disney+.\n"}
{"title": "'All of Manhattan Became Mutants': TMNT's Original Plan for Mutant Town Was Much Darker", "date": "2023-10-05 20:00:28", "text": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles writer/artist Sophie Campbell reveals the Mutant Town was supposed to be so much darker ahead of her upcoming TMNT #150. \nMutant Town is a relatively new addition to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles lore, but one that has become integral to the wider story, as it makes the established universe feel so much fuller while also creating nearly limitless future story potential. While Mutant Town is unarguably a good thing within TMNT canon, it was originally supposed to be way darker, and the creative mind behind Mutant Town, Sophie Campbell, said so herself ahead of the conclusion to her run on TMNT.\nMutant Town was created after the events of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #98 when the TMNT's mutant extremist group called the Mighty Mutanimals led by the anthropomorphic cat-mutant and prominent TMNT villain Old Hob set off a mutagen bomb in the middle of a crowd in New York City, mutating every human in that general vicinity. While there were some outlying mutants who popped up in later stories who weren’t in the immediate area - given that the mutagen was airborne - it was only a relatively small number of mutants that were created that day, though more than enough to give the City of New York cause for alarm. In response, the newly-elected Mayor Baxter Stockman decided to wall-off a portion of the city where the mutants could live separate from humanity. This happened in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #101, which was Sophie Campbell’s debut issue. And now, Campbell reflects on the choices she made with the development of TMNT's Mutant Town, including the original scale of the walled-off portion of New York City.\nIn an interview with CBR, Sophie Campbell discussed the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #150, as that issue will mark the end of her run on IDW Publishing’s TMNT comic book series. While talking about what fans can expect, Campbell touched on how her storyline began, most notably Mutant Town. She spoke about what aspects of Mutant Town she was proud of, while also revealing what could have been.\nCampbell: Originally, I had wanted to expand the mutagen bomb effects and have the entirety of Manhattan become mutants and have the city walled off like Escape from New York, but we ended up scaling it back, which I think was the right way to go.\nSophie Campbell also explained how Mutant Town impacted the Ninja Turtles personally, not just in terms of the wider universe.\nCampbell: It was an opportunity to do a whole brave new world for the Turtles – a situation they’d never been in. They could finally mingle with other people without having to hide. They could finally have real lives in a real community.\nThese quotes outline two very different versions of Mutant Town. Given the reference to Escape from New York, it seems the original idea for it was something more akin to a controlled post-apocalyptic wasteland behind tall, unbreachable walls. That gives one an image of the Ninja Turtles filling the narrative role of Snake Plissken, carefully traversing the dangerous area, taking down mutant crime lords and kicking butt along the way. It’s a cool thought based on an ambitious idea, but definitely a dark flip for the Turtles that would have ultimately only served to separate them further from humanity, which is the opposite of what the canonical Mutant Town actually did. The Mutant Town TMNT fans got was the culmination of everything the Turtles had ever wanted up until that point. Sure, they hated that so many people were displaced and mutated, but in the end, everyone came together to form a tight-knit community where everyone belonged and no one was judged based on their physical appearance.\nNo longer did the Turtles have to hide in the shadows and live in the streets. In Mutant Town, they were respected community leaders, law enforcement officers, and even a reliable new source. Sophie Campbell created a home for the Turtles with Mutant Town, which - based on this interview - is a far cry from the ‘Escape from New York’-esque prison they almost got, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ Mutant Town was reportedly supposed to be way darker.\nSource: CBR\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

The idea of an adult movie about the iconic purple dinosaur is intriguing, especially to those who fondly look back on the character's role in their childhoods. Additionally, Barbie's remarkable performance demonstrates how Barney could make just as strong an impact. Still, the early word on this upcoming film gives some cause for concern.\nBarney is still in the very early stages of production, so Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz was reluctant to provide much information about the plot or angle of the film (via Screen Rant). He did confirm that this adaptation of the popular Barney & Friends franchise would be aimed at adults but wouldn't come with an R rating. This indicates it will be more like Barbie (rated PG-13) than a graphic reimagining like Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey. Overall, this is good news. However, Kreiz followed this up by stating that Barney \"will not be an odd movie,\" which, considering Barbie's oddness, is a somewhat concerning revelation.\nRELATED: Barney: Confirmation, Release Date Prediction & Everything We Know About Daniel Kaluuya's Adult-Focused Movie\nMattel's Barbie was undoubtedly full of wholesome, heartwarming, and societally impactful moments, but it was, at its core, an odd movie. The story was charming, but the film was absolutely absurd between Ryan Gosling's \"I'm Just Ken\" musical number and Kate McKinnon's Weird Barbie character. Considering Barbie was such a success, it seems Mattel would want to stick with a similar formula with Barney, and that means making things a little weird.\nAs a story about a purple dinosaur toy that comes to life and plays with school children all day, there is virtually no way to create an adult-aimed film that adequately pays homage to Barney while remaining serious. Of course, this also comes down to Kreiz's idea of what is or is not \"odd.\" It's possible the Mattel CEO was trying to say that audiences shouldn't expect a version of Barney that is dark or obscene. Regardless, the choice of words here, combined with the company's upcoming content plan, seems to imply that Mattel completely misunderstood what made Barbie so popular with audiences to begin with.\nBarbie was a massive box office success, with a worldwide gross of about $1.4 billion, making it the top movie of 2023. This has led Mattel to buckle down on the toy angle by announcing several similar movies in the works. Along with Barney, we can expect projects featuring American Girl Dolls, Hot Wheels, Thomas the Tank Engine, and much more. Though this is great for nostalgia, it reveals just how much Mattel has missed the point, and this is only furthered by the CEO's comments about Barney.\nRELATED: Barbie's Success Redeems Margot Robbie's 3-Movie Long Box Office Losing Streak\nThough Barbie certainly resonated with audiences who enjoyed playing with the various dolls back in the day, it was the impactful themes relating to society and the wacky comedy that made the film a success. There are countless ways that Greta Gerwig could have gone wrong with this movie, but by keeping things fun but layered with important concepts, Barbie was elevated to a new level. An adult-aimed, not \"odd\" Barney adaptation would prove that this went right over Mattel's head and would be a significant disappointment to audiences who genuinely want to see more projects like Barbie.\n"}

Despite having a better sense of how a player interacts with a game, it's wasted on bolstering its protagonist's \"specialness\". In the low-stakes world of an MMO, it feels like an unnecessary and, therefore, tired piece of storytelling.\nRakuro \"Sunraku\" Hizutome speaks and acts like a gamer; that isn't in question. However, many of his banal stunts feel too self-congratulatory, making the anime give in to the all too onerous clichés of the overpowered fantasy hero. This is a shame since Shangri La Frontier otherwise has deserved moments of levity, and of course, beautifully drawn action scenes.\nRelated: 10 Best Anime Inspired By Video Games\nMany anime protagonists these days are now reliant on some quirk - optionally one leading to ostracization - becoming the core ability that lifts them up to godlike power by the end of the story. In Hizutome's case, his hobby of playing shovelware games is so mundane it's ludicrous writers want to convince fan this is a talent, yet Shangri La Frontier insists it is. Besides skills finely honed from playing glitchy entertainment, Sunraku's Shangri La avatar - a man wearing only underwear and a bird mask - is treated as an outside-the-box strategy that only he, the \"Trash Game King\", could have envisioned.\nUnfortunately, in 2023 this is all standard gamer tradition to the point of banality. A gamer subjecting themselves to \"trash games\" is likely to be livestreaming their antics. Meanwhile, wearing inappropriate outfits, or any at all, is just a way to raise hell or a self-appointed challenge to kill a boss while at the risk of dying in one hit. Even Sunraku's \"genius\" tactic of dumping his allotted skill points into Luck is nothing groundbreaking. Yet because Shangri La tries so earnestly to pretend its protagonist is some unparalleled genius, it only makes his skills come across as artificial.\nShangri La Frontier can be genuinely amusing when it actually talks about gaming itself. When someone complains about useless AI-controlled characters or skips a game's introductory cutscene, it's funny because it's true to life. While the hero's misadventures briefly mention them, ultimately the game exists just to glorify him, not video gaming itself. While Shangri La Frontier gained a lot of attention for these gestures to actual gamer habits, if the anime is going to continue congratulating its hero for acting like a typical player, it's ultimately not going to set a higher standard in much else beyond animation quality.\nBorn and raised in Canada, Kevin Chu lived internationally throughout his childhood, spending the majority of his schooling in Hong Kong before returning to Canada, first to study at the University of British Columbia, and then to find work.

Loki grapples with the warning He Who Remains gave him about his death, leading to a second multiverse war as he deals with the ever-expanding branches of the \"sacred timeline.\" With the help of new and familiar faces at the TVA, he will face questions about free will and the multiverse while also searching for Sylvie, Renslayer, and Miss Minutes.\nMichael Waldron created Loki, but Eric Martin stepped into the role of head writer for season 2. Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead join the series as the lead directing team for the second season, following Kate Herron's departure after the first. Loki features a star-studded cast led by Tom Hiddleston, Owen Wilson, Sophia Di Martino, Jonathan Majors, Wunmi Mosaku, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Tara Strong, and Eugene Cordero. Ke Huy Quan also joined the cast for the second season.\nRelated: Loki Season 2 Breaks 2 MCU Trends That Have Defined The Last 10 Years\nScreen Rant spoke with Christine Wada, the costume designer for Loki season 2, about the new looks for the characters. She shared the inspiration for Victor Timely's look, OB's coveralls, and how both Loki and Sylvie have changed to reflect their journeys. Wada also revealed that the space suit worn by Mobius was a practical suit and a hilarious detail about Majors' Victor Timely costume.\nScreen Rant: You guys jump around from different genres and different eras. What was one of your favorite eras to explore in season 2?\nChristine Wada: 1970s. So fun. So fun and such a great way to transition us out of the TVA and then jump into that glamour world. Go from uniform to glamour was really fun. And I think it's a fun journey for characters like B-15 and to see her out of the armor and the uniform. It's great.\nWe do end up in a McDonald's there. How much research did you do with those old-school McDonald's outfits?\nChristine Wada: A lot. They're spot on. They are spot on. It comes from a catalog. Well, not a catalog. It actually comes from the handbook. So we really tried to stay as true and honest to that as possible. Yeah.\nYeah. One of the other ones that really jumped out to me was the World's Fair. Everything looks so incredibly detailed. Even the way it was shot was beautiful. Talk to me about designing the costumes for that sequence because there are a lot of folks wearing costumes from that era.\nChristine Wada: Yeah. That was, first of all, it was just interesting to try to make it feel like America in that era because of course we filmed in London, so a lot of the costumes are from Europe. And it's just American, adds some of that little Western vibe to it and a little less fitted because in Europe, everybody was really more, the collar was tight and everything was a little more trim. When you look at old American research, there's just a little more cowboy to it. So it's fun to do that and just designing it to sort of in a weird way, almost be a little bit like the TVA because it's still a uniform.\nWhen you go back to the 1890s, you realize that it's still kind of a uniform. There just wasn't as much choice, which I think is interesting when the season is somewhat about choice. We're going to this era where there really wasn't a lot of choice. So it's fun to play with that a little bit. So I really restricted the palette as much as I could and to try to think about how we see those past actual centuries. We see them sort of in black and white or as colorized photography. I thought it would be nice to sort of feed that into that episode.\nNow, Christine, Loki has evolved as a character from season 1 to season 2. I don't even think Thor would recognize this version of Loki at this point, but talk to me about what went into Loki's design this season evolving from last season.\nChristine Wada: He still, I think he needed to be tied to the TVA and all his relationships in the TVA. It's basically kind of assembling what would Loki do if he still wanted to have an attachment visually to the TVA, but Loki, the God, could create his own TVA uniform? So he still has the pants from season 1, but I think the jacket is definitely something that Loki would conjure up.\nHow much input does Tom Hiddleston have in the look of Loki?\nChristine Wada: Quite a bit. He's definitely... but input that is maybe not even verbal because I just think that there is a physicality to Tom that if you're paying attention, it dictates how you're going to design those costumes because his presence just brings a lot to the table. The way he performs brings a lot to the table. So, as a designer, like I said, I think if you're doing your homework, you can really take from a much more nuanced directive.\nI want to talk about Sylvie's look for a second because she's in a different point in season 2, but it's blending her Asgardian armor along with being more casual. What went into developing that for her?\nChristine Wada: There's so many different elements because you wanted her to feel like she picked up something from the 80s because she's really just trying to live a more real life, right? And I felt like her palette had to stay somewhat subdued because I just think she's just trying to blend in, but it also had to give her a swagger.\nAnd just from a really technical level of six episodes, it was also how do we keep Sylvie looking, how do we not make it campy or goofy for her to arrive in the 1890s in this 80s getup? Because I think the season is such an internal exploration of these characters that you want the costumes to be more vulnerable, and you don't want them to just stand out when they're going into these different environments in a way that's at all campy or jolting.\nIn Quantumania, we got introduced to Victor Timely, and we get his story expanded here in Loki season 2. Can you talk to me about designing Victor Timely's look and having that stand out from other variations of Kang the Conqueror?\nChristine Wada: Well, it was really inspired by Frederick Douglass. I think it's on the page. I think we're in the 1890s World Fair and I think if we stay true to what Loki is very successful at and really what makes it so fun to design is it always takes elements from real life. Even the TVA being grounded in the 60s and having some of the analog of the 60s. I just think it makes the show special and exciting and I think that with Victor Timely's character to have a real person be sort of our base role model just allowed us to design something that, he can only, he's just, yeah.\nThe subtleties of that character are phenomenal, even the small things he does.\nChristine Wada: Small things! Just the rise of the pant where the pant is and just the posture and even his handkerchief I embroidered with his initials. I actually made him real period underwear, so he could really feel like he was getting into the whole time period.\nKe Huy Quan might be my favorite new MCU character. OB is phenomenal. What went into designing his look and staying true to still with the TVA kind of aesthetic?\nChristine Wada: Well, it started, and I'd say production design has always been just so collaborative and something to cue off of. I remember Kasra [Farahani] talking about we were going to see these new areas of the TVA and having OB and his world feeling a little bit more like it's from the 40s or early 50s, right? And so that jumpsuit is, I pulled period jumpsuits from that era.\nThere's even that buckle, the high buckle in the back that is just very much a nod to those older periods and just doing all that work wear herringbone from that period. It was just trying to keep him a little more backdated and of course there were so many different iterations of that costume and so it really became this, well what are we trying to say that fits into this entire cohesive vision? So staying a little more period, a little more mechanical felt right.\nWhich character went through the most evolution from season 1 to season 2 and was the most challenging for you?\nChristine Wada: Wow, I would say that it really does have to be Sylvie even though Sylvie is oddly still wearing her armor from season 1. I just think it had to feel more vulnerable and more real and just taking the whole thing down a little bit. So, I think finding that sweet spot was hard, but then again working with the acting of Sophia is not hard so.\nOut of what we've seen in the first four episodes, can you tease anything that we would see visually that's coming up without giving a spoiler away? It's hard to tiptoe around that I feel like, right?\nChristine Wada: I don't think that I can. I don't know how to, and I would never want to spoil it because I think that it's so impactful what happens through this season that I would... I don't think I could say anything.\nI do have a question for you actually about the space suit. Is that a physical space suit or is that all a CG type of?\nChristine Wada: I love it. No, it's all practical and I have to say that's another thing that I think is really fun and special about Loki in particular is that we try very hard to do as much in camera as possible. Justin and Aaron were really great about that and so no, that's almost all practical. So we made a destructed version and we made so many different versions of it. So, it's all practical which wasn't easy, but it's modular, so it gave the actors some breathing room.\nOut of these costumes, which one is your favorite? I know it's like picking your favorite child.\nChristine Wada: I mean, right now I'm really, well I love the collar of Tom's. Come on. This is mean. This is mean. I love his collar. I love Sylvie's coat and I really love Renslayer so I'm sorry I can't keep it to one. I broke the rules.\nAlong with Mobius, Hunter B-15 and a team of new and returning characters, Loki navigates an ever-expanding and increasingly dangerous multiverse in search of Sylvie, Judge Renslayer, Miss Minutes and the truth of what it means to possess free will and glorious purpose.\nBe sure to also check out our interview with Loki season 2 executive producer Kevin Wright\nLoki season 2 debuts on Disney+ on October 5.\n"}

First announced in September of last year, the Apple TV+ Original reunites Gilligan with Seehorn, as the two worked together on Better Call Saul. The project has been described as a \"blended, grounded genre drama' and it has already nabbed a two-season straight-to-series order from the streamer. Gilligan will serve as executive producer and showrunner on Seehorn's first major television role since she ended her run as Kim Wexler, though plot details have been kept under wraps.\nIn a new interview with Variety, Gilligan pulls back the curtain on what to expect from his upcoming collaboration with Seehorn. The four-time Emmy winner was asked to shed some light on the Apple TV+ drama and mentioned that the story has a sci-fi component. Gilligan, who co-created Better Call Saul with Peter Gould, also stresses the new show is not connected to the Breaking Bad universe. He adds: \"The world changes very abruptly in the first episode, and then it is quite different.\" The full exchange is below:\nYeah! I wouldn’t call this heavy science fiction, I would call it mild science fiction. But it does have a sci-fi element to it, at its core. And there’s no crime, and no methamphetamine. It’s going to be fun and different. I have no prediction as to how folks to react to it — whether they’ll love it or hate it, or somewhere in the vast in-between. But I know it’s a story that interests me, and Rhea will be playing a very different character than she played on “Saul.” The weird thing is that it takes place in Albuquerque, except it’s a whole different world. There’s no overlap that I can see. She’s playing a character who is not Kim Wexler, but hopefully people will roll with that. I’m nervous. It’ll be interesting to see how folks react to it.\nThe world changes very abruptly in the first episode, and then it is quite different. It’s the modern world — the world we live in — but it changes very abruptly. And the consequences that that reaps hopefully provide drama for many, many episodes after that.\nPerhaps more than any other streaming service, Apple TV+ has gained the reputation of wanting to work with A-list talent on big and buzzy projects. But this is arguably the first time that the platform has put its resources behind a proven duo. Gilligan is one of the most popular writers in television, going back to his time on The X-Files. Seehorn, meanwhile, emerged as the beating heart of Better Call Saul and a phenomenal performer, with hopes that she will receive an overdue Emmy win for her performance as Kim Wexler.\nThe combination of the platform and the talent, both in front of and behind the camera, makes the upcoming show one to watch for. It'll be filmed in Albuquerque, the famous setting of the Breaking Bad world, and Gilligan mentions in the same interview that work on the project is set to ramp up again soon. It could be even more exciting when more details and castings are eventually shared.\nRelated: Better Call Saul Has 46 Nominations, But Hasn't Won A Single Emmy - That's Absurd\nSeehorn is Emmy-nominated for the second half of Better Call Saul. In comments before the actors' strike, the actor made no secret that she hopes to play Kim again someday. For now, her next endeavor with Breaking Bad creator has all the right components to capture attention once it finally debuts.\nSource: Variety\nAbdullah Al-Ghamdi joined Screen Rant in 2019.

Netflix's critically acclaimed Bridgerton took the world by storm, bringing Julia Quinn's book series to life and serializing the loves, scandals, and adventures of the children of the late Viscount Bridgerton. The deep dive into the personal lives of Bridgerton's high society made the series a breakout hit. It quickly brought about the development of a second season, as well as the prequel limited series Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.\nAs of now, the Bridgerton universe's production company Shondaland has yet to confirm Queen Charlotte season 2. And although Bridgerton season 3 and 4 have been confirmed, solid release dates have yet to be established, leaving fans burning for more addictive narratives and historical romances of the 19th century. Fortunately, Bridgerton fans don't have to wait until those pesky, undisclosed release dates to enjoy another period piece. Apple TV+ will soon release its own historical drama, and it has the potential to win them over.\nApple recently released a trailer for its upcoming eight-episode drama The Buccaneers, and it promises to become one of several suitable replacements for Bridgerton to watch in the wait for season 3. The British series is set to premiere on the streaming platform on Wednesday, November 8. The Buccaneers will follow similar storylines and feature familiar themes from Shondaland's acclaimed Netflix series. The Buccaneers centers on a lively group of American girls who, despite rejecting the gender roles of high society in 1870s London, are shipped off to attend a debutante ball and secure suitors.\nLeading The Buccaneers' cast of characters is Sierra Burgess Is a Loser star Kristine Froseth as Nan St. George, 13 Reasons Why's Alisha Boe as Conchita Closson, and the Saved by the Bell reboot's Josie Totah as Mabel. The cast will also include Christina Hendricks (Mad Men), Imogen Waterhouse (The Irregulars), Josh Dylan (Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again), and Kate Winslet's daughter Mia Threapleton (I Am Ruth). Katherine Jakeways, writer of the British TV series Tracey Ullman's Show, serves as The Buccaneers' writer and creator, while Doctor Who alum Beth Willis serves as executive producer alongside Jakeways, George Faber, and Susanna White.\nHints from the trailer suggest fans of Bridgerton may find The Buccaneers a suitable replacement for several reasons. The Buccaneers will follow a group of young women as they balance their love/hate relationship to romance during the particularly confining period of the 1870s — so not long after Bridgerton's Regency era setting. The Buccaneers will tell its story quite similarly to Bridgerton, underlining the overall narrative with whirlwind romances, pushback against societal constructs, and exquisite fashions.\nThe Buccaneers' trailer might not reveal enough to convince fans to watch it in Bridgerton's stead, but period piece aficionados will be intrigued to know that Apple TV's new series is based on the unfinished, same-titled novel by Edith Wharton. Like Bridgerton and other successful period films and series — including Pride and Prejudice, Becoming Jane, and Outlander — The Buccaneers will be adapted from a source novel. The Buccaneers may not be the end-all, be-all for Shondaland fans. However, it holds promise and enough likeness to Bridgerton to pacify audiences until the highly anticipated season 3 releases.\n"}
{"title": "Miranda’s Victim Review: Important Drama Is Elevated By Outstanding Performances", "date": "2023-10-05 19:35:26", "text": "Not a single performance was wasted in Miranda’s Victim, which is exactly the kind of production you need from such a heavy story.\n“You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say will be used against you in a court of law…” Under the fifth amendment of the US Constitution, Miranda Rights protect people from self-incrimination. We hear them often in crime shows and films, but the story behind their creation is a shocking one. Director Michelle Danner brings to life this true story based on the 1966 Supreme Court decision that changed America forever. In Miranda’s Victim, Abigail Breslin stars as a victim of one of the most heinous crimes imaginable. George Kolber and Richard Lasser developed the story and J. Craig Stiles penned the screenplay of this well-acted, shocking story of events that would change crime reporting and our justice system forever.\nTrish Weir (Breslin) is a kindhearted and shy eighteen-year-old. After getting off at her bus stop from a long night at work and beginning her walk home, Trish is kidnapped and raped. Through countless recalls with the local police officers, Trish finally identifies her assailant, Ernesto Miranda (Sebastian Quinn). Miranda confesses without legal representation and serves a two-year sentence, which is later overturned. Trish wants to put her trauma behind her, but Lawrence Turoff (Luke Wilson), the prosecutor overseeing the case, is determined to hold Ernesto accountable for his crimes. But with Ernesto’s defense attorney, John Flynn (Ryan Phillippe), standing in his way, that proves to be more challenging.\nThroughout Danner’s film, there is one thing that is vastly clear: Rape reporting and convictions have been a trouble spot in our legal system for a very long time. Though Miranda Rights serve their purpose and belong in the constitution, their origin can very well leave a bad taste in your mouth. Through Weir, we see how little support there is when it comes to reporting such crimes, whether that be from your own mother, husband, or the courts. But something that Miranda’s Victim does well is show Trish’s bravery in dealing with her trauma while pushing through and using her voice to get her rapist convicted. We don’t often see this depicted on the big screen, so it’s a breath of fresh air to be reminded that women are multifaceted and able to take on the very same things that bring them trauma.\nThe script appropriately demonstrates just how difficult standing up to one’s rapist can be. Though the screenplay, written by J. Craig Styles, takes us through Trish’s trauma and fight for justice in equal doses, it is Danner’s direction that pushes the visuals a bit far in the storytelling. We're well aware of what a rape scene looks like, and the visual impact it brings. But we’ve also moved past the point of needing them to prove a point. And in Miranda’s Victim, the graphic visuals serve very little service to the story other than reminder flashbacks and ways to emphasize Trish’s ongoing nightmares. Subtlety would have been the best approach here and a redirection to the film’s style and personality would’ve been better suited.\nDespite these minor hiccups, it is clear Danner understands the sensitive content of the story. Visually, the other parts of the story work in and out of the courtroom when it comes to shaping Trish’s feelings throughout the years. Crucially, Danner gives her actors the space to excel in every moment, giving us a compelling final product that is worth the watch. Abigail Breslin certifies her talent with every tear shed while giving an equally amazing physical performance. Ryan Phillippe also returns to form with his cutthroat approach to his character John Flynn. Not a single performance is wasted in Miranda’s Victim, which is exactly the kind of production you need from such a heavy story.\nUltimately, this story, likely unfamiliar to the masses, conveys the hidden history behind Miranda Rights with conviction and great storytelling. Breslin leads this ensemble cast with confidence, reminding us that her Oscar nomination for Little Miss Sunshine was no fluke. Though Danner could have taken a more subtle approach in her visual cues, there’s no denying the lasting impact her feature will have given the origin of Miranda Rights. Even with the film’s simple style, this story is about one woman’s courage to tell her truth and get justice for herself, even if she had to face the Supreme Court to do so.\nMiranda's Victim will release in limited theaters and streaming on October 6. The film is 127 minutes and not rated.\nPatrice is a film/TV critic and editor based in southern California.

A spinoff of NBC’s classic sitcom Cheers, Frasier follows Dr. Frasier Crane, a successful Boston therapist who moves back to his hometown Seattle following his divorce from his wife. After landing a job as host of a radio call-in show in hopes of getting a fresh start, he begins to reconnect with his estranged family members. Airing from September 1993 to May 2004, Frasier earned a whooping thirty-seven Primetime Emmy Awards.\nSpeaking to The Guardian ahead of the release of the Frasier reboot, the 82-year-old legendary sitcom director explains that he came on board for the show because Kelsey Grammer, the award-winning actor who played the titular character in the original show, requested for him to come in. He also adds that he was not involved in the writing process of the pilot episode, he simply handed in a script. Read his full comment below:\nI had nothing to do with the writing of the pilot, or determining what it should be. I was just handed a script. Was it an easy decision to take it on? When Kelsey calls, you say yes!\nBurrows' has been working in television as far back as the 1970s, directing countless television shows and sitcoms. He was originally responsible for first bringing the Dr. Frasier Crane character to screens, back in 1984, when he created Cheers alongside Glen and Les Charles. Running the show 11 seasons, Cheers was widely lauded, receiving 28 Primetime Emmy Awards from a record of 117 nominations.\nFollowing the success of Cheers, Burrows went on to direct other notable shows like Wings, Friends, Will & Grace, Two and A Half Men, The Big Bang Theory, as well as Frasier. With Burrows confirmed to return to once again work on Frasier, with reports stating that the 82-year-old directed the first two episodes of the reboot, his inclusion in the show will come as good news to viewers of the original classic sitcom.\nRelated: Frasier Reboot Answers A Big Cheers Question 30 Years Later\nSeeing as there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the Frasier reboot, especially because the show is coming back nearly 20 years after it originally ended and a number of the key cast — David Hyde Pierce and Jane Leeves, who played Niles and Daphne, as well as the now deceased John Mahoney will not be returning. However, Burrows' experienced and familiar hands should come as a great boost for the forthcoming show.\nSource: The Guardian\nBoluwatife Adeyemi is a freelance writer currently contributing to Screen Rant as a TV and News Writer.

{"title": "1 Evil Dead Rise Line Finally Explains Why Deadites Are So Unpredictable", "date": "2023-10-05 19:30:32", "text": "The vicious and lethal Deadites of the Evil Dead franchise could probably kill their victims immediately, but instead they torment and disturb.\nAfter several movies displayed just how unpredictable the vicious Deadites can be when torturing their victims, one Evil Dead Rise line finally revealed what their motivation is. With few exceptions, the living victims of Deadites eventually die in gruesome fashion, and it's fairly clear that they have the ability to kill their victims whenever they want. But the defining characteristic of a Deadite possession is not the eventual outcome, it's the insane behavior of the possessed individuals while under the influence of the Deadites.\nAs the Evil Dead franchise has evolved, the Deadite behavior has ranged from almost silly to extremely disturbing, but the common thread is their completely unpredictable nature. There is no textbook Deadite possession, and each instance reveals new and twisted ways that the Deadites can morph flesh, spread their infection and torment the people closest to the victim. The true intention of the Deadites' behavior was finally revealed in Evil Dead Rise, and it explains all the madness sown by the Deadites throughout history.\nThe recordings of the priest found with the Naturom Demonto in the vault at the outset of Evil Dead Rise revealed the true intention of the Deadites chaos. As the priest, voiced by Evil Dead franchise star Bruce Campbell, describes, a Deadite \"takes its pleasure in creating terror through total chaos.\" The aim of the parasitic demons is not to kill their victims - it is to enjoy the fear created by their unpredictable behavior.\nThis explains most of the actions of the Deadites, and why they even go so far as to possess already-dead individuals. Rotting their victims from the inside out, appearing uninfected to deceive others, and the group-merging seen at the climax of Evil Dead Rise are all tricks that Deadites use to sow fear and chaos in whatever environment they happen to invade. The deceptions they use and the confusion they create also make it far easier for them to infect others, as observed when the Ellie Deadite appears to return to her uninfected state to trick her youngest daughter into opening the apartment door.\nRelated: Evil Dead: How Deadite Possession Really Works\nThe Deadites' desire for chaos explains why their possessed victims are so different in their appearance and abilities. While they are sometimes played almost as jokes (as was the case with Cougie the half-human, half-mascot Deadite in season 3 of Ash vs. Evil Dead) the various versions of the Deadites are totally unpredictable in their actions, making them that much harder to defeat. The Deadites find new ways to terrify with every interaction, resulting in some truly bizarre creatures.\nOne of the best examples occurs in Evil Dead Rise itself. The Ellie, Danny, and Bridget Deadites literally melt their bodies together to create a monstrous entity known as The Marauder, which is unlike anything ever seen in the Evil Dead movies or TV show. That merging makes very little sense - as three separate people, the Deadites would likely have an easier time pursuing and infecting Beth and Kassie. However, as The Marauder, they create something far scarier and more disturbing, which elevates the fear and chaos they crave.\n"}
{"title": "All The Assassin's Creed Games, Ranked Worst To Best", "date": "2023-10-05 19:30:32", "text": "The Assassin’s Creed series currently has 20 games including spin-offs and handheld releases - here’s how they all stack up compared to one another.\nBased on a unique premise, Assassin's Creed successfully combines historical fiction and action-adventure to create a series of pulpy extravaganzas. Although the franchise has had its ups and downs, it's continued to push boundaries, taking players into increasingly enveloping and engaging scenarios.\nRecent entries have taken players further into the past than ever before, and while opinions differ on its recent direction, the series has never strayed too long from providing fun and engaging titles. Assassin's Creed has never shied away from exploring new ideas and epochs, constantly evolving along with the industry and always offering something new that keeps critics satisfied and audiences in anticipation. Although the upcoming live-service hub Assassin's Creed Infinity presents worries for some series fans regarding the future direction of the franchise, no matter where the franchise heads in the future, it will have a strong legacy behind it.\nRelated: How To Play Every Assassin's Creed Game In Chronological Order\nWith awkward controls on the Nintendo DS and more emphasis on stealth that makes it feel more akin to Prince Of Persia than Assassin's Creed, Altaïr's Chronicles was a poor first attempt at a handheld that landed a measly 58 on Metacritic. While it is impressive that Ubisoft was able to put an open world into a DS cartridge, it is clearly a rushed product.\nThe biggest issue it faced with players was its length; it can be beaten completely in four to five hours. Even for an early Assassin's Creed, that is way too short. Sadly, it also suffered from a flaw that the very first Assassin's Creed had: the overrated protagonist Altaïr is not that interesting of a character.\nThe spin-off series of Assassin's Creed was never beloved, but Chronicles did provide a unique 2.5D side-scrolling experience. However, fans were displeased with the copy-paste style of many Assassin's Creed subseries entries.\nThe highlight of Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia came in the form of its 1918 Russian setting, an era more technologically advanced than the franchise has ever explored. The World War I setting was refreshing and the main character was interesting, but with a 61 on Metacritic, it still amounted to little more than an average clone of the first Chronicles game.\nRelated: Every Assassin's Creed Setting So Far (Spin-offs Included)\nAltair made his return to the series with Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines on the PlayStation Portable, one of only a few AC games made for handheld consoles. The gameplay was a step backward for the series - particularly since Assassin's Creed 2 had recently released as a superior sequel to the original game and set a new standard for the franchise. While it was praised for giving Altaïr a proper return in a better story than Altaïr's Chronicles, it only achieved a 63 on Metacritic.\nDespite the impressively large map for a handheld title, the comparably unpolished and choppy gameplay made Bloodlines an unappealing alternative to the console games. A lot of this was due to the limitations of the PSP, a common problem with the system's games.\nContinuing from the first Chronicles, Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India continues to explore more exotic settings, this time showcasing the beauty of India. Many praised the visuals of India, but, like Chronicles: Russia, the sequel just does not do anything to innovate the spin-off series.\nDespite its lack of innovation, those who enjoyed the inaugural Chronicles game will likely enjoy its follow-up despite its mediocre 64 on Metacritic. Although it may not be an Assassin's Creed spinoff worth playing for everyone, fans interested in a more challenging experience can find one in Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed & Other Games That Are Wonderful History Lessons\nEzio Auditore da Firenze finally got his chance to shine in a handheld title with Assassin's Creed 2: Discovery. As such, the game received praise for continuing the legacy of one of the most beloved main characters of the whole franchise and managing to improve upon the formula.\nUnfortunately, Discovery doesn't quite manage to be anything beyond solid, showcased by the 69 it received on Metacritic. Like Altaïr's Chronicles, the game is far too short and largely comes across as a watered-down clone of Prince Of Persia, albeit with a decent story that takes place after the events of Assassin's Creed 2's DLC.\nThe first of the Chronicles spin-offs is definitely the best, taking players to one of the most perfect Assassin's Creed settings for the first time. The main protagonist, Shao Jun, has the credit of being one of the franchise's first playable female Assassins. The character was also praised due to her more grounded story and respectable portrayal of an Asian character.\nA more straightforward side-scrolling action/stealth game, Chronicles: China is a refreshing break from the open-world vastness of the main titles. The game's average score of a 69 on Metacritic showcases its limitations, but the title could have been a lot worse. There's no reason for hardcore Assassin's Creed fans to not give Chronicles: China a chance.\nRelated: How Assassin's Creed Jade Is Changing AC Combat & Gameplay\nDespite its title making it sound like DLC for Assassin's Creed 3, Liberation is actually a spin-off developed exclusively for the new - at the time - PlayStation Vita. When it comes to the Vita, Assassin's Creed 3: Liberation is often considered a must-have game for Sony's most recent handheld.\nIt keeps the typical open-world gameplay that Assassin's Creedis known for and, despite some slowdown, manages to hold up reasonably against its console counterparts. It is praised for replicating the Assassin's Creed 3 gameplay while introducing the first female Assassin and a unique new location. Liberation was so beloved - relative to the other side games, at least - that it even got an HD remake for two different generations of consoles.\n2014 was not a good year for Assassin's Creed. Both releases received the lowest scores of any console games in the entire franchise, with Assassin's Creed: Unity achieving a score of 71 on Metacritic. The plot is set during the French Revolution and centers on Arno Victor Dorian's efforts to expose the true powers behind the revolution. It's a setup AC fans had been hoping to see for some time, but it was marred with shortcomings.\nOften considered the worst Assassin's Creed, Unitydrew criticism centered on the game's small scope and numerous technical issues which included bugs and glitches, poor graphics, and performance and connectivity issues. Although patches improved the game and its parkour system was exciting, it never reached the heights of prior titles.\nRelated: Ubisoft Learned The Wrong Lessons From Assassin's Creed Unity\nThe first of two games released in 2014, Assassin's Creed: Rogue's final mission actually serves as the prologue for Unity. Set during the Seven Years' War, Rogue follows Shay Patrick Cormac, an Assassin turned Templar, in his efforts to hunt down and kill members of the Brotherhood who betrayed him.\nWith a weighted average of 72, Rogue holds a \"mixed or average reviews\" grade on Metacritic. Praise went to the primary twist of playing as an Assassin's Creed Templar instead of an Assassin, as well as the complexity of the titular character. The game, however, failed to innovate or deliver a sailing experience as strong as Black Flag and featured a generally predictable plot.\nThings improved somewhat in 2015, though the franchise remained at a low point with Assassin's Creed: Syndicate. With a Metacritic score of 76, firmly set on the \"mixed or average reviews\" camp, Syndicate follows twin Assassins Jacob and Evie Frye's attempts to take back their city from Templar control.\nSet in Victorian-era London, Syndicate offered an improvement on Unity and Rogue, with particular praise going to the plot, graphics, and missions. Many considered it a return to form for the franchise, although the repetitiveness of the gameplay acted as a strong downside.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed Syndicate: Evie Deserved To Be The Main Character\nThe game that started it all, the first Assassin's Creed showed the promise of the series from the beginning. It takes place during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land and introduces Desmond Miles, the franchise's modern-day lead - at least, during the first few games. The central conflict between Assassins and Templars is also introduced.\nPraised for its innovative premise, engaging storytelling and visuals, and overall originality, Assassin's Creed received a weighted average of 80 on Metacritic. Although its innovations are still interesting today, the characters and gameplay of later entries have improved in variety and entertainment.\nThe fourth game in the main series, Revelations continues the story of Desmond Miles, still voiced by Nolan North, as he tries to avert the 2012 apocalypse. It is mainly set during the 12th and 13th-century in Masyaf, Cappadocia, and Constantinople.\nFollowing up the acclaim offered to Assassin's Creed 2 and Brotherhood, Revelations took a slight downturn by adding only superficial additions and covering a less compelling part of Ezio's complete Assassin's Creed story. It still brought a solid experience to the table and also stands as the first and so far only game where all its versions received the same grade on Metacritic, with PC, Xbox 360, and PS3 all getting an 80 \"generally favorable\" review.\nRelated: Dawn Of Ragnarok's Trailer Has A Hidden Nod To AC Revelations\nPremiering in 2018, Assassin's Creed: Odyssey brought the franchise into full RPG mode. Odyssey took players further into the past than ever before, taking place between the years 431-422 BC. Set against the backdrop of the Peloponnesian War, the player controls a mercenary who fights for both sides as they attempt to find their family.\nOdyssey received critical acclaim for its characters (particularly when choosing the strong Assassin's Creed protagonist Kassandra), scope, setting, plot, gameplay, and story, gaining an 85 on Metacritic. However, the game's reach sometimes exceeded its grasp, and a focus on having an enormous amount of content led to some of the missions feeling repetitive or trite. With a focus on making players explore and grind for achievement, Odyssey's best features could only sometimes overcome its weaknesses.\nThe sequel to Revelations and the fifth game overall, Assassin's Creed 3 continues the apocalypse storyline and is set during the American Revolution. It received generally positive reviews, with an average weighted score of 83 on Metacritic.\nThe game courted some controversy when it was accused of anti-British sentiment while promoting American nationalism, particularly in its marketing. Once released, critics agreed that the depiction of both sides was balanced, with reviewers concurring with the developers claim that the game did not portray or endorse jingoism. Assassin's Creed 3's excellent opening gives way to uneven story pacing, which coincided with a buggy release to make Assassin's Creed 3 compare unfavorably against the high points of the Ezio games. Highlights like naval combat and tomahawk action, however, go a long way in counterbalancing flaws.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed 3 Gave Connor The Series' Coolest Weapon\nThe latest entry into the Assassin's Creed RPG venture, Valhalla serves as a successor to Odyssey. Set during the Viking Invasion of Britain circa 872 CE, the player assumes control of the Viking Eivor, who becomes involved in the ancient conflict between Templars and Assassins.\nHighly anticipated since its announcement, Valhalla received praise for its narrative and world design. Some side content can feel repetitive, but a less grindy approach to equipment marks an improvement from Odyssey. An average score of 83 on Metacritic shows that Valhalla's familiar approach doesn't hold it back from being a good overall experience.\nAssassin's Creed Mirage is a prequel to Valhalla, taking place 11 years before in ancient Baghdad, with its story centering on a street thief turned Hidden One, Basim Ibn Ishaq. Basim plays a key role in Valhalla, but Mirage is perfectly playable as a standalone experience, using its predecessor's foundation to deliver a game closer to the classic stealth action the series was known for originally. The overarching story of Mirage falters in some key places, but its gameplay is a delightful throwback, and the majority of its immediate narrative within Baghdad more than makes up for any low points.\nMirage feels like a return to the series' roots through-and-through, recentering the conflict between the Hidden Ones and the Order of the Ancients, organizations that would go on to become the Assassin Brotherhood and Templar Order respectively. This focus makes assassination Basim's main objective in numerous missions, peeling back the facade of Baghdad's high society to find the Order's rot within. This focus on investiagation makes it heavily reminiscent of the original Assassin's Creed, but Mirage doesn't suffer from the same repetitiveness.\nRelated: \"A Triumphant Homage\" - Assassin's Creed Mirage Review\nBlack Flag represented substantially different gameplay from prior Assassin's Creed games. Set in the 18th-century Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy, the game features a great deal of ship-based action, with particular emphasis on strategy and exploration. Black Flag follows Welsh pirate Edward Kenway, voiced by Matt Ryan, who stumbles upon the Assassin/Templar conflict.\nCritically acclaimed upon release, Black Flag made an interesting and successful change-up to the traditional formula. Although Black Flag's open world tends to ping-pong players from mission to mission, its large scope marked an exciting change for the series, and its expansion of Assassin's Creed 3's naval gameplay resonated with fans. With an 85 Metacritic score, it received high notes in all its iterations, with its PS3 version as the highest-rated.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed: Edward Kenway Deserved His Own Ezio Trilogy\nEntering into the golden age of Assassin's Creed, Brotherhood marks the second installment of the Assassin's Creed trilogy headlined by protagonist Ezio Auditore da Firenze. His quest to restore the Assassin order continues, as well as his goal of bringing down his enemies, the powerful Borgia family.\nSet in 16th-century Italy, mainly Rome, Brotherhood earned critical acclaim. The PS3 version achieved a 90 on Metacritic, although its weighted average is 89 when counting the Xbox 360 and PC versions. Although the story doesn't always operate at the heights of Assassin's Creed 2, an excellent setting, improved gameplay, and interesting side content made it a more than worthy follow-up to a legendary predecessor.\nAssassin's Creed: Origins is set in Egypt at the end of the Ptolemaic Period circa 49 BCE. It explores the conflict between the Hidden Ones, ancestors of the Assassins, and The Order of the Ancients, who were forerunners of the Templars. It emphasizes role-playing elements but retains the open-world and stealth elements typical of the franchise.\nThe enormous Assassin's Creed Origins mapleads to a slower pace than prior games in the series, but the game excels in many other regards. The engaging protagonist Bayek has a compelling and personal story, and clearing enemy camps proves more engaging than prior games thanks to interesting combat and design. With an average of 83 on Metacritic, indicating \"generally positive reviews,\" Origins successfully took Assassin's Creed into new and exciting territory.\nRelated: Assassin's Creed Origins Bayek Cosplay Is Worthy Of The Gods\nAssassin's Creed 2 turned the franchise into a true force with which to be reckoned in the gaming world. Taking place at the height of the Italian Renaissance, the plot follows Ezio as he seeks vengeance against those who betrayed his family, discovering mysteries left behind by an ancient race known as the First Civilization.\nCritically acclaimed at the time of its release, Assassin's Creed 2's realistic open world, in which the player can explore Florence, Venice, Monteriggioni, and Forli, received universal praise. This perspective holds up today, as limited combat options and a smaller scope fail to drag down a tight, focused story and gameplay experience.Plenty of great Assassin's Creedgames have released since Ezio's first adventure, but the rooftops of Venice still stand tall above the rest.\nSource: Ubisoft/YouTube\nDavid is a twenty-nine-year-old Mexican writer and reader.

{"title": "Gen V Drops An Explosive Track By Christopher Lennertz & Matt Bowen [EXCLUSIVE]", "date": "2023-10-05 19:22:19", "text": "Exclusive: Screen Rant offers a first listen to “Flashpoint” from the upcoming Gen V soundtrack album by Christopher Lennertz & Matt Bowen.\nGen V proves that there is plenty of room for expansion in the world of The Boys. The spinoff series has managed to capture the violence, humor, and social commentary The Boys is known for, even as it introduces a slew of new Supes for whom powers may be as much of a curse as they are a blessing. Though Gen V boasts an exciting new cast led by Chilling Adventures of Sabrina alums Jaz Sinclair as Marie Moreau and Chance Perdomo as Andre Anderson, it was created by Eric Kripke, Craig Rosenberg, and Evan Goldberg, who all helped bring The Boys to life.\nAlso jumping from The Boys to Gen V are composers Christopher Lennertz and Matt Bowen. The pair have written music for The Boys since season 1, and Matt Bowen has spoken with Screen Rant about how they approached scoring that series. Now, Screen Rant is excited to share a piece of music Bowen and Lennertz have composed for Gen V. Check out “Flashpoint” below:\nAs can be heard above, “Flashpoint” is an exciting track full of dramatic twists and turns. It’s clear Bowen and Lennertz have taken plenty of inspiration from their work on The Boys, using many of the same techniques in Gen V. Still, with Gen V’s main characters bringing something new to the world, Lennertz and Bowen have incorporated new elements into their music as well. Both composers touched on their difference in approach to Gen V and their excitement in scoring the series:\nMatt Bowen: The writers and actors did such a great job setting this up as a spinoff. Chris and I just followed their lead when looking for our own inspiration. The music is still rooted in the world of The Boys, but it has fresh flavors and themes just like the show has fresh characters and storylines.\nChristopher Lennertz: From the beginning, the idea of expanding the sonic world of The Boys for a new group of Supes and a whole new setting and set of powers was an exciting opportunity. We had a chance to take all the violent dissonance and warped chaos of our Vought universe, but filter it through a new lens: the excitement of students at the very beginning of their journeys, as heroes in training. We hope that we created a sound that feels familiar, yet even more eclectic and powerful.\nWith so much crossover potential between The Boys and Gen V, it makes sense Lennertz and Bowen would keep the musical identity of each show relatively similar. With the story of Gen V so tied to the events of The Boys, a meeting of characters from both shows feels inevitable. If and when that does happen, the inclusion of new instruments to the spinoff’s musical palette, such as 808 drums and featured vocalists, will make for a fun blending of The Boys’ themes with those from Gen V.\nNew episodes of Gen V release on Fridays on Prime Video. The Gen V (Prime Original Series Soundtrack) will be released on digital platforms on October 6th.\n"}
{"title": "MCU Phase 5's Avengers Replacements Prove Marvel Fixed A Long-Standing Phase 2 Critique", "date": "2023-10-05 19:20:27", "text": "The MCU's origin story formula has become repetitive, but the Multiverse Saga's new characters prove that Marvel is working to subvert expectations.\nWith the Marvel Cinematic Universe moving into a new era with the Multiverse Saga, the franchise’s latest new characters prove that the studio has acknowledged early criticism. Every iconic character that has debuted in the MCU timeline comes with their own origin story, and the formula for these origin stories has been relatively straightforward since the MCU Phase 1. A character will be introduced as an underdog of sorts, with their first film usually showing them getting used to their unique powers while sometimes teasing another MCU character alongside them.\nWhile it is the classic superhero origin story, the repetitiveness of it started to wear on audiences as the MCU progressed. By the time of films like Ant-Man and Doctor Strange, the origin story formula had already been done with numerous heroes beforehand. Most of the origins followed the same story beats and even included the same kind of villain that mirrored the hero. The end of the Infinity Saga was the perfect time for the studio to act on the criticism, and the Multiverse Saga’s new characters have already proven that the Phase 5 and 6 movies will start branching out from the origin story formula.\nThe Multiverse Saga has most notably seen the introduction of several younger heroes to the MCU. These younger heroes have often debuted alongside more established MCU characters, and their ties to their mentors contribute to part of their origin story. Yelena Belova and America Chavez were only supporting characters in their respective films, but their origin stories were effectively fleshed out without needing a solo film. Even characters who debuted in a Disney+ series, like Kate Bishop, have shown off the MCU’s new take on origin stories in a more condensed setting.\nRelated: Marvel’s MCU Young Avengers Cast (As We Know It)\nKamala Khan’s origin story can be considered the most akin to the standard formula since she has a solo series that explores her powers. However, Ms. Marvel still manages to subvert from the Phase 1 origin story tradition by not having her save the world from some big bad or uprooting her whole life because of her newfound hero identity. Phase 5 and 6’s new take on character introductions suggest that the MCU has developed enough that they don’t need to stick to a traditional trend or formula and that the studio can take more liberties with origin stories with so much lore already developed.\nThe MCU’s Phase 1 origin story formula may have been the most effective way to translate a comic story to the big screen at the time, but the franchise has evolved past that. There is such a huge range of origin stories in the comics that the MCU subverting from tradition will be the best way to mirror its unique source material. With over 30 films in the MCU already, the superhero origin stories were starting to get too predictable. Marvel changing things up will help keep the franchise feeling fresh and creative going into a new era of the Phase 6 projects.\nPhases 1 and 2 of the MCU are undoubtedly iconic, but the standard storytelling format introduced in these phases could only work for so long. Going into the Multiverse Saga, Marvel had to do something to address the criticism of their redundant origin story formula. Whether it be alongside their mentor or in the grounded setting of teenage life, Phase 5 has already introduced new characters in ways that differ from before. With a shift in focus towards younger heroes and Disney+ being a whole new platform for the MCU to play with, Phase 6 should only continue to subvert expectations.\n"}

But leave it up to comic books to give fans what they want because, in a Terminator issue from the early '90s, one of the grossest fan theories out there has already been confirmed to be true.\nThe Terminator: One Shot by James Robinson and Matt Wagner was released the same year as Terminator 2: Judgment Day and focuses on another “wrong Sarah Connor” that Skynet has targeted for destruction. Hunted down by a T-800 Terminatrix, Sarah is protected by a future Resistance member named Ellis Ruggles (who has been kicking around since 1955).\nEllis saves Sarah by using a large “Electro-Mech Fazer” against the Terminatrix, revealed later to have been built by hiding pieces of it in his body during his time travel trip.\nRelated: The First Terminator Had 1 Weapon That Could Destroy Arnie's T-800\nThe franchise's time travel is unable to send anything synthetic through time without a layer of organic material wrapped around it to help make the transition (the reason Terminators look like fleshy humans when sent on missions and arrive naked). Because of this, both the Terminators and the rebels sent back to stop them usually have to fend for themselves for clothing and weapons when they arrive at their temporal destination, leading fans to speculate that John Connors’ agents should be able to bring back advanced technology inside their bodies to help mitigate this disadvantage - something this comic issue directly addresses.\nObviously an uncomfortable choice, since rebels would have to either surgically implant pieces of weapons into their bodies or use more of a discomfiting approach to smuggling everything, this tactic nevertheless gives humans a major advantage in stopping the machines by giving them access to technology that won’t exist for decades. Furthermore, sending more than one person through time, each stocked up internally with contraband, would allow John Connor to essentially build whatever he wanted in the past to help his future self. It's a gross tactic, but one worth exploring if it can help save all of humanity.\nEssentially evening the odds between a human-sized flesh-covered weapon and an actual human with \"hidden\" weapons, this fan theory, though never technically seen in the films, is proven in this issue to work as something that the Resistance forces need to utilize more often.\nJohn Connor’s struggle to save humanity seems to be a never-ending one, so if he could find a way to send even more internally weaponized rebels to fight past Terminators, there at least will always be a fighting chance to take down these evil machines once and for all!\nBrian is first and foremost a nerd in every way shape and form. He likes to compare himself to a black hole, consuming any and every form of entertainment unlucky enough to get caught in his gravitational pull. It's not uncommon on any given day for him to read a couple comics, settle down with a good book, watch a few movies (inside and out of the theater), catch up on his ever growing but never depleting streaming queue, challenge himself with a few good video games, and of course, write his heart out.

{"title": "Who The “Reptile” Is In Netflix’s 2023 Movie – Title Explained", "date": "2023-10-05 19:10:27", "text": "Reptile is an intriguing name for the new thriller starring Benicio Del Toro. Here's who the \"reptile\" in Netflix's 2023 movie really is. \nWarning: This article contains spoilers for Reptile!\nWith so many mercurial characters and ambiguous situations in Netflix's 2023 film Reptile, the meaning behind the title points to the heart of the mystery Detective Nichols (Benicio Del Toro) is trying to solve. Nichols has transferred police departments and operates in the small community of Scarborough under the avuncular eye of Captain Allen, his wife's uncle. When a young real estate agent named Summer is killed, several suspects emerge from the darkness that enshrouds her idyllic life; Sam, an ex-husband, Will Grady (Justin Timberlake) a new boyfriend and fellow realtor born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and Eli Phillips, a neighbor with a personal vendetta.\nAs the investigation into Summer's death goes deeper, Nichols discovers that what he thinks he knows about all the characters in Reptile isn't what it appears to be. Shifting allegiances, ulterior motives, and all the hallmarks of a first-rate thriller and film-noir are on display, and at the heart of it stands a detective trying to make sense of it while keeping his integrity intact. By the end of Reptile, the explosive finale drives home why the dissonant title has so much bearing on the plot, and why the natural stages of a reptile's life cycle fits the way that the characters operate within it.\nReptile's title points to the titular entity's \"shedding of skin,\" which can be seen as a metaphor for the way the characters reveal themselves to be corrupt after previously presenting as benign. The director explained to Netflix; \"In the movie, characters are introduced as one thing and revealed to be something else,” Singer continues. “There’s a shedding of skin that occurs, and it felt like an appropriate metaphor for the film. Some of the most unethical people in the film can be very likable in moments.” Not only is this true of Nichols' boss Captain Allen, or Will Grady, Summer's grieving boyfriend with a sinister side, but of Nichols himself.\nAs Nichols' investigation peels away the layers of different characters' facades, and likable people in his life emerge as literal snakes in the grass, Nichols also goes through a shedding of skin, but for the languorous detective, the process works in reverse. He's trying to get rid of a reputation for taking bribes and keeping contraband that he acquired at his previous department, so while other characters become more corrupt, Nichols' true nature emerges as more altruistic. By the end of the film, he cannot in good conscience allow the illegal actions of those closest to him, and even his superiors, to continue.\nUnfortunately for Nichols, the final shedding of skin occurs in his own department, where even his closest friends are caught up in a scheme involving Grady's shell real estate company White Fish. When Nichols finds out that certain officers have been placing contraband in houses, seizing them, and then allowing White Fish to buy them for dirt cheap to flip at incredible profits, he has to confront the people he trusts the most, including the chief of police. It's only after Nichols has made it clear he won't be part of their plan that his transformation is complete, and he can honestly say to himself that he's a good cop.\nReptile explores themes of transformation, perspective, and survival in the natural world. Whereas some characters seem destined to remain the same and make the same mistakes, some can surmount fate and oppose what seems like an inevitable degradation of the human spirit. It's natural for snakes and reptiles to shed their skin as they outgrow it, and Reptile explores how that can be both the sign of a new beginning and a further indictment of character depending on perspective, and with Nichols providing the film's point of view, he presents a realistic arbiter the audience can relate to.\nSource: Netflix\n"}

Tumi finally made it to the yacht Mustique in Italy after having visa issues in customs. She and Kyle were both stuck there and had to sit out the first charter. When Tumi met Natalya for the first time, it was clear there was some tension, and Natalya believed it had to do with Kyle.\nReddit user emergencyelk95, took a screengrab from Bravo's Below Deck Instagram account. In the screengrab, Natalya's going off in the comment section about Tumi and Kyle. Natalya's first comment was, \"My biggest pet peeve is when someone lets a certain person influence their opinion on someone before even meeting them.\" Natalya is clearly talking about Tumi and how Kyle likely said some not-so-nice things about her after their charter season together on Below Deck Med season 7.\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nIn her next comment, she wrote, \"My other pet peeve would be ungrateful people who can’t even say thank you for holding do the fort for 4 days, while being crew down, while setting up a boat, while running on no sleep.\" ﻿During the most recent Below Deck Med season 8 episode, Tumi revealed in one of her confessionals that Kyle had warned her about Natalya. He told her how he and Natalya had their ups and downs last season, so Tumi was simply trying to make Natalya know that she was the boss. However, Natalya didn't appreciate how Tumi didn't give her the props for holding down the fort while she was gone.\nKyle clearly gave Tumi the rundown from last season and poisoned the relationship between Tumi and Natalya before it could even begin. It was clear when Natalya was showing Tumi the boat that Tumi had preconceived notions of Natalya. While Kyle and Natalya seemingly left the boat on good terms, it seems Kyle still had some issues with Natalya, some of which were shown in the Below Deck Med season 8 trailer.\nJudging by the trailer, the interior crew is going to have some issues going forward. Even though Kyle still had some underlying issues with Natalya, he should have let Tumi have an opinion of her on her own. Kyle giving Tumi the rundown on Natalya before the start of the season could potentially ruin their season.\nBelow Deck Mediterranean airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.\nSources: emergencyelk95/Reddit, Below Deck/Instagram\n"}

The 48-year-old Pennsylvania native recently completed his journey in Before the 90 Days season 6. On the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off, he dated Vietnamese single mom Violet Tuyet, hoping to marry her. Unfortunately, things didn’t work out between the two, leading to their split. Riley and Violet had no romantic chemistry at all. But at the Tell-All, Violet accused Riley of getting her pregnant. However, Riley surprised her by revealing he wasn’t fertile.\nWhile Riley’s connection with Violet didn’t go as intended, his new friendship with Kimberly may become fruitful. Recently, viewers spotted Riley getting flirty with Usman “Sojaboy” Umar’s ex. The duo interacted on a live video call on Instagram and planned to meet up. 90 Day Fiancé fan account 90 Day The Melanated Way posted the proof of Riley and Kimberly’s interaction and shared the gossip.\nThe fan account wrote, “Riley is heading down to visit Kimberly in SD later this month and let’s just say ‘date night’ is planned.” The admin of the fan account added fire to the rumors by stating that Riley’s dad already refers to Kimberly as his “daughter-in-law.”\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nAs expected, many 90 Day Fiance viewers took to the comments section to express their surprise and excitement about the news as they thought Riley and Kimberly made sense. Even co-stars such as Sumit Singh and Jenny Slatten were shocked about the sudden turn of events. Kimberly’s son Jamal Menzies also fueled the fire by stating he’ll “stop by” during the date. Unfortunately, the duo in question shut down the romance rumors by addressing their relationship. Kimberly commented, “No no no no. We are friends ONLY. D*** we can’t be friends?” Riley jumped into the conversation and told the 90 Day Fiancé fan account, “You never cease to amaze me lol.”\nFans aren’t wrong to get excited about Kimberly and Riley’s potential relationship. Both cast members were in bad relationships and would suit each other well. Kimberly dated Usman, who seemed to only care about making his name and didn’t respect her. Riley dated Violet, who called him “ugly” and didn’t care for his romantic gestures. Kimberly and Riley had similar heartbreaks, which would help them relate to each other. They are also both Americans and won’t have a cultural difference. Kimberly and Riley could be well-suited for 90 Day: The Single Life season 4.\nRiley seems like a much better fit for Kimberly as well. Usman cared for the San Diego woman but didn’t respect her enough. He made comments about her looks and didn’t love her sufficiently. In comparison, Riley cared for Violet and bought her many gifts. He wanted to make the relationship work and didn’t worry about her past for the longest time. Riley is a much better potential partner for Kimberly because the two don’t have a significant age gap or cultural differences. Unlike Kimberly’s last boyfriend, the new 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star also doesn’t want a child.\nSource: 90 Day The Melanated Way/Instagram\n"}

Created by Vince Gilligan, the acclaimed crime drama first aired in 2008, chronicling the journey of Bryan Cranston's Walter White from mild-mannered chemistry teacher to the biggest drug kingpin in New Mexico. Aaron Paul costars in the show as Jesse, Walt's former student and eventual business partner, with the two have a major falling out in Breaking Bad season 5, the show's last.\nNow, in a recent interview with SlashFilm, Schnauz and Mastras reveal that there was originally a very different direction planned for Jesse's character arc in Breaking Bad season 5. What ultimately changed things, however, was the decision to have Jesse Plemons' Todd kill Drew Sharp in \"Dead Freight\" the show's train heist episode. Check out Schnauz and Mastras full comments about the change below:\nSchnauz: \"We had all these ideas of Walt's going to retire, and Jesse's going to be the big meth guy in Albuquerque. And once the kid got shot, that all got wiped off the table. \n“When we write, we flowchart a lot. And we say, 'What if this happened? What if that happens?' And one of the logical things is that Jesse is in the meth business and he's proud of what he does and he's good at it, and they're making the big bucks. And so the logical thing would be that Jesse would continue and Walt would get too sick to continue or pull away and let Jesse take over the operation.\n\"Walt, [unlike Jesse], can compartmentalize. They've done so many terrible things [...] So many things that he's pressed down that he tries to convince Jesse that yes, it was a horrible, terrible thing, but be strong and move on, and come with me on the successful journey that we're on because Mike's leaving so Walt doesn't want to be on his own.\"\nMastras: \"[Drew Sharp's death] really turned into the catalyst for the end really, spinning, turning Jesse against Walt. And that gave us that tool, I think unknowingly at the time, to really have that be the central conflict between the two characters that led to the overall ending.\"\nJesse, with Walt, is one of the most important characters in Breaking Bad, playing a central role in Walt's rise to power and subsequent fall. The two characters don't see eye to eye on most things, but they also need each other, with Walt memorably saying in season 1, \"You know the business, and I know the chemistry.\" While Walt's arc is what the show is essentially built around, Jesse's is just as crucial.\nWhere Walt is ambitious, driven, and ruthless to a fault, Jesse is, for parts of the show at least, basically the opposite. Jesse is, ostensibly, a loser, but he's also the heart of the series. Audiences care about Jesse because he's more empathetic, because he falls in love and cares about people, and because the horrible things he witnesses and participates in gnaw at his soul.\nThe decision to lean into this aspect of the character in Breaking Bad season 5 was for the best, as it speaks to Jesse's humanity. Jesse can't bear what happened to Drew, but Drew's death is really the last straw in a series of crushing deaths, betrayals, and hardships. While Breaking Bad's final season may still have worked if Jesse followed in Walt's footsteps and became a drug kingpin himself, exploring the softer and more human side of the character ultimately resulted in a powerful, cathartic, and more emotional ending.\nSource: SlashFilm\n"}
{"title": "The Rick And Morty Movie: Confirmation Chances, Release Date Prediction & Everything We Know", "date": "2023-10-05 19:00:32", "text": "A Rick and Morty movie has been discussed ever since the show first arrived in 2013, and over a decade later it may actually be happening.\nA Rick and Morty movie has been discussed almost since the shows debut back in 2013, both as a spinoff of the show and a live-action reimaging. While none of these ideas have reached the stage of development yet, there’s still be discussions about the possibility of a feature-length Rick and Morty adventure. With seven seasons behind it the show is entering a new era thanks to the departure of co-creator and voice actor Justin Roiland. Given that the future could see radical changes for Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith, there’s increased speculation that now could finally be the time for the Rick and Morty movie.\nThere have been several ideas for a Rick and Morty movie floated in the past by Dan Harmon, who created the show with Roiland but has been its main driving force for several years. The possibility of Rick and Morty getting a film adventure, be it on the big screen or as a double-length episode, hasn’t been ruled out by any of the Rick and Morty creative team, either. For the Rick and Morty movie it may be a case of not if it happens, but when, despite nothing official being confirmed yet.\nThe most recent news surrounding a possible Rick and Morty movie came on September 27, 2023. Dan Harmon gave an update on the Rick and Morty movie’s prospects. Surprisingly, Harmon revealed that conversations about a Rick and Morty movie were happening with studios prior to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes commenting earlier in the year. \nThe Rick and Morty co-creator revealed that a movie would be like a “super episode” akin to the likes of South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut. Now that the WGA strike has ended and SAG-AFTRA are expected to resolve their dispute with the AMPTP soon it’s possible that a Rick and Morty movie confirmation may actually arrive in the future after nearly a decade.\nThe Rick and Morty movie isn’t confirmed, although comments from Dan Harmon do indicate serious discussions have happened with studios behind the scenes. The prospects of a feature-length adventure for Rick, Morty, Beth, Summer, and Jerry has been discussed multiple times over the years, but seemingly not in any official capacity.\nThere’s no release date for the Rick and Morty movie yet, and until it’s picked up by a studio and enters development it’s impossible to predict one. However, it’s likely not a project that will arrive soon after being confirmed. Dan Harmon and the Rick and Morty team have famously never compromised the show’s quality by rushing to meet a release window. Given how important for the franchise a Rick and Morty movie would be, it’s a given they’d take their time ensuring it was the right story. A release date of 2027-2028 for the first Rick and Morty film isn’t at all unrealistic, and it could arrive even later.\nThe cast of the Rick and Morty movie would likely feature the same voice actors from the show. The Simpsons, Bob’s Burgers, South Park, and Futurama all kept the same cast for their feature length outings, and Rick and Morty is all but guaranteed to do the same. Comments from Harmon suggest that the movie would be like a “super episode” — what one would expect from Rick and Morty, but much more of it than the standard 20 minute-or-so-runtime allows.\nThis means the central cast of Sarah Chalke as Beth, Chris Parnell as Jerry, Spencer Grammer as Summer, and regular supporting voice actors like Kari Wahlgren, Phil Hendrie, and Cassie Steele would all be present. While they haven’t yet been revealed, the actors behind the re-casted Rick and Morty replacing Justin Roiland would also of course be part of the Rick and Morty movie cast.\nAnother option that has been floated is a live-action Rick and Morty movie. In this case the cast would be totally unknown, though there have been many suggestions for who could play Rick and Morty in live-action. Christopher Lloyd remains perhaps the most popular choice, and even appeared as Rick in a series of live-action shorts. \nThere are no hints as to what the story of the Rick and Morty movie would be. It’s likely Dan Harmon hasn’t fully concocted an idea yet, although he’s doubtless got several potential ones in mind. One possibility is that a feature-length Rick and Morty adventure could be a vehicle for resolving the meta-narrative of the show involving Rick Prime, Evil Morty, or maybe even Doofus Jerry from the Rick and Morty comic books. Until the movie is officially confirmed, however, it’s unclear what the plot could entail — and with a show like Rick and Morty the possibilities are limitless.\n"}

This article contains spoilers for Immortal Thor #2 Thor wields a power few other characters in the Marvel Universe can even understand, let alone match, and his all-new abilities only reinforces that assertion, as Thor debuts powers that would have assuredly redefined his MCU journey.\nThor Odinson is currently the All-Father and the King of Asgard in Marvel Comics continuity, though he’s made it clear on many occasions that he considers Midgard - or, Earth - to be just as much a home to him as Asgard, with Thor's Avengers membership being a key reason as to why. The same is true for Thor in the MCU. Though with every effort to defend the Earth in the films, Thor always creates an impressive amount of damage. From the destruction caused during the Battle of New York in The Avengers to the decimation of Sokovia in Avengers: Age of Ultron, Thor has regularly been at the center of chaos in the MCU. However, with this new ability that was just introduced in Immortal Thor, Thor could have fixed all that damage in a flash (and eliminated any of his enemies even faster) by tapping into a power known as his ‘Thor-Knowledge’.\nIn Immortal Thor #2 by Al Ewing and Martín Cóccolo, Thor is in New York City facing-off against an elder god who exists outside the Ten Realms, one of immense power and fury: Toranos. It was clear since the battle began that Thor was no match for Toranos, even with the Odin-Power. However, after Thor recognized that he, not Odin, was in control of the abilities he now wields, the power and knowledge passed down by Odin were now wholly his own. Therefore, what was once the power of Odin became officially recognized as the power of Thor, and what was once the Odin-Knowledge was now Thor-Knowledge. With this reframing of his mind and realignment of his cosmic energies, Thor was able to use the Thor-Knowledge to its fullest extent. Thor tore a hole in the fabric of reality, and threw Toranus through it to the edge of known existence. Then, he used this power to repair the damage that was done to New York City in an instant, with his only shortcoming being his inability to reverse the deaths of those who perished.\nThis ability would have been perfect for dealing with the Chitauri in The Avengers, or Ultron in Age of Ultron, or even Thanos in Infinity War (indeed, Thor faced Thanos before any other Avenger in that film). Not only would Thor have been able to launch these villains to the other side of the universe instantaneously, but he’d also be able to clean up any and all damage caused by the villains immediately after they were gone. Toranos is one of the most powerful entities Thor has ever faced, as he was an elder god who claimed the title of God of Thunder when the first lightning bolt cracked across the sky, long before Thor was even born. Yet even still, Toranos wasn’t strong enough to withstand Thor when he utilized the Thor-Knowledge, meaning every villain Thor faced in the MCU would have easily crumbled before his newfound might.\nIf the God of Thunder had access to the Thor-Knowledge in the MCU, then his entire journey would have been altered, as every villain he faced would have been vanquished incredibly quickly. Or, if he wasn’t strong enough to consistently banish bad guys across the universe, then he’d at least be able to repair any damage that was done during any given battle, which alone might have been enough to prevent the Avengers splitting up in Captain America: Civil War. Any way one looks at it, it’s clear that the new powers Thor just debuted would have definitely come in handy in the MCU.\nImmortal Thor #2 by Marvel Comics is available now.\nSpencer Connolly is a Staff Writer for Screen Rant.

{"title": "10 Best Godlike Anime Healers", "date": "2023-10-05 19:00:32", "text": "Though they are often underappreciated, healers play the important role of allowing wounded anime heroes to recover from even the gravest injuries.\nAnime healers are rarely the center of attention, with all the glory usually going to heroes and warriors who boast impressive offensive capabilities, defeating their foes in a flashy manner and taking the spotlight for themselves. However, were it not for supporting characters who keep them afloat, these fighters may not even live to achieve the triumphs that make them popular.\nDepending on the setting and world, the power source and method of healers can vary greatly, from elite doctors who can treat even the rarest of conditions, to those who use magic to perform miraculous feats such as undoing the effects of death itself. But only the ones who can make a significant difference in their world can count themselves among the most remarkable, godlike healers.\nWhile Bleach's cast includes multiple accomplished healers, such as Retsu Unohana, no one is quite on the same level as Orihime Inoue. Thanks to her naturally high spiritual power, she is talented in detecting and controlling spiritual energy. Her spirit energy is harbored in the six-petal flower-shaped hairpins she received from her brother, where six different spirits lie. Using her spirits, Orihime can cast incredible techniques such as Sōten Kisshun, which doesn't technically \"heal\", but rather allows her to deny and undo certain events, even going as far as to restore missing limbs and resurrect people. Nothing says \"godlike\" like bringing back people from the dead.\nAs the Armed Detective Agency's personal physician, Akiko Yosano is a true expert in her field, possessing rich knowledge in terms of human anatomy and physiology. As Bungo Stray Dogs revolves around special abilities though, it's her rare ability that allows her to differentiate herself from other physicians. Using \"Thou Shalt Not Die\", Akiko can instantly heal any and all external wounds, both in and outside of combat, provided the target is nearly dead. The condition may seem limiting, but she has no qualms about injuring others to bring them closer to the necessary stage of being barely alive. Unfortunately, this ability has no effect on internal injuries and illnesses.\nAs Konohagakure's Fifth Hokage, Naruto's Tsunade is not only one of the world's strongest kunoichi, but also a legendary medical-nin, or ninja specialized in healing techniques. Her abilities as a medical-nin are truly unrivaled, as she has been noted to instantly identify any illness, and also easily treat conditions that most would consider impossible to recover from. She can heal anything from physical to psychological damage, and even solve cases of severe chakra depletion. Tsunade's strongest technique is her Creation Rebirth, which instantly heals any wounds, making her nearly immortal, but it comes at the cost of shortening her lifespan, which is why she only uses it as a last resort.\nRelated: A Forgotten Boruto Mystery Could Make A Comeback In Two Blue Vortex\nJoJo's Bizarre Adventure is all about iconic Stand abilities, which vary significantly in terms of both form and power. Diamond is Unbreakable's main protagonist, Josuke Higashikata, wields the Stand known as Crazy Diamond, which doesn't strictly heal, but rather restores objects and organisms to a previous state. This way, Josuke can not only repair anything but also heal virtually any injury, as long as it's not lethal. Thanks to his intelligence and mastery over his Stand, he always finds ways to use this ability creatively, adapting to any situation and making use of his environment. The only downside is that he cannot heal himself, which would require him to be more cautious, but that's not in Josuke's personality at all, so he will rush into any dangerous situation without regrets.\nWhile music is not uncommon in the anime world, thanks to the popularity of idol anime series, there is nothing quite like Healer Girl, wherein the musical moments are more akin to stage plays or Disney scenes. Its story takes place in a world wherein music is a valid, scientifically proven form of healing, and Ria Karasuma is at the top of the voice medicine world. Not only is she a renowned healer who runs her own clinic and teaches apprentice girls who hope to become like her, but she also conducts research on music healing, actively working towards advancing the field.\nHunter x Hunter's Alluka Zoldyck is not only a great example of trans representation, but also one of the anime world's most powerful characters. Truthfully though, despite being born into a family of infamous deadly assassins, Alluka has no exceptional strengths, either physical or Nen-related. Instead, the source of her power is Nanika, a mysterious creature from the Dark Continent who possessed her body. Nanika can grant any wishes, presumably to an infinite extent, after three of Alluka's requests are fulfilled. In terms of healing, a notable example would be when she healed Gon, whose body was in a critical state, almost dying as a result of a Nen contract.\nFairy Tail's Wendy Marvell uses Sky Dragon Slayer Magic, whose potential is multifaceted. Not only does it allow her to cast surprisingly powerful offensive and versatile support spells, but it also makes her a fantastic healer, able to cure even the gravest of injuries. Prior to her using this magic, it was believed to be long-lost, which indicates just how rare and significant it is. As one would expect, she can heal various wounds and negate the effects of potent poison, but that's not the full extent of her power, as she has even been noted to revive people who were in a near-death state.\nAs the Straw Hat Pirates' resident doctor, Tony Tony Chopper's medical skills aren't owed to one of One Piece's many Devil Fruits, but rather to his adoptive parental figures, Hiriluk and Kureha, two doctors who took care of him and taught him everything they knew about medicine. After learning the foundations of the field, he further increased his knowledge in the Torino Kingdom, where he studied books on drugs and herbs that the rest of the world was unfamiliar with. He has continued to learn and evolve as a doctor ever since, proving himself through extraordinary feats such as quickly developing new cures and treating brutal injuries.\nParallel World Pharmacy follows a world-class medical researcher who overworked himself to death and was reincarnated as Falma de Médicis, the heir of an esteemed family of pharmacologists, in an alternate, less developed world. Combining the knowledge from his previous life with the unique powers he obtained thanks to a deity's divine blessing, Falma can perform miraculous feats such as creating and destroying any substance whose molecular structure he's familiar with. Additionally, he also has divine sight, which lets him identify the medical issues of any person he's looking at. Lastly, unlike other people in his world, there seems to be no limit to his magic powers, making his potential unrivaled.\nWhile Elizabeth Liones may not be one of the titular sins, she is still one of The Seven Deadly Sins' most likable characters, as well as a surprisingly powerful one. As the current queen of the Kingdom of Liones and the current incarnation of the Goddess Elizabeth, she possesses immense light-based powers, being able to heal everyone in the kingdom at once in an instant. After learning to control her abilities, she proves herself to be incredibly talented, even more skillful than the best druids, easily healing multiple people who suffered lethal damage, as well as dispelling powerful curses placed by the Demon King's magic.\nWhile these characters may not be the most memorable of their series, as viewers tend to instead admire the ones defined by their seemingly endless strength, they may very well be the ones who played the most important role. Thanks to their healing powers, they allowed others to shine, often without expecting anything in turn. Some are even powerful enough to resurrect those who underestimated the threats they were facing, allowing fan-favorite characters to keep driving the action. Truly, anime healers deserve far more recognition than they usually receive.\nRemus Badescu is a writer for ScreenRant's anime section.

{"title": "“No One Wanted This”: iCarly Cancellation After Cliffhanger Ending Addressed By Freddie Actor", "date": "2023-10-05 18:59:04", "text": "Freddie Benson actor Nathan Kress addresses iCarly's unexpected cancellation, revealing his disappointment and the show's cliffhanger ending.\niCarly’s Nathan Kress reacts to the show’s cancellation after three seasons. As one of the most popular Nickelodeon shows during its six-season run from 2007 to 2012, iCarly received a Paramount+ revival in 2021. The revival allowed Kress to reprise his role as Freddie Benson, alongside co-stars Miranda Cosgrove (Carly Shay) and Jerry Trainor (Spencer Shay). However, it was announced that the iCarly revival would be cancelled after just three seasons.\nIn a tweet, Kress reacts to iCarly’s cancellation, taking the time to thank the show’s production team as well as the iCarly fans who made the show possible. The actor also mentioned that “no one wanted this to end on a cliffhanger.” Read his tweet below:\nKress elaborated that the iCarly team “had a lot of story left to tell.” While wishing that he and the team could have given audiences “the ending [they] deserved],” Kress ended his statement with some hope. He wrote: “Maybe somehow, someday, we'll find out how to story ends\" after iCarly season 3.\nKress expresses a similar sentiment that many iCarly fans are undoubtedly feeling in the wake of the show’s cancellation. As the Freddie actor alludes to, the show ends on a major cliffhanger when Carly and Spencer’s mom appears right before Carly and Freddie’s wedding despite being absent from the original series and revival up to that point. Additionally, audiences never saw a long-awaited wedding between Carly and Freddie.\nIn their cancellation announcement, Paramount+ attempted to paint a positive spin on the ending, mentioning that the show “delivered on what fans really wanted to see with Carly and Freddie finally getting together.” While the streaming platform did not state a reason for the show’s cancellation, it is possible that low ratings (though the numbers are unavailable on the streaming platform) played a factor. The WGA strikes may have also factored into the decision, as writers' room pauses halted shows across Hollywood.\nRelated: 10 Best Shows Like iCarly\niCarly’s cancellation is frustrating not only to viewers but to the cast as well. Although not every cast member returned to the show (the reboot was notably missing Jeanette McCurdy), those that did re-committed to the show after nearly a decade off the air. It is understandable that Kress would grieve for the loss of iCarly and still hope that he can finally finish Freddie’s story one day.\nSource: Nathan Kress/Twitter\n"}
{"title": "Spider-Man's MCU Future Can Finally Revive Black Panther's Original Villain Plan", "date": "2023-10-05 18:50:28", "text": "Kraven the Hunter was originally set to appear in Black Panther, but with his solo movie coming up, it's not too late for him to jump into the MCU.\nSpider-Man 4 is one of the MCU's most anticipated movies, and it could potentially bring Kraven the Hunter into its story after his initial planned debut did not happen. Spider-Man has had a complex history with the MCU due to Sony Pictures holding his film rights, but Sony and Marvel Studios's eventual deal to share the Web-Slinger has blown the doors off the Spider-Verse like never before for both studios. In Sony's case, it also is helping to expand the possibilities of their universe of Spider-Man villains, including its next new series, Kraven the Hunter.\nDespite Kraven being a long-time Spidey villain, Spider-Man will likely not appear in Kraven the Hunter, but that does not mean they will not eventually meet. With the multiverse heavily in play in the MCU and Sony's Marvel films, there are already multiple avenues for Kraven to finally embark on his hunt for the Wall-Crawler after the release of Kraven the Hunter. Here is how Kraven the Hunter was almost introduced in the MCU and how Spider-Man 4 could bring him into the fold.\nJust prior to the release of Black Panther in 2018, director Ryan Coogler revealed in an interview that Kraven the Hunter was originally set to appear in the film. It's not fully clear exactly what Kraven's role in Black Panther would have been, in terms of whether he would have been the main protagonist, a secondary villain teaming up with Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger, or simply appearing in a minor cameo. However, Kraven's backstory and animal-like powers make it easy to see how he could have potentially fit into Black Panther's story.\nRELATED: Kraven the Hunter Cast & Marvel Character Guide\nIn theory, Kraven might have been featured in a scene or two showing him hunting African wildlife and encroaching on Wakanda's territory. Given Wakanda's secretive nature in the film, it would make sense for Kraven to be expelled from the nation in such a scenario, and this could have potentially set up his subsequent meeting with Spider-Man. On the other hand, Kraven's eventual debut in Sony's universe of Marvel villains seems likely to serve him better as a character.\nAs a Spider-Man villain and member of the Sinister Six, Kraven is in good company already in Sony's Spider-Man universe with Tom Hardy's Venom, Jared Leto's Morbius, and Dakota Johnson's forthcoming Madam Web. With the Rhino (Alessandro Nivola) also to appear in Kraven the Hunter, Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Kraven is in a setting much more directly geared towards an eventual Spider-Man showdown than his Black Panther role likely would have been. While Spidey has yet to arrive in Sony's universe of Marvel villains, that status quo will surely not last forever.\nRELATED: Everything We Know About Sony's Kraven The Hunter Movie\nThe fact of the matter is that, in a universe headlined by Spider-Man villains, it is a virtual certainty that Spidey himself will eventually appear. Venom: Let There Be Carnage and Spider-Man: No Way Home's end credits scenes laid the groundwork for exactly that with Eddie Brock being transported to the MCU and seeing Tom Holland's Spider-Man on television, so that expectation has clearly been primed by Sony. The infinite doorways of the multiverse make it possible for anyone from Andrew Garfield's Peter #3 to Miles Morales of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse to be that very Web-Slinger, while Kraven the Hunter is undoubtedly as prepped as Venom to battle Spidey.\nWhile Kraven the Hunter is set within Sony's universe of Spider-Man villains, there is also the potential that he could cross over into the MCU and meet Tom Holland's Web-Head. Venom's aforementioned journey to the MCU - brief though it may have been - already shows the door is open for Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Kraven to do the same. With Peter Parker in a difficult situation with the world's memory of him erased in No Way Home's ending, one particular Spider-Man comic story could even be perfect for where he picks up next. Namely, Kraven's Last Hunt, which is already serving as the partial basis for the Kraven the Hunter film.\nIn Kraven's Last Hunt, Kraven seemingly kills Spider-Man and assumes his identity in New York City, with the surviving Peter returning to stop him. With Peter forgotten by the entire world, someone else taking on Spider-Man's identity would be much easier to pull off if they were to get Peter out of the way, even temporarily. If Kraven is teleported into the MCU after his own movie, Spider-Man 4 could also easily adapt Kraven's Last Hunt as its story, with Tom Holland's Spidey battling his most vicious enemy yet in a battle where the stakes are higher than ever for him.\nBrad Curran is a Features Writer and Interviewer for Screen Rant.

Nikki is a part of the several new faces making their way into the franchise with the milestone season. While Gino Palazzolo and Jasmine Pineda is the only returning couple for 90 Day Fiance season 10, 2023 has a total of six new couples in store for viewers. 90 Day Fiancé is the show where engaged couples have applied for or have received a K-1 visa, so they can bring their international partners to America and get married to them within a span of three months.\nEngaged couple Nikki and Justin have a shocking history together. According to a preview of the 90 Day Fiancé season 10 premiere, courtesy of ET, Nikki reveals she was engaged to Justin 17 years ago and what led to their first breakup.\nNikki tells a friend that Justin was being lazy, wasn’t helping her with the housework, and expected her to cook and clean for him. They got into a lot of heated arguments. During one such argument, Nikki told Justin, “I used to be a man.” It had been two years since Nikki and Justin started their relationship. “I traumatized him,” admitted Nikki.\nNikki was about 20 years old when she underwent her gender affirmation operation. She had tears in her eyes after the surgery and felt like she was reborn again. After the surgery, she started living in “stealth,” which meant that she didn’t tell people what sex she was assigned at birth. As a result, Nikki was in the closet. She never made any gay or trans friends; she only wanted to have female friends. This was all part of Nikki’s journey to find herself. Justin was “in shock” when Nikki blurted out that she's trans. Justin went back home and was “depressed for a very long time.”\nRelated: 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now\nThis was back in 2007. Nikki and Justin had met on a dating site in Moldova 17 years ago. Justin proposed to Nikki and had come to the United States on a K-1 visa.

She thought it was a good idea for them to give their relationship a second chance. Three months after they first started speaking again, Nikki and Justin met in Mexico to connect “physically, mentally, emotionally.”\nJustin has proposed to Nikki again, and then she applied for the K-1 visa a second time. Justin wasn’t comfortable with Nikki’s gender identity the first time around. Nikki now knows what exactly she’s looking for in her future partner.

He Who Remains was revealed as the mastermind of the TVA in the first season's finale. He warned Loki and Sylvie that his death and the destruction of the TVA would lead to another multiverse war with his own variants as their enemies. However, Sylvie still decided to kill him, potentially plunging the multiverse into chaos, in order to give herself and everyone else the free will He Who Remains deprived them of.\nIn an exclusive interview with Screen Rant for Loki season 2, Wright discusses Miss Minutes and He Who Remains. He explains how many of the characters are searching for identities this season. He also teases how Miss Minutes dynamic with He Who Remains is unique in how he allowed her to evolve. Check out Wright's full quote below:\nKevin Wright: I think like all of our characters and their search for identity, but also that all of our characters being caught in a bit of a cyclical time loop, keep making the same mistakes. There's another interesting question about Miss Minutes that I think has been really fun to explore, which is the nature of ... She says this season something along the lines of He Who Remains gave her the ability to write her own programming, to create her own personality, to grow, to have wants, to have needs.\nI think that's exciting if that's true, knowing what we know about He Who Remains, he doesn't give a lot of people a lot of choices up until his death. And I'd be interested to see how much of her programming is her own, how much of this is just further path that He Who Remains maybe paved for all of our characters to walk down for some bigger reasoning.\nMiss Minutes has always been an intriguing character in Loki. She knows all and has a sweet southern drawl, but there seems to be a darker side as well. This could be exemplified by her connection to He Who Remains, who introduced himself to Loki and Sylvie as non-threatening but had done terrible things in the name of, according to him, protecting the \"sacred\" timeline. Stripping the universe of free will to keep the timeline on track and separate from the rest of the multiverse.\nRelated: He Who Remains Is Actually More Powerful Than Kang (In 1 Way)\nWith He Who Remains as her creator, it seems likely that Miss Minutes would be influenced by his mentality as well. However, if He Who Remains gave her the ability to alter and evolve her own programming, that is more free will than he seemed to have offered to anyone else. Miss Minutes foundation would still be the base programming that he gave her, which could be a way to keep his story alive in the second season of Loki even with He Who Remains dying in the first.\nThis could also set Miss Minutes up as a potential villain in the second season, especially if she wants to stay true to his mission. Miss Minutes likely wants to keep the \"sacred\" timeline as it is not allowing people to have free will, which could put her at odds with the people of the TVA, who were revealed to be variants plucked from timelines and brainwashed. Miss Minutes has always had a bit of a dark streak because of her connection to He Who Remains, but that could grow more insidious in the second season of Loki, especially after his death.\n"}
{"title": "Star Wars Admits Lightsabers Are Useless Against a Central Canon Race", "date": "2023-10-05 18:38:19", "text": "Lightsabers in the Star Wars universe are the ultimate weapon, but a new villain proves they're more useless than fans thought.\nThe Jedi and Sith of the Star Wars universe wield one of the most powerful weapons in the galaxy - but even lightsabers can be useless against certain beings and objects. The iconic symbol of the Star Wars mythos, these \"elegant weapons from a more civilized age\" can stop almost every form of weapon the Empire can create. But in one Star Wars story, the franchise reveals lightsabers fail to work on one key race...and fail to stop a key villain from amassing an army.\nIntroduced in Episode IV: A New Hope in 1977, lightsabers were immediately iconic, with only Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader seen using them. The prequels only expanded what lightsabers could do, showing them deflect blaster bolts back at foes, cut through nearly any solid objects, and prove impossible to stop by anything but another lightsaber. But fans may not realize that one historically significant droid proved too powerful for even a lightsaber to stop.\nIn Star Wars: Revelations #1 the mysterious Eye of Webbish Bog reveals to Darth Vader a vision of a single droid: Ajax Sigma, a being who inspired a revolution among his people. Centuries ago, the Jedi of the High Republic cut down Ajax Sigma's rebellion and his followers in a pitched conflict... but his core processor was preserved, passed down from person to person, and eventually installed the core into a new, more powerful droid body.\nSo given all their power, why were the Jedi unable to kill a simple droid? Star Wars: Revelations #1 revealed this tale of droid survival thanks to Marc Guggenheim, Salvador Larroca, Paul Fry, Emma Kubert, and Justin Mason. But proving it wasn't a one-off bit of luck, a villainous droid's miraculous survival against a lightsaber-wielding foe has happened before.In Star Wars: Darth Vader #1, Darth Vader engages the droid ZED-6-7 in battle, but fails to permanently destroy it - and the same exact situation plays out in Star Wars: Darth Vader #13 against the famous IG-88.\nA lightsaber can take an organic opponent out of the fight with a single stroke to a non-vital organ, but the same cannot be said for droids. The destruction of a droid's limb simply does not matter when it can be repaired in minutes (or after years, or centuries). Unless the core processor sustains a direct hit, the individual droid will continue to function, possessed of all its character traits and motivations. Making them harder to kill, as demonstrated in Revenge of the Sith against General Grievous' Magnaguards, who continued to fight even when headless and limbless. But when rising to a height of individual threat and menace, it means an immortality that will survive even a flawless, elegant Jedi weapon.\nSimply put, a lightsaber is too precise a weapon to efficiently cut down droids for good. Even if a Jedi or a Sith slices off all their limbs and stabs them multiple times in the center mass, the droid's \"brain\" can still be recovered and placed in a new body; the same cannot be said for a human opponent. This is why Ajax Sigma is a genuine threat against lightsaber-wielders: a single stroke isn't enough to defeat him (or his many followers).\nSince a droid's core processor can theoretically be located anywhere (the head, the body, or even miles away in another ship), Jedi and Sith must either waste their time cutting each robotic opponent to ribbons, or lose the lightsaber in exchange for a conventional blaster - devices that these Star Wars organizations, steeped in tradition, would rarely use on principle.\nNext: Star Wars Addresses Fan Concerns About Ruining Yoda's Backstory\nJoshua Isaak is a Comics Staff Writer for Screenrant and attended New York University.

{"title": "&quot;Define An Era&quot;: How Dave Filoni's Star Wars Movie Will Change The Franchise", "date": "2023-10-05 18:36:01", "text": "Dave Filoni has shared about the importance of a film defining an era, hinting towards how his Mandalorian movie will change the Star Wars franchise.\nThe anticipation for Dave Filoni's Star Wars movie set in The Mandalorian-era has only grown since the conclusion of the Ahsoka series, and the director has already provided a hint as to how it will impact the franchise. Filoni's The Mandalorian movie is expected to be a culmination of the events that take place in Star Wars Disney+ TV shows such as The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, and soon-to-arrive Skeleton Crew. The story has already been compared to an Avengers-esque team-up of heroes like Din Djarin and Ahsoka Tano to face off against Grand Admiral Thrawn, and now, Filoni may be hinting towards another important detail.\nIn speaking with Empire, Filoni describes the importance of a movie having a moment that can \"define an era,\" likening it to Luke Skywalker blowing up the Death Star in A New Hope. He ties it into the idea of \"characters coming together\" as well, something that's inevitable for his upcoming Star Wars movie.\nTo me, a theatrical experience has to have a big idea – a monumental moment in the time period that changes what’s happening. What Tony [Gilroy] has done [in Andor] and what we did in Rebels, everything then changes when Luke blows up the Death Star. You’re looking for those moments that define an era, and that’s what the films really should be about – whether it’s characters coming together, or a defining moment.\nFiloni, then, is pointing towards what viewers can start to expect from his movie. If the idea of the characters coming together for a defining moment in a movie is so important to him, then there's some idea of what that defining moment might be.\nBy the time of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Coruscant is no longer the capital of the New Republic. At some point, it moves to Hosnian Prime, and Filoni's Star Wars movie could be the moment where this change is finally seen - and it may be because of the fall of Coruscant. The Mandalorian season 3 spent quite some time on Coruscant, with episode 3 having spent nearly its entire duration there, and now Ahsoka has also done the work of tying in the New Republic and Coruscant. All of this could be leading to the fall of the infamous capital, especially now that Thrawn has returned.\nRelated: New Star Wars Movies: Every Upcoming Movie & Release Date\nWhatever this moment may turn out to be in Filoni's Star Wars movie, one thing is for certain: the movie will define The Mandalorian-era. The inevitable team-up of the heroes already promised to start that effort, but Filoni's commitment to create a memorable moment only emphasizes it. The fall of Coruscant would be a perfect moment for Filoni to show in his movie, but no matter what he puts on the big screen, his film will change Star Wars and The Mandalorian-era - and likely for the better.\nSource: Empire\n"}

While cinema has gone downhill in the 21st century, with the rise of CG-riddled I.P.-based blockbusters, TV has only gotten better. For decades, television rigidly stuck to established formulas with its stories and characters. But, when those formulaic TV shows inevitably grew stale, writers like David Chase and Vince Gilligan came along to shake up those formulas with morally gray antiheroes, long-running serialized storylines, and a truly cinematic sensibility.\nFor a long time, television was considered to be a lesser medium to the more grandiose forms of media like movies and the theater. But in the past couple of decades, trailblazing shows like Mad Men and Band of Brothers have turned TV into a respected art form. Those shows, combined with others like The Wire and True Detective, have contributed to the so-called “Golden Age of Television” that audiences are currently enjoying.\nRELATED: 10 Best TV Shows About Making TV Shows\nWith their HBO miniseries Band of Brothers, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg proved that a TV show about the Second World War can be just as big and grand and eventful as a movie about the Second World War, like their own Saving Private Ryan. Dramatizing the history of the “Easy” Company, Band of Brothers explores the conflict from a ground-level soldier’s perspective. Band of Brothers is as visceral and intense a portrayal of the horrors of warfare as any war movie ever made.\nVery few TV comedies have a joke-per-minute rate to rival that of Arrested Development. Most sitcoms get laughs purely from the situations and the dialogue, but Arrested Development proved that it’s possible to get laughs with cinematography, music, and editing, too. Arrested Development is filled with so many jokes and sight gags that every episode holds up to countless rewatches to spot them all. Every great single-camera comedy series from 30 Rock to Community was influenced by Arrested Development.\nJesse Armstrong pioneered a whole new kind of satire with Succession. His Shakespearean study of the spoilt brats fighting over their dying father’s media empire is both endlessly hilarious and deeply heartbreaking. The show gives the audience plenty of room to both laugh at the excesses of these absurdly wealthy characters and care intimately about their personal problems. The Roys are oddly endearing, and Succession strikes a unique balance between sympathy and mockery.\nAfter the game-changing arcs of Tony Soprano and Vic Mackey, Mad Men came along to prove that TV antiheroes don’t need to kill people to be compelling. Ad executive Don Draper is a captivating character whose highest-stakes conflict is whether or not he can land the Lucky Strike account. Matthew Weiner and his writers’ room used Don’s ad agency as a backdrop to explore all the social, political, and economic revolutions that American society underwent in the 1960s.\nFormer crime reporter David Simon captures the inner workings of the city of Baltimore with the depth and realism of a documentary in The Wire. Covering everything from the illegal drug trade to the underfunded public schools, The Wire is a razor-sharp study of crime and corruption in the American city. The series encapsulates the impact that institutions have on individuals, and the sociopolitical systems that prevent real change and perpetuate the cycles of violence and poverty. The Wire reinvented what a TV show could do.\nWhile the subsequent seasons have been kind of hit-and-miss, the first season of True Detective is top-tier television. A lot of modern TV shows style themselves as really long movies cut up into episodes, but True Detective season 1 really achieves that ambition with cinematic visuals, big-screen star power, and a single cohesive narrative that doesn’t get bogged down in unnecessary subplots. True Detective season 1 is a mesmerizing Southern Gothic detective noir told on two parallel timelines through the strained “buddy cop” pairing of a perfectly matched Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey.\nCraig Mazin brought the 1986 Chernobyl disaster to life in his HBO miniseries about the subject. Everything in Chernobyl is perfect: the atmospheric cinematography, the disturbing musical score, the grave seriousness of the actors’ performances. Chernobyl is a rare triumph of both the technical aspects of filmmaking and the specifics of historical accuracy. Some liberties were taken for dramatic purposes, but Chernobyl’s attention to detail is truly impressive.\nLarry David’s second sitcom deconstructed and revolutionized the entire genre. Curb Your Enthusiasm takes Seinfeld’s satirical exploration of the minutiae of everyday life and blurs the line between reality and fiction. Rather than shooting on a stage with a live audience and a laugh track, Curb Your Enthusiasm removes all the artifice of the sitcom with improvised dialogue, handheld documentary-like camerawork, and actors playing themselves. Curb Your Enthusiasm opened up the TV comedy to new possibilities, and continues to influence the genre to this day.\nDavid Chase singlehandedly kicked off the “Golden Age of Television” with his revolutionary work on The Sopranos. The Sopranos realized the cinematic potential of television with surreal dream sequences, pitch-black humor, and a wide variety of filming locations. It completely deconstructs the gangster genre with a typically stoic mob boss who starts opening up and feeling his feelings when he enters therapy. James Gandolfini and Chase’s team of writers combined forces to give audiences a more complex and rounded portrait of Tony Soprano than any previous TV show had done with its protagonist.\nVince Gilligan reimagined the purpose of a TV series with Breaking Bad. Most shows are designed to maintain the status quo, so the series can go on indefinitely. But Breaking Bad was defined by change as Gilligan famously envisioned turning Mr. Chips into Scarface. Breaking Bad is an intimate character study of a mild-mannered chemistry teacher who gradually embraces his dark side as he rises through the criminal underworld to become a meth kingpin. Breaking Bad also introduced the notion that TV directors can get creative with their cinematography and don’t have to feel confined by standard methods of coverage.\nWith his surprisingly harrowing series BoJack Horseman, Raphael Bob-Waksberg proved that dark character studies like Breaking Bad and wacky animated comedies like Family Guy aren’t mutually exclusive. BoJack Horseman started as a lighthearted Hollywood satire about a washed-up sitcom actor who happens to be a talking horse. But it quickly turned darker than most TV dramas as it dug into BoJack’s problems with addiction and mental health. It’s not an easy watch (particularly in its later seasons), but BoJack Horseman is a profound and groundbreaking series.\n"}
{"title": "Foe Director Garth Davis On The Narrative Complexities Of The Sci-Fi Thriller", "date": "2023-10-05 18:30:29", "text": "Garth Davis, the director and co-writer of Foe, discusses the intricacies and overarching environmental themes of the new sci-fi thriller.\nFoe is a sci-fi thriller that explores the idea of AI replacement and what it means to be human. Based on the book of the same name by Iain Reid - who previously wrote I'm Thinking of Ending Things - the story centers on a married couple whose life is thrown into turmoil after the arrival of a mysterious stranger. The film has an incredibly small cast, with just three main members: Little Women's Saoirse Ronan, Normal People's Paul Mescal, and Brother's Aaron Pierre.\nThe movie's Black Mirror-esque plot centers around Ronan and Mescal's characters Hen and Junior, a married couple who live on a generations-old farm in the year 2065. One night, Pierre's character Terrance arrives and informs them that Junior has been chosen to be a part of a special space program that will necessitate him leaving Earth for two years. As part of preparations for his departure, Terrance begins conducting a series of interviews and observations in order to design a sentient replacement to replace Junior in his absence, putting a huge existential strain on the couple's marriage.\nRelated: Foe: Release Date, Trailer & Everything We Know About The Prime Video Sci-Fi Thriller\nScreen Rant sat down with Foe's co-writer and director Garth Davis to discuss what it was like working with such a small cast, layered storytelling, and the biggest challenges in making the film.\nScreen Rant: First, I would just love to know what elements of the novel were the ones you wanted to be sure came through in the film the most.\nGarth Davis: I guess for me, what I really wanted to come through was Hen's story, how she is really fighting for this marriage and fighting for agency and her own destiny and her own life. I really wanted that to come through, that was the main - that's the heart and soul of the film for me.\nAnd what was it like working with Saoirse and Paul, were there any moments that stick out to you from set especially?\nGarth Davis: I guess all of them. I mean, every day going to set was a joy; they're wonderful human beings, and very collaborative and brilliant with their choices, and just so easy to work with, and so there's just such a great sense of play and craft and professionalism. So it was a joy going to set every day working with these actors, with this material, because it was so complex and exciting to explore. And also Aaron Pierre was also just wonderful to work with as well.\nAnd this movie has an incredibly small cast compared to projects that you've done in the past. I'm curious what that adjustment was like, was it weird at all to go down to so few people for the most part?\nGarth Davis: I was desperate for it. I mean, in a way I can do these big sweeping things, but ultimately the stuff that really puts a fire in the belly is when I'm just on the actor's face doing something beautiful. So I guess I was just trying to find some material that would have a lot of complexity and potential to give the actors a lot of stuff to explore. And there's so many layers and complexity to the story, and it was just like a delicious experiment which was all about acting, it was all about the human condition. So that was super exciting.\nWere there any things that stick out to you that were incredibly challenging to get just right?\nGarth Davis: I mean, they're all challenging, but probably the one that was the most challenging and we went through rehearsals quite a bit was the opening scene when Terrance comes into the house and they sit in the lounge room, because there's so many things going on at that moment. There's so many secret rivers - the story you think you're watching, the story that's really happening. So all of the actors are doing a multitude of things, and there's a lot of, \"How much do we reveal? How much do we conceal?\" So I think trying to find the reality of that conceit was the greatest challenge. It was very complex, so that was probably - for all of us - the greatest challenge was that scene.\nAnd there's a strong relationship in this film between Junior and Hen's relationship and the environmental climate around them. How would you compare those two things in the film?\nGarth Davis: Well, Saoirse I think said at one point,\"The way you behave, the way you treat someone, is the same way you treat the planet,\" like there's a direct parallel. But I love the idea that this decaying marriage kind of echoes and mirrors the decaying planet. And I guess the conversation in that connection is they're one and the same thing. So if the planet is dying, it's only saying that we're also dying inside of us as well, and I guess I found that a really fascinating metaphor and theme to bring through.\nAcademy Award nominees Saoirse Ronan and Paul Mescal star in Foe, a haunting exploration of marriage and identity set in an uncertain world. Hen and Junior farm a secluded piece of land that has been in Junior’s family for generations, but their quiet life is thrown into turmoil when an uninvited stranger (Aaron Pierre) shows up at their door with a startling proposal. Based on best-selling author Iain Reid’s novel, directed by Garth Davis, and co-written by Davis and Reid, Foe’s mesmerizing imagery and persistent questions about the nature of humanity (and artificial humanity) bring the not-too-distant future to luminous life.\nCheck back soon for our other Foe interviews here:\nFoe releases in theaters on October 6.\nSource: Screen Rant Plus\n"}
{"title": "It's A Wonderful Knife Trailer: Justin Long Stars In Holiday Slasher Movie", "date": "2023-10-05 18:28:23", "text": "It's a Wonderful Knife trailer shows Justin Long in a horror twist of the classic James Stewart Christmas-centered film It's a Wonderful Life.\nA new trailer has been released for the upcoming holiday slasher film It’s a Wonderful Knife. Starring Justin Long, It’s a Wonderful Knife is a comedy-horror with a twist on the classic film It’s a Wonderful Life. It’s a Wonderful Knife will be released on November 10.\nDropped by RLJE Films, the It’s a Wonderful Knife trailer gives the first look at the holiday slasher.\nIn the trailer, It’s a Wonderful Life shows Winnie Carruthers, who wishes that she had never been born. Set to the tune of “Jingle Bells,” the It’s a Wonderful Knife trailer follows Winnie as she discovers a series of murders in her hometown and attempts to stop the killer in his tracks.\nAs mentioned in the trailer, It’s a Wonderful Knife has the same producers as the 2020 Vince Vaughn film Freaky. Taking on a similar twisted approach, Freaky retells the classic body-swap film Freaky Friday and turns it into a horror narrative wherein high school student Millie swaps bodies with a middle-aged serial killer. The film gained a decent following, and Freaky 2 has since been announced. Freaky and It’s a Wonderful Knife are two of several recent horror films that take a similar approach. Freaky director Christopher Landon previously made a Groundhog Day inspired horror movie in 2017 titled Happy Death Day.\nIt’s a Wonderful Knife sees director Tyler MacIntyre at the helm. It’s a Wonderful Knife seems to push and pull with the source material in similar ways as did Happy Death Day and Freaky. The wish-one-had-never-been-born framework remains, and elements such as the presence of angels are borrowed from It’s a Wonderful Life, while original horror elements are also introduced.\nWhile it can partially rely on the cult success of its predecessors, It’s a Wonderful Knife is also being released at a good moment for horror parody. 2023 brought the infamous Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey, which posited the likes of Pooh Bear and Piglet in more grotesque scenarios. While based on starkly different material, It’s a Wonderful Knife could do well riding the recent tidal wave of both horror parody and its predecessors.\nSource: RLJE Films\n"}

A look at all the spoilers revealed about the couple online.\n90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way couple Brandan DeNuccio and Mary Demasu-ay have reportedly been fired from the franchise. Brandan met Mary on a dating app after getting over a bad breakup. Mary had been cheated on multiple times by an ex-boyfriend herself when she decided to match with Brandan, who she thought looked like a mix of Justin Bieber and Harry Potter. However, Brandan and Mary became too possessive of each other.\nBrandan gave in to Mary’s demands when she insisted they be on video calls 24/7. Her demands made Brandan lose multiple jobs. He eventually flew to the Philippines to spend a lifetime with her. While the couple is yet to marry on the show, a cast member from a different 90 Day Fiancé spin-off, Statler Riley, has made an alarming claim about Mary and Brandan being fired. Statler revealed that Brandan and Mary overshared personal information online, spoiling their season. The pair has yet to address the rumors, but it’s likely that they might have broken some rules from their contract.\nBrandan and Mary’s wedding photos were posted online before their 90 Day Fiancé debut. Brandan spilled the secret on his social media. He then gave away a major spoiler about his relationship with Mary on Instagram. He had written, “Happily Married” in his Instagram bio.

Are the couple engaged now and is she in America?\n90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days couple Christian Allgood and Cleo surprisingly stayed together after the finale and revealed plans of getting engaged in the Tell All. Cleo, a 32-year-old trans woman living in England, is originally from Italy. Cleo and Christian, 28, met on social media and were good friends for a year before they started dating. Christian had no experience in dating a transgender partner before. While he seemed ready to meet Cleo in person, his family raised concerns about their relationship.\nChristian decided he would not show his affection for Cleo in public. He also acted quite friendly with other women while Cleo was right next to him, which made it look like Christian wasn’t serious about being with Cleo. He even refused to acknowledge to the cameras that they’d had sex. These ups and downs, however, didn’t affect the positive outcome of the relationship.

{"title": "Big Brother Live Feed Viewers Want Cameron Hardin Evicted (He's A Threat)", "date": "2023-10-05 18:22:27", "text": "Big Brother 25 viewers enjoy Cameron Hardin on the weekly episodes, but those watching the live feeds are seeing a different side of the houseguest.\nBig Brother 25 viewers have been enjoying watching Cameron Hardin take on the competition, but those who are watching him on the BB live feeds have a different take on the competitor's sometimes inappropriate behavior. Cameron, who has been in the Big Brother house for over 60 days and spent the majority of his time on the nomination block, has faced challenges during his time on the series. A stay-at-home dad, Cameron has been away from his daughter for over 2 months and fought hard to stay in the BB house, even being brought back after a unanimous eviction. Cameron's gameplay has been impressive, but it isn't always clean.\nOn the weekly episodes, Cameron is being edited to seem like a game player who doesn't let things get too personal, but for viewers who are indulging in the Big Brother 24-hour live feeds, Cameron takes on an entirely different personality. Cameron, who presents as a care-free, fun guy that just wants to play Big Brother, has been saying some alarming things to his fellow houseguests, which have confounded live feed viewers. Though he appears as a master manipulator on Big Brother's TV aired episodes, Cameron has made it clear that he's more of a villain than most viewers imagined.\nWhile Big Brother is a game that requires manipulation the majority of the time, Cameron is taking his emotionally manipulative tactics to another level. During his second Head Of Household reign, Cameron's targets included Survivor legend Cirie Fields' closest allies, Izzy Gleicher and Felicia Cannon. He felt that he could take Cirie's power away from her in the game by getting rid of one of her closest allies, targeting Izzy over Felicia, though he didn't much care who went home. Cameron's targets were clear for him, but the emotionally manipulative tactics he used throughout his HOH reign to get Izzy out of the house were exhausting to watch.\nPrior to the nomination ceremony, Cameron decided to pull fellow BB 25 houseguests Blue Kim and Jag Bains up to the HOH room and lie, explaining he'd be nominating them. He was choosing to scare the houseguests in order to get as much information out of them as possible, knowing they were closer to the epicenter of the Cirie/Izzy/Felicia alliance than he was. After intimidating his potential nominees, he seemed almost gleeful in his reaction, loving the fact that he was able to twist them around emotionally as much as he had. This isn't the only instance of Cameron's troubling manipulation tactics, which leave his fellow houseguests feeling wronged.\nAfter BB 25 houseguest Luke Valentine was ejected early in the game for breaking the show's code of conduct, the houseguests have been tremendously careful about what they've said in the BB house. Cameron, who has spent the majority of the season on his own, has made some close-call remarks during the game that many feel could've been pushing the code of conduct. Though his alliance with BB 25 evicted houseguest Red Utley deteriorated after they were put on the nomination block together, both made some ugly remarks about the female houseguests during their time together in the game. After Red's eviction, some wondered if Cameron would calm down.\nDuring his time in the BB house, Cameron has been overtly sexual about several of his younger female houseguests, including BB 25's Reilly Smedley and America Lopez. Reilly was evicted during the second week of the summer and was friendly with Cameron during her time in the house. Though he's mentioned that he felt akin to her because she reminded him of her daughter, Cameron has made remarks about Reilly that are uncomfortable knowing he views her in that light. His comments about America have been explicit and overtly sexual, to the point that some houseguests choose not to leave the pair alone in a room together for America's safety.\nWhile the majority of the houseguests left in the Big Brother 25 house have tried to make themselves as comfortable with Cameron as possible, the houseguests who have been evicted from the game have spoken out about his behavior. Kirsten Elwin, the first evicted houseguest of the season, has been able to watch the entirety of the season and comment on the houseguests behavior as she's followed along. Having never been a fan of Cameron due to his abrasive personality, Kirsten hasn't been kind about his inappropriate comments and has even found herself calling him out on social media for the things he's said in the Big Brother house.\nKirsten has spoken out about the way Cameron speaks to America, unhappy with the fact that he continues to make explicitly sexual remarks to her even though she's both unresponsive and in a showmance with another houseguest. She's also called out the way that Cameron has acted towards the houseguests of color, as his behavior is riddled with microaggressions and his vernacular leaves much to be desired. In a recent post, Kirsten called Cameron out for calling her \"cotton\", appalled at the connotation of the word being used about a woman of color. Kirsten rightfully put Cameron on blast, calling for BB to do something about the racially insensitive behavior.\nCameron has been making remarks to America throughout Big Brother 25, despite the fact that she's been in a showmance with Cory Wurtenberger for weeks. Though it wasn't clear where America and Cory stood to some of the other houseguests early on in their relationship, it has become obvious. Cameron, who says he feels like Cory is his brother, was clearly put-off by the fact that America was interested in Cory rather than him, as Cameron and America had been playfully flirty early in the game. While America has engaged in the behavior, Cameron has taken it further than expected, making overtly sexual comments that America is openly uncomfortable with.\nCameron's jealousy has been obvious as he continually stared the pair down any time they were in communal areas or interrupted them when they were spending time one-on-one. He's told both Cory and America to distance from one another, angry when they refuse to do so, and has even targeted Cory in the game in jealousy. Though Cory has always supported Cameron in the house, he's chosen to take a path of destruction against Cory while talking poorly about America behind her back. The aggression in his gameplay is new towards the pair, and only happened after America stopped openly flirting with Cameron to make herself and Cory's relationship obvious.\nCameron was evicted unanimously during Big Brother 25 week 7, but his eviction was overturned by a twist in the game that allowed him to come back into the house and compete for his BB life. Cameron, who is a competitive threat in the game, won the competition against Jared Fields and got to come back into the house, but in the time between his eviction and re-entry to the game, it was clear that Cameron was angling for his spot. During his pitch to his fellow Big Brother houseguests to keep him around, Cameron used a bargaining tool that seemed off-putting to houseguests, and irked live feed viewers.\nCameron was hoping for just one more week of safety so he could make it to the jury house. The competitors who make it to the jury phase of the competition are paid handsomely for their time. Cameron, who left his daughter to come on Big Brother, explained to anyone who would listen that he didn't need to win the game, he simply wanted to make it to jury in order to make the most money he could. While it's understandable, Cameron rubbed his fellow houseguests the wrong way saying he didn't need to win the game, as the people left in the house are interested in playing to win.\nBig Brother 25 airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EDT, Tuesdays at 8 p.m. EDT, and Thursdays at 9 p.m. EDT on CBS.\n"}

Among these books is Morte's Planar Parade, a new companion book to the standard Monster Manual that adds many mighty monsters to the multiversal menagerie. Using similar presentations of stat blocks, Morte's Planar Parade has more than 60 enemies included for adventuring parties to vanquish, or at least attempt to.\nThe set of books in Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse includes lots of new content for DnD, including everything from new magic items to unique and incredible fantasy adventures for DMs to use to warp realities. For truly adventurous dungeon masters, the bestiary in Morte's Planar Parade could also be used to add fantastical creatures to other campaigns or homebrew games as well. Among the numerous additions in the set, here are a few of the most powerful and strongest monsters for players to watch out for.\nRelated: D&D Planescape Preview: A High-Level Adventure With A Catch\nAn Eater of Knowledge is a disgusting-looking mass of muscles and brain matter categorized in DnD as a large aberration that is typically neutral evil. Likely it doesn't smell very good either, while it uses its strength to hold its victims as tentacles crack open their brains for it to eat. The Eater of Knowledge becomes more powerful with every brain it eats, learning stronger spells for it to use in its attacks on its future meal. With an AC of 15 and only an average of 102 HP, it isn't impossible to defeat, but if it gets the chance to take its turn, adventurers will want to be prepared.\nThe Avoral Guardinal is one of several guardinals added in Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse and with good rolls could potentially be swayed to being an ally as they are typically neutral good. These eagle-like humanoids are avian Celestials, and are known to dive at enemies from high above and rip them apart with their talons. It does have darkvision of 120 ft and has a passive perception of 21, making it difficult to hide from, and has an AC of 16 and an average of 172 Hit Points.\nBaernaloths are bad enough on their own, but if a hapless adventurer comes across one in its lair, this fiend becomes even more powerful. These monsters enjoy the despair and suffering of others and will use their power to keep victims alive simply to prolong the misery. They are yugoloths who can sometimes summon another yugoloth to fight by their side and have resistance to magic, as well as many nonmagical attacks. When inside a baernaloth's lair, any creature that is not at full hit points must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw and take necrotic damage while they are in the area.\nDnD's Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse adds stat blocks for three demodands, which are Fiends from the Tarterian Depths of Carceri. They are wicked and bitter creatures who were thrown into prison long ago and know they are doomed to return. The Shator demodand is generally the commander of the others and is covered in fungal growths. It has a chance to summon another demodand and has a passive Perception of 23. Its many spells and attacks, combined with an AC of 19 and an average of 195 Hit Points, make it a truly powerful foe to run across.\nRelated: D&D's Planescape Character Options: The New Backgrounds & Feats Explained\nShemeshka is another yugoloth, who happens to be the notorious crime boss at her multiplanar casino Fortune's Wheel, which is a focus of the new DnD adventures in Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse. Even without her lackeys around her, she is strong and has many resistances, immunities, and powerful spells at her disposal - along with an AC of 17, an average of 162 Hit Points, and very high stats.\nOne of the five modrons added to DnD for the Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse books is the Hexton Modron. These huge constructs are the leaders of the modrons when outside of Mechanus. When damaged, they can retaliate with an arc of lightning, and during their turn, they can dispel magic at will. They have an AC of 17 and an average of 209 Hit Points.\nThe Aurumach Rilmani is a large Celestial and is one of the leaders of the rilmani people. They have gold skin and typically do not leave the Outlands, only doing so when they feel they need to destroy any who pose a threat to the stability of the multiverse. They are very skilled in magic and psychic powers and have an Armor Class of 18 in addition to 285 Hit Points.\nPlanar Incarnates are the literal manifestations of good and evil, either Celestial or Fiend, and are of gargantuan size. They look like roiling masses of energies, distinct for each type, and are broken off to protect their plane from threats and then will merge back to their original plane again once the danger is gone. They can take on majestic shapes or are even said to \"appear as unique manifestations of the philosophies they embody\" according to Morte's Planar Parade in the Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse. These powerful beings are immune to most conditions and damages, know all languages, and have very high stats to go with their average 333 Hit Points.\nKolyarut is a construct created by the leader of the modrons which is designed to forge binding contracts and agreements that should never be broken. They have four arms that are made through a combination of magic and machine and are classified as Inevitables. A kolyarut will forcefully destroy anything that stands in the way of what it considers to be the truth or who needs to be punished for breaking any contract.\nRelated: D&D: Planescape Reveals Cool New Styles From The Streets of Sigil [EXCLUSIVE TRAILER]\nDnD's time dragons are able to harness and manipulate any point in time: past, present, or future. There are time dragons of different ages, each with their own powers, but the Ancient Time Dragons are the deadliest of creatures. They have the power to create temporal gates connecting times and places throughout the overarching multiverse in Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse and can banish threats. They are beautiful, majestic-looking dragons, with an average of 536 Hit Points and an AC of 22.\nThey are rated as a challenge of 26 in DnD, for they have very high stats and skills plus the ability to manipulate time around it. If an Ancient Time Dragon dies, it will be reborn with all knowledge and memory of its previous life, including who killed it. This makes them a formidable new foe for Dungeons & Dragons.\nSource: D&DBeyond\n"}

From director Martin Scorsese, Killers of the Flower Moon tackles the story of a series of mysterious murders of members of the Osage tribe in the 1920s United States. In addition to De Niro and DiCaprio, Killers of the Flower Moon stars Lily Gladstone, Jesse Plemons, Tantoo Cardinal, and John Lithgow.\nAhead of the release of Killers of the Flower Moon, a new clip from Entertainment Weekly shows De Niro and DiCaprio’s characters in dire straits. In the clip, De Niro’s character chastises DiCaprio’s character for how he went about a planned murder, that was supposed to look like a suicide. DiCaprio’s character asserts that he told a presumably hired assassin to shoot the victim in the front of the head and leave the gun behind, while De Niro yells at him for being “foolish.”\nDiCaprio plays Ernest Burkhart opposite De Niro’s William K Hale, both of whom were real-life figures who played a part in the Osage murders. This new Killers of the Flower Moon clip hints at the relationship between the two characters, both of which have their own moral corruptions. Hale is a mastermind behind the murder plot, while Burkhart is willing to go to extreme lengths to please Hale.\nKillers of the Flower Moon is significant for the actors in that it unites the two of them in a Scorsese-directed feature for the first time. Despite this milestone, De Niro and DiCaprio’s working relationship goes 30 years back, when the two co-starred in 1993’s This Boy’s Life. According to an interview with Scorsese, it was De Niro who helped convince the director to cast DiCaprio in one of his films, after being so impressed with the emergent actor’s work on This Boy’s Life.\nSince first teaming up with Scorsese in Gangs of New York, DiCaprio has become a Scorsese regular. De Niro has maintained this relationship too, which originated in Scorsese’s Mean Streets and has continued through renowned films like Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and The Irishman. De Niro and DiCaprio did appear together in one other Scorsese-directed, co-starring in Scorsese’s 2015 short film The Audition. Killers of the Flower Moon is DiCaprio and De Niro’s shot for a feature-length unfolding of their working relationship, and if this newest clip is any indication, this effort will not disappoint.\nSource: EW\n"}
{"title": "10 Most Ridiculous Final Destination Deaths", "date": "2023-10-05 18:10:28", "text": "The Final Destination franchise features plenty of ridiculous kills, but there's a sense of palpable horror inherent to event the most absurd deaths.\nThe Final Destination series is known for its creative and gruesome deaths, with some of its most ridiculous still remembered as the best. The film series began in 2000 with the original Final Destination, wherein a teenager’s premonition saves several members of his high school class from an air disaster, only for death to come for the survivors in a series unexpected and violent accidents. Originally, Final Destination was written as an X-Files spec script before its author, Jeffrey Reddick, expanded the concept into a full movie.\nThe concept of death coming to the survivors through apparent accidents only materialized in a rewrite from filmmaking team Glen Morgan and James Wong, but it quickly became a core part of the franchise’s identity. While most teen-oriented horror films feature a malignant slasher killer, the notion of an omnipotent force of death motivating the accidents makes the kills all the more harrowing, even at their most absurd. As the franchise goes on, it embraces more and more absurd comedy in its gruesome death traps that have become a staple of the series.\nRELATED: Final Destination: Every Death Rule (& Exception) Explained\nRory Peters' death in Final Destination 2 displays the franchise’s knack for understanding the intrusive fear wrapped up in common objects, as well as a characteristic disrespect for the laws of physics. As an exploding van propels a length of barbed wire fencing through the air, poor Rory Peters is run clean through while still standing. The uneven cut, which also takes off one arm at the elbow, is unsettling in its specificity. Other details, like Rory’s still-moving expression of surprise and the wet, textured sound design, make the absurd death stick in the viewer’s memory.\nThe Final Destination franchise thrives off its wry balance of existential horror and pitch-black humor. One moment that successfully leverages its horror into laughs is the barbecue explosion that caps off Final Destination 2. As young Brian Gibbons goes to tend to the barbecue, his family reveals that Brian was also one of the survivors of the movie’s opening disaster, making him another target of death's design. The ensuing explosion which annihilates Brian and sends his dismembered arm flying onto the picnic table before his screeching mother is paced like a punchline, buttoning up the movie with a sick laugh.\nThe Final Destination breaks new ground for the series by featuring two mass-death premonitions rather than one. The second, a catastrophe set off by a shopping mall explosion, sees Nick’s girlfriend Lori sucked up into the exposed mechanism of an escalator. It’s quite contrived as Final Destination deaths go, since Lori had plenty of time to get away from it, and the mechanism reaching her foot somehow causes her to begin spitting up blood. Nevertheless, Lori being slowly crushed like a tube of toothpaste is just the kind of grisly image the series does well.\nOne of the most infamous deaths in the Final Destination series comes in the third installment with the egregious tanning beds scene. As Ashley and Ashlyn manage to trap themselves in malfunctioning tanning beds, the rapidly increasing heat proceeds to microwave the two alive. The absurd concept and gruesome execution finds the perfect balance between horror and comedy. The scene also gives way to one of the best match cuts in cinema history, as the two flaming tanning beds cut to Ashley and Ashlyn’s twin coffins.\nAs the Final Destination franchise progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult for the filmmakers to stay ahead of the audience’s expectations. One smart act of subversion comes in Final Destination 3, when the two main characters narrowly avoid death by escaping their car moments before it gets demolished by an out-of-control truck. However, death still gets its satisfaction, as the engine block of their car goes flying into the vehicle in front of them, which happened to be occupied by another death-cheating survivor, Frankie. Once again, the series makes the death disturbingly textured by having the engine’s fan blend the back of Frankie’s head into soup.\nIn Final Destination 2, the series ratchets up the suspense on doomed Evan by exposing him to a near-comic gauntlet of potential death traps, from fire, to a malfunctioning garbage disposal, to a sparking microwave. The punchline comes when Evan meets his end thanks to a forgotten pile of discarded spaghetti. As he slips and falls directly under the fire escape ladder, it gives way and punctures his skull. While a ladder malfunction is one of the more likely Final Destination deaths, the absurd gauntlet of death traps that precedes it makes the sequence farcical.\nFinal Destination proves itself one of the most consistent horror franchises thanks to its enduring capacity to conjure gruesome deaths out of the most banal situations. In The Final Destination, the swimming pool goes to show the series still has its edge, four movies in. As Hunt Wynorski takes a dip in the pool, a malfunctioning filter seizes him and sucks his innards out (presumably through his anus). Again, it’s a death that plays fast and loose with the laws of engineering and of physics in general, but the film’s exploitation of a fear of pool filters is affecting nonetheless.\nOne of the franchise’s best fakeouts gives way to one of its most memorable deaths in Final Destination 2. After a tense trip to the dentist, packed with ominous implements and a near miss with an airway-blocking plastic fish, Tim seems to be out of danger, but he isn’t exempt from the rules of Final Destination. His penchant for chasing pigeons causes the birds to send a pane of glass crashing on top of him. The franchise has shown characters being crushed before, but the utter pancaking that occurs with Tim's giant pane of glass is novel and macabre.\nFinal Destination 5 stepped away from the franchise’s increasingly comedic tone with a more serious fifth outing, defined by its tension powerhouse gymnastic scene. Since the films have trained their audience to understand the catastrophic chain reaction that can be set off by a single mishap, a falling air conditioner screw landing on a gymnastics beam fills the scene with creeping dread. When it finally pays off, the ensuing calamity launches gymnast Candice to her death from a parallel bar. However, the series still delivers the absurdity with the over-the-top gruesomeness of her death, as Candice’s spine explodes from her back on impact, folding her body like an ironing board.\nDespite the horror movie's unfairly low Rotten Tomatoes score, the original Final Destination is still the best in the franchise. The film delivers a series of unique and shocking deaths that each boast their own gruesome charms. Arguably the best death in the film is its most excessive, as a series of home mishaps at Mrs Lewton’s house all come to a head, inflicting an overkill death on the teacher. Shards of glass from an exploding computer slash her throat, a kitchen knife is pushed into her chest, and, to cap things off, her house explodes. It’s a display of absurd excess that the Final Destination franchise never tops.\n"}

James MacKinnon, Makeup Department Head and Prosthetics, and his team are strong contenders to win the Emmy for Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup.\nJames MacKinnon has a storied history in the Star Trek franchise. Starting in the 1990s series Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, MacKinnon worked as a prosthetic makeup and special makeup effects artist under department head and mentor, Michael Westmore. MacKinnon also worked with Westmore on Star Trek: First Contact. MacKinnon has won Emmys for his work in Star Trek: Discovery and Star Trek: Picard.\nRelated: Star Trek: Picard Season 3 Ending Explained (In Detail)\nScreen Rant had the pleasure to chat with James MacKinnon about Star Trek: Picard season 3's home video release. We discussed his Emmy-nominated work on Picard's Borg Queen (Alice Krige/Jane Edwina Seymour), Worf (Michael Dorn), Data (Brent Spiner), and his overall career creating makeup and prosthetics for Star Trek.\nScreen Rant: Congratulations on your Emmy nominations for Picard. I think every other department, especially the actors, the writers, the directors, got robbed this year, but it's great your department got recognized.\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, they did. They did. They did a great job. I was a little disappointed myself.\nYou have a little cameo in the turbo-lift with Seven of Nine in one of the episodes of Picard. Terry Matalas called you out in the commentary.\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, what's funny is most of the Star Treks that I've worked on in the last 27 years, I've played a little part in each one of them. So I always try to put my face on.\nDo you prefer to be Starfleet? Or is there like an alien love to play?\nJames MacKinnon: Well, I was a Borg in season 2. Sorry, season 1, I was a Borg. And then season 2... what was I? I was something else in season 2. But this one, you actually saw my face. Usually I'm completely under makeup.\nI read that you got to do three aliens from your bucket list in Picard season 3. What were the three?\nJames MacKinnon: Well, to do Worf again, to do Data again, and then to do a Ferengi for the second time. It's kind of fun in this world that I'm in that I actually, as an artist, I get to do them one time, and then products and materials change, and years change, and my artistry changes as well. And I get another opportunity to excel make them bigger, better, but still keep the core look about 'em. And that's obviously with Neville Page and Vincent Van Dyke with VVD effects. So it's a good combination of how to keep the fans happy, how to keep the original looks, but elevate the makeups to current day.\nLet's talk about that a little bit. I know you've worked on DS9. I'm a massive Ferengi fan. I love DS9. It's my favorite of the Star Treks. Tell me about upgrading Sneed from Quark in the 90s.\nJames MacKinnon: Well, that's all foam latex back then. And we're obviously shooting on 35 millimeter film. So you have a little bit of play on the paint jobs, on the materials. And now with 8K, 10K, 12K, all the Ks that they have... And now we're doing silicone. We have to, as artists, step up our game because that sees every little nook and cranny of either a mistake in a paint job, a mistake in an application, anything. A mouth opens too big, a crack happens. And I never liked Jason Zimmerman, our visual effects supervisor, to touch any of my work. But if he has to he will. But my goal is for them not to touch anything so that it's all original and not manipulated. So it's just an opportunity. I always say that 8K is made for NASCAR and Animal Planet, not for women of a certain age and older men. It's too much detail. But as an artist, like I say, we have to step up and make sure that these things look amazing because our fans are so, so passionate that they go, \"Oh, in episode 3, two minutes in, that makeup was crappy, and I saw this...\" So that's my goal: For that not to happen.\nLet's talk about the Borg Queen a little bit. Absolutely incredible incarnation of the Borg Queen. What went into creating literally the gnarliest-looking version of the Queen ever?\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, she's a little [H.R.] Giger. She's got a little... she's been screwed up for the last few years because we haven't seen her for 20-some-odd years, right? Since she disappeared in [Star Trek: Voyager's finale]. And I was on set for that kind of stuff, too. I worked on First Contact as well. So it was kind of cool to watch all that happen - we'll go to a little side story about that with Brent - but just to be able to recreate that, and recreate that cool character again and again, you get that next option. But it's a five-hour makeup. There's 13 prosthetics on her face and her body to create that. As well, Dave Blass is creating that set that she's inside, and then she's attached to that, and we have to glue her into that. That actress [Jane Edwina Seymour] did an amazing job sitting there all day for 18 hours, plus five hours in the makeup chair.\nYeah, what a trooper she was. She does such a great performance.\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, she did. She was amazing. A treat to work with.\nThere's a lot of joking around in the commentary for the finale about how Jack [Crusher] was basically the first Borg with hair. And how jealous Jeri Ryan was.\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, that's true. Yeah, yeah.\nWhat was the decision-making for keeping Jack's hair? As opposed to making him bald as a Borg?\nJames MacKinnon: I think that was a Terry decision. I mean, it works. It's the same as on Discovery when our Klingons didn't have hair, and then all of a sudden, in season 2, they have hair. So there are reasons and changes and all that kind of stuff. The reason why we go certain directions. But I think that was a Terry decision. But [Jack] looked... I actually have some photos where I had him as Locutus in the position and the Borg Queen from First Contact. So I got a couple of great photos of them in that same position.\nAnd you worked with Amanda Plummer to create Vadic as well?\nJames MacKinnon: One of my assistants, Hugo Villasenor, actually did that makeup. What a process! That was fun, too, because Amanda is passionate as a great actress, and [for] what she is going to bring on camera. And did she ever pull that off. I mean, as a makeup artist and an actor sitting together, it takes both of us. Neither of us can do it until we come together, and that [makeup] starts to come on. And it's fun to watch as those makeups start applying, and you take away eyebrows, and you put the scars on, they become that actor in the middle of the makeup session too, as well. And they change as a character, and they start becoming it, and they start talking [as the character]. And Amanda's verbiage changed, and her personality changed because she's similar to that, but not really. She's a little more quiet and stuff. But that was a fun process. I mean, it's a process that I can't talk about, but it changed dramatically from what we were originally going to do to what was on script and to what you saw. But it was a great process as an artist to create that method.\nWe talked about Worf. Of course, how great he looks as an older Klingon. He really just never looked better. How did Michael Dorn like that whole transformation to turning him into the samurai Worf?\nJames MacKinnon: Oof. He had some PTSD from DS9 and Voyager and from the past. And it took a minute to get him ready to do this. And I think with the new products and the new silicone... I mean, we did his makeup in hair and 42 minutes. And usually, he was in the chair for two and some odd hours in the past. So we sped up the process [and] he was happier that he didn't have to sit in the chair that much longer. But again, Brent and Jonathan are in the trailer at the same time. So they're laughing and making jokes. So it's that legacy cast being there. And I've worked with them for [years]. I'm almost part of the makeup legacy cast with them as well, which is kind of fun, with so much past and present together.\nBut we used some techniques from the original shows to make him comfortable. Again, he has to leave that trailer, be happy with what he has on, be happy with his character. So our job is to make sure that he walks out feeling that character. So we manipulated some stuff underneath the prosthetics. Because silicone is not porous. So when he sweats, we made little routes for where the sweat was going to come down. But on the original show, he had a sweatband underneath his prosthetic, which on this prosthetic was so super thin, we couldn't. So I cut a sleeve off of a T-shirt and put it around his head. So underneath there, he's got a white T-shirt wrapped around his head. Prosthetic goes over [it]. I painted a little bit of darkness around here because some of it peeked out, but you can't see because the hair covers it. And then that soaked up all of his sweat during the day. It's those kinds of things that, as an artist, you're manipulating and learning as the process happens. And he's happy, and he walks out happy too.\nAnd Brent also looks so good as an older Data. Tell me about like how that was crafted to make Data human but still an android. Just a perfect fusion of both.\nJames MacKinnon: Yeah, because on season 1, he was obviously what you call it. And I actually was able to assist Mike Westmore on First Contact. There's a scene where he flips open his hand and there's some wires and stuff. I did that while Mike was doing his face. So I did watch that process. And I talked to Mike before we started shooting and asked what the products were, and they don't exist anymore. It's not the same method and techniques. So I had to recreate those colors with the materials we have today, which sped things up much, much faster. And on this point with Brent, I put a shine. It's like a tattoo color that I swept over across his face. So it gave him a little plastic feeling, a little robotic type feeling, but still wasn't that Data color shimmer shine. And then Maxine Morris, our Department of Hairstyles, did this amazing front lace wig on him that blended with his real hair. So 99% of that is his hair with a lace piece on the front. So you have that realism of his hair, that beautiful white hair, but gives that sharp front edge.\nYeah, he really looked amazing. In your long career with Star Trek, going back to the 90s, where does Picard season 3 rank?\nJames MacKinnon: It's like a combination of all of them. Because like I say, that cast is now there, and to have all those friends for all these years and to be able to do their makeup again. And I'm doing little side gigs with Jonathan now on his little side project. So we still get to keep that relationship. And it's just yeah, it's just all a combination of having them back again. And hopefully, we'll see them again, if everything works out. And I don't know if I get to do it, but we'll see. They always complain that they're poor, so we never know. They never have any money.\nWhat are you proudest of in terms of Picard season 3, and the work you were able to do? This amazing work to bring all these prosthetics and makeup and everything to life.\nJames MacKinnon: I just think for me when I watch it, and we got to watch it on IMAX, if you can create a makeup that the audience and fans don't see the makeup, I have done my job. So with that massive screen, and I'm scared when I go to those because if I go, oof! I make some weird faces sometimes. But I didn't. I didn't. Everything looked fantastic. And it's almost like we're shooting a feature each week. Yeah, every week we're shooting a feature. So there, you have to step up your game as an artist to keep up with it. And the technology is only going to get better, and you're going to see more pores next year with the bigger TVs. Like, I have a 95-inch TV in front of me. It's almost the size of a theater, and you can see everything. So when I know that I can trick the eye of the viewer for it not to be a makeup and immerse yourself into that, I've done my job.\nThe third and final season of Star Trek: Picard features Jean-Luc Picard during the 25th century as he reunites with the former command crew of the USS Enterprise while facing a mysterious new enemy who is hunting Picard's son.\nCheck out our other Star Trek: Picard season 3 interviews here:\nStar Trek: Picard – The Final Season is available now on DVD, Blu-ray™, and a limited-edition Blu-ray SteelBook from Paramount Home Entertainment.

Here's what we know about the sequel's development status, potential release date, story details, and more.\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley will finally bring Eddie Murphy’s titular ultra-cool law enforcer back for Beverly Hills Cop 4, and after years in development progress on the movie is moving at full steam. The Beverly Hills Cop franchise helped write the formula for buddy-cop action comedies, with Eddie Murphy playing the lead from the very beginning in 1984. Beverly Hills Cop has spawned two sequels so far, with the most recent arriving in 1994. Now, over three decades later, the fourth movie Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley is on the way.\nOnce again starring Eddie Murphy with Mark Malloy in the director's chair, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley is due to arrive on Netflix, as the streamer is teaming up with Paramount to ensure Beverly Hills Cop 4 reaches patient franchise fans. With a cast that includes returning cast members like John Aston and Paul Reiser alongside newcomers like Kevin Bacon and Joseph Gordon Levitt, there are plenty of reasons Axel Foley’s first cast in over three decades is so highly anticipated.\nThe most recent Beverly Hills Cop 4 news came in July 2023, although there was nothing official confirmed by Netflix on what could be a significant move for the Eddie Murphy franchise sequel. According to a report by World of Reel, insider sources claim that Netflix has been test-screening Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley with a view to potentially releasing it earlier than 2024. According to the report, this is to fill a sudden scheduling gap left by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.\nBeverly Hills Cop 4 is currently believed to be in post-production, meaning that a late 2023 release could be possible since - in theory - no further work would be required from the actors, who are still on strike at the time of writing. While the report suggested that Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley has tested incredibly well with audiences there’s been nothing official from Netflix, Paramount, or Eddie Murphy to verify them. If they are accurate, however, it’s possible that the release date of the new Beverly Hills Cop movie could arrive much sooner than expected.\nBeverly Hills Cop 4 was first confirmed back in the 1990s. However, this version wasn’t Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley. There have been multiple failed attempts to bring a fourth Beverly Hills Cop movie to screens, including a version from Paramount that had been slated for a 2016 release, only to be pulled from the studio's schedule a year later. At one point directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah were also attached to a 2020 version of the project, but the original Beverly Hills 4 directors left to work on the now-canceled Batgirl movie.\nThe version of Beverly Hills Cop 4 that’s due to arrive on Netflix was confirmed in 2019 (via Deadline). The final creative team of Mark Molloy directing with Will Beall, Tom Gormican, and Kevin Etten on the scripts wasn’t fully revealed until March 2023, however, despite the new Beverly Hills Cop movie filming in November 2022. The full title of Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley, as well as the addition of Joseph Gordon Levitt and Taylour Paige to the cast, was revealed earlier the same year, in August (via Deadline).\nThere is no Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley release date yet. However, the movie is reportedly currently in post-production, with test screenings possibly even taking place. While a 2024 release date is widely believed to be the earliest Beverly Hills Cop 4 could arrive, a surprise late-2023 arrival on Netflix is still possible.\nThe cast of Beverly Hills Cop 4 features a mix of new faces and returning names from the existing trilogy of Beverly Hills Cop trilogy of movies. Grammy winner and Academy Award-nominated comedy and action legend Eddie Murphy (Shrek, Coming to America) is of course back again as Axel Foley, although this is unsurprising given that the hero of the franchise is a titular one for the fourth entry. Joining Eddie Murphy in the cast of Beverly Hills Cop 4 are:\nJoining the returning franchise cast members for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley are Kevin Bacon, Mark Pellegrino, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Taylour Paige, and Patricia Belcher in undisclosed roles.\nWhile the specifics of the story are being kept under wraps by Netflix and Paramount, there is reportedly a plot synopsis for Beverly Hills Cop 4. A report shared by Moviehole suggests that the story of Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley will see Foley return to LA to investigate a corrupt Beverly Hills police force and a murder connected to them. It’s also been reported that Eddie Murphy’s Axel Foley will have an adult daughter.\nThis has yet to be confirmed by Netflix or Paramount, but many outlets appear to be running with this premise as the plot for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley. It would certainly track with previous entries in the Beverly Hills Cop franchise. It’s also known that Beverly Hills Cop 4 will be yet another buddy cop movie, so Foley won’t be on his own, and his possible partner could be one of his former franchise compatriots or, quite possibly, the rumored cop boyfriend of his estranged daughter.\nZoreb has a passion for cinema and music.

{"title": "Gen V's Subtle Stephen King Reference Makes 1 Main Character's Story Darker", "date": "2023-10-05 18:00:27", "text": "The Boys' spin-off series, Gen V, makes a subtle nod to a 43-year-old Stephen King story, making one supe's power much darker than it initially seems.\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for Gen V.\nGen V has a hidden reference to a 43-year-old Stephen King story that makes one main character's powers a lot darker. Serving as a spin-off to Amazon's adaptation of The Boys' comics, Gen V drifts away from the source material by adding new characters and storylines to the mix. Despite this deviation, the show stays true to the franchise's essence by not portraying super-powered individuals in a typical light and, instead, satirizing all the moral dilemmas and ethical conflicts they face. To reinstate these ideas and themes, Gen V also drops several easter eggs and references to the story arcs set by The Boys.\nFor instance, the spin-off series not only briefly hints that Homelander is facing legal charges for his public act of violence from The Boys season 3's ending moments but also reveals how The Seven has two empty spots following Queen Maeve and Starlight's season 3 departure. In all of these references, Gen V also surprisingly makes a subtle nod to a character from one of Stephen King's books, which adds more narrative significance to the powers of one of its supes. This clever allusion to Stephen King's work highlights how Gen V offers a rich tapestry of storytelling, making its character beats more impactful.\nRELATED: Gen V's First Major Death Was Already Teased In The Boys Season 3\nGiven how many fantastical characters have telepathic powers that allow them to manipulate others, it is not surprising that Gen V's Cate and Firestarter's Andy have similar mind-control abilities. However, Cate is similar to the Stephen King character because, like Andy, she calls her power \"the push.\" Like Andy's \"push\" powers in Firestarter were \"manufactured\" through unethical experiments performed by a government agency called \"The Shop\" that injected him with a compound named \"Lot Six,\" Cate also acquired her powers through Vought International's evil Compound V experiments.\nBoth characters also experience severe symptoms when they use their powers beyond a limit. While Firstarter's Andy gets nosebleeds, Cate's eyes turn red with blood clots. As Gen V establishes towards the end of episode 2, Cate suffers from brain damage if she does not use her abilities carefully. Although the Stephen King character does not wear gloves like Cate, his \"pushing\" power works best when he uses it on unsuspecting targets. As fascinating as these similarities between Cate and Andy's powers may seem, they make Cate's \"push\" powers in Gen V much darker.\nGen V's references to Stephen King's Firestarter prove that, like Andy, Cate will always carry the heavy burden of internal conflict concerning the ethics of controlling and manipulating others. Like Andy often regrets harming others with his \"push\" powers despite being well-intentioned, Cate will struggle to forgive herself for planting destructive thoughts in other people's heads. And, similar to Andy, even if she tries using her powers for the betterment of society in Gen V, Vought International, like The Shop, will always try to weaponize her and misuse her \"push\" for their personal benefit.\n"}
